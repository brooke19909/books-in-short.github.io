  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What will be the TVs of the future generation?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The flagship TV line from leading developers in the field of electronic equipment in each new series amaze fans with new opportunities.  But along with individual local innovations, revolutionary changes in the segment are imperceptibly approaching.  What will be the TVs of the future?  The photo presented below shows only one example of the structural and design performance of a representative of the coming generation.  But it is obvious that innovative solutions will not be limited to external characteristics. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cnet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Curved TV of the future" class="if uuid-3049212" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/3049212.jpg"></div><h2>  The pursuit of optimization </h2><p>  Nevertheless, the most noticeable changes relate to dimensional parameters.  In this sense, the trends are not new - displays will be thinner, wider and lighter.  And if today many puzzle over the choice between 40- or 50-inch televisions, then in the future this issue is more likely to disappear, since it will be possible to provide a screen for the entire wall.  It‚Äôs another matter that the question will be at a price, since <span>laser televisions of the</span> future with a wide coverage are more likely to lose in this parameter to projectors with the same area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe video stream.  Another development direction concerns the principle of display design.  It is likely to be not only thin, but also flexible, which will give the device practicality in all respects.  Do not neglect the sensational concept of a curved TV.  There are still disputes regarding its pros and cons, but Samsung designers are not leaving this niche as well, planning to squeeze the maximum benefits out of it for the user in the near future. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.ilonggotechblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Flexible TVs" class="if uuid-3049226" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/3049226.jpg"></div><h2>  Improving the quality of the "picture" </h2><p>  At one time, the FullHD standard laid the foundation for the further development of digital technology that works with video materials.  Nowadays, the UHD resolution is relevant, which allows you to consider previously inaccessible to the details details.  But how will TVs of the future show, given that display development technologies are ahead of the quality of the content itself?  Today, manufacturers are focusing on improving color reproduction and introducing a new generation of backlighting, as an example of which we can cite the Peak Illuminator live image technology.  Probably, this landmark will be traced in new generations of televisions.  As for formats, a fundamentally important stage in evolution should be the emergence of the 8K standard, which will replace 4K and improve it four times in image clarity.  Moreover, such developments are already appearing - for example, the first 8K TV was the 85-inch panel from Sharp, whose resolution is 7680x4320. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pcworld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Future 8K TV" class="if uuid-3049234" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/3049234.jpg"></div><h2>  HDR technology </h2><p>  Another solution to dramatically improve image quality.  HDR system means the expansion of the dynamic range, which increases the contrast between the white and black areas of the "picture".  In other words, the color scheme becomes richer and more accessible to the eye.  But that is not all.  If the presence of 3D technology in future-generation televisions is still foggy due to the non-obvious prospects for its further development, HDR creates the same three-dimensional volumetric image effect, but without requiring special accessories like glasses.  In conceptual models with HDR technology, designers also experiment with minimizing non-functional structural parts.  There remains only one ‚Äúworking‚Äù zone without frames and mounts. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="arstechnica.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="TVs of the future with HDR technology" class="if uuid-3049229" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/3049229.jpg"></div><h2>  Powerful processors </h2><p>  Support for highly accurate images with extensive management functionality is not possible without the corresponding filling in the form of a graphics processor.  This is another innovative selection criterion that you will have to pay close attention to in the near future.  In new generations of TV receivers, powerful processor support will also be required to process voice signals and operate service platforms that will open up new possibilities in equipment management.  In some ways, prototypes of TVs of the future of this type can be called representatives of the LG ThinQ line with Alfa 9 processors. The functional features of this device include tight integration with the smart home system.  That is, through the television interface, the user will be able to control home appliances, including climatic equipment, lighting system, audio and video players, mobile devices, etc. </p><h2>  Communication enhancement </h2><p>  Continuing the theme of ‚Äúsmart home‚Äù it is impossible not to touch on the communications of the future.  Today you will hardly surprise anyone with wireless Wi-Fi and Bluetooth modules that allow you to synchronize your TV with other devices, but progress does not stand still.  What will surprise TV manufacturers in this part?  The problem of content quality mismatch with the capabilities of modern displays has already been noted.  Most likely, streaming standards will be optimized against the background of a fundamental increase in the number of sources themselves.  In other words, TVs of the future will become more interactive and ergonomic in terms of connecting to devices in accordance with individual preferences.  As for the management technique, the changes are likely to be cosmetic.  This concerns the optimization of the remote control, which will finally get rid of the hardware buttons and switch to touch controls. </p><div class="photo" data-original="2012books.lardbucket.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Future Generation TVs" class="if uuid-3049244" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/3049244.jpg"></div><h2>  The development of Smart-TV technology </h2><p>  Samsung can be called a trendsetter in terms of finding new ideas for the television interface.  The Smart-TV concept, coupled with the SmartHub service, made it possible to forget about boring instructions and hardware settings, but progress does not stop there.  What will be the TV of the future from a Korean company in terms of functional user interaction?  In describing the development prospects of this area, Samsung specialists use the concept of convergence, implying close convergence of the TV with various points of interaction.  Moreover, the level of conjugation is characterized not so much by breadth with the simplest set of control functions, namely by the depth of connection of different principles.  In particular, we are talking about the functional merging of a TV receiver with a computer and a person.  In the first case, the device receives a wide range of interactive features on PC capacities, and in the second, the emphasis is on intuitive physical control without auxiliary tools and applications.  That is, the function of the same remote control can be completely replaced by voice and gesture commands. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hardwarezone.com.sg" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LG's next-generation TVs" class="if uuid-3049232" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/3049232.jpg"></div><h2>  Artificial Intelligence on TV </h2><p>  Along with the principles of convergence, another Korean company, LG, offers a television with its basic resources as a starting point for development.  A key aspect of this area is the possibility of self-learning the device, which will become a universal tool in building an interactive platform.  What will be the TVs of the future of this type?  As with Samsung products, a natural speech recognition system should be implemented with unique machine learning technology.  Innovations await the consumer in terms of finding the right content.  The user only needs to say a few keywords about the content, and the intelligent system will filter in a huge array of sources from network channels to connected gadgets. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="tvsetdesigns.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="TVs of the future" class="if uuid-3049219" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/3049219.jpg"></div><p>  Nevertheless, the development of TVs in various directions is difficult to consider in a closed niche.  Much depends on related segments, in which computers, network technologies, the entertainment industry and, of course, television companies, which also strive to be on the wave of progress, are improving themselves.  But one thing is for sure - the TVs of the future will retain their place as one of the main home appliances, incorporating many additional features.  The nature of many changes to this receiver can already be judged today, but for sure the manufacturers have a lot of surprises that remain to be seen.  Indeed, each new technology opens up a whole array of previously unknown opportunities. </p>
