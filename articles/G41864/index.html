On the other days of the week you can‚Äôt get there. </li><li>  Strong audibility between rooms.  In addition, a lot of noise is heard from the corridor. </li><li>  The water park closes early - at 17:30.  I would like the entertainment to last longer. </li></ul><p>  Also, the hotel feels savings on various pleasant trifles such as tea and compliments. </p>
