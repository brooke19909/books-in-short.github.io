  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Compact active subwoofer in the car: overview, selection, installation</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The era of <span>cassette recorders</span> and "tin" sound has long sunk into oblivion.  Motorists quickly figured out all the advantages of digital sound and, having tried it once, could no longer return to the usual analogue technique.  One of the most important ingredients in high-quality sound is the subwoofer, which complements the standard speakers with full low frequencies. </p><p>  Connoisseurs of powerful bass equip their cars with impressive and massive speakers.  But a good half of consumers do not need such equipment at all and compact models are enough for listening to their favorite tracks.  The critical difference here lies only in the maximum volume threshold.  And if you are not going to beat the streets passing along the road to work, then the compact active subwoofer in the car will be more than enough. </p><p>  Today's market can offer a lot of options for such equipment, but not every system can boast of its high-quality component, so the choice must be approached with due care.  To completely trust the consultants in the store is not a good idea, especially when it comes to the notorious networkers like Eldorado, Mvideo and others like them.  So at least a minimal theoretical base here obviously will not be superfluous. </p><p>  So, we present to your attention a small overview of compact <span>active subwoofers.</span>  Consider the main selection criteria, the advantages and disadvantages of systems, as well as the feasibility of acquiring a particular model. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Difficulty choosing </h2><p>  The choice of a compact active subwoofer in a car is determined mainly by your musical preferences, and not just the speaker quality or amplifier power.  For example, models with a bass reflex differ in a sharper attack (open rear volume) and are great for synthetic tracks of the Tynt-Tynts plan. </p><p>  Devices with a soft attack, that is, with a closed rear volume, perfectly digest the blues, country, etc. directions.  The cases in the Band-pass form factor have maximum efficiency and are considered universal, but it will be useful to ‚Äúlisten‚Äù to them before purchase. </p><h2>  Installation </h2><p>  As for the installation of speakers in the car, it is compact active subwoofers that boast a trouble-free installation.  The fact is that active models already come with an amplifier, and all you need to do is find a place for the system (usually under the driver's seat) and throw wires to the radio.  While for the installation of passive models it is necessary to take care of the additional area. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinsdaddy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="subwoofer installation" class="if uuid-2523344" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2523344.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, compact active subwoofers are noticeably cheaper than their passive counterparts.  Of course, the sound with a separate amplifier turns out to be noticeably louder and somewhere even better, but this will result in serious financial expenses, which is unacceptable for a good half of ordinary motorists. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Next, we consider the specific and most popular models of compact active subwoofers, distinguished by a large number of positive reviews from car enthusiasts. </p><h2>  "Pioneer TS-WX110A" </h2><p>  The model from the venerable brand boasts not only attractive characteristics, but also more than adequate value.  The active subwoofer "Pioneer TS-WX110A" is made in the universal form factor 15 by 20 cm (6 x 8 inches) and will definitely find its place under the driver's seat. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.productreview.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="subwoofer pioneer" class="if uuid-2523340" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2523340.jpg"></div><p>  The rated power of the model is 50 watts, and the maximum ranges from 150 watts, which is quite acceptable even for fans to listen to something louder.  Model Pioneer TS WX110A pleased with its good sensitivity of 82 dB, as well as a wide frequency range - from 40 to 200 Hz. </p><h2>  Subwoofer Features </h2><p>  Users respond very positively about the system, but many complain about the fastidiousness of the device to the radio.  That is, in a good half of cases, the Pioneer active subwoofer will have to be properly tuned, otherwise you will not hear decent sound. </p><div class="photo" data-original="buenosybaratos.es" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="compact subwoofer pioneer" class="if uuid-2523338" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2523338.jpg"></div><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  strong and reliable aluminum diffuser; </li><li>  remote control support; </li><li>  sensible housing coating, almost completely eliminating scratches and other minor mechanical damage; </li><li>  quite adequate cost for its characteristics. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  whimsical apparatus for fine tuning. </li></ul><p>  Estimated price of the model is about 9000 rubles. </p><h2>  Alpine PWE-V80 </h2><p>  Another compact active subwoofer from the venerable brand, which is easily located under the driver's seat and produces low frequencies of excellent quality.  The model costs a little more than the previous ‚ÄúPioneer‚Äù, but boasts advanced functionality. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.autostudio.fi" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="compact subwoofer" class="if uuid-2523339" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2523339.jpg"></div><p>  The device will be of interest primarily to those who need a subwoofer as a head unit without a separate and customizable output.  The built-in amplifier of the model can be connected both directly to the RCA-interface of the right and left channels, and to the terminal via a special connector. </p><p>  Management of the main functionality is carried out on a separate remote control and is also connected independently of other equipment, which is very convenient.  On the 8-inch (20 cm) case itself there are only controls for cutting the frequencies, volume and phase. </p><p>  Pluses of model: </p><ul><li>  work with the head unit on standard outputs for conventional speakers; </li><li>  excellent build quality and resistance to damage; </li><li>  Intelligent control panel with clear functionality. </li></ul><p>  Minuses: </p><ul><li>  the cost is slightly overpriced. </li></ul><p>  The estimated cost of the subwoofer is about 12,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Eton USB 10 </h2><p>  This model boasts a trend form factor, which has become the main ‚Äútrick‚Äù of marketers who use the concept of ultra-thin with respect to all characteristics of the subwoofer.  Despite the large 10-inch size (25 cm), the device is really very thin, especially when compared with the two previous respondents. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hifigarage.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ultra slim subwoofer" class="if uuid-2523343" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2523343.jpg"></div><p>  The model was distinguished by an enviable maximum power of 350 W and the same chic impedance of 4 Ohms.  Separately, it is worth noting the custom part of the device.  She was distinguished by friendliness and anyone will deal with her, and in the shortest possible time. </p><p>  In addition, to get great sound, you don‚Äôt have to rearrange everything in your own way.  Available presets should satisfy even the most demanding music lovers, not to mention ordinary users. </p><h2>  Subwoofer Features </h2><p>  So if your luggage compartment is always full, but you really want high-quality and bass sound, then this model will be the best option.  Users in their reviews though complain about the price tag, but understand that excellent quality, as well as ample opportunities, simply can not be cheap. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hifitest.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ultra slim subwoofer" class="if uuid-2523341" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2523341.jpg"></div><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  attractive appearance in an ultra-slim case; </li><li>  loud and great sound; </li><li>  extremely simple settings and an abundance of presets; </li><li>  exceptional build quality along with a long-term manufacturer's warranty. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  short stroke of the speaker. </li></ul><p>  The estimated price of the model is about 17,000 rubles. </p>
