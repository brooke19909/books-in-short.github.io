Paper flowers are used for interior design or for decorating gifts.  It‚Äôs easy to figure out where to adapt the result of your creativity.  So let's learn how to create beauty.  Look for ideas for inspiration below. </p><h2>  Big flower </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY paper crafts flowers" class="if uuid-2263404" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/2263404.jpg"></div><p>  Such a product is best for creating a background.  It can be a small banner or a huge canvas.  It is up to you to decide.  Now let's look at how to make a paper craft step by step.  Flowers will consist of petals.  Therefore, the first stage of work will be to create blanks.  From double-sided colored paper, cut out the petals.  Then in the middle of each of them we make an incision.  We fasten the workpiece in the middle so that it acquires a characteristic bend.  Now glue 6 petals together.  In a kind of "bowl" you need to insert another 6 workpieces smaller.  And the last layer will also consist of 6 petals.  Now you need to make the middle.  Cut a smooth strip of paper and make cuts along one edge.  We twist the rectangle into a tube and glue it in the center of the craft.  Flower made of colored paper is ready. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Roses </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="paper daisies" class="if uuid-2262835" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2262835.jpg"></div><p>  The flower queen should be created from corrugated paper.  For this purpose, it is better to purchase a white, pink, burgundy or yellow roll.  How to make paper crafts?  Flowers are made according to patterns.  Drop-shaped blanks of four sizes should be made.  How they should look, you can see above.  Flowers from colored paper will look more magnificent if you make a lot of blanks.  When all the details are cut out they are tedious to stretch a little.  We take the petal and pull it first along, and then across.  This will help the workpiece increase in size.  Now you need to make the middle of the rose.  To do this, roll up two small petals into a tube.  To fasten them together you can use glue, or you can use a hot gun.  We continue to layer-wrap the petals on top of each other.  First you need to glue the smallest, then longer, etc. The last layer of petals needs to be wound a little.  Thus, the rose will become a little more magnificent. </p><h2>  Poppy </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bulk paper flowers" class="if uuid-2262839" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2262839.jpg"></div><p>  This flower will be able to decorate both the living space for the holiday and become a decorative element of the gift.  How to make paper craft?  Poppy flowers are made on blanks.  Redraw or print the sample above.  Now it should be cut out of thick cardboard.  Transfer the outline onto thick red paper and cut out 7-8 petals.  Then the workpieces should be bent with an accordion, cut in the middle and glue in the place of the cut.  This must be done so that the petal becomes voluminous.  Now you need to fasten the workpieces to each other.  Glue the petals in two rows.  In the middle we attach a black circle, and a yellow border should be made along its perimeter.  It is made of a long rectangle.  It is cut to the middle along one edge.  Fringe is wound with scissors.  Then the workpiece is twisted into a tube and glued to the center of the flower, framing a black circle. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Holly flower </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="colored paper flowers" class="if uuid-2262862" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2262862.jpg"></div><p>  One of the easiest ways to make a flower is to collect it from the petals.  You need to start with cutting.  A paper flower is made from blanks.  They should be in the form of a drop.  12 light pink blanks and 12 fuchsia blanks should be cut.  All petals are incised in the middle and glued together.  Then they are interconnected according to the following scheme.  Light pink is glued into a dark pink petal, and then the part is attached to the same ‚Äúsandwich‚Äù.  Petals should be arranged in two rows.  When the flower is ready, you can proceed to the manufacture of the center.  It is done as follows.  A long yellow ribbon is cut along one edge.  Then it is twisted into a tube, and the fringe is fluffy.  The tube is held together and then hoisted into the center of the flower. </p><h2>  Aster </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="paper cut flowers" class="if uuid-2262864" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2262864.jpg"></div><p>  It will be very simple to make such a paperwork with your own hands.  Even a child can collect an aster flower.  This will require colored paper, scissors and glue.  You can fasten parts to each other using a hot gun.  Let's get started.  Astra will be made of long rectangles.  Cut the same size workpieces.  They should be 60 cm in length and 7 cm in width. Now we cut the strips into ¬æ of its width along one edge.  The blanks are ready.  Start picking the flower from the middle.  We twist the first workpiece into a tube and attach the next part to it.  Again, wrap in a tube.  The bud is ready.  Glue another strip and begin to unfold the petals.  After the flower is collected, you can partially wind it with scissors. </p><h2>  Modular flower </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="paper crafts flowers" class="if uuid-2262869" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2262869.jpg"></div><p>  Thinking of creating a do-it-yourself paper craft?  A flower is a great decoration for your home or office.  Such a craft will definitely not gather dust in a box.  How to create it?  We will make the flower from the modules, so the first thing to do is cut and glue the blanks.  Cut the colored paper into squares of the same size.  Now you need to collapse each of them with a bag.  To do this, roll up the workpiece with a tube, and then slightly crush the tip.  Each module must be fastened with glue or a hot gun.  When all the blanks are done, you can begin to create a flower.  Cut out the base circle from cardboard.  On it, starting from the inner edge, row after row you need to glue the parts.  The central part can be distinguished by blanks of a different color. </p><h2>  Napkin flower </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="flowers from napkins" class="if uuid-2263387" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/2263387.jpg"></div><p>  With the manufacture of such crafts even a three-year-old child will cope.  To create it, you need beautiful napkins.  They should be round and have a ragged edge.  To create one flower you will need 3 napkins.  You can make your own petals.  To do this, cut a round shape, and then decorate its edge with the help of a figured hole punch.  Now we take one whole paper blank and cut it in half.  Now you need to glue the semicircle along the cut line.  We make 6 petals according to this scheme.  And now you need to glue all the blanks with slices inward.  We open the petals a little and the flower is ready. </p><h2>  Chamomile </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="paper flowers for hall decoration" class="if uuid-2262875" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2262875.jpg"></div><p>  One of the favorite flowers of any girl is easy to create.  To make camomiles out of paper, you need a dense tinted sheet, scissors and glue.  Above are the patterns.  They need to be printed and cut.  Now you should decide what size flower you will produce.  It can be a big daisy or a miniature craft.  Cut the desired workpiece and clone it on paper.  If you make a standard camomile, then cut the petals out of a thick white sheet.  Whatman is great for this purpose.  And if you want something more original, for example, to create a gerbera, you should make blanks from colored paper.  When the petals are ready, glue them together.  Now, according to the standard scheme, you need to create a core.  We cut a rectangular strip along one edge to ¬æ of its width.  Then we turn it into a tube and glue it in the center of the flower.  Paper daisies are ready. </p><h2>  Twisted rose </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="paper crafts: scheme" class="if uuid-2262876" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2262876.jpg"></div><p>  Volume paper flowers can be created in many ways.  For example, cut them to a pattern.  You can print the one attached above, or in the image and likeness draw your own.  It is possible to make a rose both from corrugated paper, and from a usual tinted sheet.  If you take tracing paper, you get a light flower from paper to decorate the hall.  For this purpose, you can use something denser.  But heavy flowers are more difficult to attach to the surface, and to stay upright they will be worse.  How to make a similar flower?  You cut the workpiece, now you need to glue it.  We coat the bottom of the pattern with glue, and gently twist the workpiece into a tube.  When the flower dries, it can be made a core. </p><h2>  Striped flowers </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="paper crafts flowers" class="if uuid-2262883" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2262883.jpg"></div><p>  Such crafts can decorate the room both in winter and in summer.  In the cold season, voluminous flowers from paper should be made in cold colors, that is, from white, blue or blue paper, and warm - from green, pink or orange.  These versatile jewelry can be a spectacular gift addition.  They can be glued onto the packaging instead or along with a bow.  How to make such a flower?  Strips should be cut into a thickness of 2 cm and a length of 20 cm. Now you should fasten the workpieces in the middle.  Then alternately it is necessary to bend along one edge of the strip and glue with a pencil to attach the edge to the center.  The result should be a volumetric flower.  To make the craft look more interesting, strips can be taken not just one-color, but multi-colored, or even quite multi-colored.  Then the flower will turn out bright, as if from a fairy tale. </p>
