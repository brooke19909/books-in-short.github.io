  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Place of Psychology in the System of Sciences</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Psychology studies the general and particular patterns of the functioning of the psyche and its development.  This is an objective science of the subjective inner world of man. </p><p>  Psychology seeks answers to questions about why in certain situations a person behaves in this way, and not in a different way.  The behavior of man is controlled by the psyche. </p><p>  According to researchers, the place of psychology in the system of sciences is rather ambiguous.  There are quite a few classifications of scientific knowledge.  In most of them, psychology is put on an intermediate stage between different categories.  This is due to the fact that psychology explores a very wide range of issues, using a rather extensive system of methods. </p><p>  On the one hand, it is a natural science that widely uses experimental techniques in research to confirm or refute its own hypotheses.  It was psychologists who introduced many methods of statistical calculations into scientific use. </p><p>  On the other hand, the place of psychology in the system of sciences is determined by the fact that many scientists in this field absolutely do not resort to calculations, measurements and experiments.  That is, many schools of psychology clearly relate to humanitarian knowledge.  For example, in establishing the laws of <span>cognitive processes,</span> psychology contributes to the construction of a learning process scheme, assisting pedagogy in the optimal development of the educational process. </p><p>  In addition, it should be mentioned that some classifications classify psychology as a group of social sciences.  <span>The famous psychologist of the</span> Soviet era B. G. Ananiev called psychology the core of the science of man. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The place of psychology in the system of sciences is determined by the tasks it solves, among which is the desire to understand the essence and laws of <span>psychic phenomena,</span> learn to manage them, apply the acquired knowledge in practice, and create a theoretical basis for the psychological service. </p><p>  In the study of psychological phenomena, researchers reveal the essence of the process of reflection in the human brain of objective reality, study the mechanisms of regulation of human actions, the development of mental activity and the formation of mental <span>properties of personality.</span> </p><p>  The place of psychology in the system of sciences depends on the fact that psychology interacts widely with most of the modern sciences, solving joint complex problems.  Moreover, within psychology itself, there are special branches that deal with solving problems in a certain area of ‚Äã‚Äãpublic life.  Therefore, psychology is between the philosophical and natural sciences, as well as between them and the social sphere.  This is explained by the fact that the center of her attention is a person whose life aspects are also studied by all of the listed sciences in their specific areas. </p><p>  Psychology in the system of sciences is intertwined with the following branches of knowledge.  Psychology closely interacts with the economic sciences in the study of the laws of reality associated with the economic sphere of life.  Psychology is also closely associated with anthropology through the psychology of personality.  General aspects of study are available in psychology and psychiatry.  A direct connection exists with biology (through the branches of pathopsychology, psychosomatics, psychology of abnormal production);  neurobiology (through neuropsychology);  genetics (through psychogenetics), speech therapy (through psycholinguistics), jurisprudence (through forensic psychology, victim psychology, criminal psychology, psychology of the consequence of offenses).  <span>The theory of organization</span> in the system of sciences also intersects on many issues with psychology, since organization is a semblance of a living organism consisting of people participating in the general activity. </p>
