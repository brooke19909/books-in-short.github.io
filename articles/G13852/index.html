Often this is due to low-quality products.  Not always the manufacturer pays much attention to the creation of headphones.  Especially when it comes to budget models.  Although even the cheapest options can last for years. </p><p>  As a rule, cost does not always play a key role.  Sometimes users complain that expensive headphones have become quieter to play or even broken.  Do not panic right away.  Sometimes you can independently resolve all issues. </p><h2>  Causes of breakdowns </h2><p>  To begin with, it is important to deal with the causes of the problems: what they can be and what to expect from them. </p><p>  If the headphones have become quieter to play, then the problem may be hiding in improper use.  Of course, it is unlikely that someone will deliberately dip the headset in water or throw it in the sand.  All this will undoubtedly lead to problems with which, most likely, nothing can be done. </p><p>  But there are minor breakdowns that can interfere with the operation of the device.  For example, the headphones began to play quieter, because they got drops of water, etc. </p><h2>  Possible problems </h2><p>  There are still the most common problems: </p><ul><li>  contact closure on the case; </li><li>  demagnetized speaker; </li><li>  extraneous garbage; </li><li>  problems with the device to which the headphones are connected; </li><li>  mechanical damage. </li></ul><p>  Of course, this list could be more.  For example, it is impossible to exclude marriage, which is often found in budget models. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rtings.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The earphones are quiet" class="if uuid-2986552" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2986552.jpg"></div><p>  Fixing the above problems yourself will not be easy.  Without proper skills, it is impossible to check the demagnetized speaker or contact closure.  But to solve the problem with garbage and the device to which the headphones are connected is real. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Wire contacts </h2><p>  So, contact closure or marriage is a common problem.  Especially when it comes to the plug.  Poor-quality headphones are especially prone to this breakdown, as they are made of poor materials. </p><p>  Most vacuum models are often used daily.  The plug bends, pulls out and becomes dirty.  All this affects him not in the best way.  Over time, problems arise.  It happens that the sound disappears completely, and sometimes you notice that the headphones began to play quietly. </p><p>  The problem with this problem is that apparently there are no signs, but the wire frayed inside, which led to such a breakdown. </p><h2>  Solving the problem with wire contacts </h2><p>  Often, the plug is a non-separable element.  It cannot be unscrewed or removed for repair.  In this case, you can purchase a new one and replace it with the old one.  Of course, this option involves soldering skills.  Just cut off the plug and stick a new one will not work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="parttimeaudiophile.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Headphone Repair" class="if uuid-2986566" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2986566.jpg"></div><p>  If you cannot cope with it yourself, you will have to carry the headphones for repair.  And then do it rationally only if the headset is really expensive.  Cheap headphones are easier to throw away. </p><h2>  Soldering break </h2><p>  This is another problem that can lead to the fact that the headphones become quieter to play.  Unfortunately, even an expensive headset can be poorly soldered.  This is due to the fact that the manufacturer is trying in every possible way to save.  Of course, he is trying to spend less on assembly and materials. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is also often caused by a marketing decision.  If we find a successful device, we are ready to use it for years.  Not all users are chasing fashion.  But this state of affairs is disadvantageous to the manufacturer.  Therefore, you need to create devices that would not work forever. </p><p>  Poor soldering can be caused by environmental regulations.  In this case, manufacturers use those components that do not harm the environment.  But often such materials turn out to be fragile and short-lived. </p><h2>  Soldering break repair </h2><p>  In this case, again, you can solve the problem yourself.  If you understand how the headphones work, you can try to take them apart to replace the solder.  But this solution is not always possible, because some models of the headset are not separable.  The user during the repair process may damage other elements that cannot be fixed. </p><p>  Therefore, in this case, you can also contact the service center or purchase new headphones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.forrestthewoods.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Headphones began to play quietly" class="if uuid-2986556" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2986556.jpg"></div><h2>  Cable break </h2><p>  This problem is mechanical.  Many do not understand why the headphones began to play quietly, although it is a cable break that can be the main reason.  Sometimes it can be seen with the naked eye, and sometimes you have to feel for it, because it occurred inside the shell. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  By the way, such a problem often occurs with a sharp physical load on the wire.  For example, you abruptly got up or caught on the cable for something, after which tension and breakage occurred inside.  If you use headphones at the computer, and the wire is so long that it often gets confused, you could run into it with the wheels of the chair and, accordingly, damage them. </p><h2>  Cable break repair </h2><p>  If such a breakdown occurs, the only solution is to completely replace the cable.  Of course, this is not easy to do on your own, especially if you do not have the proper skills.  Therefore, many turn to the service center.  But you need to understand that if the wire is very thin, then in the future similar problems will often occur with it.  It will be easier to replace the headphones with new ones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="trustedrewiews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Why are the headphones quiet" class="if uuid-2986558" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2986558.jpg"></div><h2>  Water or debris has fallen. </h2><p>  What to do if the headphones are quietly playing?  Maybe they got water or garbage.  These are the most common causes of problems.  Some headphones may be damaged even after a couple of drops of water fall on them or some dust accumulates.  If you quickly take all the necessary measures, you can fix the problems yourself. </p><h2>  What to do if water gets in? </h2><p>  First you need to dry the headphones.  There are several ways to do this.  Try putting them next to a warm battery.  But by no means from above.  The battery may be very hot and damage the board inside the device. </p><p>  Alternatively, you can send the headset in a bag of dry rice.  Krupa quickly absorbs moisture and in a day can pick up all the excess water that was in the headphones. </p><p>  But here it is worthwhile to understand that the oxidation of contacts occurs very quickly.  If the headphones continue to work properly for the first couple of weeks, then over time you will begin to notice problems with sound.  It will become quieter, the device will buzz or make noise.  In this case, specialists in the service center will be able to help. </p><h2>  What to do if garbage has accumulated? </h2><p>  The ear pads will become dirty over time.  This must be understood and taken care of in advance.  It happens that the headphones began to play quietly on the phone due to the fact that the mesh was clogged with earwax and dust.  Over time, you will begin to notice that one earphone has become much quieter. </p><div class="photo" data-original="9to5mac.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Headphone problems" class="if uuid-2986565" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2986565.jpg"></div><p>  In this case, you have to clean them yourself.  To do this, take hydrogen peroxide.  It is needed in order to wash the nets from dirt.  They can be cleaned in any container, for example, in a bottle cap. </p><p>  Depending on the structure, you will have to buy headphones in different ways.  If it is possible to separately clean the grid, you will have to remove it first.  If you can‚Äôt do this, then you can try to dip the grid with the earpiece so that water does not get on the speakers. </p><p>  After such cleaning, it is important to lay the earpiece with the net down so that no moisture can flow inside.  It takes more than an hour to dry. </p><h2>  Device issues </h2><p>  But not always damage can be associated with headphones.  Sometimes the fault is the device to which they are connected.  For example, if the headphones have become quieter to play on your computer, try connecting them to your phone or to another PC.  It may be that the sound settings in the system are lost, and therefore it seems that the headset is broken. </p><p>  If the <span>headphones</span> work well on the other <span>device</span> , you will have to configure the computer.  If no changes have occurred, then you have to look for the cause directly in the headset. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Headphone problems are not the rarest problem.  Those who often listen to music experience headset breakdowns very often.  Some budget headphones do not live even two months.  Even expensive models can break. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.expertreviews.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Headphone problems" class="if uuid-2986562" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2986562.jpg"></div><p>  Most users who encounter this problem say that they rarely take headphones for repair.  Most often, they throw out a broken device and acquire a new one.  Of course, if we are not talking about an expensive headset, especially a gaming one.  In this case, you have to contact the service center. </p><p>  There are even fewer users who are trying to fix the headphones themselves than those who go to the service center.  This is due to the fact that not everyone has the necessary tools and skills in order to cope with a breakdown. </p>
