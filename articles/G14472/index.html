    <h2>  Title </h2><p>  For residents of Russia and the former Soviet Union, this track is known as E95.  The E105 highway received a new name after the reform on the numbering of European roads.  But shortly before that, Alice's song ‚ÄúE95 Route‚Äù was released, which instantly became a hit, and in the memory of most Russians, thanks to the composition, it is associated with the old name. </p><h2>  Main characteristics </h2><p>  The E105 route originates in Norway, then passes through the Russian Federation to Ukraine, and then leads to the Crimea peninsula, thereby returning to Russia again. </p><p>  The length of the route is 3770 km. </p><h2>  Big cities <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="e105 track" class="if" height="341" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44196/1898415.jpg" width="329"></div></h2><p>  E105 is a highway that runs through three countries and crosses dozens of major cities and hundreds of small towns.  The main points of this route in the direction from Norway to the Crimea are: Kirkenes, Murmansk, Petrozavodsk, Petersburg, Veliky Novgorod, Tver, Solnechnegorsk, Moscow, Tula, Oryol, Belgorod, Kharkov, Zaporozhye, Simferopol, Alushta, Yalta.  The European route connected the largest cities and administrative centers on its way. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Road alignment </h2><p>  The European classification and numbering of roads differs from that generally accepted in the territory of the Russian Federation; therefore, the same interval of the E105 highway may bear another name that is familiar to Russians.  There are several such coincidences.  The road connecting Murmansk and St. Petersburg is called M18 or "Kola" in Russia.  According to European numbering, this is E105. </p><p>  Next is the highway called P10, it starts from the Border highway and leads to Pechengi.  Immediately after it is a section of the E105 route between Pechenga and Murmansk, which is the Russian name A118.  And everyone already knows the former E95 highway, and now the M10, which goes from St. Petersburg to Moscow and back.  The highway under the simple name "Crimea" or M2 runs from Moscow to the Ukrainian border.  Then E105 goes further already on the territory of Ukraine.  It fully coincides with the M20, leading traffic flows from the border with the Russian Federation to Kharkov.  Then E105 partially coincides with the roads M18, M03, E40.  This stretch of road connects Kharkov and Yalta. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="highway e105 refueling" class="if" height="293" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44196/1898421.jpg" width="390"></div>

    <h2>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãsections </h2><p>  E105 - the highway crossing three states merges with many other routes and roads on its way, passes through hundreds of small settlements, dozens of large cities and some historical monuments.  Despite all this, there are three high-speed sections on the highway. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  St. Petersburg.  On the ring road around St. Petersburg, vehicles are allowed to reach speeds of up to 110 km per hour.  This is an undoubted advantage of this route, the condition of the road allows you to travel at such a speed, but, unfortunately, the Ring Road is often overloaded with traffic.  And therefore, congestion is not uncommon. </li><li>  Tula region.  This is a paid <span>expressway,</span> but travel on it at the present time is worth a mere penny - some 60 p.  <span>This highway</span> begins immediately after the exit from the Moscow Ring Road and ends on the border of the Tula and Oryol regions.  The road passes completely through the Tula region and avoids entry into the territory of Klimovsk, Chekhov, Serpukhov.  An indisputable advantage not only in speed, but also in the quality of the coating.  A paid motorway will help to avoid the inconvenience of driving along the old highway, passing a little to the side, which is called in common people - the "old Crimean highway". </li><li>  Kharkov - Novomoskovsk.  The motorway begins at the intersection of two routes E40 and M03.  It is 9.5 km from the Kharkov ring road.  And it ends not in Novomoskovsk itself, but on its bypass road.  Thus leaving the city out of the line.  This new route also leaves aside other Ukrainian cities: Merefu, Krasnograd, Pereshchepino.  According to approximate calculations of engineers, this highway helps to save about two hours of travel.  This part of the route was opened relatively recently, in 2008, by the Prime Minister of Ukraine <span>Yulia Tymoshenko.</span>  The high-speed section was built in accordance with all European standards and is now in a satisfactory condition.  Previously it was planned to extend it up to Simferopol, but to date, these intentions have remained at the development stage. </li></ol><h2>  Hazardous areas </h2><p>  The most dangerous and congested sections of the route are: </p><ul><li>  Part of the road from St. Petersburg to the capital.  There are constantly congestion that can delay motorists for more than one hour, especially in the summer. </li><li>  MKAD.  Here, traffic jams are a constant and deeply rooted phenomenon.  <span>The Moscow Ring Road</span> is known for all and sorts of traffic congestion. </li><li>  Turn to Kirilovka (Ukraine).  From Melitopol the highway crosses a road of territorial significance leading to the popular resort village of Kirilovka, which attracts a lot of vacationers' attention in the summer. </li></ul>

    <p>  The E105 track, reviews of which appear on automotive forums daily, of course, is not completely perfect.  There are places and stretches of road that have a large number of potholes and holes, but they do not reach a critical level of danger.  Representatives of all countries in whose territory it passes try to maintain the track in a condition suitable for a comfortable ride. </p><h2>  Gas stations </h2><p>  Refueling along the E105 highway, of course, as on any other highway, is not uncommon.  Today, it is unlikely that any driver has a problem of lack of fuel.  Gas stations are waiting for their customers literally at every corner.  Of the Russian gas stations, most of the representatives of such large companies as Lukoil, Neftmagistral, Gazpromneft, Tatneft, Rosneft, Surgutneftegaz are on the highway.  And dozens that are not so popular and known to both residents of Russia and foreign guests. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="e105 track name" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44196/1898417.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Work to improve and improve the track in its various sections is carried out from year to year so that motorists feel confident and safe on it.  European standards and capabilities do not stand still.  They are constantly increasing and increasing, so the E105 highway will remain in good condition for a long time and will be on par with other similar highways. </p>
