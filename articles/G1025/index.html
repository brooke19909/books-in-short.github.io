They give the journey to this eastern country an indelible mark.  There are many places that you must definitely see, because Turkey is not only a beach holiday, but also a corner on the planet where many cultures have left their mark. </p><h2>  Overview </h2><p>  The main cluster of attractions of Istanbul is located in the Sultanahmet district, near the eponymous small park.  Within walking distance there are the Hagia Sophia of Constantinople, the 17th-century Blue Mosque, several palaces, including Dolmabahce and Topkapi. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travelatelier.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska - Roksolana" class="if uuid-2569817" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2569817.jpg"></div><p>  All the sights of the Turkish capital are striking in their luxury and grandeur, they are unique and inimitable. </p><h2>  Beautiful legend </h2><p>  One of the unique historical monuments is the mosque in Istanbul, bearing the name Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska - the beloved wife of Sultan Suleiman.  Legend has it that as a result of one of the raids, the Crimean Tatars captured the fifteen-year-old beauty Nastya Lisovsky, the daughter of a priest from a small Ukrainian farm.  The girl, having brought to Turkey, was immediately put up for sale on the famous slave market in Istanbul.  By coincidence, Nastya was bought for the harem of the still young Sultan Suleiman, who at that time was only 26 years old.  The girl‚Äôs charming smile and her cheerful character immediately attracted the attention of the ruler.  Sultan wholeheartedly loved a slave.  He called her Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska ("funny").  European diplomats coming to Istanbul spoke of her as Roksolan, thereby emphasizing the Slavic origin of the beloved woman of the great Sultan. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where is the Hyurrem Sultan Mosque </h2><p>  Coming to Istanbul and not seeing her would be a big crime.  Moreover, today some enterprising travel agencies even offer special tours to places mentioned in the famous series "The Magnificent Century."  But you can see the Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska Sultan mosque in Istanbul on your own.  It is located in the European part of the Turkish capital in the Fatih area on Haseki Cd. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.oldistanbul.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to get there" class="if uuid-2569802" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2569802.jpg"></div><p>  Judging by the reviews, many of our tourists who visited Istanbul tried to walk as much as possible around the city.  Indeed, here at every step you can meet historical monuments and cultural objects.  However, those who do not like long walks can get to the Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska Sultan Mosque on a light rail.  Getting off at the Yusuf Pasha stop, you need to cross the beautiful pedestrian bridge onto Haseki Street.  After walking along it several hundred meters towards the sea, on the left side you can see the entrance to the Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska Sultan mosque. </p><p>  Previously, this district of Istanbul was called Avrat Pazary, which in Turkish means ‚Äúwomen's market‚Äù.  After the construction was completed, it was renamed Haseki.  This name has been preserved to this day as a reminder of the beautiful Roksolana.  The history of this amazing attraction originates in the sixteenth century. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Charity complex </h2><p>  The Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska Sultan was built by the Sultan Suleiman for his wife, who in Europe is known as Roksolana.  She became the first harem concubine in Turkish history, who managed not only to become the legal wife of the ruler, but also to gain unprecedented power.  Being drugged by love for this beautiful and at the same time incredibly smart woman, the Sultan violated the centuries-old established traditions. </p><p>  Often, the name "Haseki" is added to the name of this Turkish historical site.  Literally translated, this means "beloved woman from the Sultan‚Äôs harem of the Sultan." </p><div class="photo" data-original="upload.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="History of the construction of a mosque" class="if uuid-2569804" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2569804.jpg"></div><p>  Using the unprecedented mercy of Suleiman, the young concubine wished on the site of the slave market, where the Crimean Tatars had once brought her herself, to erect a religious structure.  The complex, according to her idea, should include both the Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska mosque itself, as well as primary and high schools, a canteen for the poor and a hospital.  Roksolana created a foundation and after the construction of the temple was completed, she began to erect charitable objects on her behalf.  The complex in terms of grandeur should not be inferior to such great mosques as Suleymaniye and Fatih. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mosque plan" class="if uuid-2569830" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2569830.jpg"></div><p>  However, in fairness, it should be noted that in terms of scale it turned out to be slightly less than the two. </p><h2>  The grandiose idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa concubine </h2><p>  The uniqueness of the plan conceived by Roksolana, or Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska was that the former concubine was able to independently order the construction of charitable institutions directly in the main city of the Ottoman Empire.  Other official wives and mothers of the eldest sons of Suleiman were allowed to build only small mosques in those provinces where the heirs of the ruler became governors after reaching full age. </p><p>  Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska Sultan in Istanbul had another feature: Haseki planned the construction on the site of the former slave women's market.  With this decision, she wanted to permanently ‚Äúerase‚Äù the memories of her own humiliation. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska Sultan began to be erected in 1538.  The construction was completed in 1551. When the construction work was completed, Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska Sultan, having created her own fund, with the money raised, began to implement her grandiose project.  She created a charity complex - Kullye, which became the third largest in Istanbul. </p><div class="photo" data-original="i.pinimg.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="School Patio" class="if uuid-2569810" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2569810.jpg"></div><p>  Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska Sultan (Turkey) was the first such project of the already well-known architect Mimar Sinan at that time.  He worked not only on the building of the mosque itself, but the entire religious complex.  The kullya also includes a hospital, a madrasah and an elementary school, a kitchen for the poor, a bathhouse, etc. </p><p>  The buildings of the charity complex, built by Roksolana, are still functioning.  In one of them there is a city hospital, in the other there are shops and cafes.  The history of the Hyurrem Sultan mosque indicates that in the sixteenth century this religious object was mainly in Istanbul.  The former appearance of the complex to this day has been preserved in its magnificent grandeur. </p><p>  This historical site is of particular interest to tourists, not only because of its beauty and uniqueness, but also because it is here that one of the largest operating hammams is located, and recently renovated.  Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska Sultan and the charity part of the complex are separated by a narrow street Haseki.  They suffered several times from fires and earthquakes.  But every time the buildings were restored in their former appearance. </p><h2>  Architecture </h2><p>  Initially, the Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska Sultan mosque was a small building in the form of a cube with one dome.  But already in 1612 the back wall was demolished.  It was decided to attach another hall with a vaulted ceiling to the building. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Entrance to the mosque" class="if uuid-2569813" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2569813.jpg"></div><p>  And instead of the old wall, an arch was made with round columns of dark marble at the base.  Above the building of this mosque in Istanbul was closed by another dome.  During the construction process, the stones were very tightly fitted to each other, so the seams between them are almost not noticeable.  The walls of the Hyurrem Sultan mosque are covered with porcelain tiles.  The mihrab pulpit is decorated with wood carvings inside.  The niche in the wall is decorated in the Baroque style and filled with "stalactites." </p><h2>  Information </h2><p>  The Hyurrem Sultan Mosque for tourists is open daily from 9 to 17:30.  At the time of prayer, the doors are closed.  The entrance is free.  In the Mosque of Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska Sultan there are places closed to tourists, which are warned by signs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mapio.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Carpet shop on site" class="if uuid-2569822" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2569822.jpg"></div><p>  Before visiting, women should hide their hair under a scarf and cover their shoulders and d√©collet√©.  Shoes should be removed at the entrance. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska for the Turkish people is a true legend, overgrown with centuries-old myths.  After the death of Suleiman and his wife, they were not buried in this mosque, but in the mausoleums on the territory of Suleimaniye.  This main mosque in Istanbul is located on the other side of the city in a picturesque cypress garden.  Here, some other rulers, as well as their relatives and prominent figures of the state, found their last refuge.  The mausoleums of Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska and Suleiman are located opposite to each other in the far part of the garden. </p>
