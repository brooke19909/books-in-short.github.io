It is not far from the large Diamond Hill hotel complex.  Europeans like Germans, citizens of the Baltic states, and the British love to relax here.  This is another argument in favor of the fact that choosing such a hotel, you will not overpay and will not have problems.  Of course, lovers of chic and palace surroundings will be disappointed - hotel room categories like Blue Camelot do not imply luxury.  However, this hotel, according to many vacationers, fully justifies the four stars assigned to it.  Nice rooms, clean sea and delicious food guarantee you a positive and good mood. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Blue camelot beach hotel 4 turkey reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1011384.jpg" width="600"></div>
