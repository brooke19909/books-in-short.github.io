According to statistics, goods of its own production are stubbornly fighting with each other for first place in the market.  One of the well-known production positions of this company can be called DJ accessories that help create a club atmosphere. </p><p>  It should be noted that the market in which studio equipment is offered is very narrow, and Pioneer has long been stable in it.  The specifics of the organization are clear.  New manufacturers are not able to compete with those already held.  Quality and price must strictly correspond to each other.  Really good firms can be counted on the fingers of one hand. </p><p>  For a long time <span>,</span> Pioneer <span>consoles, mixers,</span> DJ controllers and other equipment compete with Matsushita.  The speech in this material will be about the first manufacturer. </p><h2>  DDJ-Wego </h2><p>  A compact device that is equipped with a very decent set of functions.  Most suitable for those who love electronic music.  For people who want to win DJ ratings, the <span>Pioneer</span> Wego <span>controller is</span> not suitable.  The device will become the "king" of home parties, it is able to give unforgettable and pleasant moments.  The manufacturer positions the equipment of this model as unprofessional.  It will be quite useful for those who want to engage in DJ activity at the amateur level. </p><p>  The controller works, like many other devices of the company.  You need to connect it to a laptop.  Thanks to the manufacturer, Pioneer (controller) allows you to easily manage tracks, melodies, flexibly changing them.  This is done using the downloaded software, which is called Virtual DJ. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What distinguishes this model from others?  In it, the manufacturer installed an LED-backlight, which will help to confidently cope with their duties even in the dark.  It should be noted that in each mode the colors are different.  That is, any experienced DJ who has been dealing with the Wego model for a long time will be able to understand at a glance how his device works at the moment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pioneer controller" class="if" height="291" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1512096.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Office DDJ-Wego </h2><p>  Most of the buttons are located on the front of the controller.  An exception was the standard on / off key.  All buttons are close enough to each other, to some extent even flattened.  This is to save space and materials. </p><p>  In general, judging by the reviews, the control and ergonomics of this device are, as always, at the highest level.  This is exactly what was expected from the manufacturer Pioneer.  The controller is compact, it seems to some that the fader knobs are too small, but this is not so.  The latter effect occurs only in those who are accustomed to full-size.  For beginners, they will seem convenient. </p><p>  All knobs and buttons work quickly.  They do not need to be pressed hard; they are squeezed smoothly and without sharpness.  For those who want to deal with scratching, the Pioneer DDJ-Wego controller is also suitable.  The crossfader is quite light and functions quite quickly. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A great impression for all users appears after working with rotators.  It is recommended that you carefully study them, since they often fail the very first.  This is due to the fact that rotators are used most often. </p><h2>  DDJ-T1 and DDG-S1 </h2><p>  I must say, considering products from Pioneer, the T1 controller confidently competes with its sister model S1.  They both help control the music (tracks), thanks to the installed programs.  Software downloaded by the manufacturer.  Accordingly, no problems with downloading it will arise.  All such questions are covered by the Pioneer trademark.  The controller of any model comes to the buyer in a complete set. </p><p>  After the presentation of the instruments, they immediately caused a great stir.  After all, it‚Äôs already clear that the company does not produce ‚Äúraw‚Äù product.  It should be noted that Pioneer is a manufacturer that is famous for reliable, functional devices.  They are also characterized by good ergonomics and assembly.  The T1 and S1 models exceeded all customer expectations.  They are well dispersed all over the world.  What else could you expect from Pioneer products? </p><p>  S1 controller and its brief technical characteristics: </p><ul><li>  Total weight - 5 kg. </li><li>  <span>MIDI controller</span> </li><li>  One microphone input and one AUX type. </li><li>  The maximum frequency range is up to 20 thousand Hz. </li></ul><p>  Brief Specifications T1: </p><ul><li>  It weighs 5 kg. </li><li>  MIDI controller </li><li>  Distortion - not more than 0.005%. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dj controller" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1512098.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><h2>  Device T1 and S1 </h2><p>  The DJ controller of both models is equipped with a removable panel, which is located on the bottom.  Thanks to it, the device is located at a small distance from the surface of the table or cabinet, where you can install a laptop for maximum comfort.  It should be noted that even devices with 17-inch screens will fit.  This decision of the manufacturer will help to save space. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Considering the Pioneer DJ-controller, it should be said about its device.  All elements on the panel are located in the same way as in the 400 series. The difference is that the players and the remote control are combined and they are much more convenient to use.  Both described devices have impressive dimensions, however this inconvenience easily pays off with maximum functionality. </p><p>  The controllers work powerfully, which was to be expected.  The reviews constantly compare among themselves many models of this manufacturer, highlighting the T1 / S1.  They have an excellent build, good keys and levers.  There is no backlash, creaking and free play in unnecessary places. </p><h2>  Appearance T1 / S1 </h2><p>  The Pioneer T1 / S1 DJ controller is difficult to evaluate fairly, if we are not talking about the possibilities, but about the <span>appearance.</span>  This is due to the fact that the reviews of professionals vary greatly.  Some like the standard arrangement of all the details, while others do not fit it, and they compare it with some kind of unnecessary plastic board. </p><p>  The only thing the DJs agreed on is that poppin controllers do not look in any way.  They have no backlight: neither glossy nor ordinary.  The design focuses on neutral color, which varies only in its range.  In different models, it is either darker or lighter.  The buttons are highlighted.  Hue is orange.  This is the standard color for this manufacturer.  Some more details have a slight shade, however it does not look clumsy and catchy.  Appearance is one hundred percent strict and conservative, but does not cause boredom. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dj pioneer controller" class="if" height="187" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1512104.jpg" width="600"></div>

Thanks to special buttons and levers that allow you to adjust the level of music, you can easily work with up to four decks, samples, marks.  In addition to the main features of the model, it is also equipped with ten quality effects that make tracks unforgettable. </p><p>  Due to the presence of sixteen non-standard keys, you can add a new level to any song.

    <h2>  Mixer DDJ-SX </h2><p>  In fact, the mixer can be called the ‚Äúface‚Äù of this controller.  The device works with four playback channels.  Two of them are automatic.  The rest can be customized as you wish, for example, by connecting an external device or using them as a digital or analog center. </p><p>  No problems during connection.  However, during playback, you can notice significant differences in sound.  Excessive noise may appear or the volume may decrease. </p><p>  The instrument software has a built-in equalizer.  Thanks to him, it is easy to change the music, make the sound more powerful.  You can adjust the low and high frequencies with one easy press. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pioneer wego controller" class="if" height="447" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1512120.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  DDJ-SR </h2><p>  This DJ Pioneer DDJ-SR controller is a relatively new device.  It has a built-in sound card, which is necessary for Serato to work.  Judging by the reviews of DJs, this model is most often chosen by professionals.  This controller is quite strong, easy to transport, has unique functions, which allows a person to show their creative abilities and successfully develop.  This model is suitable for both beginners and professionals.  However, those who will not work in this area seriously, it is best not to pay attention to this option.  It is too expensive for a regular hobby.  Reviews about the device are good.  All emit its excellent sound and convenient controls. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pioneer r1 controller" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1512130.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Finally </h2><p>  All the described models are distinguished by good functionality, some of them are enhanced.  Not everyone is suitable for a beginner or an amateur, but professionals will definitely pay attention to such devices. </p><p>  What will attract any customer first?  Appearance.  The manufacturer understands this, so he never leaves for later working out the design.  It is not "raw", but quite democratic, even provocative in some models.  The pricing policy is reasonable, the cost is not overpriced (from 15 to 236 thousand rubles).  Quality goes well with it, and this is the most important thing. </p>
