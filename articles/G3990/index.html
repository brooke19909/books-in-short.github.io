After all, the first can be used as a printer, scanner and copier.  And the printer is also a printer in Africa.  That is why many users and individual entrepreneurs choose an MFP.  This device can replace several components at once.  Even in a small office.  By the way, the Canon MAXIFY MB2340 MFP is perfect for a small office.  Reviews about this device are almost completely positive.  Therefore, it makes sense to consider it in more detail.  But first, a few words about the manufacturer.  As usual. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wallpapersdsc.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="canon maxify mb2340 reviews" class="if uuid-2993368" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2993368.jpg"></div><h2>  About Canon </h2><p>  The company was founded in Japan in 1937.  It was at this time that the first Japanese SLR camera was created on the model of the best German models.  It was called Hansa Canon.  From this time began the history of the company as a manufacturer of photographic equipment.  The release of printers was established closer to the nineties of the twentieth century.  The company immediately managed to create a legendary printer for the needs of professionals.  And it went. </p><p>  By 2007, printer sales outperformed classic cameras.  And then at "Canon" decided to release the first multifunctional device.  The novelty was favorably received by users, and the conveyor earned.  In the field of production of multifunctional devices, the company has achieved impressive success.  Proof of this is the Canon MAXIFY MB2340 MFP.  We will begin the review of this device right now.  And first of all, we will analyze the scope of delivery. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.hardware-boom.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="canon maxify mb2340 photo" class="if uuid-2993396" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2993396.jpg"></div><h2>  Packaging and delivery </h2><p>  So, the multifunction device comes in a box of recycled cardboard.  On the front wall is a colorful image of the device itself and no less colorful logo of the manufacturer.  Inside is the Canon MAXIFY MB2340 itself, an instruction manual, a warranty card, a cable for connecting to a computer, a driver disk and other software.  There is nothing more in the box.  But this is quite enough.  Especially when you consider that the multifunctional device belongs to the category of budget.  Speaking of instructions.  The latter is made in several languages.  There is also Russian.  Moreover, the translation is quite normal.  And there you can find all the necessary information on how to connect the MFP to a computer and how to use it.  Everything is laid out literally on the shelves.  I almost forgot about another feature of the Canon MAXIFY MB2340 package.  The device‚Äôs cartridge is not installed in it, but is located nearby, in a special unit.  For greater safety.  Now let's move on to the design. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="canon maxify mb2340 specifications" class="if uuid-2993370" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2993370.jpg"></div><h2>  Appearance and design </h2><p>  What can be said about the appearance of this multifunction device?  Its design is such that the device will easily fit into any interior.  In a small office or at home.  The body of the device is made of high quality plastic, painted black.  The plastic itself is matte, which is incredibly pleasing.  There will be less prints on the case.  Above is a control panel with an informative screen and many buttons.  On the front wall there is a slot for printed output and two containers for clean paper.  The corners of the body are rounded.  This allows you to place the MFP almost everywhere.  Although this is how to say it.  It's time to move on to the dimensions and weight of the Canon MAXIFY MB2340.  We will consider user reviews in the following sections. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.trustedreviews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="canon maxify mb2340 cartridge" class="if uuid-2993375" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2993375.jpg"></div><h2>  Dimensions and weight </h2><p>  In fact, the multifunctional device from Canon is very large.  Keeping this at home is another challenge.  Especially if the apartment is small.  The height of this monster is 463 millimeters.  The length and width are 459 and 320 millimeters, respectively.  For computer peripherals, this is a lot.  And this device weighs 12.2 kilograms.  That is why it is recommended to use this multifunction device in small offices.  At home, this is somewhat problematic.  Although there is a wireless option.  So, if you place this printer in a cabinet, it will not take up much space.  But this is a completely different story.  And now let's move on to the main technical characteristics of the device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trustedreviews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="canon maxify mb2340" class="if uuid-2993372" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2993372.jpg"></div><h2>  Key Specifications </h2><p>  We continue to consider the Canon MAXIFY MB2340 MFP.  The characteristics of this device are pretty good.  The printer uses inkjet technology and has a piezoelectric head.  The monthly resource is 15,000 pages.  This means that he can easily cope with the amount of work in a small office.  Print speed depends on the type of document.  Monochrome MFP text prints at 23 pages per minute.  A color image is printed at a speed of 15 pages per minute.  Not a bad result.  The first page after switching on is released after 7 seconds.  The print resolution is 1200 dots in length and width.  There is an option of double-sided printing.  And there is a very good scanner with a resolution of 1200 DPI.  The copier does its job even without a computer.  Also, the device has a built-in fax.

Users also liked the ability to print directly from a smartphone.  This is possible due to the presence of a Wi-Fi transmitter on board the device.  Users also note the presence of a fax.  Although at home, this feature is useless.  But for a small office - what you need.  Those who use this multifunctional device at home were pleased with the option of silent printing.  She helps a lot when she needs to work at night.  Another positive aspect indicates the relative cheapness of consumables.  Cartridges for this unit are inexpensive.  It makes no sense to use non-original.  However, there are several negative reviews.  One of them is connected with the notorious wireless connection.  Users note that this method of communication is not stable.  Failures are possible.  But not frequent.  Also, some of the users complain about the dimensions of the device.  But these are trifles. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, above was considered a multifunctional device Canon MAXIFY MB2340.  Reviews of it clearly make it clear that this is a wonderful device that provides high quality printing and has a whole range of additional features.
