Parents of lovers spent more than six million dollars on a celebration that struck guests with scale. </p><p>  In addition to a stunning dress from the famous Vera Wong and expensive jewelry, the subject of discussion was a fantastic cake.  The two-meter wedding piece, decorated with flower placers, consisted of 13 tiers, each of which had its own filling. </p><h2>  Fateful acquaintance </h2><p>  The marriage of Jared Kushner to the daughter of a billionaire did not become a misalliance, because the groom is a large media magnate and a very famous person in America. </p><p>  A happy meeting of young people occurred in 2007, when they were 25 years old.  They recall that they were brought together by a mutual friend who considered that Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, who are engaged in commercial real estate, can be useful for each other.  Business business lunch turned into a romantic date, after which the lovers did not part.  They met for two years before deciding to get married. </p><h2>  Secret romance </h2><p>  Now the heir to the financial empire Jared Kushner thanks a mutual friend for the acquaintance, which resulted in a strong marriage, and Ivanka laughs that the comrade has a good commission for concluding the best deal in their life. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="jared kushner" class="if" height="490" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1185112.jpg" width="376"></div>

The reason was found out much later.  It turned out that Jared Kushner asked his chosen one to accept Judaism.  A young man with Jewish roots wanted to celebrate his wedding according to national traditions. </p><p>  Ivanka did not refuse her beloved and went to the synagogue to study Judaism.  This process is long, and as soon as it ended, they played not one wedding, but two.  After the first, world-famous celebration, a ceremony was held in accordance with Jewish customs. </p><h2>  In business - only the first roles </h2><p>  Real estate investor Jared Kushner does not work with his wife.  Such was the condition of Ivanka, who was worried that a <span>joint business</span> destroyed the marriage of her parents.  The self-confident heiress of the influential dynasty did not intend to divide the leading posts, warning that neither she nor her husband agreed on the second roles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1185120.jpg" width="416"></div>

Hilton, because Ivanka works 13 hours a day, and thanks to this, at the beginning of her career, she bought a whole house from her father with her money.  The woman is the vice president of real estate at Trump, and now she is expecting a third child and is unusually happy. </p><h2>  Great family man </h2><p>  According to his beloved wife, Jared Kushner knows what he wants from life, and sets the right priorities.  Even before the birth of the first-born, the girl stated that an amazing father would come out of a <span>successful businessman</span> , and she was not mistaken. </p><p>  Donald Trump is unusually proud of his wonderful son-in-law, saying that the deals he deals with are ‚Äúof a cosmic scale‚Äù, but despite the heavy workload at work, Jared Kushner remains an excellent family man. </p><p>  Ivanka, trying to combine motherhood and business, is grateful to her husband: ‚ÄúIt's good that there is a person nearby who takes care of me.  He always supports me, and without him I am nobody. ‚Äù </p><h2>  Waiting for a third heir </h2><p>  The famous American investor and successor of family traditions, Jared Kushner, whose photo now appears not only in business magazines, thanks his wife for everything, recognizing her primacy.  ‚ÄúShe is the CEO, and I am only a member of the government.
