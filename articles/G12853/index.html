    <p>  The focus of this article is one of the representatives of the expensive segment of SLR cameras, which most professional photographers still classify as entry-level, because the Canon EOS 60D has an incomplete matrix, respectively, it cannot be in the flagship line of digital devices. </p><h2>  Step in the right direction </h2><p>  Beginner and advanced photographers are already used to the features of the market for SLR cameras and know that the fewer characters in the name of the model, the higher the class of the digital device.  And this applies to all brands on the world market that produce similar devices, because the hierarchy present allows you to segment cameras by different price niches, which will greatly facilitate the user's choice in the purchase process.  Accordingly, the Canon EOS 60D SLR camera belongs to the segment of initial devices that belong to the professional class. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  However, the manufacturer made a surprise for all fans - he did not continue to update the line of two-digit modifications of mirror devices (after all, logically, the 60th model is a modified 50D camera).  Within the walls of the company, they violated their own rules and introduced the world to a completely new product, which incorporated all the qualities of a professional Canon 7D camera and, in the <span>form of a bonus,</span> received completely new functionality. </p><h2>  Just to stay afloat </h2><p>  After the rival Nikon presented the all-new D90 product, which for decades has outstripped all Canon's two-digit cameras with its technical specifications, technologists had no choice but to use the functionality of professional SLR cameras in the production of Canon EOS 60D.  The rotary screen that appeared at that time played a major role in the digital technology market and attracted millions of customers to the new product. </p>

    <p>  This is the only model of all Canon products, which is located in the "golden mean".  Situated between functionality, shooting quality and price, the 60D is a signpost for customers, identifying camera models according to user needs.  Everything that was on the market before this SLR camera, including three-digit modifications, is limited by amateurism and creativity.  The novelty opens to all comers the path to the world of professional photography. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Status Strike </h2><p>  The camera Canon EOS 60D Kit at the first acquaintance causes a lot of bewilderment among experienced photographers.  The manufacturer, trying to reduce the cost of production, refused to use magnesium alloy in creating the body of the mirror device.  This is really a serious blow to the status of a semi-professional device.  Although the aluminum frame with polycarbonate inserts makes the camera easier, the loss of strength is incommensurably greater. </p><p>  The lack of a mini-joystick on the back of the gadget, which allows you to control autofocus points, was the second unpleasant news for many photographers, judging by their reviews.  Yes, the manufacturer created an alternative in the form of an 8-position switch, which he placed on the control dial, however, the convenience of using this functionality is an order of magnitude lower and even causes discomfort. </p><h2>  The main characteristic </h2><p>  For the Canon EOS 60D Kit, the price is not the main indicator, because in the class of devices of the semi-professional segment, the matrix of the digital device plays an important role.  There is nothing special to be surprised at here - the 18-megapixel CMOS matrix has dimensions of 22.3x14.9 mm, which corresponds to the APS-C format and is called the crop factor 1.6 among professionals.  It is this indicator that does not allow the SLR camera to sit on a shelf with full-frame flagships. </p>

    <p>  As for the photosensitivity and density of the matrix elements, the fact of using technologies inherent in expensive mirror models in production is precisely manifested here.  The powerful DIGIC 4 processor, which was also borrowed from the Canon 7D, processes information quickly enough, which pleases many owners of this SLR camera, judging by their reviews. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Ease of shooting </h2><p>  An optical viewfinder is the norm for all SLR devices, but a movable LCD screen for this class of devices is new.  Firstly, the LCD monitor has a 3: 2 ratio, increasing the information content of both the control menu and when viewing images.  The second feature is the color reproduction and brightness of the display.  The screen, even in sunlight, perfectly displays information at any angle. </p>

    <p>  Naturally, such characteristics take the Canon EOS 60D camera to a new level, the price of which continues to be affordable for many potential buyers.  However, judging by the user reviews, there are also disadvantages to working with a rotary screen - the lack of a touch surface causes a negative.  Many users compare the semi-professional device with the <span>Canon 600D</span> entry-level SLR camera <span>,</span> which just has a touch screen. </p><h2>  Is it negative? </h2><p>  Many buyers who pay attention to the Canon EOS 60D are very often interested in the ability of the camera to shoot high-quality video.  Undoubtedly, recording a video sequence in FullHD format (1920x1080 dpi) up to 30 frames per second should satisfy a potential buyer, but there are a number of drawbacks that make the user think that he will not be able to go further than amateur shooting.  And we are talking about the lack of the ability to automatically focus during the recording process.  A professional photographer is able to correct the situation with his own hands - by controlling the lens rings, but a beginner will obviously not like such a solution. </p><p>  Missing in the mirror device and support for recording stereo sound.  It would seem a trifle, but it is she who stops many potential buyers.  Even if the video recording will never be used by the owner, the fact of the absence of something important very often decides the fate of the purchase. </p><h2>  Device Modifications </h2><p>  All SLR cameras for the convenience of the buyer are presented by manufacturers on the market in the form of several models.  A significant difference between them is the price and availability of the lens.  The most inexpensive copy, the cost of which does not exceed 40 thousand rubles, is generally offered without a lens (Body).  But the dear representative of the Canon EOS 60D 18-135 Kit (price - 70 000 rubles) is offered to customers in the configuration with one of the best lenses for creativity and home use. </p>

    <p>  Also on the market, the user can find cameras with lenses: 18-55 and 18-200 - they also fall under the definition of ‚Äúcreativity‚Äù for those who like to take pictures in the lap of nature.  More professionally, photographers assure their reviews that the purchase of optics with a large focal length is irrational, and are advised to look at the modification of the Body and any <span>fast lens</span> with a fixed parameter (for example, Canon EF 50 f / 1.8 II). </p><h2>  Remote Control </h2><p>  It is impossible to find fault with controlling a SLR camera (if you forget about the lack of a mini-joystick).  Then the manufacturer decided to please everyone by simplifying the control menu, automating several processes and leaving the arrangement of buttons and an additional screen, as is implemented with professional cameras.  For all beginners, the manual helps the Canon EOS 60D to understand the settings, and advanced photographers will not have to relearn at all. </p><p>  Yes, it‚Äôs a little unusual for professionals that most of the functionality in the SLR camera is automated, however, getting to know the device better, the user will agree that managing the plot and choosing an exposure has become much easier.  But beginners still have to delve into the manual settings, since in automatic mode, most photos are too cold, with a predominance of artificial light shade. </p><h2>  Additional functionality </h2><p>  Many sellers are silent about some of the features of semi-professional SLR cameras, hoping that a potential buyer is already versed in technology.  So, the Canon EOS 60D EF-S camera, in contrast to inexpensive modifications, is equipped with its own lens control mechanism (popularly called a ‚Äúscrewdriver‚Äù), respectively, any lens compatible with the Canon connector will fit the camera. </p>

    <p>  The manufacturer also refused to use CF memory cards in expensive cameras.  Following the fashion and technological progress, the camera is equipped with support for SD-cards.  As for the remote control of the camera, synchronization of the device with several flash units and the "shooting" of several frames per second with different exposures, here the manufacturer guessed and provided his product with the required functionality. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  You can talk about a Canon EOS 60D camera for hours, describing its advantages and disadvantages, because in the digital technology market this is not the only mirror device in the semi-professional segment.  However, many professional photographers recommend paying attention to the reviews themselves in the media, because most of them are left by the owners of mirror gadgets.  And if millions of users gave their preference to this camera, then it is not so bad. </p>
