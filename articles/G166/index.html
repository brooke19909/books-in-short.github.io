Today it is divided into two unequal parts, which are divided by a dam.  According to experts, about 200 years ago it was a salty enclosed lake.  The Akhtanizovsky estuary by the Peresypsky girl was connected with the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov.  However, in 1819, residents of the Starotitarovskaya and Temryukskaya villages for the purpose of desalination connected it with the sleeve of the Kuban. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Akhtanizovsky estuary" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1664789.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  Since that time, part of the <span>river flow</span> flows through the Cossack Erik to the Akhtanizovsky estuary.  Today it consists of two unequal water areas separated by a dam.  They are called Small and Big Akhtanizovsky estuaries.  The first is a closed reservoir, which is several times smaller in area.  Small Akhtanizovsky estuary and in terms of recreation is of much less significant interest. </p><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Great Water Area is approximately one hundred thousand square meters with a maximum depth of one hundred and eighty centimeters. </p><p>  From the south, the reservoir is fenced by the Starotitarovskaya Upland, cut by numerous ravines and gullies.  In the west rises Mount Borisoglebskaya.  Directly near the water is the village of the same name - Akhtanizovskaya.  The estuary in the northern part has a fairly high shore.  The mirror surface of the lake is separated from solid land by <span>reed beds.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Akhtanizovsky estuary lake" class="if" height="254" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1664790.jpg" width="353"></div>

It contains catfish and asp, pike, pike perch, tench and perch, crucian carp, bream, carp.  Ram, silver carp, sabrefish and rudd are also found here.  Akhtanizovsky estuary is a place of constant wintering and the habitat of many waterfowl.  The hunt for them, as a rule, begins on the third Saturday of September and ends on the twentieth of January.  The most interesting of the waterfowl species is primarily the coot, which is quite a lot here.  There are a lot of ducks in the estuary, mainly mallards. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, the most fascinating hunt here begins in November, when the birds survive the cold from the northern regions and they begin to gather here for wintering.  On windy days, catch on the estuary is quite rich.  Ducks come across almost all day.  For hunting you need a boat and stuffed animals, as well as camouflage equipment. </p><h2>  It is interesting </h2><p>  In the eighties of the last century, they tried to plant a lotus in Taman.  This exotic flower has not taken root well everywhere.  The only place for lotus germination was the Akhtanizovsky estuary.  Photos of the reservoir from mid-July until the end of September are simply amazing.  Here a real plantation of this flower was formed.  Today, the <span>Lotus Valley</span> has become a favorite destination for tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Akhtanizovsky estuary photo" class="if" height="379" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1664791.jpg" width="600"></div>

The water temperature warms up to a maximum of twenty-nine degrees - optimal for an exotic culture.  And although a similar regime persists throughout the pond, the lotus grows only two square kilometers. </p><p>  Tearing these amazing flowers is strictly prohibited.  They are listed in the regional Red Book.  Moreover, the plucked plant does not live very long, so it is not worth spoiling it.  According to legend, if you whisper the name of a loved one in a lotus, then love will bloom forever.  Get to the part of the estuary where the excursions begin, through the Cossack Erik, located near the village of Strelka. </p><h2>  Fishing </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews, fishing on this reservoir is almost always successful.  The fish here is very tasty, and since the estuary is flowing, it does not smell of mud from it.  On the lake itself, there are practically no places for fishing directly from the shore.  Therefore, fishermen need a boat, although as an alternative, you can choose a channel for fishing that flows into the Small Akhtanizovsky estuary. </p><p>  Fishing in the pond is always very popular.  Here you can meet with a fishing rod not only local villagers, but also lovers of this pastime from other nearby villages.  People come here even from Anapa and Temryuk. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Akhtanizovsky estuary fishing" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1664792.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  Pilengas can be caught on the right bait, in some areas to set fire to zander, especially in the presence of an echo sounder.  Judging by the reviews, some managed to pull out a good pike in the winter. </p>
