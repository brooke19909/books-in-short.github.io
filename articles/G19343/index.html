    <p>  Travelers daily leave for the capital of Armenia - Yerevan, this settlement is one of the oldest on Earth.  Earlier it was called Erivan, it received its current name in 1936.  According to data for 2014, more than a million people live in the city.  Historians believe that the village from which Yerevan subsequently emerged was formed in 782 BC, then the village of Erebuni was founded here. </p><p>  Unfortunately, in the capital of Armenia, a small number of architectural monuments of the past years have been preserved, however, it is still possible to realize their significance.  Before leaving the “Yerevan-Moscow” route, it is worth visiting all the local excursions to the sights of the city.  Over the past few years, a large tourist infrastructure has formed in the city, allowing you to enjoy a wonderful vacation and high-quality service. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Moscow </h2>

    <p>  I must say that tourists from Armenia also willingly fly to Moscow to get acquainted with its history and sights.  A few hours travel on the route “Yerevan - Moscow”, and the newly-arrived tourist leaves the <span>plane</span> in the hope of seeing absolutely all the delights of the Russian capital.  Most often, guests of the capital use taxi services because of its convenience, and also because it is possible to meet a native of Armenia who can talk in the same language. </p><p>  Despite the fact that Armenia, back in 1991, separated from the USSR, its inhabitants actively maintain cultural and business ties with the Russians.  That is why guests from Yerevan can often be met in the capital's business centers, restaurants, as well as at various exhibitions, symposiums and meetings dedicated to the development of entrepreneurship. </p><h2>  Distance between two cities </h2>

Of course, a lot here will also depend on what kind of transport you plan to use.  When traveling on motorways, you will have to overcome a little more than 2300 kilometers, along with crossing the border and resting, the trip can take about three days one way. </p><p>  Another option is train travel, but there are some difficulties here, in particular, the lack of direct communication between Russia and Armenia.  If you go with transfers, then the total travel time will be about 4 days, and mileage - about 3.5 thousand kilometers.  The smallest distance between Yerevan and Moscow will have to be overcome when flying by plane - only about 1800 kilometers. </p><h2>  Bus ride </h2><p>  One of the vehicles used by passengers on the Moscow-Yerevan route is a bus.  The average driving time ranges from 39 to 48 hours, while the bus stops in large cities and towns.  Bus passengers can sleep on the road, watch TV.  If you need to charge portable devices you need to go to the driver. </p><p>  The fare in this case can fluctuate greatly, it all depends on the speed of the bus and its comfort.  As of November 2015, it is from 2 to 2.7 thousand rubles.  Each route has different destinations, so you need to clarify them by visiting local bus stations. </p><h2>  And you can on the plane! </h2>

    <p>  The fastest means of transportation on the Moscow-Yerevan route is an airplane; the maximum travel time on it is about 3 hours.  Every day, more than 30 flights run between the two cities, Aeroflot, S7, UTair and Ural Airlines are servicing this area, the average flight interval is 30-50 minutes. </p><p>  All flights are carried out mainly from Sheremetyevo and Domodedovo, all of them arrive at Zvartnots airport.  The second airport in Yerevan, Erebuni, is primarily engaged in servicing military aircraft, helicopters, as well as some types of civilian airliners. </p><p>  Utair Airlines is the only one whose liners fly on the route Yerevan - Moscow (Vnukovo).  Only one flight is carried out daily; Boeing aircraft are used on the route.  Generally speaking, the cost of a flight from Moscow to Yerevan ranges from 8 to 35 thousand rubles, in the opposite direction - from 9 to 42 thousand. </p><h2>  Or maybe a train? </h2><p>  Alas, there is no direct railway link on the Yerevan-Moscow route.  The reason for this is simple - the only branch that connects the two countries passes through Georgia and Abkhazia, and does not work due to the conflict between the two countries.  You can find a workaround, but you have to go for about 4 days with transfers and spend an amount comparable to buying a plane ticket. </p><p>  Armenia supports railway communication with Georgia, so you can try to get to Tbilisi, and then catch the train No. 371/372.  The cost of travel documents and the current schedule is best clarified at the railway ticket offices, as they change periodically.  As a rule, railway workers are given discounts for children. </p><h2>  Travel by car </h2>

    <p>  If the Moscow-Yerevan bus flights, traveling by plane and train do not appeal to you, you can go to Armenia by your own car.  In this case, you will have to prepare the car for travel in advance, as well as stock up on additional finances in case of unforeseen circumstances.  On the way to Yerevan there is a large number of service stations, but the distances between them can be very significant. </p><p>  When entering Armenia, in addition to the basic documents, you will need to present a driver's license of an international standard and a vehicle technical passport.  If you rented a car, you will also have to submit a contract with the rental company or a power of attorney from the owner of the vehicle.  All documents must be translated into Russian.  At customs, you need to issue a permit to import a vehicle, and pay a customs fee, when leaving, respectively, you will have to draw up a similar document, but already for the export of the vehicle.  All this takes on average up to 2 hours, the exact timing depends on how busy the border control is. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  Both in Moscow and in Yerevan you can find a huge number of classes.  Visiting excursions, going to cultural institutions, clubs and discos - you will have plenty of time for all this in both capitals.  The Russians and the Armenians are friendly enough to each other, while both nations prefer to cheer for each other at various competitions (world soccer championships, Eurovision, etc.). </p><p>  Travelers should remember that on the territory of both countries, a completely different currency is used, 1 Russian ruble is equal to 7-8 Armenian drams.  You can exchange currency in advance, but in this case it is recommended to familiarize yourself with the rules for importing it into the territory of the country where you are going.  Have a nice trip! </p>
