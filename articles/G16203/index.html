And the tourist area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSunny Beach is the most visited among all the resorts of the country.  In our article we want to talk about one of the budget hotels in the region - Complex Selena (All Inclusive). </p><h2>  A bit about the hotel </h2><p>  Complex Selena (All Inclusive) is located in the northern part of Sunny Beach.  It was built in 2007, and therefore refers to relatively young complexes.  The hotel is only 35 kilometers from the airport in the city of Burgas and 150 meters from the coast. </p><p>  The hotel is located in the most favorable climatic region of Sunny Beach.  This part of the resort has amazingly clean air, because it is here that sea currents meet with mountain air masses, while creating a high level of ionization.  Tourists who want to improve their respiratory organs tend to come here. </p>

    <p>  The resort is great for families with kids, as the local bay is characterized by shallow and gentle sunset.  The region has built a lot of children's playgrounds, slides, swings, entertainment centers in which kids can have fun.  An incredible advantage of the coast are the gentle approaches to the sea itself.  There is no need to go down the stairs or from the mountain.  The resort is also not less popular with young people, because night clubs, discotheques work here, interesting parties gather. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Attractions and entertainment </h2><p>  The resort is an ideal place for water sports: pedal boats, puddles, parasailing, windsurfing, hang gliders, boat trips, bananas, boats and yachts.  Also in the region there are numerous tennis courts, volleyball and basketball courts.  Not so long ago between Nessebar and Sunny Beach there was opened a water park with water attractions, which will be interesting for children, since the local slides are not as high and dangerous as in adult institutions of this direction. </p><p>  In the center of the resort there is an amusement park, which has attractions for all age categories: a centrifuge, a free fall tower, a carousel, a horror house, a <span>dead loop</span> and much more. </p>

    <p>  Sunny Beach itself does not have famous historical sights, in order to see something interesting, you will have to go to Nessebar, which is one of the most ancient settlements on the whole continent.  Nessebar is often called the city of forty churches; it is included in the UNESCO cultural heritage list.  The most ancient churches that have survived to this day date back to the 4th-5th-5th centuries of construction. </p><p>  Sunny Beach is the site of numerous competitions and folklore holidays.  Here you can see the performances of the Burgas Opera and the symphony orchestra. </p><p>  No less interesting for tourists is the Kalinata Nature Reserve, which is a corner of untouched nature.  It is located ten kilometers from St. Vlas and Sunny Beach.  In the reserve you can see the rarest species of plants and animals: storks, owls, turtles, eagle owls, fallow deer and deer.  You can visit this place not only as part of an excursion group, but also by taxi or a rented car. </p><h2>  Hotel Complex Selena All Inclusive 3 * (Sunny Beach): reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, of course, I would like to refer to the reviews of guests who managed to visit it.  Selena Complex 3 * (Sunny Beach, Bulgaria) refers to those institutions about which tourists express rather conflicting opinions.  In general, guests are satisfied with the hotel if they understand that they are going to a three-star hotel, and initially do not make excessive demands. </p><p>  According to vacationers, the complex really has a good location relative to the sea.  Villas of wealthy people start outside the hotel, and there is a bus stop not far from the hotel. </p><p>  You can order a transfer at the hotel, however, the tourists following to Selena Complex 3 * are the last to reach their destination, and therefore the road turns out to be long and incredibly tiring. </p>

    <p>  The hotel has a poolside bar and restaurant.  Meals at Complex Selena All Inclusive 3 * (Sunny Beach) are ordinary.  Here you will not find gourmet dishes, but the products are fresh and the local chef tries to cook deliciously.  Breakfast, as elsewhere, does not differ in variety, but for lunch and dinner you can taste excellent Bulgarian dishes.  There are a lot of meat on the tables, and watermelon, grapefruit, grapes, apples, plums are served from fruits.  Tea and coffee in the bar and restaurant are ok, local beer is also of acceptable quality.  But not everyone is satisfied with draft alcohol.  The hotel does not serve bottled water, there is only a cooler with which there are some inconveniences, and therefore you have to buy some water at the nearest supermarket. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  In general, the reviews about the Selena 3 * hotel (Sunny Beach) are positive, which gives reason to recommend this place for a budget holiday.  However, when purchasing a tour, you need to know some of the nuances of the complex so as not to be disappointed. </p><p>  The hotel rooms are spacious and comfortable, they are equipped with everything necessary.  Some of them would do well to refresh.  Furniture is also not very new, but in good condition.  But the beds in some apartments, according to tourists, are shaky and need to be replaced.  There are no insects in the rooms.  There are complaints regarding the cleaning of the guests: not everyone is satisfied with its quality.  Hotel linen and towels are not changed as often as we would like.  It is noticeable that they have long been in need of replacement. </p>

    <p>  The territory of the complex is very small, there are two pools, a recreation area near one of them.  A playground has been built for children and a playroom is open.  But the animator who deals with kids is almost invisible.  At the reception hangs a plan of daily children's events, but for some reason they are not held.  For adults, there is also no special entertainment.  Therefore, if you are going to this hotel for the sake of the sea and excursions and do not plan to spend much time on its territory, then it is quite suitable for you.  And, if you are counting on an active day and evening animation, then you are clearly not here. </p><p>  The hotel has good staff who are friendly to all guests.  Especially vacationers praise the bartender and the waiters from the restaurant. </p><p>  Not far from the hotel there are several supermarkets where you can buy good local products: cheeses, sausages, dairy, parmesan, Bulgarian wine. </p><p>  Walking distance from the hotel to the coast.  All the nearest beaches are quite equipped.  Even in municipalities there are rescuers.  If you do not like a large crowd of people, then it is worth a little walk to the side on the coast of a neighboring hotel.  There are always much less vacationers.  It is not necessary to rent sun loungers and umbrellas.  Many relax with their accessories.  All beaches of the resort are sandy and equipped with showers and toilets. </p>

    <p>  Sunny Beach has a stunningly beautiful promenade, on which there are many rental points for electric cars, bicycles, scooters.  For those tourists who do not like walking too much, but want to see the resort, such transport will become the most acceptable, cheap convenient option for transportation. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Complex Selena is a good option for an economical vacation.  It is suitable for unassuming tourists who do not want to overpay for additional amenities.  Good location and reasonable food make the hotel very popular among holidaymakers.  All the most interesting places of the resort are within walking distance from the hotel.  But the main advantage of the complex is its proximity to the sea, for the sake of which thousands of tourists try to get to the resort every year. </p>
