Then only the first smartphones appeared, personal computers were actively introduced.  It was difficult to imagine that devices no less powerful than computers, and only slightly larger than smartphones, would enter the market.  Yes, we are talking about tablets - gadgets that have become truly indispensable today.  One of the most famous in this market are <span>Huawei tablets.</span>  Reviews about them are very different: there are both completely and completely satisfied customers, and those who did not like the device at all.  Let's try to understand what this brand represents by the example of several of its most popular models. </p><h2>  What is Huawei? </h2><p>  Perhaps we should start with the story.  The company was founded in the late eighties in China.  From the very first day of their work, Huawei focused on innovations: at first they were engaged in the development of communicator phones, which in those days were considered the latest technological advances, and then gradually switched to mobile phones and mini-computers.  Today, Huawei tablets collect reviews from customers around the world, and fierce competition in the Chinese market forces the manufacturer to constantly monitor the latest developments in the world of technology. </p>

    <p>  The company‚Äôs representative offices have long gone beyond the borders of their native Asia: Huawei lives in the European Union, Russia, and America.  The advantage of the company is that at an affordable price it guarantees its customers excellent product quality.  By their technical characteristics, tablets and phones are in no way inferior to the flagships of world famous brands. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Huawei mediapad </h2><p>  It's time to move from general impressions to specifics.  Our acquaintance with the brand of the tablet Huawei mediapad will begin.  Reviews say that in general, these devices have amazing technical characteristics for their class, sometimes they are ahead of even the world leaders in the production of mobile equipment.  Yes, as in any series, there are also outsiders and leaders here.  The first tablets that entered the market in 2013 suffered from battery problems, while newer versions sometimes have not the most sensitive sensors, which also causes complaints.  But in general, the products of this company are in demand and, most importantly, the love of the user, who sensibly assesses the ratio of price and quality. </p><h2>  Huawei mediapad t1 </h2><p>  Starting to talk about this line, we should mention the tablet Huawei mediapad t1.  Reviews about this seven-inch "kid" are pretty good, although there are also disadvantages.  Most customers are not happy with the sensor: they say that it is not very sensitive, and this affects the quality of the tablet. </p>

    <p>  The case, like other computers of this line, is metal and, most importantly, light.  As in other Mediapad, you can add a USB flash drive to the internal memory.  The average score for the tablet is 4 out of 5, although users note that it has become much more stable than the computers of the first generation of this series. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Huawei 10 </h2><p>  Next in line is Huawei 10 - a tablet, reviews of which emphasize that this is not just a computer, but an ideal option for music lovers.  The considerable dimensions of a ten-inch gadget are explained by the presence of four powerful speakers.  Special attention should be paid to the pen, which comes bundled with the so-called premium version of the tablet.  With it, you can write and delete text, as well as take screenshots.  Like many modern devices, this model has a fingerprint unlock feature.  In general, users are very happy with this modification: the tablet‚Äôs functionality, its speed and, most importantly, a powerful battery, allow you to use the device for both work and entertainment. </p>

    <p>  As for the minuses, for the most part they are connected with the pen: firstly, it can‚Äôt be attached to the tablet in any way, that is, it is quite likely that it will be lost pretty quickly, and secondly, the pen does not recharge, but is powered by batteries, which from time still have to change.  The Huawei mediapad 10 tablet itself collects mostly positive reviews, its only problem is the lack of a quick charge function, so it will take some time to restore the power of a rather capacious battery. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Huawei mediapad 7 </h2><p>  The <span>Huawei mediapad 7</span> tablet will continue our acquaintance <span>.</span> Reviews of this, as it is jokingly called, the ‚Äúphone for Gulliver‚Äù show that users like minimalistic, stylish and, most importantly, functional design.  For example, many entrances are covered with special plugs, which does not allow dust to clog in them.  True, the same cannot be said about the dynamics, which, due to its location, will still have to be cleaned from time to time. </p>

    <p>  Once again, due dynamics is given, the sound of which is in no way inferior to the flagships of miniature tablets.  The flaws of the screen were also fixed: the sensor responds quickly to the slightest touch.  Here, the only negative is that the display itself is not bright enough, so this is the only thing in which this computer is inferior to its competitors. </p><h2>  Huawei mediapad t1 8 </h2><p>  Like any company, Huawei develops models within the same series.  The result of this modernization was the tablet Huawei mediapad t1 8. Reviews of it show that almost everything is excellent in this computer: both the assembly, the color rendering quality, and the battery capacity, which competes with the flagship models of tablet computers.  True, the tablet does not have <span>an oleophobic coating,</span> that is, the screen will be quite easily soiled.  Also a drawback is the heating of the device when performing heavy tasks for it, which, by the way, are not so many, since the tablet's performance is at a fairly high level. </p><h2>  Huawei mediapad t1 10 </h2><p>  Considering the fact that the tablet Huawei mediapad t1 7, reviews of which are generally positive, has already been mentioned, we will continue talking about this line and consider the device Huawei mediapad t1 10. The paradox is that, judging by the reviews, these tablets are almost identical in their technical characteristics.  For the most part, the difference is only in the diagonal of the screen (this computer has 9.7 inches).  The front camera arrangement, unusual for large tablets, immediately catches your eye: usually such computers are used in landscape orientation, and for some reason the camera is located on the side, narrower side.  The same applies to the second camera: if you use a tablet without a case, then when shooting it can close with your fingers.  The case, as in all other models, is made of metal. </p>

    <p>  Alas, Huawei is constant not only in the strengths of its devices, but also in the weak.  It seems that all the problems of the Chinese manufacturer have gathered in this tablet: both the insufficient color rendering of the display, and the battery small in volume for such a tablet, and low productivity.  Simply put, this copy of the more compact version of Huawei mediapad turned out to be not the highest quality. </p><h2>  In conclusion about the t1 series </h2><p>  So, we have already examined several mini-computers from Huawei.  The first was the tablet Huawei mediapad t1 7 3g, reviews of which, unfortunately, are slightly worse than other models in this line.  However, we can confidently say that specifically the T1 series was successful in some respects, but, alas, not ideal.  Perhaps this is due to a focus on affordable prices, and not on the maximum possible functionality, which can not be said about other tablets of this company.  Let's get to know better the leaders of Huawei, appreciated not only by ordinary users, but also by experts in the field of mobile devices. </p><h2>  Huawei Mediapad X2 </h2><p>  A lot of specialized publications make ratings, where Huawei tablets, reviews of which are provided by users from all over the world, compete among themselves.  One of the first places is traditionally occupied by Huawei Mediapad X2, which is significantly ahead of its counterparts in all respects: its design, as well as that of other models, is maximally functional and stylish, and 32 GB of internal memory (this is without additional flash cards) , and the sound is excellent, and performance does not suffer, even the battery is powerful enough to support such a versatile device. </p>

    <p>  Alas, you have to pay for all the good.  The biggest drawback of this phone, according to users, is its high price for tablet computers: for its brainchild, Huawei wants to get $ 370, which is comparable to the cost of a laptop.  But, according to experts, it is really worth it if compactness is important for you with the same functions as a good, powerful laptop. </p><h2>  Huawei MediaPad M3 </h2><p>  Also worthy of special attention is the Huawei MediaPad M3.  With a relatively small diagonal (8.4 inches), it has an amazing resolution.  The already familiar metal casing is made of even more durable aluminum than usual.  A lightweight (310 g) tablet conceals 8 cores, which allows it, like the mini-computer, which was mentioned above, to easily compete with laptops. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, this tablet is one big advantage.  The only drawback that even the most picky users could find was the unsuccessful headphones that come with this gadget.  Huawei MediaPad M3 can rightfully be considered one of the best flagships among the <span>tablets of the Chinese</span> company, which is constantly strengthening its position in the mobile device market.  By the way, an external keyboard can be connected to it, like other tablets of various models, using bluetooth, so with some efforts this device will become as convenient for work as a standard laptop is comfortable. </p><h2>  Afterword </h2><p>  What kind of technology is this - Huawei tablets?  Reviews and reviews insist that these gadgets are not only worthy of attention, but also deserve a leading place in human life.  Yes, let the brand belong to China, but this is the case when the Celestial Empire produces a really high-quality and functional product.  Competition in the domestic market forces Huawei to create the most functional tablets that will cost the minimum amount of money. </p>

    <p>  Fortunately, the Chinese company has transferred these principles to the international market.  The tablet from Huawei, which is not inferior in quality, will cost several times cheaper than its famous western and eastern competitors.  Now we can safely say that as long as Huawei adheres to the same policy, they will not only be afloat, but among the leaders in their industry.  The company's mobile phones come out with enviable constancy and often occupy leading positions in various ratings, the same goes for tablets.  When choosing a mini-computer, be sure to think about a manufacturer like Huawei.  Perfect value for money - these are the main arguments in his favor. </p>
