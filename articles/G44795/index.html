The city was considered one of the largest in Russia and Europe, but after the founding of St. Petersburg, it lost its significance on the western borders of the country. </p><p>  Today, Pskov is an important tourist center, which is successfully located at the intersection of major highways and railways.  Thanks to centuries of history, the city has preserved a huge number of attractions that are included in the list of cultural heritage of our country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pskov hotels" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1032003.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Ancient <span>temples, the Pskov</span> fortress, a number of residential buildings of the 17th century and other architectural monuments invariably arouse interest among travelers who seek Pskov.  Hotels and hotels are presented in large numbers and are designed for any wallet. </p><h2>  Hotel “903” </h2><p>  The most popular hotels in Pskov are located in the immediate vicinity of the city center.  Guests of the “903” complex can visit the Kremlin, which is a five-minute walk, at any time. </p><p>  The comfortable rooms have everything you need to relax: <span>air conditioning, minibar,</span> hairdryer, TV, Internet and a set of cosmetic accessories.  Fifteen rooms are available for booking - “standard double”, “twin”, “junior suite”, “comfort” and “apartments”.  The minimum cost for double accommodation is 2700 rubles, the most expensive apartments with a kitchenette - 6000 rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In the mornings, guests can enjoy breakfast in the cozy dining room, and during the day you can always enjoy tea or coffee with sweets.  Free parking is available on site. </p><h2>  Travelers opinion </h2><p>  Find negative reviews about the hotel “903" is almost impossible.  Tasty breakfasts, wonderful equipment of rooms, a view from the window on the sights, helpful staff. </p><p>  A few comments apply only to bathrooms, where guests note a low pressure of water and uncomfortable temperature.  Definitely not enough towel dryers and underfloor heating. </p><h2>  Old Estate Hotel &amp; SPA </h2><p>  Pskov hotels with a swimming pool do not differ at affordable prices.  One of the most expensive is considered to be Old Estate Hotel &amp; SPA.  The mansion in which the complex is located is an architectural monument of the 16th-19th centuries.  The Heliopark Hotel (Pskov) used to be here, but for unknown reasons the famous chain decided to close its project. </p><p>  Old Estate offers the following room types: </p><p>  - double standard; </p><p>  - superior double; </p><p>  - studio; </p><p>  - junior suite; </p><p>  - luxury. </p><p>  Regardless of the category, guests have access to a safe, minibar, cable TV, air conditioning, hairdryer and wireless internet. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  When booking online on the official website, no prepayment is required, and special offers also apply.  The most modest double room will cost 4,500 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the best hotels of pskov" class="if" height="214" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1032008.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The best hotels in Pskov can not be imagined without SPA.  Beauty Center Old Estate offers more than 200 types of procedures: </p><ol><li>  Massages (honey, Indian, stone, Polynesian, wellness and others). </li><li>  Turkish steam room. </li><li>  Finnish sauna. </li><li>  Sharko's shower. </li><li>  Sessions tallallo - and hydrotherapy. </li></ol><h2>  In the best traditions </h2><p>  The hotel has the Aristocrat restaurant, which serves a buffet breakfast in the mornings, and on weekdays from 12 to 15 hours, guests can dine cheaply.  At any time, they prepare excellent dishes of traditional Russian cuisine, and connoisseurs will certainly be interested in a huge selection of collection wines. </p><p>  The Rublev bar, which is located in a unique building, the House of the Merchant Statina (XVII century), offers a real time travel.  The interior combines modern furniture with recreated antique paintings on the walls.  Dishes prepared according to real Pskov recipes are served in earthenware dishes.  Visitors are pleasantly surprised by the variety of home-made drinks (cedar wine, fruit drinks, sbiten and horseradish). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Traveler Reviews </h2><p>  The undoubted advantage of Old Estate is its location in the very center of the city.  The laconic interior of the hotel and rooms, as well as the availability of all cosmetic accessories, leaves a pleasant impression.  The dishes in the restaurant are really delicious.  In a word, the hotel complex corresponds to the declared status of “4 stars”. </p><p>  According to guests, the main drawback is the high prices for literally everything - accommodation, meals, additional services and alcoholic beverages.  In addition, not the best reviews are written about the spa-center, where saunas work intermittently. </p><h2>  Yard Pozdnoeva </h2><p>  The “Pozdnoeva Yard” also entered the top three <span>most expensive hotels in</span> Pskov.  The restaurant and hotel complex includes: </p><ol><li>  The main building (50 comfortable rooms, a lobby bar and a banquet room). </li><li>  Business building (25 rooms, a conference room and a room for business meetings and negotiations). </li><li>  Restaurant of Russian and European cuisine “Refectory Chambers”. </li><li>  Wellness complex “Spa without a bottom”. </li><li>  Shop “Wine Chambers”. </li><li>  “Beer Chambers”. </li><li>  “Pie chambers”. </li><li>  “Coffee Chambers”. </li></ol><p>  The minimum cost of living is 4,600 rubles for two - a standard category room.  However, many travelers are willing to pay for comfort and a high level of service.  Room reservation includes breakfast and access to the spa with pool and saunas in the morning.  There is a games room for young guests. </p><p>  Restaurants are considered one of the best in the city, but the prices, accordingly, “bite”.  Hospitality, an unusual interior and small details (for example, a menu in the Old Russian language) add color to this place. </p>

    <p>  Additional services: </p><p>  - banquets; </p><p>  - catering; </p><p>  - laundry room; </p><p>  - concierge services; </p><p>  - excursion service; </p><p>  - room service. </p><h2>  Human Resources </h2><p>  The rating of the “Pozdnoev Yard” complex is pretty good.  There are no questions regarding the equipment of rooms.  The hotel grounds, where there are several restaurants and cafes, leave a good impression.  They cook there very tasty, and many guests like the atmosphere.  Breakfast includes a large selection of hot dishes, and a coffee machine makes your favorite morning drink. </p><p>  About the shortcomings.  Travelers are occasionally confused by the inconsistency of the hotel and the spa.  The administrator at the reception simply sends the guests to find out answers to their questions on their own and does not even try to help.  In addition, the staff is not attentive to the requests of the guests. </p><h2>  Golden embankment </h2><p>  Amazing atmosphere and privacy offers the hotel “Golden Embankment” (Pskov), from the windows of which offer amazing views of the Kremlin.  Furniture made of precious wood, stained-glass windows, panels and wall paintings - the interior of the mini-hotel was created by talented artists-decorators. </p><p>  “Suite”, “Junior Suite”, “Comfort” and “Comfort +” - 15 rooms are available for booking, each of which is suitable for both leisure and work.  The minimum cost for double occupancy is 3200 rubles. </p><p>  In the morning, a <span>continental breakfast</span> awaits guests at a nearby restaurant <span>.</span>  The inn features a playground and a children's room for young travelers. </p><h2>  Guest opinion </h2><p>  Excellent location, delicious breakfasts and polite staff - this, perhaps, the advantages of the hotel “Golden Embankment” end. </p><p>  Recently, guests have begun to note more and more flaws.  According to guests, a wonderful number of rooms does not receive proper care.  The work of the maids leaves much to be desired - rust stains everywhere in the bathroom, sometimes cobwebs and traces of insects are visible on the ceilings, and there is an accumulation of dust on the furniture. </p><p>  Another “minus” is poor insulation and lack of air conditioning, but many Pskov hotels “sin” this.  On hot summer days you have to open the windows, and the room is instantly filled with noise from a nearby restaurant. </p><h2>  "Balthouse" </h2><p>  Hotel “Balthouse” (Pskov) is located almost on the highway, so most often guests stay here who have arrived in the city by personal transport.  There are 27 rooms available for booking: </p><p>  - four-seater (3200 rubles); </p><p>  - triple (2700 rubles); </p><p>  - standard (2300-2600 rubles); </p><p>  - junior suite (3500 rubles); </p><p>  - lux (3900 rubles). </p><p>  The room rate includes a continental breakfast.  There is free Wi-Fi.  For the convenience of travelers, the cafe is open around the clock, so even with an early departure, you will not be left without a cup of aromatic coffee. </p><p>  Some Pskov hotels, including the “Balthouse”, are pet-friendly.  Depending on the size of the pet, accommodation will cost 300-900 rubles. </p><p>  For business meetings, the hotel offers for rent two conference rooms with 25 and 80 seats.  The price also includes equipment: an LCD TV, a projector and a screen, a flip chart and a camera with video recording function.  Additionally, coffee breaks can be arranged at the cafe. </p><p>  At the end of a busy day, guests can visit the traditional Russian bathhouse.  Oak font, steam room, bath accessories, relaxation room and karaoke - detailed pricing information is available on the hotel’s official website. </p><h2>  For one night </h2><p>  Many guests agree that the “Balthouse” is suitable for one, maximum two nights.  Only motorists will appreciate the location, but without personal transportation it will be difficult to get to the city.  The rooms have everything you need, and a hearty breakfast is served in the cafe.  Of the pluses, a secure parking is also noted - 100 rubles per day. </p><p>  The main disadvantage of the hotel is the lack of air conditioning in most rooms.  The only option is to open the windows, but due to the proximity of the highway and the airport (2 km), the noise level increases several times.  In addition, the number of rooms requires a small update. </p><h2>  "Pushkin" </h2><p>  In September 2014, the Pushkin Hotel opened its doors (Pskov, Krestovsky highway, 40a).  Remoteness from the historical center is more than compensated by affordable prices and comfortable rooms, so this institution does not experience a shortage of guests. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel golden embankment pskov" class="if" height="354" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1032009.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The following categories are available for booking: </p><p>  - single room (1960 rubles); </p><p>  - double room (2300-2700 rubles); </p><p>  - triple room (2800-3100 rubles); </p><p>  - quadruple room (3500-3700 rubles); </p><p>  - junior suite (3800 rubles). </p><p>  In the mornings, a generous breakfast awaits you at the restaurant.  A kettle, iron and hairdryer are available upon request. </p><p>  Interestingly, the opinion of travelers about the hotel depends on the neighbors.  Unfortunately, soundproofing is almost completely absent, and guests can hear everything that happens in other rooms. </p><p>  The hotel is more suitable for guests with personal vehicles, because in a matter of minutes you can drive to the center and see Pskov itself. </p><p>  Hotels on the highway are not required to provide high-quality service, but cleanliness is still a prerequisite.  The management of “Pushkin” should take control of the work of the maids - most of the negative reviews are talking about the poor content of the rooms. </p><h2>  Avatar </h2><p>  To the list: “Cheap hotels of Pskov”, you can also define an institution with the unusual name “Avatar”, which is located near the historical center of the city.  A twenty-minute walk - Pokrovsky complex, Mirozhsky monastery and Victory Square, and even closer are the railway and bus stations. </p><p>  The Avatar Hotel (Pskov, Sovetskaya St., 111) offers a choice of 19 rooms: </p><p>  - single two-room (3100 rubles); </p><p>  - "comfort" single (3100 rubles); </p><p>  - two-room double room (3100 rubles); </p><p>  - "comfort" double (3100 rubles); </p><p>  - "standard" double (2500 rubles); </p><p>  - "economy" single (1100 rubles); </p><p>  - "economy" double (1600 rubles); </p><p>  - "economy" triple (2100 rubles); </p><p>  - "economy" four-seater (2300 rubles). </p><p>  Economy rooms are not equipped with a private bathroom, and there is a bathroom on the floor for guests. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Balthouse Pskov" class="if" height="451" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34529/840172.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  At the request of guests, the hotel is ready to provide a free hairdryer, iron, kettle and repair kit for clothes (threads, needles).  Wi-Fi is also available throughout. </p><p>  Meals are not included in the reservation price, but for 170 rubles guests can have breakfast in the Avatar cafe, which offers a choice of three options: Russian breakfast, American express and English continental. </p><h2>  Error handling </h2><p>  Travelers note that the area and the building in which the hotel is located do not inspire confidence, especially in the dark.  However, after living impressions are exactly the opposite.  Bright interior, cleanliness, attentive staff and affordable prices - not all hotels in the city of Pskov can boast of this. </p><p>  Observations of fastidious travelers: </p><p>  - mattresses with protruding springs; </p><p>  - unattractive view from the window; </p><p>  - too modest breakfast; </p><p>  - lack of dark curtains (actual during white nights). </p><h2>  Artmagic </h2><p>  A hotel complex of European level, an apartment or a mini-hotel - Pskov today can offer various types of accommodation. </p><p>  ArtMagic ApartHotel is located two kilometers from Trinity Cathedral, in the immediate vicinity of the Great River.  The spacious apartments are equipped with all necessary furniture, but the main feature is the presence of a kitchenette with a refrigerator, kettle, stove and microwave.  This equipment is most appreciated by travelers with young children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Pushkin Pskov" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1032006.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  ArtMagic offers a choice of six apartments, the minimum cost is 2500 rubles for two. </p><p>  Due to its remoteness, the aparthotel is suitable for tourists with personal transportation.  There is no traditional reception desk, and the duties of the administrator are carried out by the owner himself.  Guests perceive this as an advantage, because they do not impose additional services. </p><p>  Among the shortcomings, the noise of sewers and not the most attractive neighborhoods are noted.  In addition, guests lack a washing machine. </p><p>  The ArtMagic format is rather unusual, but they are gradually getting used to it.  In December 2015, Kamelot (Pskov) was opened - a hotel where you can also book apartments with a kitchenette.  According to information on the official website, anyone can rent a room in the apart-hotel at any time of the day. </p><h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  An obligatory stage in any trip is the purchase of souvenirs.  From Pskov, you and your friends can bring to memory: </p><ol><li>  Black clay pottery. </li><li>  Products of the Pskov Potter plant. </li><li>  Magnets, t-shirts and other things with the image of the symbol of the city - a graceful leopard. </li><li>  The jewelry, recreated based on the ornaments that were found during excavations in the Pskov land. </li><li>  Dog wool socks, mittens, stockings and gloves. </li></ol><p>  The most popular souvenir shops are concentrated in the city center.  There is a small market in front of the Kremlin, the Pskov Potter company store is located on Oktyabrskaya Street, and you will find the most expensive items in the Menshikov Chambers, where even shop windows can be photographed for a fee. </p>
