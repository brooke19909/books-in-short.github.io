Is it possible to meet him in May?  Yes!  To do this, it‚Äôs enough to plan a vacation in this last spring month and choose for yourself a country that will delight you with a warm sea and a tanning sun. </p><p>  Where to fly to rest in May so that there are no disappointments from the trip?

Judging by the reviews of tourists, there are no high-rise hotels on these islands.  The only exception is the capital of Male.  The main part of the hotels is represented by houses, cottages, villas, bungalows and chalets.  Despite such a great variety in names, the essence of these buildings is one.  All of them are low and free-standing, which allows each vacationer to enter their room directly from the street. </p><p>  Bungalow houses in the Maldives can be divided into three types.  Among them are those that: </p><ul><li>  located deep in the island; </li><li>  located on the shore, and exit from them leads directly to the beach; </li><li>  stand on stilts in the water. </li></ul><p>  Most often, to the houses that are in the sea, you can walk along the bridge.

They offer visitors to the country yachting, water skiing and ATVs.  With children it is best to go to the islands of Pattaya, Samui and Phuket. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.turquoiseholidays.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hammock on the beach of thailand" class="if uuid-3071243" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/3071243.jpg"></div><p>  The hotels of the first of these resorts are distinguished by their impeccable service.  However, judging by the reviews of experienced tourists, when choosing a hotel in Pattaya, you should not pay attention to its stardom, as it can be very conditional.  It is recommended to look at specific photos, study the services provided and evaluate its location.  For example, those who come to Thailand for entertainment and nightlife are advised to choose a hotel for themselves near the center.  But it should be borne in mind that inexpensive hotels, as a rule, are located above the massage parlors and bars, so that under the windows of a traveler it will be very noisy almost around the clock. </p><p>  Those who come here with children are advised to stay in more peaceful areas - Naklua and Jomtien.  The cheapest option is guest houses.  These are mini-hotels of family type for the most unassuming in terms of life guests.  The most popular types of accommodation in the country are condominiums.  They are a cross between an apartment and a hotel.  There are security and reception, as well as a shared pool for all guests. </p><p>  You can stay in Pattaya in a two-story villa.  Such structures are located directly on the beach. </p><p>  Finding the right accommodation for yourself is easy on Koh Samui.  Those who prefer a vibrant nightlife should consider options for hotels located near the beaches of Lamai and Chaweng.  Fans of a relaxing holiday will prefer the southern part of the island or the Maenam area. </p><p>  For those who went to Phuket and do not want to spend money on housing, experienced tourists recommend going to the crowded Patong.  Connoisseurs of clean beaches and silence will pick up a hotel in Karon Beach, but scuba diving lovers should go to Nai Yang, where you can admire the magnificent coral reefs. </p><h2>  Greece </h2><p>  Where to fly to rest in May at sea?
