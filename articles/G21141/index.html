But in the pursuit of impressions it is not necessary to go far.  Dzhubga has its own lighthouse, it may not look very impressive, but it can easily boast of an interesting and long history.  The construction was created in 1954.  The first lighthouse at this place was installed back in 1898.  Relaxing in the village, you can visit the picturesque <span>Inal Bay.</span>  It is located five kilometers from Dzhubga.
