Therefore, we will not do a full review of the device today, but let's talk about what in one way or another highlights an improved version compared to the base one.  By the way, we immediately note that the device has a ‚Äúbrother‚Äù.  This is the Nokia 6310i Mercedes Benz phone, which is distinguished by the corresponding external designations. </p><h2>  What did the updated version get? </h2>

    <p>  The device is equipped with the ability to work with an additional range.  More specifically, this is GSM 1900. Thus, the Nokia 6310i E220 phone instantly transforms both physically and psychologically into a business class device.  In fact, the integration of chips to work with the new range means that it will be possible to use ‚ÄúNokia‚Äù not only in Europe, but also in the United States of America.  On the other hand, a similar feature was added to many devices before the release of version 6310i.  But the reason for such a delay in the integration of the updated functional part is a completely different story. </p><h2>  Do we notice the highlight? </h2>

And not just sluggishly notice: this improvement is simply striking to all those who were familiar with the previous model, that is, ‚ÄúNokia 6310‚Äù.  Here, by the way, it is pale blue.  Only the screen is actively highlighted, but this is enough to appreciate the innovation.  A similar upgrade by many experts in the field of mobile technology was described as positive, since it became much more convenient to read text from the display.  And although a large fraction of the intensity falls precisely on this functional part, the backlight also extends to the keys, albeit to a lesser extent.  Which, in principle, cannot but rejoice. </p><h2>  What influenced the decision of the developers? </h2>

    <p>  Nokia 6310i, the photo of which you can see in this article, is a direct continuation of the base model 6310. As mentioned earlier, this is an upgraded version with innovations.  So you can only logically guess that here the engineers and designers decided to learn from their mistakes that they made in the design and manufacture of the base unit.  There, if someone remembers, letters as separate characters were perceived very poorly.  They practically merged, forming one incomprehensible word.  But what remains unchanged is the shape of the keys and their sizes, as well as options for the coloring and shape of the body.  All this is, so to speak, a legacy from its predecessor. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Major change </h2>

    <p>  Such a ‚Äútitle‚Äù can probably be given to innovations applied to the telephone engineering menu.  Rather, not to him as a whole, but to the section called ‚ÄúApplications‚Äù, or in English Application.  Here we can notice a couple of pre-installed applications of the Java format.  They demonstrate what new technologies embedded in the device‚Äôs hardware platform are capable of. </p><h2>  More about programs </h2>

    <p>  The first one is Nokia Converter.  With its help, you can translate numerical values ‚Äã‚Äãbetween systems of measures.  Well, for example, you know how many degrees Celsius is on the street.  And you need to know the answer in Fahrenheit.  To do this, you can use a program called ‚ÄúNokia Converter‚Äù.  Actually, it is intended for various groups.  This is the mass, and the length, and much more. </p><p>  The second program is called World Clock.  If translated into Russian, then this is ‚ÄúWorld Clock‚Äù.  Let's agree that we will call it a system utility on the Java platform.  It allows you to find out how much time is currently at any point in the world.  Rather, only large cities fall into the calculation.  Nevertheless, sometimes the program can bring noticeable benefits.  It can be used very simply, although for the embedded functionality, certain correspondences are respected.  But we don‚Äôt need more. </p><h2>  Update option </h2>

    <p>  You can always update your applications in Java format.  To do this, you will only need to establish a connection through the WAP standard.  To do this, you need to take care of collecting the relevant information in advance.  More specifically, verify whether the available version matches the one on your phone.  If programs are not needed at all, then you can uninstall them.  Although with regard to memory, you need to be careful here.  The device provides for the presence of only 140 kB.  This volume is enough for a two-minute recording on the recorder.  This is for the reader to simply imagine the scale of the problem. </p><h2>  Software issues </h2><p>  This item is still here.  As the predecessor of the model of our today's review suffered, so does she, in fact, herself.  Java applications load quite a long time, even by that time standards.  For example, to fully deploy Nokia Converter, you should wait about ten seconds.  For such a relatively simple application, such indicators are rather overstated.  Then the engineers were too lazy to do anything, I guess.  To find a clear answer to this question, one could conduct a test between Nokia and its direct competitor Siemens.  However, the functional part of the programs on these two devices is different, which, unfortunately, fundamentally negates the possibility of a comparative analysis due to inequalities. </p><h2>  And if you try to open the game? </h2><p>  The impossibility of comparing the programs of the same type on these two devices did not stop the experts who, in their desire to find out which of the phones would benefit from this parameter, decided to go all the way.  We can say that they deliberately decided to play along with ‚ÄúNokia‚Äù by launching a rather ‚Äúheavy‚Äù game on ‚ÄúSiemens‚Äù.  But the results were as impressive as unexpected.  It turned out that even in this case, the latter is ahead of the subject of our today's review by a couple of seconds.  This once again confirmed the assumption that the engineers either could not or did not want (which seems more likely) to optimize Java applications on Nokia. </p><h2>  Nokia 6310i: features and parameters </h2><p>  The device was developed and released in 2002.  Works in three GSM bands.  A lithium-polymer battery is built in as a source of battery life.  It is designed for a capacity of 1100 milliamps per hour.  In standby mode, the device can "live" up to 410 hours.  The battery, by the way, charges from 0 to 100 percent in just one hour.  The form factor is classic, no surprises here.  We have already talked about memory, its only 160 kilobytes here.  Not so hot, of course.  The charging input is classic, no need to talk about any USB. </p><h2>  Verdict </h2><p>  In general, to characterize the device as something worthwhile is unlikely to succeed.  And it‚Äôs hardly worth exchanging the base model for an improved one.  There are, of course, a couple of pleasant innovations that can be appreciated, but no more.  Globally, practically nothing has changed, and overpaying in a new way for improvements in part of the screen (and we are talking about backlighting) seems at least illogical. </p>
