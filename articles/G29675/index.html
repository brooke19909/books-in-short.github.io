    <h2>  India and Sri Lanka </h2><p>  Where is it hot at sea in January?  Warm and sunny weather in winter is promised to tourists by India, in particular, the state of Goa.  The water temperature at this time is very comfortable for swimming - up to 25 ° C.  This region is most often chosen by middle-class tourists who love exoticism.  Goa resorts offer elephant rides and visits to ancient monuments.  The beaches in the region are quite clean, and many hotels have quite decent service.  Inveterate party-goers are advised to go to the northern part of the state.  Most hotels here are economical, and parties are held from dusk to dawn. </p><p>  While a blizzard is raging in Russia and frosts are raging, Sri Lanka is quite hot in January.  The south and west of the country lie in the equatorial climate zone, this situation provides the region with year-round high temperature marks.  The east and north are characterized by a subequatorial climate, there is less rainfall, but winter is cooler.  Monsoons also strongly influence the climate of the island.  But in general, a vacation on the island of Ceylon in January will be very comfortable.  For example, in Trincomale, the air warms up to 27 ° C during the day, and drops to 24 ° C at night.  Therefore, tourists will not need warm clothes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Maldives </h2><p>  An honorable place in the list of “Hot countries in January” can be safely given to the charming Maldives.  High temperatures on the islands are explained by the proximity of the country to the equator line.  At the height of the winter season, vacation here can only be spoiled by a few rainy days.  At noon, the thermometer can reach 30-32 ° C.  Such climatic conditions in combination with almost complete calm will provide tourists with an excellent vacation.  In the evening, the air can be cooled to +25 ° C.  And the water warms up to + 28 <sup></sup> , so even young children can swim for hours in the sea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="relax at sea in january" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/510174.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Mauritius </h2><p>  If you are looking for a resort where it is hot on the sea in January, then we recommend visiting Mauritius.  Unlike countries that are in our latitude, on this picturesque island, January is the middle of summer.  The weather in this period is just perfect for relaxing on the beaches.  During the day, you can sunbathe and plenty of fun, and in the evening you can take a walk around the island or go to one of the local restaurants or bars.  Note that in January in Mauritius there is a large amount of rainfall, but this is not an obstacle for tourists, showers pass very quickly and instantly evaporate. </p><p>  It should also be borne in mind that on the ocean coast the temperature is approximately 5 ° C higher than in the central mountain region.  However, it is in the center that most of the tourist attractions are concentrated. </p><p>  The weather on the island of Mauritius, of course, differs depending on the time of day.  During the day you can observe the heat up to 35 C, and in the evening the air can cool to 22 C <sup>about</sup> .  Water warms up to 27 degrees, and air humidity in the winter is 81%.  Mauritius is located in the tropical zone, so there are no sharp changes in temperature on the island. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hot in January" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/510165.jpg" width="480"></div>

    <h2>  Bahamas </h2><p>  Another place where it is hot at sea in January is the Bahamas.  The cleanest beaches, the endless <span>turquoise sea,</span> picturesque evergreen vegetation, the highest level of service - all these are characteristic features of the Bahamas resorts that distinguish them from other popular places on our planet.  Rest here is beautiful at any time of the year.  In January, the air temperature is set at 23-24 degrees.  During this period, the islands have mild and calm weather, almost no precipitation in winter.  Such favorable conditions attract hundreds of tourists to the Bahamas.  But in the summer the sea can be very stormy. </p><h2>  Cuba </h2><p>  If you want to hide from the cold, then go under the sultry sun of Cuba.  The Liberty Island is dominated by a tropical trade wind climate.  Between October and April, clear and dry weather reigns on the archipelago.  Most tourists prefer to visit Cuba during this period.  A beach holiday at the country's resorts promises to be entertaining.  The coast of the archipelago is dotted with luxurious white beaches.  Outdoor enthusiasts can go scuba diving and watch the coral reefs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hot countries in January" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/510173.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Brazil </h2><p>  Brazil is a place where you can safely go to the sea in January.  The second month of winter in the country of the jungle, football and carnival is the real height of summer.  At this time, the highest temperatures are noted here - air, as a rule, warms up to 27-30 C <sup>about</sup> , water - up to 28-30 C <sup>about</sup> .  High humidity is also observed this month, because rains in January fall quite often. </p><p>  In addition, tourists have another reason to visit Brazil in the middle of winter - January 20 in Rio de Janeiro and January 25 in Sao Paulo are the days of the founding of these cities.  The celebration is accompanied by theatrical shows, festivities and large-scale nightly fireworks.  And if you wait until the beginning of February, you can get to the grand carnival in Rio de Janeiro. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the hottest countries in January" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/510184.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  South Africa </h2><p>  Closing our list “The hottest countries in January”, let us recall the South African Republic.  Here, at this time, it will definitely not be cold, but rather, on the contrary.  On the coast in winter, air temperature is 25-27 ° C, and water is 20-22 degrees.  In addition, tourists can choose for their holidays both the Indian and Atlantic Ocean. </p><p>  Whatever country you choose for your winter vacation, you will surely be satisfied.  After all, to come from the cold and blizzards to the warm sea is just an unearthly pleasure.  Our citizens still have a stereotype from Soviet times that vacations should be planned only in the summer.  But if you decide to pack up on an exotic resort in the midst of harsh Russian winter, you will get a lot of undeniable advantages: the lack of a huge flow of tourists, low prices for apartments in hotels and other services, as well as a charge of positive emotions that will definitely last until the warm days in our latitudes. </p>
