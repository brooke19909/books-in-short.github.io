Consider that you are just lucky, people often go here on purpose and from afar.  You won‚Äôt have to think long about the question of where to go in Yaroslavl.  There is something to see here.  Yaroslavl is a beautiful Russian city with more than a thousand-year history.  It is very well preserved, it is not so much compared with other ancient cities of central Russia affected by war, revolution, modernization, reconstruction and perestroika.  Yaroslavl is included as one of the central points in the tourist route of the Golden Ring of Russia.  In terms of the volume and significance of the cultural and historical heritage of the cities comparable to it, there are not so many both within the Golden Ring and beyond them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to go in yaroslavl" class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/276676.jpg" width="499"></div>

    <p>  Where to go in Yaroslavl in the first place </p><p>  Acquaintance with the city is most preferable to begin with its historical center.  This, of course, is the Transfiguration Monastery.  In ancient Yaroslavl there was no Kremlin, the functions of a <span>fortification</span> for many centuries were performed by the massive walls of this monastery.  They defended the city from enemies.  Today there is a museum-reserve, a significant cultural and historical heritage and many architectural monuments are concentrated on its territory.  The vast funds of the museum have unique exhibits of icon painting and ancient Russian culture.  Here you can climb the ancient belfry of the monastery, it offers a magnificent view of the city, you can see and think about where to go in Yaroslavl yet.  Getting around the city in one day will be difficult.  Many <span>monuments of Yaroslavl are</span> known for illustrations in the textbook of the History of Russia, and the more interesting it will be to meet them in reality. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yaroslavl where to go with a girl" class="if" height="371" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/276680.jpg" width="495"></div>  But the <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãon the Volga</span> does not consist of historical antiquities alone, it has many places where you can have a good time.  The Volga embankment is a luxurious place for walking, and Yaroslavl is justly proud of it.  <span>"Where to go with the girl?"</span>  - The question is purely private, but many young Yaroslavl people choose this place for walking on the banks of the Volga.  The embankment is beautifully furnished in the style typical of the Volga region; it faces the facades of ancient merchant mansions and historical office buildings.  The length of the Volga embankment is about three kilometers.  It so happened that the townspeople for a long time did not think about where to go for a walk in Yaroslavl.  Where else if not on the Volga embankment? <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to go for a walk in Yaroslavl" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/276679.jpg" width="499"></div>

    <p>  Where to go in Yaroslavl in the evening </p><p>  There should not be any special problems with how pleasant and beneficial it is to spend an evening in Yaroslavl.  There are many options for carrying it out, it is a matter of taste.  But in Yaroslavl, one of the oldest Russian theaters has existed for three hundred years now.  This is the Theater named after <span>Fedor Volkov.</span>  It was founded in 1750 and successfully exists to this day, delighting its viewers with new works every year.  The Volkov Theater is located in the very center of the city, near the Volga Embankment.  This is certainly one of the most significant city attractions. </p>
