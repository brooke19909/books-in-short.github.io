Raji and Maharajas of the Indian Subcontinent</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In books about India and in its vibrant, dynamic films, you have definitely met references to the titles of Indian princes.  The familiar words “raja”, “rani”, “rajput” and others sound to us like a regular prefix to a name.  Who is the Indian prince and how does he stand out from the crowd of nobles? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ibtimes.co.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="title of indian princes" class="if uuid-2510982" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/91394/2510982.jpg"></div><h2>  The value of the main ranks of the Indian rulers </h2><p>  Maharaja and Raja are the most common titles of representatives of the ruling dynasties of India.  There is also the term nizam.  <span>This is a title</span> assigned to the ruler of the Principality of Hyderabad and, despite the deprivation of real power after Operation Polo, has been preserved to this day. </p><ul><li>  Rajah.  Comes from Sanskrit राज rāja - ruler.  The feminine form of the word is rājñī, in Latin spelled regina. </li><li>  Maharaj.  In Sanskrit, महाराज mahārājaḥ, where mahā means great.  The second word राजन् rājan is close in meaning to the Latin rēx (king). </li><li>  Nizam Hyderabad.  The word "niẓām" belongs to the ancient Arabic language and is translated as "order".  The title belonged to the <span>rulers of the Indian</span> principality of Hyderabad, which existed from 1724 to 1948. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=":   , " data-source="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tektrader/10717389233"><img itemprop="image" alt="title of indian prince" class="if uuid-2510660" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/91394/2510660.jpg"></div><h2>  Who is Raja? </h2><p>  For the Slavic peoples, this is the Indian analogue of the Russian prince, which in Western European countries is equated to a duke or prince.  For centuries, the Indian subcontinent was divided into areas controlled by the Rajas.  For a long time they remained the same components of the current authorities.  However, later, after the establishment of British rule in 1858, the question was raised about their position in the hierarchy of the empire. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The British still decided to support most local rulers, instead of deciding to replace them with colonial officials.  Abandoned Indian princes were now forced to imitate Western customs. </p><p>  The rajas of our day is one of the important symbols of the country's national identity. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.haalo.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="supreme title of indian princes" class="if uuid-2510972" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/91394/2510972.jpg"></div><h2>  What is the royal power of India? </h2><p>  The supreme title of the Indian princes today is simply a prefix to the name.  All official powers were lost in 1947, when the nation gained independence.  However, the Maharajas are rich, influential and continue to live a luxurious life familiar to us from Bollywood films. </p><p>  In the 1970s, the government of Indira Gandhi takes away the remaining privileges.  Now the Maharajas are forced to pay taxes, lifelong payments are canceled.  For the most part, the nobility retained the titles, but many Indian princes sell their palaces and jewelry for nothing, trying to adapt to the upcoming changes. </p><p>  The modern royal families of India are successfully doing business.  They invest in hydropower, biofuels, pharmaceuticals and other cost-effective sectors.  Princes often study abroad, but return to their homeland to continue family traditions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Maharajas successfully balance between modern and traditional values.  In their world, princes and princesses are not only the main characters of fairy tales, but also real personalities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.prahladbubbar.com" data-author=":   , "><img itemprop="image" alt="indian prince" class="if uuid-2510623" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/91394/2510623.jpg"></div><h2>  Hyderabad Dynasty History </h2><p>  The full title of the founder of the dynasty Mir Kamar-ud-Din sounds like Nizam ul-Mulk, also known as “Asaf Jah”.  According to Sir Roper Lethbridge's The Golden Book of India, the Nizams belong to the oldest and most important family among Muslim rulers.  The genus from India comes from Abid Khan. </p><p>  The first baseman ruled on behalf of the Mughal emperor.  During the reign of Britain, the family retained its princely position.  During their reign, the Hyderabad state became one of the richest, there was a noticeable economic and cultural growth. </p><p>  One example of the welfare of a dynasty is the jewels of the Nizams.  This is an outstanding collection of stones and jewelry that are made of gold and silver.  They are decorated with Colombian emeralds, diamonds from the Golconda mines, Burmese rubies and Basra pearls. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Indian counterpart of the Russian prince" class="if uuid-2510697" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/91394/2510697.jpg"></div><h2>  Modern descendants of rulers </h2><p>  After the country gained independence, the rulers of many provinces became bankrupt.  Some Indian princes were able to adapt by turning their luxurious palaces into hotels and museums or taking part in economic activities. </p><p>  All important posts of the country are occupied by representatives of the upper class, preparation for state activity begins from childhood.  Necessarily excellent knowledge of English, for this education is received in the leading educational institutions of the world. </p><div class="photo" data-original="royaljaipur.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Royal family jaipur" class="if uuid-2510781" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/91394/2510781.jpg"></div><p>  An important role is played by appearance.  It is worth noting that when choosing clothes, local designers prefer.  Indians from wealthy families spend their free time in special places accessible only to representatives of high society. </p><h2>  Personal life of princes with a family tree </h2><p>  Contractual marriages based on business settlement are concluded in 90% of cases.  The Hindu from the ruling class is very limited in choosing a future wife. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.indianweddingbuzz.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wedding ceremony" class="if uuid-2510757" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/91394/2510757.jpg"></div><p>  Parents are often engaged in the selection of the bride, the girl should be of the appropriate level.  The cost of a wedding is divided equally between both families. </p><p>  Marriage in India is almost forever.  Divorces are so rare that many people think that there is a ban on them. </p>
