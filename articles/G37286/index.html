Material for the report on educational psychology</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The policy, methodology and strategy of Russian education clarify their historical landmarks.  A new <span>Federal State General Education Standard (GEF) is</span> being developed <span>.</span>  In accordance with it, the educational institution is called upon to guarantee the socialization of the new generation, its adequate entry into society. </p><p>  Such an imperative statement of strategic objectives brought to life a change in the didactic paradigm.  From the goals of mastering knowledge, abilities and skills (ZUN), which have dominated pedagogy for more than half a century, the task focus is shifted to a fundamentally new paradigm <strong>-</strong> systemic <strong>-</strong> activity. </p><p>  To date, the system <strong>-</strong> activity approach in elementary school has been practically implemented.  The time has come for transformations in elementary school. </p><p>  <strong>Semantic field for understanding PSD</strong> </p><p>  The system <strong>-</strong> activity approach (SDP) becomes a means of socialization.  It provides for joint and conscious actions of subjects of education in the process of appropriation of historical values ‚Äã‚Äãand traditions. </p><p>  The psychological aspect of education focuses on the cultivation of personal meanings, bearing values.  The space of their development, generation and transformation is the joint activity of pupils with adult mentors. </p><p>  The criterion of the educational process, in contrast to the educational process, is the motto of modern times: ‚ÄúIt is impossible to teach meaning.  It can only be raised. ‚Äù </p><p>  In the new concept of education, new dialectic opposites arise: standardization and variability. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A variable factor of education is a property that allows full manifestation of the abilities of students in groups, and also makes it possible to take into account the individual qualities of individual students. </p><p>  Education standardization is a system of limitations of variability.  The purpose of the restrictions is to ensure equal opportunities for the subjects of education in the educational process. </p><p>  <strong>The specifics of the PSD in the development of GEF</strong> </p><p>  The system <strong>-</strong> activity approach dictates a number of provisions that must be taken into account for the development of the GEF. </p><ul><li>  An individual can be understood only by observing the purposeful activity in which he is integrated, through which he develops, acts through which he lives. </li><li>  An adult, a child and his peers in a jointly divided activity create for each other and enrich the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe world.  It is it that allows a growing personality to solve the life problems of a wide range. </li><li>  The age stages of child development are characterized by the predominance of one or another <span>leading activity.</span>  It determines the individual characteristics of students depending on their age. </li><li>  A child can assimilate historically formed ways of human behavior, grow abilities, assimilate values ‚Äã‚Äãand social norms that have been verified by history only if he is included in purposeful and systematized activities. </li></ul><p>  <strong>GEF development analysis plans</strong> </p><p>  When designing the GEF, it is necessary to design an activity that forms an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe world, based on four plans for its successive analysis: </p><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  motivational value plan (MCP); </li><li>  target plan (CPU); </li><li>  operational plan (OP); </li><li>  Resource Plan (RP) </li></ol><p>  The system <strong>-</strong> activity approach requires taking these plans into account when developing sample education programs. </p><p>  Briefly about the specifics of each activity analysis plan. </p><p>  1. The specifics of the ICP - he answers the question: ‚ÄúWhy is this activity necessary?‚Äù. </p><p>  The answer gives a picture of the value guidelines on which the developing personality is based.  When designing a standard and sample programs, it is necessary to give priority attention to the worldview of the individual and the motivation for learning. </p><p>  The system-forming characteristic of the educational standard in the course of MCP analysis is the achievement of a personal result in training and education. </p><p>  2. The specifics of the CPU - it answers the question: "What is the direction of activity?" </p><p>  The answer gives a picture of the system of actions during which the <span>content of education</span> is assimilated <span>.</span>  When designing, it is necessary to pay attention to the cumulative use of <span>universal educational actions (UUD),</span> leading to a substantive learning outcome - an integral fundamental educational core. </p><p>  3. The specifics of the OP - he answers the question: "How are the actions?" </p><p>  The answer gives a picture containing specialized modes of action and operations.  With their help, skills are acquired that guarantee the completion of training activities. </p><p>  In any subject subject to assimilation, the goal of the learning action is a constant value, and the set of operations, including the technology of arriving at the result, is a variable. </p><p>  4. The specifics of the RP - he answers the question: ‚ÄúWhat is the account for the activity?‚Äù </p><p>  The answer gives a comprehensive picture of the resources, without which an effective course of training and education is impossible: financial, human resources, regulatory. </p><p>  The following factors influence the choice of resources: </p><ul><li>  the necessary objective result (the determining condition is the goal of the action); </li><li>  necessary personal result (the determining condition is the motive of activity). </li></ul><p>  Resources, as well as <span>educational technologies,</span> are variable components in its standard. </p><p>  <strong>Competence and ZUN</strong> </p><p>  The system <strong>-</strong> activity approach in education claims that ZUN is secondary to targeted educational activities.  They (ZUN) should be generated, applicable and stored, only on the basis of the conditions of purposeful activity. </p><p>  As for the quality of knowledge, it is also derived from the diversity of focused UUD. </p><p>  In the PSD, the competence of an individual is formed in the following order: "competence - activity - competence." </p><p>  Competency appears as knowledge in action.  It manifests itself in the ability to apply the acquired knowledge and skills to obtain effective results. </p><p>  The system <strong>-</strong> activity approach reunites in <span>pedagogical psychology,</span> methodology and didactics two fundamental historical approaches: the modern actual <span>competency approach</span> and the earlier, now secondary, based on ZUN. </p>
