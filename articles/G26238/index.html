    <h2>  Saint John Russian </h2><p>  This liturgical religious building was named after one of the most revered Orthodox saints and confessors.  Righteous John the Russian was born in Little Russia in 1690.  When he reached adulthood, he was drafted into the army of Peter the Great, in whose ranks he took part in the Russian-Turkish battle.  In the summer of 1711, during the <span>Prut campaign, a</span> soldier, in whose honor the Church of righteous John of Russia received its name, was captured.  After some time, he was transferred to Constantinople and sold into slavery to one of the leaders of the Turkish cavalry named Aga. </p><p>  In the daytime, John worked, fasted and prayed, and at night, when everyone went to bed, he went to a cave church located nearby.  Here he read prayers, and every Saturday he communicated.  While in the house near Aga, John performed several miracles, rumors of which spread far beyond the village.  And all the people living in the vicinity, even Muslim Turks, began to call this man nothing more than "led", which means "saint." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="temple of the righteous john russian" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11964/392407.jpg?1399623603392" width="308"></div></h2><h2>  The veneration of John of Russia in Russia </h2><p>  The face of the righteous John of Russia was officially included in 1962.  At the same time, his name as a saint was added to the calendar of the Orthodox Church.  In 2003, they began to build the Temple in Kuntsevo of John of Russia with the blessing of the Patriarch of Moscow Alexy.  It was the first in Russia small wooden religious building, erected in <span>honor of this</span> holy righteous.  Today, John of Russia is also given the lower aisle of the temple in Novosibirsk.  The latter was at one time built in honor of one of the most famous icons of the Mother of God under the name "Sign" of Abalatskaya. </p><h2>  General Information about the Temple </h2>

It was designed as a small wooden religious building in the architectural form of a ‚Äúshipbuilder‚Äù, typical of many Old Russian churches.  The ship symbolizes the Temple as a refuge for man in the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãlife.
