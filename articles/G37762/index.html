It is precisely this first reaction from visitors that Breathless Punta Cana Resort &amp; Spa (adults only) counts on.  In the name of the hotel there is the word "breless", which can be translated as "stop breathing."  Why should visitors have such a spasm? </p><p>  In this article we will give the most detailed description of the hotel, its rooms, infrastructure, beach.  In order not to be unfounded, we will confirm our story with reviews of tourists and real photos of this resort.  We‚Äôll immediately inform you that there is nothing to count on a family vacation: the hotel does not accept persons under 18 years of age.  It is intended for adults only. </p><h2>  Information for "package" tourists </h2><p>  Not used to planning your vacation?  Do you want to come to a travel agency and put on the shoulders of its employees all the worries about booking a hotel in Punta Cana (Dominican Republic)?  In this case, you will never be sent to the Bralessless Resort &amp; Spa 5 * hotel.  She is simply not on the list of Russian tour operators.  But an independent traveler can book it at the "Booking".  Read the current reviews about this hotel on the leading European tourist site Holidaycheck.  Breathless Punta Cana Resort &amp; Spa has a rather high rating there - 5.4 out of six points. </p><p>  In the reviews, Europeans (mainly Germans and Benelux residents) praise the hotel for its first-class service, luxurious rooms, delicious food and a stunning beach.  They call this hotel the best place in Punta Cana for a honeymoon or premarital romantic getaway.  But those who came here with a cheerful company of friends will also not be bored.  Indeed, in Bralessless Resort a great animation program.  Travelers report that the hotel is one of the newest in the resort.  Maybe that's why he is not too well-known to Russian tour operators? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="18.808584" data-lng="-68.58126099999998" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/5/9/4/17594.png"></div><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Hotel Breathless Punta Cana Resort &amp; Spa 5 * was opened in 2014.  The territory in her, as the photo shows, is quite large.  The map also shows the neighboring hotel - Nau Onyx.  Although it is not part of the Braceless Resort &amp; Spa, you can freely go there, spend time there and even have breakfast in its restaurant.  In Dominican hotels, the territory is often divided into zones for ordinary guests and VIP guests.  The hotel and Nau Onyx described by us are also no exception.  In the latter there is "Prefred Zone."  And when you check in at Bralessless Resort &amp; Spa, you are immediately offered to make a surcharge for accommodation at the Exhale Club.  What privileges this gives - we will tell later. </p><p>  The hotel consists of two long, perpendicular to the sea three-story buildings.  Between them passes the life of ordinary guests.  Two pools, eight restaurants, a tennis court, and sports grounds are concentrated in this space.  The VIP guest area is located on the outside of one of the buildings.  It focuses more on relaxing vacations.  For especially lazy guests, golf carts run around the hotel.  But tourists say they rarely used them, because the distances here are small.  The whole territory is landscaped and well-groomed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Breathless punta cana resort &amp; spa" class="if uuid-3223104" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3223104.jpg"></div><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  As noted above, the huge Breathless Punta Cana Resort &amp; Spa is divided into two zones.  Non-VIP guests are located in both buildings, but in those parts that are closer to the sea and away from noisy bars.  The rooms for ordinary guests are called the Allure Suite.  They are divided into categories depending on where the windows go - into the garden, pool or ocean. </p><p>  The rooms on the ground floor stand alone.  These suites have spacious terraces with sun loungers and direct access to the pool.  And the upper rooms are all with balconies.  Suites for guests of Exhale Club are also divided into categories depending on the type of windows: the pool and partly the sea.  The ground floor rooms also have direct access to the beach.  Especially worth noting are the more expensive categories of ‚Äúsuites‚Äù: ‚ÄúMaster‚Äù (with direct ocean views, a terrace with sun loungers, a spacious living room and two bathrooms) and ‚ÄúPresidential‚Äù (to everything else, there is also an equipped kitchen and dining room). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.expedia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Breathless Punta Cana Resort &amp; Spa 5 *" class="if uuid-3223106" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3223106.jpg"></div><h2>  What's in the room? </h2><p>  To realize the luxury of suites, let's analyze the content of the cheapest category of rooms.  Tourists say that all rooms of Breathless Punta Cana Resort &amp; Spa are fully consistent with the five-star status of the hotel.  Firstly, reviews often mention stylish design - bright, rich colors of the walls, mosaic on the ceiling, original architectural details.  Each room has a jacuzzi on the balcony (or terrace).  A hairdryer, a safe, a minibar, a flat-screen TV with satellite channels, air conditioning and a ceiling fan, bathrobes and slippers - all this you expect to see in the "five". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  But the rooms have something beyond the usual set.  For example, a device for drying air, because in the tropics of the Caribbean it is very humid.  Drinks and snacks from the minibar are replenished every day.  And the bathroom amenities are not simple, but Gilchrist &amp; Soames.  The furniture is complemented by garden furniture on the balcony, scales, an iron with an ironing board and other pleasant things. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sunwing.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Breathless Punta Cana Resort &amp; Spa - rooms" class="if uuid-3223115" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3223115.jpg"></div><h2>  VIP privileges </h2><p>  Now let's see if it is worth upgrading the service at Exhale Club.  The rooms for such guests have not only a more advantageous location, but also a number of other advantages.  This is increased comfort, a pillow menu, premium linen, luxury cosmetics, richer filling of the minibar.  These rooms are cleaned twice a day.  Guests can use the services of a butler. </p><p>  VIP Guest Service Concept at Breathless Punta Cana Resort &amp; Spa- Unlimited luxury.  Members of the Exhale Club have their own two swimming pools, a lounge area, a breakfast restaurant (with √† la carte service), a lounge with computers (use is free).  Throughout the day, such guests are offered drinks and snacks, and cocktails are served on a specially designated area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe beach.  After lunch, they are treated to tea and coffee with elite desserts in the VIP lounge.  Check-in to the rooms takes place for them out of turn, at a separate reception.  If for ordinary guests only local drinks are poured in bars for free, then foreign branded drinks are available for club members. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The Breathless Punta Cana Resort &amp; Spa has an all-inclusive concept for ordinary guests and Unlimited luxury for VIP guests.  Tourists report in reviews that you can have breakfast and lunch at the Nau Onyx Hotel.  Guests can dine at seven √† la carte restaurants.  These establishments specialize in cuisines of various countries: French, Italian, Caribbean, Lebanese, Mexican, Asian. </p><p>  There is also a Steak House, a tapas bar, a pastry shop with natural coffee and a wine cellar.  For ordinary guests to visit the √† la carte restaurant, a preliminary reservation is required.  A dress code is provided for all visitors at dinners (they simply will not let them in shorts, jeans and beach flip flops).  Don't want to change for lunch?  There is a cafe on the beach with steaks, burgers and other fast food.  In addition to restaurants and cafes, the hotel has 8 bars. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cheapcaribbean.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amenities at Breathless Punta Cana Resort &amp; Spa" class="if uuid-3223117" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3223117.jpg"></div><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Hotel Breathless Punta Cana Resort &amp; Spa is located on the first line.  Its own beach is beyond praise - tourists assure the reviews.  The sand is not just white and tiniest, but pearl.  Water in the sea - like on brochures.  There are plenty of sunbeds and umbrellas on the beach.  There is also ‚ÄúBali troubles‚Äù, but their use is paid.  On the beach there are constantly some kind of recreational activities. </p><p>  Animators are completely unobtrusive, but if you are fed up with passive rest, then they definitely will not let you get bored.  VIP guests relax in their area.  Since they use the concept of "Unlimited luxury", bar staff constantly come up to them with questions about whether guests are willing to drink something.  The bottom is sandy, without pebbles and corals.  The beach is cleaned every hour. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.firstchoice.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Breathless Punta Cana Resort &amp; Spa: beach" class="if uuid-3223120" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3223120.jpg"></div><h2>  Pools and spa services </h2><p>  Hotel Breathless Punta Cana Resort &amp; Spa 5 * has six artificial ponds for swimming.  Two of them are reserved only for members of the VIP club.  Of the remaining four pools, two are adapted for outdoor activities, and 2 - for relaxation.  Tourists recall in their reviews that there are "floating bars" and areas where you can lie on sun loungers directly in the water. </p><p>  There are also hydromassage elements in the pools.  And this despite the fact that each room has a jacuzzi on the terrace / balcony.  In addition, a few words should be said about the Pivonia spa.  There is a whole complex of baths, various massage rooms, thalassotherapy procedures, a beauty salon, a lounge for relaxation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="holidayplace.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Breathless Punta Cana Resort &amp; Spa Reviews" class="if uuid-3223122" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3223122.jpg"></div><h2>  Amenities at Breathless Punta Cana Resort &amp; Spa (adults only) </h2><p>  The concept of the hotel "18+" allows guests to have fun in an adult way.  On the territory there are many lounges and themed cafes, where the fun lasts up to three nights.  Every morning, a poster for the events of the day is available at the reception, and you can choose your own entertainment to your liking - Latin dance classes, a kayaking tour, scuba diving, magicians, a win-win lottery or an incendiary foam disco.  For a fee, you can book horseback riding, helicopter flight or sea fishing. </p><p>  The hotel has a casino where the evening flies like a blink of an eye.  The hotel positions itself as a holiday destination for the newlyweds.  Here you can often see symbolic wedding ceremonies.  But the hotel also pays great attention to outdoor activities.  Here you can rent a bicycle, kayak, snorkeling equipment for free, play billiards, tennis and table tennis, and work out in the gyms. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Breathless Punta Cana Resort &amp; Spa (adults only)" class="if uuid-3223119" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3223119.jpg"></div><h2>  Breathless Punta Cana Resort &amp; Spa: reviews </h2><p>  About 90 percent of hotel guests are Americans.  There are still citizens of Western Europe.  In general, everything here is aimed at ensuring that each guest is satisfied.  Therefore, the administration was able to masterfully combine fun parties and an atmosphere of complete relaxation.  Tourists liked the location of the hotel.  It is located not in Punta Cana itself, but in the beautiful tourist area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe resort of Uvero Alto.  Guests are invited to take a trip to San Juan Shopping Center and Manati Natural Park. </p><p>  If you have a birthday or wedding anniversary, do not hesitate to inform this at the reception upon arrival.  The hotel will prepare you a very pleasant surprise.  For cleaning in the rooms, on the territory and on the beach, no one had any complaints.  All staff are very smiling and friendly.  Reception staff speak excellent not only Spanish, but also English.  Many tourists said they would recommend this hotel to their friends. </p>
