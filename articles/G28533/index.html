Today, this is really a decent amount, which can be enough for a penthouse, a dozen good apartments or several dozen expensive and high-quality cars.  In general, 1 million dollars is the annual budget of many cities.  In general, what would you buy for such a huge amount?  Would you buy headphones for that amount? </p><h2>  The most expensive Beats By Dre headphones by Graff Diamonds </h2><div class="photo" data-original="baybloorradio.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Inlay of diamonds on headphones" class="if uuid-2394705" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76803/2394705.jpg"></div><p>  Yes, it didn‚Äôt seem to you!  We are talking about ordinary, but at the same time not quite ordinary, headphones.  In the photo - the most expensive headphones for 1 million dollars (57.5 million rubles.).  It is worth noting that this accessory exists in only one instance.  The most expensive headphones were first seen in February 2012 at a concert by LMFAO with Madonna.  The soloist of the band LMFAO Sky Blu performed with them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="o.canada.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LMFAO Band Concert with Madonna" class="if uuid-2394703" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76803/2394703.jpg"></div><p>  I wonder what it is like to perform at a concert, jump and dance, knowing that the most expensive headphones in the world hang on your neck?  An interesting point is that at this concert the joint song of Madonna, Sky Blue and Redfoo was presented, but this song was not remembered by anyone.  In the same way as the concert itself, despite the huge number of special effects and advertising hype.  Pop stars were overshadowed by just one accessory.  These headphones subsequently became the subject of many discussions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Why exactly 1 million dollars? </h2><p>  The ‚Äúneighbor‚Äù in the price category for these most expensive headphones is the Sennheiser Orpheus model, which, in turn, costs $ 30,000 (1.7 million rubles).  Therefore, the question arises - where does such a huge difference in price come from?  In fact, everything is simple - the side panels of the headphones are encrusted with 114 carat diamonds.  Graff Diamonds claims that because of this ‚Äúfeature‚Äù, a person in such headphones will hear all the sounds in a special tone and with a special sound.  Unfortunately, verifying this statement is not possible for obvious reasons.  During all this time, only a few people had the opportunity to enjoy music, the sound of which was emphasized by noble gems. </p><p>  The headphones themselves are made in white.  The logo of the manufacturer is inlaid with red diamonds, all the others are painted white.  In addition to this, the ear pads in these headphones are made of a special membrane material that prevents the skin from sweating.  This is a really useful property, because it‚Äôs hard not to sweat when you have 1 million dollars on your head. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.howtomakeit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beats By Dre by Graff Diamonds" class="if uuid-2394712" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76803/2394712.jpg"></div><h2>  How to purchase this accessory </h2><p>  If suddenly you had a desire to purchase the most expensive headphones, then here you will find a slight disappointment: for obvious reasons, these headphones are not in mobile stores and even in Beat By Dre branches.  You can‚Äôt buy them on the Internet either.  The only way to purchase such headphones is to win the Special Event auction from Graff Diamonds.  Starting price is $ 1 million.  But the actual purchase price depends on other bidders.  You may have to ‚Äúfinish off‚Äù a couple of tens of thousands of dollars to win the auction.  Although, to be honest, there will not be so many participants, if we take into account the fact that since 2012 these headphones do not have a specific owner. </p>
