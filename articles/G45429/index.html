    <p>  For a craftswoman who knows how to handle yarn, knitting a skirt for a girl with knitting needles (with or without a description) is not a problem.  If the model is relatively simple, it can be completed in just a few days. </p><h2>  Material selection </h2><p>  Before buying yarn, you should determine the purpose of the product.  There are winter, summer and demi-season skirts for girls with knitting needles.  The description, which is usually attached to the model, can be checked, but do not blindly follow it.  You need to understand the properties and characteristics of different materials. </p><p>  The main characteristics of the yarn are: </p><ul><li>  Composition. </li><li>  Thickness. </li><li>  Metric area. </li></ul><p>  The more natural fiber in a strand, the better.  The ideal option is yarn, which consists entirely of cotton, wool or includes both of these components.  For example, it is better to take soft wool (100%) or wool with cotton (50/50%) to knit <span>warm skirts</span> for girls with knitting needles.  You need to be careful with the description of the pattern - you should choose only solid ornaments. </p><p>  The role of emollient can also play bamboo, linen or silk.  Of course, when there is acrylic in the composition, yarn will cost less.  But it is worth remembering that acrylic is a synthetic fiber.  It does not absorb moisture and does not retain heat, but it contributes to sweating. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A compromise can be threads in which the acrylic content is small: not more than 50%. </p><p>  For summer and demi-season products, those types of yarn that contain only cotton, linen and bamboo or the same components together with acrylic are well suited. </p><p>  It is easiest to knit from yarn of medium thickness with an average density, for example 250-350 m / 100 grams. </p><h2>  Training </h2><p>  The photo below shows a universal model of a skirt.  It can be knitted from almost any yarn, and it can be worn for any reason.  In addition, such a product is easy to recount for a larger size.  It is enough to increase the number of rapports (repeating parts of the circuit) and the total length. </p>

    <p>  The drawing shows the dimensions for the manufacture of five options for skirts.  The smallest is 28 cm long and the longest is 53 cm. To determine the right numbers, you should take measurements from the child who will wear the finished skirt. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Then you need to knit a small fragment of the selected yarn in order to calculate the density of the future fabric.  Each craftswoman will have this indicator, as the numbers depend on the thickness of the thread and the characteristics of the knitter. </p><p>  The finished sample is measured in width and height.  Then calculate how many loops (P) you need to dial to form the first row (P).  For example, if 10 P of a sample contains 22 P, then for knitting a fabric with a width of 47 cm, you need to dial 103 P. </p><p>  Depending on her skills, the craftswoman can choose a way to work in a circular fashion or in straight and return rows.  Both methods are convenient.  The following describes <span>how to knit a skirt</span> for a girl with knitting needles with a description of a circular canvas.  However, if there is concern that the calculations performed are incorrect, it is better to work with two parts (front and back).  This way you can quickly identify and fix the error. </p><h2>  The main stages: how to knit a skirt for a girl with knitting needles (with description) </h2><p>  On circular knitting needles, loop for the first row, the length of which should be equal to the bottom line of the product. </p><p>  Next, the first circular P is performed: all P are knitted with facial ones (Lits. P). </p><p>  To exclude folding of the edge, it is worth knitting a few R. with a garter pattern. </p><p>  Then the canvas is divided into wedges.  Depending on the size of the product, the number of wedges will be different: 14-15-16-18-20 (relative to the dimensions indicated on the pattern). </p><p>  Each wedge is separated from the neighboring by a longitudinal scar, which is knitted according to the scheme (in the figure next to the pattern).  Based on this ornament, it is possible to make different versions of the skirt for the girl with knitting needles: the schemes and description are universal. </p><p>  The main fabric is a hosiery knit: on the front side of the faces.  P, with the wrong side - Izn.  P. If desired, the craftswoman can replace this elementary ornament with a more complex one. </p><p>  The canvas is knitted from the bottom up, in the process, the wedges narrow.  At the last stage, gum and lace are performed. </p><h2>  Knit volumetric hem </h2><p>  As shown in the diagram, the volume boundary between the wedges does not affect the change in the number of loops in the rows of the canvas.  In this pattern, balance is maintained: in the first row, the yarn is made (that is, one element is added), but in the third row, one loop is shortened. </p><p>  In more detail about knitting a hem: </p><ol><li>  Persons.  P, yarn, Persons.  P. On the needles 3 P. </li><li>  All P according to drawing (Izn. P).  On the needles 3 P. </li><li>  The first P is transferred to the right knitting needle, the next two are knitted together, the first P is transferred to the left knitting needle and put on P obtained from the second and third.  On the needles 2 P. </li><li>  All  by drawing.  On the needles 2 P. </li></ol><p>  Next, you need to follow the above algorithm (from point 1 to point 4). </p><h2>  How to narrow the skirt </h2><p>  The loops in the wedges are reduced due to the successive decrease near the hem: </p><ol><li>  At a height of 3-5 cm from the set edge, cut one P on the left side of each wedge.  This means that after almost all P wedges are completed, the last two need to be knitted with one. </li><li>  At a height of 6-10 cm from the edge of the product, it is required to reduce one P on the right side of each wedge.  When the scar is completed, the first two Ps of each wedge should be tied with one Person.  P. </li></ol><p>  Abbreviations should be repeated at specified intervals.  If you ignore the staggered order of contractions and constantly remove P only to the right or only to the left, the wedges will have a spiral shape. </p><h2>  Knitting skirt for girls (with description) </h2><p>  To keep the product firmly on the child‚Äôs waist, you should tie a belt.  Width can vary depending on your own preferences.  The described model is decorated with a wide belt made with 1: 1 elastic. </p><p>  This part of the work needs to be done especially diligently and tightly.  Thinner knitting needles can be used to make the elastic really elastic. </p><p>  This model is designed to fill a blouse in it.  And girls like such knitted skirts with knitting needles (with diagrams and description).  Various cords threaded through a knitted fabric look good.  This decoration also performs a practical function - it holds the skirt at the waist. </p><p>  The cord is usually knitted from the same thread from which the product itself is connected.  You can thread it between the loops of elastic or make a row with special holes: * two P knit together, double crochet *.  Repeat the sequence from * to * to the end of the row. </p><p>  For those who wish to try their hand at a more difficult test, another model is proposed. </p>
