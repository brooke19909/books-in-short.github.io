Its roots go back to France in the 19th century, when in almost all gambling establishments in Paris they played vingt-et-un, which translates from French as "twenty-one."  Blackjack rules are also widely known in Russia.  But in our country, the game has a different name: "twenty-one", or "point".  Undoubtedly, more than one generation played in it: both your grandparents, and your parents, and you. </p>

    <p>  In popularity, blackjack is not inferior to all known poker.  It's all about the simplicity of the game.  Blackjack rules are quite simple and very fast and easy to digest.  And at the same time, this game is very exciting and dynamic.  Therefore, it is "cut" not only in all land-based casinos, but also online. </p><p>  <strong>Blackjack Rules</strong> </p><p>  The goal of this game is to win.  And to become a winner, you need to score as many points as possible.  As a result, you should get <span>the highest number of</span> points of all the players, but not more than 21. If you crossed this line, they automatically flew out. </p><p>  Before the start of the game, players make their bets.  Then it‚Äôs the turn of the dealer.  He must give everyone playing two cards.  The dealer himself - with open cards: one or two.  After the cards are in the hands of the players, they take turns making decisions. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <ul><li>  if you have two identical cards in your hands, they can be divided; </li><li>  if enough points are scored, you can stop; </li><li>  you can take an additional card, but in this case you lose your bet.  If one of the players draws a card, another new participant is added, and the limit of points scored is increased by 1 (i.e. = 22); </li><li>  you can take a card without losing your bet (for this you need to double the bet); </li><li>  cards can be dealt, but in this case you will lose half your bet. </li></ul><p>  <strong>Blackjack Rules: Card / Score Ratio</strong> </p><ol><li>  Small cards from 2 to 10 are respectively equal from 2 to 10 points. </li><li>  The king, queen and jack are valued at 10 points each. </li><li>  Ace is harder.  If the amount of your cards in your hands is up to 21 points, the ace will add as many as 11 points, if the amount is more than 21, then the ace will add 1 point. </li><li>  <span>The card suits</span> in blackjack do not matter. </li></ol><p>  Blackjack rules provide for some nuances that are possible in the game: </p><ol><li><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="blackjack game" class="if" height="425" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15681/297484.jpg" width="580"></div>  <em>Blackjack combination</em> .  After the cards have been dealt, the player is holding one of the following combinations: ace and 10, ace and jack, ace and queen, or ace and king.  The lucky one immediately gains the required number of points - 21. He receives a win - his bet increased by one and a half times.  The remaining players have the right to take an additional card or not to do this and stay at their own points. </li><li>  <em>The combination of "Push"</em> .  This is a situation where at the end of the game the opponents have the same amount of points.  As a result, each of the players will remain with their bets. </li><li>  <em>Blackjack at the dealer</em> .  In this situation, the loser is everyone who did not get 21 points.  Here it is necessary to stipulate in advance: either the prize is divided in half between the winners, or all will remain with their bets. </li><li>  <em>The combination of "777"</em> : if the player dials 21 using three sevens.  Usually a bonus is given for such a combination. </li></ol><p>  Remember that blackjack is a game that does not forgive mistakes and requires thought out strategies.  But then she certainly will never go out of fashion! </p>
