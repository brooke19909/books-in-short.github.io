    <h2>  Beaches: Tuapse district (Lermontovo village) </h2><p>  Despite the fact that Lermontovo is a small village, there are two large beaches.  One, as they call it, is central, and the second - with the more attractive and alluring name ‚ÄúGolden Coast‚Äù, is practically Bulgaria.  A distinctive feature of the Central Beach is that, despite its popularity among the local population, it is rarely possible to meet large masses of people here.  It is often quiet and very spacious.  Perhaps this is due to the fact that a beach with a length of two kilometers can accommodate too many people, without limiting the place.  It also matters that the beach is quite wide.  Be sure to visit the village.  Lermontovo (Tuapse district).  Photos can be seen in this article. </p>

    <p>  This beach is able to satisfy both lovers of sandy beaches and those who are partial to pebble beaches.  The peculiarity of the beach is that it consists of several sections where small pebbles turn into sand spits.  The entrance to the sea is gentle and without cliffs, with a gradual increase in depth.  The decoration of the central beach is undoubtedly the beautiful promenade, walking along which you can buy for yourself a memorable souvenir about a wonderful holiday in Lermontovo.  If you are tired of constant sunbathing and swimming, you can rent a catamaran or boat and swim away from the coast.  There is also the opportunity to try yourself in extreme water activities. </p><h2>  Camping and the private sector </h2><p>  Moving smoothly from one beach to the second, it is worth saying that the "Golden Coast" is located at some distance from the center.  Here is the relative number of vacationers.  Perhaps this is due to the fact that the beach is less landscaped.  You can get to this place by bus or car.  Here you will not find either beach entertainment or an amusement park.  But to the delight of car travelers, car camping is here.  It is very convenient for those who are accustomed to rest as a savage, and also like to spend the night in a tent on the <span>seashore.</span>  However, it is worth noting that the cost of living in a car camp is much higher than in the private sector, so it is prudent to rent a room than to overpay. </p>
