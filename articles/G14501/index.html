    <p>  Aerated concrete is one of the new building materials.  It is lightweight and easy to use.  This allows you to significantly speed up and simplify the process of <span>building construction.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Aerated concrete belongs to the category of environmentally friendly materials.

Buildings up to 4 floors high are erected from it.  It is a strong, reliable material. </p><h2>  Turnkey construction </h2><p>  The construction companies that exist today offer typical prefabricated <span>aerated concrete house designs.</span>  <span>The construction cost</span> in this case is easier to determine.

    <p>  Before concluding an agreement with the organization, it is necessary to consider all the nuances of the construction.  In documentary form, the timing of each stage should be agreed.  Many companies provide a standard project to their customers for free.  This is normal practice. </p><p>  At the same time, the contract may include the cost of geodetic reconnaissance of the area, the conclusion of contracts with organizations providing utilities, etc. As a rule, the client can choose materials for decoration, express wishes regarding the design of the premises, facade, site, etc. d. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What affects the cost? </h2><p>  <span>The approximate cost of building a house from aerated concrete</span> can be provided to the client at the planning stage of the construction of the selected project building.
