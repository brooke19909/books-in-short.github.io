The dishes are sustained in the best Russian traditions of the 19th century. </p><p>  The hotel staff receives only the most flattering reviews.  Tourists appreciated the attentive and friendly attitude, unobtrusive service, prompt solution of minor problems that arose during the stay. </p><p>  Many guests find the acceptable cost of accommodation (approximately 2500-7500 rubles / day), noting the excellent price / quality ratio. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travelata.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="19th century style interior" class="if uuid-2572515" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56278/2572515.jpg"></div><h2>  There are always dissatisfied </h2><p>  Despite the very high rating of the hotel (4.92 out of 5 possible), there were guests whose accommodation caused a number of complaints.  Some visitors were unhappy with the too dark and gloomy rooms.  Indeed, the interior rooms, named after the characters of the novel by Dostoevsky ("Katerina", "Netochka Nezvanova"), turn out to be an "amateur". </p><p>  Not surprisingly, the business hotel has absolutely nothing to entertain children.  However, couples note this as a drawback.  In other reviews, they were skeptical and suspicious of breakfasts, guessing yesterday's products in them.  Soundproofing in the rooms was not very good. </p><h2>  Summarize </h2><p>  If you are planning a business trip or just a trip to St. Petersburg for sightseeing, then you should pay attention to the described hotel.  Convenient location in a quiet location near the historical center of the Northern capital, high-quality food, excellent number of rooms, a wide range of services are the main advantages of this accommodation facility.  A small but comfortable hotel will leave only positive emotions about a trip to St. Petersburg (this is verified information compiled from numerous reviews of real hotel customers over the past 2-3 years). </p>
