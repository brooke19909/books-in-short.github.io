    <p>  In fact, there are many more historical and cultural monuments in the city and its environs than it seems at first glance.  Here you can see the Sharavsinsky Caravanserai, the Nymphaeum Monumental Fountain, as well as the Port Bathhouse, Arched Gate and the Bishop's Palace. </p><h2>  How much does it cost to relax at the hotel? </h2><p>  Of course, cost is one of the most important issues for any traveler.  And it is worth noting that the hotel complex Lake River Side Hotel Spa is famous not only for its high level of comfort, but also at relatively affordable prices.  Of course, it all depends on the date of booking and arrival, as well as some other factors.  But on average, the cost of a day at the hotel will cost about 2500-3500 rubles, including good nutrition.  For example, a triple standard room costs 9600 per day.  And do not forget that some services of the hotel complex, including excursions, are paid separately. </p><h2>  Hotel complex Lake River <span>(Turkey): reviews of</span> Russian tourists </h2><p>  It is worth noting that this hotel is very popular among compatriots - every year the number of Russian tourists here is increasing.  And the reviews for the luxury Lake River Side Hotel 5 are for the most part positive.  Perhaps, from time to time, travelers have some not too pleasant situations, but these are trifles compared to the offered range of services and living conditions. </p><p>  The rooms here are really comfortable, and you won‚Äôt have to complain about the work of the maids.  Special thanks to customers telling local chefs that the restaurant always has enough food that is distinguished by excellent taste.  In addition, kitchen workers every day try to pamper guests with something new. </p><p>  As for the employees, they are all polite and helpful.  Most of the employees understand the Russian language quite well, so there will be no communication problems.  Moreover, they are always ready to help in case of difficulties. </p><p>  The only drawbacks are the long distance to the beach.  On the other hand, the Mediterranean Sea is worth all efforts.  But the huge advantage of Lake River Hotel Spa is its relatively affordable cost. </p>
