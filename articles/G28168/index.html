He is known for creating the largest collection of domestic cars in the open air, in which there are already more than 300 copies.  Among them are many rare and collectible models.  However, many are still ambiguous about its exposure, arguing that it is: a unique museum or an ordinary dump.  Indeed, on the one hand, he saved many cars from destruction at scrap metal collection points, and on the other, he himself set up a dump of once rare cars under the scorching sun and snow.  In this article we will talk about the collector himself and his collection, which many call the cemetery of Soviet cars. </p><h2>  Biography </h2><div class="photo" data-original="prohorov.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mikhail Krasinets" class="if uuid-3158705" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3158705.jpg"></div><p>  Now Mikhail Krasinets is a pensioner.  Previously, he was a race car driver, lived in Moscow, worked as a mechanic at the Lenin Komsomol Automobile Plant, now better known as Moskvich. </p><p>  He began to collect a unique collection of Soviet cars back in the 90s.  The turning point in the biography of Mikhail Yuryevich Krasinets was 1993, when the hero of our article quit the factory where the problems started.  Together with his wife, he sold an apartment and moved to the village of Chernousovo, located in the Tula region. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This is a very small settlement, in which, according to the All-Russian population census, only five people live.  It is located 7 kilometers from the village of Krasivka, which is considered the rural administrative center, and 7 kilometers from the urban village called Chern.  The village is located in the south-east of the Tula region, near the border with the Bryansk region. </p><h2>  Way </h2><p>  As recognized by visitors who saw with their own eyes the collection of Mikhail Yuryevich Krasinets, getting to this place is not easy even now.  Not to mention the state of the roads in these places in the early 90s. </p><p>  You have to go on the highway M2 "Crimea".  A short route to the Mikhail Krasinets Autoschool passes through Ugot ', as another landmark - the small village of Millionnaya for several houses.  The road leaves much to be desired: first it is concrete slabs, shabby with life and time, and then a usual primer, sometimes with a deep and hard-to-drive track. </p><p>  Most cars will be able to get on this route only in dry weather.  If it rains heavily, there is a risk of sitting down, for example, when descending to a bridge over a river.  There is an easier way to this place - through the villages of Bredikhino and Donok, but it is much longer. </p><h2>  Museum foundation </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.interesmir.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum of Mikhail Krasinets" class="if uuid-3158698" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3158698.jpg"></div><p>  Mikhail Yuryevich Krasinets says that the money from the sale of a Moscow apartment in 1993 he ran out in just three months.  For $ 150-200, he actively bought cars from demolished garages that were on the site of the construction of the Third Transport Ring.  Today they form almost the basis of his collection. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Mikhail Krasinets Museum itself turned out to be divided into two unequal parts.  Most cars today are in the open air field.  The most valuable and rare are located on the inside of a private house of the collector himself. </p><p>  Now Mikhail Krasinets is buying new copies solely on donations left by museum visitors.  It guarantees that without exception, all money goes to replenish the collection.  At the same time, it is recognized that living on a single pension is not easy, but he tries to stay above social and domestic problems.  He puts a lot of work into the preservation of his museum. </p><p>  It takes a lot of time and effort to maintain such a huge collection, but there are so many cars that external factors still have a very negative effect on most. </p><h2>  Highlights Collection </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.gazeta.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Criticism of Mikhail Krasinets" class="if uuid-3158704" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3158704.jpg"></div><p>  There are many truly unique specimens in the Mikhail Krasinets Museum in Chernousovo.  For example, the ancient GAZ M-20, on which in the past, Soviet police officers traveled.  Its appearance may be well known to many of the detective films of the Soviet Union.  It is interesting that the copy presented in the collection of Mikhail Krasinets was in private hands, was never on the balance sheet of state structures. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The museum ranger improves some of the cars on his own.  For example, as Mikhail Krasinets tells us, he found Pobeda in one of Moscow's yards in 1998 and delivered it to Chernousovo on his own, and here he made the inscription ‚ÄúORUD Police‚Äù with a brush.  Law enforcement officers also moved on such machines in Soviet times.  Mikhail Yuryevich painted one of the rare Volga cars under a rally car. </p><h2>  Seagulls </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.interesmir.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Car Museum in Chernousovo" class="if uuid-3158700" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3158700.jpg"></div><p>  Two ‚ÄúSeagulls‚Äù are considered to be the special pride of the Mikhail Krasinets Museum in Chernousovo - these are the GAZ-13 and GAZ-14 models.  It is believed that this was the first executive car in the history of the Soviet automobile industry.  Its design is in the style of the then popular "Detroit Baroque."  Such cars were produced from 1959 to 1979.  In total, a little more than 3 thousand were produced.  In the museum you can admire a chic sedan with an automatic transmission.  In Soviet times, such a car was a truly unique thing.  Now he sagged a lot, the paint peeled off.  But even now, "The Seagull" is able to impress.  The interior has been preserved much better; it is in almost perfect condition.  Museum visitors can not only inspect the exhibits, but also sit behind the wheel. </p><p>  The second "Seagull" from this collection represents a sample of the GAZ-14 model.  This is another "limousine", a later assembly, but not so elegant.  They were produced at the Gorky Automobile Plant from 1977 to 1988, having managed to produce more than a thousand cars. </p><h2>  "Volga" and "Victory" </h2><p>  The museum is widely represented cars of the brands "Victory" and "Volga".  Among the unique exhibits, there are several rare specimens of the GAZ-21 from the very first series with the famous star on the grille.  Nearby are rare Volga with springs and front axles. </p><p>  The collection contains many Moskvich cars from a factory where Krasinets himself worked for many years.  For example, a convertible with a steering wheel from Opel.  Such copies were produced only until 1953, so this one is really rare and unique. </p><h2>  Cars with a story </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.drive2.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Collection of Mikhail Krasinets" class="if uuid-3158699" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3158699.jpg"></div><p>  Only in this museum you can see the only surviving "Moskvich 3-5-5".  Only three of these were built, intended for state testing.  This is a wide machine with a spring suspension, an original gearbox and a 1.7-liter engine.  It was assumed that this prototype will become the Moskvich 2140 model during the transition to mass production, but the project was never implemented. </p><p>  The story of the appearance of this rare "Muscovite" in the Museum of Krasinets is very interesting.  For a long time he stood at the back of the AZLK.  In 1994, when they were actively getting rid of everything superfluous and unnecessary, they were even going to cut it into metal.  Then the collector managed to agree on the transfer of the Moskvich to him in exchange for a used motor from the Volga. </p><p>  This story is the exception rather than the rule.  Krasinets rarely exchanges cars, as a rule, buys them for money.  From his own collection fundamentally does not sell anything.  He admits that offers to him have been received repeatedly, but he firmly stands his ground, believing that everything that got into the museum should remain in him. </p><h2>  Auto in the open field </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.drive2.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cars of Mikhail Krasinets" class="if uuid-3158702" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3158702.jpg"></div><p>  The principle of character in many respects determined the fate and biography of Mikhail Krasinets.  Many argue with his position, especially since the refusal to sell cars from his collection leads to the fact that many of them rust, stand in a field overgrown with grass above human height.  The collector has to keep track of such a large fleet of vehicles almost single-handedly, so there‚Äôs simply no time left. </p><p>  Moreover, some of the exhibits during this time were plundered.  Of course, most cars are not on the move, but body elements, headlights, and interior parts are massively removed from them.  All this is a sad, even frightening sight.  Moreover, the pattern is very simple: the farther the car is from the house of Mikhail Yuryevich himself, the more deplorable is his condition. </p><p>  At the same time, in the open field there are also significant, rare and unique exhibits that could take their rightful place in any automobile museum in the world.  In Chernousovo, the state of the machines is depressing; they continue to die in the open without leaving.  For example, in the field there is a sports model ‚ÄúMoskvich-2140‚Äù from the ‚ÄúRally‚Äù series, which once belonged to the famous domestic racer Sergey Shipilov.  In the late 90s, Krasinets bought it for about $ 200.  Today, her condition and appearance are very depressing. </p><h2>  Cemetery of old cars </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.gazeta.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Car Museum of Mikhail Krasinets in Chernousovo" class="if uuid-3158703" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3158703.jpg"></div><p>  Most of the exposition, located today in an open field, is more like a grand art object than a museum.  Many recall the infamous cemetery of old cars in the US state of Georgia. </p><p>  Also a popular place for tourists, for the entrance to which you have to pay $ 25.  Mikhail Yuryevich has no fixed fee.  Each visitor leaves as much money as he sees fit. </p><h2>  Collector criticism </h2><p>  The museum and Krasinets himself are often criticized.  Moreover, discontent is expressed not only by ordinary visitors, but even his friends and relatives.  The main complaint is that in his field, Mikhail Yuryevich has actually destroyed many rare cars that could be of great interest to collectors, tell a lot about the history of the Soviet automobile industry.  Bringing them to his museum, Krasinets is not engaged in their restoration, but simply leaves them on the street.  Many consider this approach simply unacceptable. </p><p>  At the same time, it is worth recognizing that if there weren‚Äôt this auto enthusiast, many of these cars would have long been scrapped, especially in the 90s, when nobody needed them at all.  Therefore, disputes about what to consider the collection of Krasinets: a cemetery of old cars, an art object or a museum, continue to this day. </p><h2>  Attempts to restore individual models </h2><p>  Moreover, it is known that Krasinets still tried to restore certain models of his cars, but nothing good came of it. </p><p>  It is known that Mikhail Yuryevich made attempts to restore the legendary SMZ S-3A.  This is a two-seater motorcycle stroller manufactured at the Serpukhov motorcycle plant from 1958 to 1970. </p><p>  According to experts, nothing happened.  The car was not only terribly painted, but it also turned out that its headlights were not assembled correctly, one of the parts was inserted upside down. </p><p>  A serious complaint against the collector lies in the fact that he is not even able to install an elementary fence in order to enclose his rare specimens.  As a result, those cars that did not go for processing in the 90s were plundered in parts by residents of neighboring villages who had unhindered access to the field. </p><p>  Most believe that anyone else on the site of Krasinets would have long ago built a profitable museum of a European level.  However, Mikhail Yuryevich does not want to or cannot do this.  As a result, the unique exhibits continue to rust and rot. </p>
