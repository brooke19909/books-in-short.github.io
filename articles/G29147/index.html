You need to research a tremendous amount of information in order to choose a suitable developer for yourself.  A construction company must have an impeccable reputation.  After all, there is always a risk of losing your savings.  Therefore, it is important to responsibly approach the issue of selecting a suitable project.  Everything plays a role: the location of the facility, the current progress of construction, the availability of all permits, the planned layout of the apartments, the presence of decoration or its absence, the cost of apartments, the transport accessibility of the facility, the presence of parking, the level of development of the district‚Äôs infrastructure and its improvement, as well as reviews of real customers or residents of the house (provided that you buy an apartment after the completion of the project). </p><p>  This article is intended to help you navigate all this abundance of information.

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The main thing that pleases equity holders: LCD "Battleship" was built on time.  The delay was only in some cases and amounted to only 21 days.  The pace of construction was peppy, the project was not idle.  LCD "Linkor" reviews are called an excellent option for a number of reasons.  Many people like spacious rooms designed in layouts.  Residents also like the attractive appearance of the buildings, the protected area, closed courtyards, where private vehicles will not be able to get into (therefore, you can not worry about the safety of your children when walking).  Infrastructure in the area is actively developing.  Small difficulties with transport are more than compensated by the excellent environmental situation in the area.  If we consider the new buildings of St. Petersburg, then this project is definitely recommended to pay attention to.  He completely fascinated many. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Most of the negative feedback about the LCD "Linkor" is associated with the quality of the interior decoration.  Residents say windows leak during bad weather, elevators look extremely unreliable, and their ceilings are mostly broken.  Decorating the apartments LCD "Linkor" also leaves much to be desired.  Although the apartments were completely renovated, tenants say that the materials used cannot be called high-quality and acceptable for use in residential premises.  Many believe that the floors are skewed, which means that buildings could be erected in violation of official standards.  Perhaps this is not the case in all cases, but the problem is obvious.  Others are surprised by uncomfortable layouts with prohibitively large kitchens or corridors with a modest area of ‚Äã‚Äãbedrooms.  Such statements make you think about whether to buy housing in a new building of the KVS company or to look for opportunities for a more reliable investment. </p>

    <h2>  Construction progress </h2><p>  This item will reveal one of the main unique features that characterize the developer on the positive side: the project was completed on time.  Most of the housing complex LCD "Battleship" were populated on schedule.  And only a few noted delays, which, however, were very insignificant compared with delays of other real estate companies (and amounted to only three weeks).  Thus, the project was fully completed and commissioned in the third quarter of 2015. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  All improvement of the adjacent territory of RC ‚ÄúBattleship‚Äù KVS planned in advance.  Already in the quarter there is a sufficient number of various social facilities necessary for a pleasant and, most importantly, comfortable living in this housing complex.  Among them, the following are distinguished: medical centers and preschool institutions, drugstores and secondary schools, gas stations, boutiques, cafeterias, car dealerships, beauty salons, restaurants, shopping and entertainment centers, cinemas, gyms and much more. </p><p>  Not far from the buildings of the housing complex under consideration are motorways that allow you to get directly to St. Petersburg in a short time, both with the help of personal vehicles and public transport. </p><p>  Availability of places for a comfortable stay and a good location in terms of natural landscapes is also important for real estate investors.  The housing complex under consideration is a model quarter according to the above characteristics.  Nearby are many green areas with great places to relax.  The <span>Duderhof Canal</span> and the Gulf of Finland are nearby. </p>

    <h2>  Beautification </h2><p>  The <span>residential complex</span> under consideration occupies a significant territory, which the developer has landscaped and ennobled in order to make residents as comfortable and comfortable as possible to live there.  Now there is the opportunity to play sports.  Playgrounds are also equipped.  Soon, benches with lighting lamps along pedestrian alleys will be installed.  For residents and their guests equipped with excellent parking for cars (both ground and underground).  In the latter, you can descend directly from the entrance, which is not only comfortable, but also significantly saves time. </p><p>  KVS was actively engaged in the improvement of not only the apartments themselves, but also the plots adjacent to the residential buildings.  Each of the buildings is equipped with a reliable and modern security system, and surveillance cameras are installed not only outside the house, but also inside it.  All this ensures the safety and peace of all who live in the quarter under consideration.  Each of the halls is equipped with a modern silent elevator.  Its main characteristics are accelerated movement, as well as significantly increased carrying capacity. </p><p>  The territory of the residential quarter under consideration is carefully guarded.  It will be impossible to go there freely.  Parking is guarded in the same way.  This ensures not only the personal safety of the residents, but also their own transport. </p><p>  Any housing, including a one-room apartment, can be purchased for cash, as well as in installments. </p><h2>  Overview of available apartments </h2><p>  The complex provides comfort-class housing.  The building was erected using brick-monolithic technology.  All apartments are for rent with a finish (you can choose one of several options).  The area ranges from 70 square meters to 91 square meters.  How much will the apartment in LCD ‚ÄúLinkor‚Äù cost?  Prices vary in proportion to the area.  What does this mean in practice?  So, a one-room apartment can cost you 88 thousand 787 rubles per square meter.  Apartments of a different layout - up to 96 thousand 119 per square meter. </p><p>  The company, which is engaged in the construction of a housing complex, promised to finish with high-quality materials made in Europe and which were purchased only from trusted manufacturers.  All communications are made.  There is also a heating and power supply system. </p>

    <h2>  How to get to the new building? </h2><p>  The housing complex is located in the <span>Baltic Pearl area of</span> St. Petersburg.  You can get to it if, after reaching the Leninsky Prospekt metro station, at the bus stop of the same name, transfer to bus number 142. It will take you about twenty minutes to get to the Heroes Avenue stop.  From this point only ten minutes walk to the LCD "Battleship".  KVS built a complex in a developing area.  Therefore, in the future we can hope for an improvement in transport communications. </p><h2>  Parking </h2><p>  Residents of the complex will be able to purchase parking spaces for their personal vehicles in one of the heated parking lots of RC ‚ÄúLinkor‚Äù.  Their cost ranges from 280 thousand rubles per parking place to 430 thousand rubles for a more solid transport. </p><p>  When buying real estate of a certain type of parking space can be obtained for free. </p><p>  You can pay by installments.  In this case, the down payment must be at least twenty percent of the total cost.  The remaining amount can be paid within one to two years. </p><h2>  Terms of payment </h2><p>  You can purchase housing by issuing a mortgage in one of the partner banks of KVS.  Lending conditions differ depending on which institution you decide to cooperate with.  Mortgage repayment period - from one year to fifty years (the upper threshold is determined by a particular bank).  The required down payment ranges from zero to fifty percent of the total amount.  The maximum loan amount starts from two million rubles or more (depending on the bank and the selected program).  Some institutions support subsidies and military mortgages. </p>
