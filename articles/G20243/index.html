    <h2>  general description </h2><p>  Leninakan is located near the capital of Armenia - Yerevan.  To be more precise, it is almost one hundred and thirty kilometers from it.  Spread in the center of the Shirak plateau, the ancient city rises one and a half kilometers above sea level.  Leninakan borders on Turkey and intersects with such gorges as Dzhadzhur and Cherkez. </p><p>  The climate is temperate continental.  In the city, the soil consists of fertile black earth.  A green cover characteristic of the desert zone perfectly grows on it.  Armenia is very striking in its relief.  Leninakan and nearby settlements are covered with plains, lava massifs, lakes and rivers. </p><p>  The ancient city looks like a stone oasis, in which the early and modern buildings are surprisingly successfully combined.  Such an unusual combination simply cannot but attract travelers from different parts of the world.  What is noteworthy, Leninakan is located in a dangerous seismic zone.  And this greatly affected the history of the settlement, which is already rich and interesting. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How the name of the city changed </h2><p>  According to historians, people began to live in the settlement in the fourth or sixth centuries BC and called it Gyumri.  But for the first time the city was mentioned in the annals of the eighth century, when the inhabitants rebelled against the Arab authorities.  The settlement was then called Kumayri, and the name Leninakan was unfamiliar to people. </p>

    <p>  Armenia at the beginning of the nineteenth century was forced to get involved in the Russian-Persian war.  As a result, the Russian Empire took possession of the land, which decided to build a military fortification in these parts.  The settlement did not yet have the status of a city and was called Alexandropol.  It was then that artisans known throughout the country began to live here.  Thanks to them, the city flourished and developed, and several guilds were founded: masons, blacksmiths, jewelers and weavers. </p><p>  Under Soviet rule, Alexandropol was called Leninakan.  Perhaps it is not difficult to guess that he got his name in honor of Vladimir Ilyich.  But after perestroika, the city was again given the former ancient name - Gyumri.  Although some people still out of habit use the same name.  Therefore, now you can find both the name "Leninakan" and "Gyumri".  And this, in principle, will be appropriate. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How the city of Leninakan developed </h2><p>  Armenia in the Leninakan region was settled before our era, as already mentioned.  And since then, the city has formed its own traditions and rich history.  It is amazing that already in ancient times, Gyumri successfully developed.  This is evidenced by the findings of archaeologists: tools, metal products, workshops for casting iron, crypts, jewelry, household items made of stone and clay: bowls, cups, jugs and other things. </p>

    <p>  The most significant period in the development of Leninakan was the nineteenth century.  At the beginning of the century, the city and the surrounding area became part of the Russian Empire.  And this is almost thirty years earlier compared to the whole of Eastern Armenia.  Thanks to this significant event, Gyumri became a famous and developed settlement of Transcaucasia. </p><p>  In the thirties, the city of Leninakan (Armenia) turned into a haven for hundreds of Armenian families who fled from Muslim daggers from the western districts.  As a result, Gyumri has become quite crowded.  A little later, a Russian fortress, military fortifications were erected in the vicinity, and villages for soldiers were founded. </p><h2>  Leninakan as an industrial center </h2><p>  In the fortieth year, Leninakan officially received the status of a city, and in ten years it became an important center of craftsmanship and trade.  He was one of the largest in Armenian culture and was famous for famous masters.  Already in the sixties there were more artisans here than in the capital of Georgia itself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In the late nineties, railway lines from Tiflis to Tauris began to be laid through Alexandropol.  This turning point was felt by both the city and the whole of Armenia.  Leninakan became an important railway junction, which allowed it to actively develop in the cultural and socio-economic spheres. </p><p>  Also in the life of the city a big role was played by handicraft.  But at the turn of the century, many enterprises for the production of leather, beer and soap were already built in Leninakan.  Since then, trade began to develop very quickly.  More and more markets, shops, large and small shops appeared. </p>

    <h2>  Fatal earthquake </h2><p>  Everything would be fine, but in 1988 there was a terrible disaster.  A strong earthquake occurred in Armenia.  Seismologists note that energy was released in the <span>fracture</span> zone of <span>the earth's crust</span> , which is equivalent to the explosion of a dozen atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima.  The shock wave went around the whole planet and was registered by experts in Australia, Asia, Europe and America. </p><p>  This <span>earthquake in Armenia was</span> destroyed by Leninakan, Kirovakan, Stepanavan and Spitak.  Also, about sixty villages of the republic became ruins, and another four hundred villages were partially destroyed.  The catastrophe claimed over half a million lives, leaving several tens of thousands wounded and injured for life.  A lot of people just went missing.  Rescue teams spent a long time searching and helping those in need who were in trouble. <em></em></p><h2>  Leninakan after the earthquake </h2><p>  Eliminated the effects of an earthquake for about ten years.  Leninakan could be called ruins, in a disaster he was badly damaged.  All this time, a cadaverous smell and construction dust hovered over the remains of the city. </p>

    <p>  Only the houses of Stalin's era more or less survived.  The rest of the buildings were boxes with ruined roofs, prevailing floors and staircases.  This is very clearly visible in the presented photos of Leninakan. </p><p>  Armenia then actively accepted humanitarian aid from around the world.  Volunteer detachments, civil defense units, and builders raked up the ruins, demolished dilapidated houses, and erected temporary dwellings, which the residents of Leninakan and other cities really needed.  Armenia had a hard time, but she was able to survive it. </p><h2>  Modern Leninakan </h2><p>  It is hard to imagine that almost thirty years ago there was an earthquake.  The modern city is very beautiful.  All areas were rebuilt, and the streets and alleys became picturesque.  Despite this, ancient buildings, fortresses and churches are still preserved.  You can admire them, walking along the streets of Leninakan. </p><p>  Pre-revolutionary buildings made of red and black tuff with decorated facades are very delightful.  Noteworthy is the Black Fortress, the Church of the Savior, the Marmashen Monastery and numerous museum houses.  The buildings were restored, but the earthquake in Armenia, the city of Leninakan will not be forgotten for a long time.  At least once, Gyumri is worth a visit to get to know more closely its rich history.  You can get into the city in any convenient way: by plane, train, bus or car. </p>

    <h2>  We are going by train </h2><p>  In Leninakan there is a station, which in itself is an interesting architectural structure.  A railway museum is located right on one of the platforms.  So it’s worth it to get to the city by train from Yerevan.  Electric trains run only twice a day: morning and evening.  The interval between them is a little over seven hours.  This time is enough to see the sights of Leninakan, and then go home.  It is also possible to get to the city by international train from Tbilisi. </p><h2>  Getting on the plane </h2><p>  Leninakan is the only Armenian provincial city that has a major airport.  Therefore, from Moscow you can fly a direct flight.  Directly from the plane to anywhere in the city can be reached in just a few minutes.  There is an opportunity to leave Yerevan if you want to admire the views that Armenia is famous for.  Leninakan is popular, therefore, in the capital you can transfer to another plane, bus or taxi.  Many airlines offer regular flights to Gyumri, so there should be no problems with timing.  Travel time will be only a few hours. </p><h2>  By bus or car </h2><p>  Fans of enjoying the views should choose these modes of transport.  Buses run from Yerevan to Leninakan several times a day, which is very convenient.  Get even faster with taxi drivers.  And you can safely bargain with them, and they will easily throw off the price.  Also in Yerevan they offer to rent a car and drive to Leninakan on their own.  You will need to get on the two-lane highway M1.  The quality of the road is good, but because of the many turns, driving too fast will not work. </p>
