    <h2>  Recreation opportunities in China </h2><p>  China has access to the largest - the Pacific Ocean.  The country's coast goes into the Korean Gulf and adjoins three seas: East China, Yellow and South China.  Due to its vast area, there is an incredibly diverse nature.  Having visited China, you can get acquainted with almost all the natural areas of the globe.  When traveling through this great country, you can visit the mountains of different heights.  In this matter, it all depends on the level of your training and the degree of lack of extreme sensations. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The lowest here is the <span>Tibetan Plateau.</span>  The interesting thing is that it is the lowest in China, and the highest and largest in the global landscape.  The next point may be the conquest of mountain peaks, up to the Himalayas, Karakorum and Pamir mountains.  Extensive desert terrain stretches between the mountain systems, one of them is the Takla ‚Äì Makan desert.  Fans of a more ‚Äúdown-to-earth‚Äù and urban leisure are offered the opportunity to visit the largest and most popular cities of the country: Beijing, Hong Kong, Shanghai and others. Taste national cuisine, admire the quality of the road surface, grow dull from the size of skyscrapers, try out the effects of Chinese medicine and dissolve in a layer of smog - an integral part of the country, with so many people and vehicles that add some flavor.  Almost the entire population of the People's Republic of China is concentrated on the low coast.  It is in such an area that the climate is milder and the soil more fertile. </p>

There are people who liked everything, but there are those who have nothing.
