If earlier the poor were purchased at such flea markets and very dubious personalities lived, today it is possible to purchase a truly antique original little thing here relatively cheaply. </p><h2>  Why is the flea market? </h2><p>  The first junk market was formed in Paris.  In the second half of the 19th century, the city authorities during the redevelopment of the French capital evicted all traders of old things on a square in a remote area of ​​Paris.  Buying old clothes, buyers carried home and the numerous fleas that live in its folds.  So the flea market first appeared.  Over time, similar junk flea markets formed in other European cities, and at the beginning of the 20th century the first “flea” appeared in Moscow on Sukharevskaya Square. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="flea market in prague" class="if" height="358" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57442/1973110.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Among the flea market goods there are cracked cups, breeches that have gone out of fashion, and antique pieces of furniture in need of restoration, and valuable coins of different times.  Often, artworks bought here for a penny turn out to be unknown masterpieces worth millions of dollars. </p><h2>  Czech "fleas" </h2><p>  The flea markets of Prague are not inferior to the flea markets of Munich, Paris, London or Madrid with an assortment of unique antique goods.  There are several such flea markets in Prague.  Each market has its own unique lifestyle, permanent residents and unique flavor.  Wandering between merchants who laid out their uncomplicated open-air goods, visitors get acquainted with the history of the country and national traditions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

There are stalls on their territory with modern goods, with the products of beekeepers, with garden tools and plants.  But "fleas" are attracted primarily by antique rare goods.  And you can buy literally everything here: an original handbag from the time of our grandmothers, and an old postcard, and a vintage hat, and figurines or paintings by unknown authors, and a well-traveled bicycle, and a primus, and a globe, and anklets.  By asking and looking at unique gizmos, you involuntarily think about the fate of their past owners, think about the history of their life.  In all markets, there is a ban on the sale of tobacco, alcohol, weapons, drugs and animals.

    <h2>  The most popular Prague market </h2><p>  Of course, having enough time, it is advisable to visit all three flea markets.  But if a visit to the Czech capital is limited to several days, preference should be given to the oldest and largest flea market in Prague - Kolbenov.  It operates year-round on Saturdays and Sundays from 7:00 to 14:00. </p><p>  Every resident knows the address of the flea market in Prague.  The trading area of ​​50,000 m <sup>2</sup> is located on U Electra.  Professionals, antique dealers or collectors come to the flea market to open it and quickly get out all the unique interesting gizmos. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="flea market prague reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57442/1973113.jpg"></div>  There are two ways to get to the Kolbenov market:

      <br>
      <p></p>
    <ol><li>  Take the <span>yellow line</span> metro to Kolbenova Station.  After leaving the only exit you need to cross the road and turn right.  The market from the metro station 1-2 minutes walk. </li><li>  The stop opposite the metro station can be reached by tram number 16.  And then also take a walk on foot. </li></ol><p>  On weekends, a lot of visitors from among residents and guests of the Czech capital go to the flea market. </p><h2>  Market prices </h2><p>  It is unusual for Russian tourists to see security at the entrance to the market.  To enter the territory through the turnstiles, visitors must pay 20 kroons or 1 euro.  Regulars of the flea market know that those who arrived early have more chances to buy an original little thing, but the prices of all goods are higher.  Closer to closure, merchants are more accommodating and significantly reduce the value of their treasures.  On clear sunny days, sellers eagerly share their valuable advice and tell tales about the former owners of their exclusive product, stuffing the price of every little thing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="flea market prague time" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45860/1974903.jpg" width="570"></div>  Antique pieces of furniture, antique watches in working order, exclusive decorative elements for decorating the facade of the house, mirrors in massive frames and much more are purchased much cheaper here than in <span>specialized stores.</span>  But the documents confirming the authenticity of the purchase or the history of the origin of the thing are rarely what a merchant can provide.

    <h2>  Features of trading at flea markets </h2><p>  Fantasizing and asking the price for everything in a row, you do not focus on something special, and your eyes snatch individual gizmos from market variegation.  Reviews about flea markets in Prague will not be able to convey a hundredth part of the delight from visiting the shopping arcade of old-timers.  Particularly brisk trade occurs on holidays.  A unique gift for the New Year or Christmas can be picked up only here.  Local merchants in Russia will immediately recognize and lose their solo performances in our native language.  Taking photographs of the collapses in the flea market is not prohibited.  But traditionally, the owner of rare gizmos asks permission to shoot.  If you fail to acquire the treasured gizmo, a photo of both the product and the colorful seller will be kept as a keepsake.  During the operation of the flea market in Prague, there are a lot of visitors and frequent thefts prompt you to be extremely attentive to your belongings and money. </p>
