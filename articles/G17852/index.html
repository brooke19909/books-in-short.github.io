But few people know that the manufacturer has not limited itself exclusively to mobile phones.  In its arsenal there are a variety of devices: scooters, televisions, smart vacuum cleaners and other products.  But today we look at the Xiaomi surge protector.  This device is from the field of smart home appliances.  We will definitely consider all the technical specifications and features of this device.  But first, a few words about the manufacturer itself. </p><div class="photo" data-original="in.c.mi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi surge protector" class="if uuid-2986343" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2986343.jpg"></div><h2>  About Xiaomi </h2><p>  Xiaomi company was founded in 2010 in China.  It was originally planned to produce exclusively smartphones.  The first Mi 2 was released in 2012.  This was the first mass smartphone company.  However, until 2013, Xiaomi products were supplied exclusively to the Chinese market.  Entering the international arena took place in 2013 with the opening of a representative office in Singapore.  Already in 2014, the whole world started talking about a new manufacturer.  Xiaomi devices were affordable and had excellent technical specifications.  Naturally, they have become very popular.  The first Xiaomi home appliance was released all in the same 2013.  It was a 3D TV.  But it was intended exclusively for the domestic market.  However, it became clear that the company wants to fill all the trading sectors with its gadgets.  This is what became the prerequisite for the release of Xiaomi surge protector.  Let's consider it in more detail.  And start with the design. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="alexnld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi surge protector with usb" class="if uuid-2986349" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2986349.jpg"></div><h2>  Appearance and design </h2><p>  It is worth noting that this device has a laconic design that will allow you to place it in almost any interior.  The Xiaomi Mi Power Strip surge protector is a small, flat, rectangular box with rounded edges and a wire.  The device is made in traditional white color.  There are no other colors.  On the top panel there are all kinds of connectors for connecting various network plugs.  There are also USB ports for charging mobile gadgets.  Toward the end of the upper panel, there is a power button that starts the device and supplies power to the connected electronics.  The network cable is mounted in the housing and is made of high-quality copper wire with a rubberized braid.  It is also white.  This is how this surge protector looks.  Simple and concise.  However, it is worth disassembling the technical characteristics of the Xiaomi Power Strip surge protector. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dhgate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi power strip surge protector" class="if uuid-2986353" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2986353.jpg"></div><h2>  Key Specifications </h2><p>  What can surprise this users with a surge protector?  Consider its main features.  This is a device with three sockets for various types of plugs, three USB ports and a cord 1.8 meters long.  The current supplied to USB is 2 A. This is enough for standard charging of mobile gadgets.  The total connected power is 2500 watts.  That is, you can connect a whole computer and a couple of devices to this filter if you wish.  Power is just great.  The total connected current is 750 A. It is also an excellent result.  In addition, the device has a transmitter for WiFi.  Xiaomi surge protector can be operated using a smartphone.  The transmitter allows you to disable and enable the filter, configure automatic start (for example, to schedule charging) and much more. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The device itself is made of refractory plastic.  It is able to withstand temperatures up to 750 degrees Celsius for a fairly long time.  That is, fire should not happen when using this filter.  In addition, there is special protection against voltage surges.  This point will be discussed in more detail below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="antyweb.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi mi power strip surge protector" class="if uuid-2986356" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2986356.jpg"></div><h2>  Filter protection </h2><p>  Xiaomi surge protector with USB ports has a very thoughtful protection.  So, if a current is supplied to it for a long time, for which it is not designed, then the built-in overheat protection will work and the filter will simply turn off.  If a short circuit occurs in the filter, then no fire will happen, since the body of the device is made of refractory plastic.  There is also a very good protection against children.  All connectors on the surge protector (even USB) are covered with special curtains, which can be removed only if a plug is inserted into the socket.  In general, Xiaomi surge protector is one of the safest devices of such a plan. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.getgreatdeals.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi wifi surge protector" class="if uuid-2986359" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2986359.jpg"></div><h2>  User reviews about the surge protector </h2><p>  In order to find out how the device works in real conditions and whether its declared technical characteristics coincide with the real ones, you need to consider the reviews of those who have already purchased such a device and successfully tested it.  The same goes for this surge protector.  It should be noted right away that most of the reviews are positive (as are responses about other devices from "Xiaomi"). </p><p>  The owners of this surge protector note that it works perfectly.  According to some reports, it even has the option of equalizing voltage and stabilizing it.  This is what users have noticed.  High quality materials were also noted.  The excellent assembly was also not deprived of attention.  Nowhere are there any backlashes, creaks and inconsistencies.  It is understandable, because carelessness in the manufacture of such devices can lead to far worse consequences than a simple failure of the gadget.  Also, users note that the surge protector stably (and very quickly) charges smartphones, tablets and other mobile equipment.  Moreover, devices from Xiaomi are charging faster than phones from other manufacturers. </p><p>  However, there are those who, for some reason, were not satisfied with the Xiaomi surge protector.  It is worth considering the features that users attributed to the shortcomings.  According to consumers, it is only one: an Australian-type power plug.  Connect the surge protector to our outlet only with an adapter.  But this is a pretty minor drawback against all the advantages. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we examined the Xiaomi surge protector, which is distinguished by advanced options (like a Wi-Fi transmitter), the presence of USB ports for charging gadgets and a powerful system of protection against voltage surges.  Such a device costs relatively little - about 1200 rubles.  Almost any user can afford it.  For little money, the consumer gets a modern smart device with improved protection.  What is bad?  Only here the network plug is not of our sample, but this feature is easily fixed by the adapter. </p>
