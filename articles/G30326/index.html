He dreamed of the glory of a commander, but his military victory was attributed to another person.  He tried to win the love of the people, but received only the nickname "rich."  And yet Crassus Mark Licinius remained in history not only as a rich man, but also as the winner of the rebellious Spartacus. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crassus Mark Licinius" class="if" height="196" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31754/754330.jpg" width="600"></div>  The childhood and youth of the future commander </h2><p>  Mark Licinius Crassus was born in 115 BC into a noble Roman family.  The Licinius clan belongs to one of the most influential plebeian families in Ancient Rome, which has a long history.  Mark's father was a consul, then governor in Spain.  For the pacification of the Spanish uprising, the High Senate honored him with triumph.  In addition to Mark, the family grew two more older sons.  The father and one of the brothers Mark Crassus died in 87 BC during the dictatorship of the consular army of Guy Maria.  Mark himself hardly managed to avoid such a fate.  From early childhood, the boy did not stand out among his peers with a good memory and love of knowledge.  But on the other hand, he was distinguished by industriousness and perseverance.  In it, the brilliant abilities of the businessman, who knew how to profit from everything, were early discovered. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Business qualities of Crassus </h2><p>  Commercial operations succeeded young Mark much easier than public speaking, so necessary for the beginning of a political career.  Crassus Mark Licinius rented land, participated in trade campaigns, bought up slaves, so that, having trained them in craft and sciences, they would sell at exorbitant prices.  His condition gradually grew.  Over time, they began to recognize Mark Licinius on the street, his name was increasingly mentioned among merchants, but the path to politics was still closed for him.  In 83 <span>BC</span> , the outlawed commander Sulla unleashed one of the most bloody civil wars in the history of the Roman Empire.  Sulla's army was advancing on Rome.  Like other wealthy Romans, the businessman Crassus Mark Licinius did not hesitate to side with the rebel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="son mark crassus" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/754638.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  The recognition of Mark Licinius in Rome </h2><p>  With his own money, he armed an entire army of two and a half thousand people.  Gold of Mark Licinius turned into swords, shields, spears, bows and arrows.  The calculations were justified: he was on the side of the winner.  When Rome surrendered, the new dictator Sulla generously rewarded the future commander.  In addition, Crassus Mark Licinius significantly increased his fortune by confiscating or buying for nothing at the auction the property of those unfortunate people who, on the orders of Sulla, were included in the transcripts and became victims of terror.  Thus, Mark became incredibly rich.  In order to win the love of the people, he once arranged a meal for the inhabitants of Rome, ordering to cover 10,000 tables.  And although the Romans praised Crassus, nicknamed the rich, Mark Licinius dreamed of more - the military exploits and glory of the commander. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The internal confrontation of the Roman Empire </h2><p>  Hard times for the Roman state come in 74 BC.  In Spain, the general indignation of the tribes increased, and in the eastern part of Italy there was a war with Mithridates VI.  In 73 BC, when the uprising of slaves led by Spartacus arose in Ancient Rome, the rich man Mark Licinius Crassus decided that his time had come and he could satisfy his ambition by gaining glory in battle.  Mark Crassus and Spartak - this is a great confrontation of representatives of different class classes.  Having received the consent of the Senate, the merchant advanced two legions subject to him to meet the army of Spartak.  But in the very first battle with the rebels, the Romans were defeated, and Crassus' reputation was in jeopardy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mark Crassus photo" class="if" height="441" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31754/754327.jpg" width="340"></div>

    <h2>  Suppression of rebellious slaves </h2><p>  However, he is not used to losing.  To restore the fighting spirit of the army, Mark Licinius Crassus followed the ancient ruthless custom of decimation.  He commanded the execution of every tenth warrior, and this cruelty had an effect.  On his orders, the legionnaires dug a deep moat 55 kilometers long, and behind it they poured a <span>shaft.</span>  <span>This</span> line of fortifications blocked the army of Spartacus on the Brutian Peninsula, pressing it to the coast of the Mediterranean Sea.  And although the rebel managed to get out of the Brutian trap, Mark Crassus (of course, there wasn‚Äôt a photo in those days, we present to you pictures of sculptures and pictures) suppressed the rebellion of the slaves, winning the decisive battle in 71 BC.  But the winner‚Äôs laurels had to be shared with the commander Pompeii, who defeated the remains of Spartak‚Äôs army and brutally cracked down on the prisoners.  The authority of Mark Crassus increased when in 70 BC, and then in the 55th he was elected consul for a year.  But the rich Crassus could not win the love and support of the people and alone to stay on the political Olympus of Ancient Rome. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Marc Crassus and Spartak" class="if" height="373" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/754632.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The first steps in big politics </h2><p>  Then he began to support the aspiring politician Guy Julius Caesar.  Caesar and Mark Crassus became very close in their political views on the future of the Roman Empire.  To ensure Julia won the election, Crassus and Pompey entered into an alliance with him.  So in 60 BC, a triumvirate of the strongest people of the state (Pompey, Mark Crassus and Julius Caesar) arose, who began to rule Rome.  In this union of power, mind and gold, the power of Pompey and the wisdom of Caesar combined with the wealth of Crassus.  Such a seizure of power will last a little less than seven years, that is, until the death of Mark Licinius. </p><h2>  New Syrian Governor </h2><p>  Marc Crassus (whose biography confirms this) becomes the governor of Syria, taking from Gabinius two legions of selected warriors, which opened up new opportunities for enrichment for him.  But, in addition, Mark Licinius saw himself as the owner of the treasures of the Parthian kingdom - a powerful power that stretched from the <span>Persian Gulf</span> to the Caspian Sea.  Parthia seemed to him easy prey.  Many tried to dissuade the sixty-year-old commander from hasty and rash decisions.  But in 54 BC Crassus, Mark Licinius began a war with the Parthians. </p><h2>  Parthian war events </h2><p>  What made Triumvir invade Parthian possessions is not known for certain.  The first conflicts between the two powers <span>(the Roman Republic</span> and the Parthian kingdom) arose as early as 92 BC.  Between the two states, diplomatic relations were even established.  Apparently, the main reason was the military conflict over the seizure of Armenia (a preliminary agreement stated the line of demarcation of the seized territory along the Euphrates River). </p><h2>  Last battle of Carrah </h2>

The numerical superiority of the Romans did not give the expected result.  More competent tactical and strategic actions of the Parthian army allowed it to attack the enemy from the flanks and deliver high-quality attacks on enemy positions.  Frequent frontal attacks and flank coverage fettered the light infantry of the Romans.  In the end, this led to the complete defeat of the <span>Roman army.</span>  In one of the counterattacks, the cavalry of Publius Crassus was destroyed, and the commander himself was captured.  The head of the son of Mark Crassus was sent to the Parthian king.  Modern military experts see the main reason for the defeat at Carra in the heavy uniforms of Roman soldiers, the weight of ammunition, which reached 50 kilograms.

    <p>  Parthian war became fatal for Mark Crassus himself.  According to the descriptions of the historian Plutarch, Mark died in the battle of the city of Carra in Mesopotamia on May 6, 53 BC.  The severed head and arm of the commander were sent to the king of Parthia.  There is a legend that the winners poured molten gold through a special pipe into Crassus' throat to completely satisfy his thirst for profit after the death of the commander and businessman. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Caesar and Mark Crassus" class="if" height="278" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/754629.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Personal life and heirs </h2><p>  Some sources that have survived to this day claim that the triumvir Mark Licinius Crassus was married to the widow of his deceased brother.  The eldest son of Mark Crassus - Tiberius - was foster and was the direct heir to Publius Crassus.  With his wife Tertulla, Mark had two sons: Mark and Publius.  Both of them had different political weight and social significance in the history of ancient Rome. </p><h2>  Mark Licinius Crassus (son) </h2><p>  Historical records of the eldest son of Triumvir are scarce enough.  It is only known that he was born in the first half of 85 BC.  At a fairly young age, Mark Crassus (son) became a pontiff, and then for a short time served in Gaul as a questor and a procurer with Julius Caesar.  In the civil war of the Roman Empire, the eldest son of Mark Licinius did not show any special abilities for martial art and was soon appointed governor of Cisalpine Gaul.  Further traces of the young heir are lost.  Most likely, his life path ended in Gaul. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="son mark crassus tiberius" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/754671.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The youngest son of the triumvir Crassus </h2><p>  Unlike his father, Publius Crassus had a good syllable and was an excellent speaker.  Curiosity, well-read and educated young commander allowed him to get closer to the first speaker of that time - Cicero.  It is known that in their private conversations both speakers touched upon the topic of politics and problems of statehood.  Cicero had high hopes for the young speaker, seeing him as his successor.  However, after the speech ‚ÄúOn the King of Alexandria‚Äù, in which the teacher criticized the plans of Crassus the Elder (on the annexation of Egypt to the Roman Empire), Mark Licinius Crassus did everything to break this connection.  <span>The political views of the</span> son and father differed, and this ceased to be a family affair, but acquired a public character. </p><h2>  Comprehension of military wisdom </h2><p>  At the request of his father, Publius Crassus goes to serve under the great Julius Caesar.  The young warrior conducted excellent military campaigns in Aquitaine and Armorica.  <span>Guy Julius Caesar</span> praised the commander's abilities of the young commander.  Upon returning home, the son of Mark Crassus married the daughter of the optimate Cornelia Metella.  Then began a new political round in the career of Publius Crassus.  Father appoints him as his security chief.  It is also known that the son of Mark Crassus was one of the first to attach importance to monetary policy in the state.  After the death of Publius at the Battle of Carra, his wife Cornelia marries Pompey. </p>
