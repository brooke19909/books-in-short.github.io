  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Burning through the fabric. Instead of thread - a hot needle</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  An ordinary <span>burner,</span> known to many of us since childhood, can process the fabric and get very interesting things, reminiscent of the ancient Richelieu embroidery technique that our grandmothers used to decorate napkins, curtains, and linen.  Guilloche - burning on fabric, is much easier and faster than painstaking embroidery, and the result is interesting.  Burning through the fabric can also be used for the manufacture of <span>volumetric applications,</span> when each element of the picture, fixed only partially, creates a ‚Äúlive‚Äù relief pattern. </p><p>  Anyone who has ever used a burning machine technically imagines this process.  Burning through the fabric is done using a conventional wood burner, but equipped with a special needle for the fabric.  The main attention should be paid to the choice of fabric.  It must be synthetic, one that melts under the influence of temperature, and not burns.  Well suited for burning capron, fastened, nylon, artificial velvet, raincoat fabric, etc.  Before starting work, the fabric should be tested.  To do this, a burner needle is carried out along a shared or transverse thread.  If the trimmed edge is melted and not charred, then the fabric is suitable for guilloche. </p><p>  To cut elements for application, use the template.  First, all the details of the pattern are cut out of thick cardboard, then they are laid on a fabric laid out on a smooth, solid surface (a glass surface will do well) and a hot needle is drawn around the contour of the template without breaking the line.  If it did not work out the first time, then the template is applied again and the whole process is repeated.  It turns out the individual elements of the future application with smooth fused edges, which no longer need to be further processed. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Smaller graceful ornaments are burned out using a different trick.  For work, you need a backlight, which is placed under the glass.  A pattern made in black on white paper is laid on the glass; fabric is laid on the drawing.  Burning through the fabric is carried out along the translucent <span>contours of the pattern.</span> </p><p>  To make the textile product especially interesting and original, it is made of several layers.  The first is decorated with a scorched pattern along the edge, a second layer of fabric of a different color is laid on it, which is decorated with applique, or also with a scorched pattern, in the gaps of which the fabric of the first layer will be visible.  The work is even more interesting when the application, the sequential burning of each layer of fabric and the burning of both layers, after applying the second layer to the first, are combined in one product. </p><p>  The needle of the burning apparatus must be periodically cleaned of the burning accumulated on it using fine sandpaper until the needle has cooled. </p><p>  Another very interesting use of the burner is decorating leather products, for example, bags, wallets, leather belts. </p><p>  Skin burning </p><p>  Actually, those who had at least a little experience working with a burner in childhood will easily do this job.  It‚Äôs important to get used to it, first you need to practice on a small piece of skin in order to correctly determine the temperature and pressure of pressing the tip of the device (there is no need for a special nozzle).  The contours of the pattern are applied to the skin with a soft pencil or chalk.  A delicate graceful pattern is burned out by light touches of the needle, wider and deeper - by point movements, gradually filling the background.  The finished pattern, if desired, is colored with paints for painting the fabric. </p><p>  Burning on fabric and skin is an entertaining lesson, with the help of which original interior items or <span>clothing decor</span> elements are obtained <span>.</span> </p>
