It was thanks to him that the Eastern Slavs became famous throughout the world and entered their names over the centuries.  This state was founded by people from Scandinavia.  They brought to the land of modern Ukrainians, northern culture, laws and an example of government.  Such assimilation was not in vain; already at the end of the 9th and beginning of the 10th centuries, the Old Russian state was comparable with the descendant of the great Roman Empire - Byzantium. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="domestic and foreign policy oleg" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26556/605353.jpg" width="507"></div>

    <h2>  Old Russian state and its princes </h2><p>  The process of evolution, unprecedented for those times, was caused by the activity of the Old Russian princes, who did their best to raise their country to a new level.  Something succeeded, something not.  Today it is safe to say that, thanks to the activities of the very first princes from the Rurikovich clan, the foundation was laid for further ‚Äúconquering‚Äù a place under the sun.  It should be noted the fact that the domestic and foreign policies of the first princes were carried out in an atmosphere of constant civil strife with other Slavic tribes and raids of nomadic tribes.  One can talk about the activities of the princes for a very long time, but among them the most wise and successful in terms of political confrontation should be singled out. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Who is Prince Oleg? </h2><p>  The most interesting and no less mysterious person in all history is the first Grand <span>Duke Oleg.</span>  Reliable statements about him practically did not survive.  The historical image of this prince is based on the Tale of Bygone Years and the Novgorod Chronicle, as well as on the stories of his legendary deeds, through which domestic and foreign policies were pursued.  Oleg can be compared with the great leader of the Huns Attila, since his whole life was also covered in secrets. </p><h2>  The origin of Oleg </h2><p>  To date, two main theories of the origin of Oleg are known.  Each of them is presented in two famous annals: "Novgorod" and "Tales of Bygone Years."  However, from the entire array of statements that are given in these ancient writings, we can single out the most rational kernel, which at least tells us a little about Oleg's appearance on the stage of the historical theater of the Old Russian State. </p><p>  Oleg‚Äôs domestic and foreign policy was largely due to his alleged origin.  According to the annalistic legends, Oleg came to the Old Russian land with Rurik.  After the death of the latter, Oleg began to reign as regent of the minor son of Rurik.  Modern scientists still have not learned why the future prince, unknown to anyone, had such a high position.  There are also two legends.  The first says that Oleg was a relative of Rurik, and the second tells about his high position next to the Scandinavian leader as a military leader.  One way or another, in 882, the reign of the Grand Duke begins. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Domestic and foreign policy of Oleg </h2><p>  Having come to power, the prince begins to conquer all the tribes that resisted or rebellion.  At that time Oleg was the prince of Novgorod, and not Kiev, since Askold and Deer were seated in the latter.  After several years of continuous war, the prince was able to conquer many Slavic tribes, namely: Slovenes, all, chud, measure and Krivichi.  Together with the warriors of the conquered tribes and the Vikings, Grand Duke Oleg began his advance down the Dnieper.  In this campaign, he was able to capture cities such as Smolensk and Lubech. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The main directions of domestic and foreign policy of Prince Oleg" class="if" height="319" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26556/605892.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  After these events, nothing prevented him from going to Kiev.  However, the prince did not take the siege of the city and did not use other military techniques.  Oleg applied a trick.  He called <span>Askold and Dir</span> to a meeting outside the city walls.  On it, the prince introduced the true heir of Rurik - Igor, and then killed the Kiev princes.  On this their reign in the city on the Dnieper ended.  Why the Prince of Novgorod did just that, no one knows. </p><p>  Since that time, Oleg has united Northern and Eastern Russia, creating the Old Russian state, or Kievan Rus, as it is commonly called.  Domestic and foreign policy of Prince Oleg was based on achieving the most positive result for Russia.  At the same time, he took the most ‚Äúbold,‚Äù so to speak, steps from a political point of view. </p><h2>  Byzantine hiking </h2><p>  The main directions of domestic and foreign policy of Prince Oleg were also determined by the personal considerations of the prince, regarding the progressive role of Kievan Rus.  The biggest contribution to <span>domestic politics</span> was made at the end of the 9th century, when Oleg united Novgorod and Kiev into one state.  Subsequent events testify to the prince's intentions to equate the country with the progressing states of that time. </p><p>  The sea neighbor of Russia at that time was the rich and influential country of Byzantium.  Realizing the danger and at the same time the attractiveness of such an enemy, Oleg decides to start a war with this state.  The first trip happened in 907.  According to legends, he was one of the most massive and great.  Then the myth of the invincibility and omnipotence of Byzantium was completely destroyed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="domestic and foreign policy of the first princes" class="if" height="371" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/605908.jpg" width="200"></div>  When the Grand Duke of Novgorod and Kiev nailed his shield to the gates of Constantinople, this marked the beginning of a new era.  As for politics, for Kievan Rus the victory over Byzantium was a real breakthrough.  According to the agreement concluded by Oleg in 907, the rich neighbor of the <span>Slavic state was</span> obligated to pay tribute to him.  Moreover, duty-free trade was established for both parties.  From that moment, Byzantium did not cease to be afraid and respect Kievan Rus.

    <p>  In 911, the prince no longer sends troops, but ambassadors to extend peace and conclude a new treaty.  It had even more positive moments for the Old Russian merchants and the Russian state as a whole. </p><p>  So, we saw that the domestic and foreign policies of Prince Oleg are inscribed in history with the help of legendary acts.  The Grand Duke ushered in a new era by combining war and politics.  It was thanks to the first lord of Kiev that the foundation was laid for the further actions of the Old Russian princes.  Thus, Oleg‚Äôs domestic and foreign policy helped him to immortalize his name, as well as build the great and glorious state of Kievan Rus. </p>
