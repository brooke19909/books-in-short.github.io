    <h2>  Column layout </h2><p>  The speaker layout includes speakers, trim, diffuser and crossover.  Powerful models use a special bass reflex.  Amplifiers can be installed with field effect or switching transistors.  In order to improve the sound quality, capacitors are used.  The woofer is selected with an amplifier.  The dynamic head must be mounted on the seal. </p>

    <h2>  Single Speaker Models </h2><p>  Single speaker speakers are very common.  To assemble the model, you will have to first deal with the body.  Plywood is often used for this purpose.  At the end of the work, she will have to be sheathed.  However, first of all, side racks should be made.  For this purpose you will have to use a jigsaw.  <span>The speaker for the column</span> can be selected with a small capacity. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The inner side of the plywood is necessarily stitched with a vibration insulation tape.  After fixing the speaker, the seal is fixed.  For this purpose glue is used.  Then it remains only to attach the diffuser.  Some make a separate shelf for it and fix it with stacking screws.  To connect the speaker to the plug, a terminal block is installed.  How to enable speakers?  For this purpose, a cable from the terminal block is used, which should lead to a power source. </p><h2>  Drawing of a model for two speakers </h2><p>  Two speaker speakers can be made for home or car.  If we consider the first option, then the diffuser will need a pulse type.  First of all, durable plywood is selected for assembly.  The next step is to cut the bottom stand.  Leg models are very rare.  To cover veneers, you can use regular varnish.  Vibration isolation tape on the front pillar is not required to be glued.  The diffuser is mounted under the speaker.  To make a hole on the panel, you need to use a jigsaw.  The phase inverter is fixed at the rear wall.  Some make devices with a horizontal arrangement of speakers.  In this case, the diffuser will be in the upper part of the structure.  Wires for speakers are used in a two-wire type. </p>

    <h2>  Three speaker devices </h2><p>  Speakers (home-made) with three speakers are very rare.  These devices are most suitable <span>for a</span> multi-channel <span>speaker system</span> .  To assemble the model, plywood sheets are selected first.  Some also advise using veneers.  However, models made of natural wood are quite expensive on the market.  The speakers should be installed in a horizontal position.  Also, an amplifier is required for the device. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To fix it, metal corners are used.  To connect the plates, tightening screws are needed.  In some cases, the plates are attached with glue.  Next, the model will have to partially cover with faux leather.  The next step is to install the terminal block.  In order to fix it on the body, you will need to make a separate hole.  It is also important to note <span>that there are models</span> with regulators.  Microcircuits for them are used capacitor type.  When the speakers fonit, you need to change the diffuser. </p><h2>  Studio devices </h2><p>  Drawings of speakers for studios involve the use of powerful speakers.  The diffuser is most often used pulse type.  Many experts recommend installing two amplifiers.  For normal operation of the <span>speaker system you</span> need a zener diode. </p><p>  For the purpose of self-assembly of columns, the casing is first of all manufactured.  Round holes are made for the speakers on the front panel.  You will also need a separate output for the bass reflex.  The design of the column is quite different.  Some prefer the surface of the body to be varnished.  However, there are models covered in leather. </p>

    <h2>  Models for computers </h2><p>  Speakers for computers are often made on a single speaker.  To assemble the model, veneer sheets of small thickness are selected.  A hole for the speaker is cut out on the front panel.  The phase inverter should be located in the rear of the housing.  If we consider models of low power, then the amplifier can be used without a resistor. </p><p>  In order to adjust the speaker volume, special crossovers are used.  These elements may be installed on the bass reflex.  If we consider devices with a power of more than 100 watts, then amplifiers can only be taken with resistors.  Some for the model choose pulse diffusers.  At the end of operation, a terminal strip is always installed. </p><h2>  Automotive Modifications </h2><p>  <span>Car speakers</span> are available in two or three speakers.  For self-assembly of the model you will need sheets of plywood.  In some cases, veneer coated with varnish is used.  To fix the speaker, you need to make a hole in the panel.  The next step is installing the bass reflex.  Some modifications are made with low-frequency cores.  If we consider the speakers (homemade) of low power, then the bass reflex is allowed to install without an amplifier. </p><p>  In this case, a multi-channel crossover is used to adjust the sound.  Some experts install terminal blocks behind the bass reflex.  If we consider speakers with a power of more than 50 watts, then the microcircuit is used on two amplifiers.  The diffuser is standardly installed pulse type.  Before fastening the case, it is important to take care of the vibration-insulating layer.  For the terminal block on the plate, you need to make a separate hole.  Some believe that the case must be cleaned without fail.  The wires for the speakers are suitable for a two-core type. </p>

    <h2>  Open case speakers </h2><p>  Portable speakers with an open enclosure are pretty easy to do.  Most often they are made with one speaker.  On the rear panel of the device, holes are drilled.  Directly the plates are connected by tightening screws.  The diffuser for such devices is suitable pulse type.  Phase inverters are often installed with a single amplifier.  If we consider powerful portable speakers, then they use a resistor crossover.  It is mounted behind the bass reflex.  Many experts recommend installing the speakers on the seal. </p><h2>  Enclosed devices </h2><p>  Speakers (home-made) with a closed case are considered the most common.  Many experts believe that they are the best in sound quality.  Phase inverters for devices are suitable operational type.  Woofers are installed in holes.  For the purpose of assembling the case, ordinary plywood sheets are suitable.  It is also important to note that there are modifications with cores.  If we consider the speakers of high power, the terminal blocks are installed in the lower part of the case.  By design, the models are quite different. </p>

    <h2>  20 W models </h2><p>  Assembling 20 V speakers is quite simple.  First of all, experts recommend preparing six sheets of veneer.  They should be varnished at the end of the work.  It is more advisable to start the assembly with the installation of speakers.  The phase inverter is used pulse type.  In some cases, it is mounted on linings.  Also, experts recommend laying rubber seals. </p><p>  The speakers are powered through the terminal block.  It is mounted at the rear panel.  The phase inverter can be installed with or without an amplifier.  If we consider the first option, then the cores are selected phase type.  In this case, the woofer can not be used.  If we consider the speakers without an amplifier, then they use a crossover.  At the end of the work, it is important to clean the case and varnish it. </p><h2>  50 watt devices </h2><p>  Speakers (homemade) at 50 watts are suitable for conventional acoustic players.  In this case, the body can be made from ordinary plywood.  Many experts also recommend the use of natural wood veneer.  However, it is important to note that he is afraid of high humidity. </p>

    <p>  After selecting the material, you should do the speakers.  They must be installed next to the bass reflex.  In this case, you can not do without an amplifier.  Many experts recommend selecting only low-frequency crossovers.  If we consider modifications with a regulator, then they use a pulsed diffuser.  The terminal block in this case is installed last.  For the design of the columns, you can always use leatherette.  A simpler option is to coat the surface with varnish. </p><h2>  100 W speakers </h2><p>  100 W speakers are suitable for powerful <span>speakers.</span>  In this case, the phase inverter is taken only pulse type.  It is also important to note that the amplifier is installed with a crossover.  Many experts recommend using veneer to assemble the case.  It is more advisable to install the woofer on a lining. </p>
