Each of us, whatever one may say, needs housing.  Some people buy apartments, others - compact and comfortable studios, and others - mansions.  One of the best options may be a small one-story house.  With an attic or with a terrace.  Or ordinary.  A lot of options.  And we should talk about them. </p>

    <h2>  Materials </h2><p>  Beautiful one-story houses can be made of different materials.  The tree is the most popular.  What could be more comfortable than a house made of this material?  In addition, it is natural and has unique properties.  And the tree is endowed with the ability to ‚Äúbreathe‚Äù.  So if you decide to build or buy a wooden house, you can be sure that a good microclimate in the premises is provided.  The air will be constantly moistened and fresh.  And besides, the wooden mansions look beautiful. </p><p>  Stone is an equally popular material.  It is used as the main (that is, building a building from it) and decoration (used in the interior).  What beautiful beautiful one-story houses made of stone do not exist!  They look elegant, expensive and even powerful.  However, if you decide to buy or build a house of stone, you need to prepare for the cost of decoration.  This material is cold, unlike wood, because you will need to spend money on insulation and home improvement. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Interior design </h2><p>  Not all beautiful one-story houses look good from the inside out.  Although many are still involved in the design themselves.  However, there is one element that must be provided in advance (if a person decided to purchase a house) or it is necessary to include it in the construction project.  And it's about the stove.  Why is it necessary to have it in a private house?  Firstly, it is very difficult to heat a whole house (even if it is small) in the cold winter with batteries alone.  The stove gives ‚Äúliving‚Äù heat, which does not dry the air.  And besides, it is also a kind of decorative element that definitely brings comfort to the house.  As they say, a house without a stove is the same samovar without smoke.  Almost all beautiful one-story houses with a terrace inside have either a fireplace or a stove.  Therefore, a very practical approach is to look for a mansion with such an element. </p>

    <h2>  Construction specifics </h2><p>  Some people decide to study what beautiful one-story houses are in their city.  Photos, in fact, help determine your own desires.  There are plenty of options.  However, others decide to start building their dream home on their own.  But they still look at what beautiful one-story houses are.  Photos of various mansions help a person design a model of the housing that he would like to have. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If there is no experience - of course, you need to contact specialists.  They will already offer either finished projects or create a new one, taking into account individual requirements (which include the number of rooms, number of floors, style, presence or absence of a garage, etc.).  Then a sketch is formed (facades, plans, visualization, materials, cladding).  Following is the finalization of the planning decision and its coordination with the customer.  And finally, the last stage is the development of drawings.  They include the architectural section, design and engineering.  When beautiful one-story houses with an attic are being built, everything is taken into account: plans, sections, facades, nodes, foundations, roofing, stairs, floors and much more.  So the process is responsible, and you should carefully think through everything if you want to become the owner of the house - built independently or with the invitation of a specialist. </p>

    <h2>  Stylization </h2><p>  We can talk about the style in which it is best to design a house for a long time.  Here, in fact, it all depends on taste preferences.  The <span>log houses</span> made in the style of Old Russian log cabins look colorful and spectacular.  And they are energy efficient and environmentally friendly. </p><p>  Good decorative solutions are obtained using bricks, which can very well decorate the facade.  In addition, it provides excellent noise and thermal insulation of walls.  If you want something extraordinary, you can complement the house with a stylized tower.  By the way, under it you can disguise the chimney from the fireplace.  So many people get a kind of house - ‚Äúfortress‚Äù or ‚Äútower‚Äù. </p><p>  European-style houses are also popular.  They look neat, simple and practical.  But they immediately show that the materials used are not cheap.  And often, such cottages are not ‚Äúalone‚Äù - with a lawn, a fence, paths and other decorations. </p><p>  In general, there are numerous options for houses.  And it is up to each individually to decide what they will be and whether to build them on their own. </p>
