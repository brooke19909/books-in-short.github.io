When the first pictures of this miracle became available to the public, many did not believe that this phenomenally beautiful creation really exists. </p><h2>  Hidden Beach (Mexico) </h2><p>  The uniqueness of the beach, located on the Marieta Islands, is that it is isolated from the outside world and is a huge natural pool, closed on top of an overhanging cave.  A thousand years ago after volcanic activity, the Las Marietas archipelago arose, considered one of the most heavenly corners of the Earth.  In 2005, it is recognized as a national reserve, and UNESCO gives it the status of a biosphere reserve.  The island was once explored by the famous traveler Cousteau. </p><h2>  History of the beach </h2><p>  The real attraction of the country was this hidden beach formed by human intervention on the island of Playa del Amor.  Mexico more than a hundred years ago made the deserted Marieta archipelago its testing ground for military trials, and after huge bombs dropped from aircraft, numerous caves formed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hidden beaches of mexico" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1068560.jpg" width="351"></div>

    <p>  By the way, it was after the intervention of Jacques-Yves Cousteau in the 60s that numerous protests began to ban the bombing of the island.  It is all the more surprising that vandal destruction methods have led to the creation of an ecological miracle.  Eighteen years ago, the hidden beach, hidden from view, was recognized as the most beautiful in the world.  Mexico became famous thanks to photos posted on social networks, from where the whole world learned about the stunning views of the now popular holiday destination.  Now in a national park, covering 1,400 hectares, any production, fishing and hunting is prohibited, so as not to harm the populations of rare fish and birds that live on the island. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  At least ninety-two species of local and migratory waterfowl, including penguins, have found refuge in the national reserve.  On the island you can observe rare pelican-like cinderella-gannets, humpback whales, as well as laughing gulls and sea swallows.  Populations of diverse reef fish only grow in a favorable climate, and coral colonies surprise with unusual beauty. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hidden beach mexico" class="if" height="443" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1068557.jpg" width="590"></div>
