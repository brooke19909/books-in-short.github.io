And what about Ibiza?  This is where and how to get there?  How is it different from other famous resorts and how is it better than others? </p><p>  So, Ibiza - where is it?  On the world map this island is not so easy to find.  Located 92 km from the Spanish Valencia and 200 km from the northern coast of <span>Africa, the island of</span> Ibiza (Ibiza) belongs to the Balearic Islands - an archipelago under the jurisdiction of Spain.  Of the four large <span>islands of the archipelago</span> (Mallorca, Minorca, Ibiza and Formentera), it takes third place.  Its length is about 40 km, and its width is 20 km.  The population of the island is just over 130 thousand people.  You can get there by ferry from the mainland or by plane. </p><p>  The local climate is very mild.  The temperature in winter on the <span>island of Ibiza</span> (this is where snow and frost are considered a real natural disaster) is rarely below +15 ¬∞ C. The hot season lasts from June to September.  At the same time, the temperature rarely rises above +30 <sup></sup>  due to refreshing light breezes. </p><p>  The water temperature in the sea by July reaches +26 <sup></sup>  and remains until October, making Ibiza unusually comfortable for spending a beach holiday. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ibiza is where" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12502/298040.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Island history</strong> </p><p>  Despite the fact that the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthis island is just over 500 km <sup>2</sup> , people began to settle here since ancient times.  Thanks to the Carthaginians, who found out where the island of Ibiza is located, even seven centuries BC, it became a major cultural and commercial center of almost the entire Mediterranean, and, consequently, a tidbit for all kinds of conquerors and lovers of easy money.  In 123 BC  Ibiza began to belong to the Roman Empire, and later (in the 19th century AD) Arabs settled here.  However, they were not able to keep the island.  In 1235, the Catalans came here.  They destroyed the mosque, built a cathedral (which, by the way, has survived to the present day) and renamed all settlements.  Nevertheless, the Arab culture left an indelible mark that can be traced not only in the general culture of the inhabitants of the island, but also in the local dialect. </p><p>  Ibiza currently belongs to Spain, however, according to the autonomous charter, it is believed that the inhabitants of the Balearic Islands are one of the peoples of Spain, and therefore, along with Spanish, the Catalan language is also widely spoken, having the status of an official language. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the island of Ibiza" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12502/298039.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Tourist paradise</strong> </p><p>  Ibiza is rightfully considered an island of happiness.  Here, literally everything is unique - the sun, sky, air, water and, of course, people.  The scenery here is truly mesmerizing.  Ibiza is where the endless turquoise sky stretches over the boundless blue sea, lush green vegetation and, of course, unique snow-white beaches. </p><p>  The main centers on the island are the cities of Ibiza and San Antonio.  In these cities the medieval spirit and modern look are harmoniously combined.  These are narrow cobbled streets with small shops where you can buy the most fashionable clothes, unique souvenirs.  The promenade of San Antonio is especially impressive, where you can see the snow-white chic yachts of the richest people in the world who have arrived here - millionaires, Hollywood stars and stars of show business, famous top models and famous athletes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ibiza is where on the map" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12502/298037.jpg" width="600"></div>
