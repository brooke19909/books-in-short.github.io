Lack of vowels</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  All modern alphabets are descended from the ancients, which were created several millennia ago.  Years passed, the writing gradually changed and improved.  But what was the source?  This article will discuss one of the progenitors of modern alphabets - the Phoenician. </p><p>  Phoenician writing is an alphabetic writing that originated in ancient times.  It appeared in the 15th century BC.  In addition to some exceptions, this writing has become the progenitor of all the alphabets existing in the world. </p><h2>  What prompted the Phoenicians to create their own written language </h2><p>  Phenicia was located in those days on the territory that is now occupied by Israel, Lebanon and Syria.  The alphabet began to be improved, since simpler and more accessible written communication was required.  At that time, trade relations and shipping were developing.  But as a result of the improvement of the alphabet, some difficulties appeared.  What is the main drawback of Phoenician writing?  This is undoubtedly the absence of vowels in it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is the main flaw of the Phoenician writing" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/706633.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  History of the Phoenician Alphabet </h2><p>  Initially, there was an Egyptian hieroglyphics.  But since it was quite complex, the Hyksos conquerors made it a little easier.  The result is 26 characters.  But the Hyksos did not have time to develop their writing. </p><p>  Then the Phoenicians continued to perfect the alphabet.  As a basis, they took the simplified Egyptian script created by the Hyksos.  But as a result, some difficulties appeared.  To the question of what is the main drawback of Phoenician writing, it is safe to answer that this is the absence of vowels.  This prevented perfect writing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Phoenician letter" class="if" height="456" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/706632.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Disadvantages of Phoenician Writing </h2><p>  In any writing, in addition to the merits, there are some errors.  So what is the main drawback of Phoenician writing?  This is consonance.  In other words, the absence of vowels.  Because of this feature, reading was difficult.  For a normal understanding, excellent knowledge of Phoenician writing was required.  In some sections of the text, one had to use his ingenuity. </p><p>  What is the main drawback of Phoenician writing?  You can answer in more detail.  All letters of the alphabet (and the <span>roots of words)</span> consisted only of consonants.  But there were still vowels, they were only used in syllables and served as a connection between words.  Therefore, reading was rather inconvenient and difficult. </p>
