This region is also called Krasnodar.  It so happened that it was the Krasnodar Territory that became the most popular resort, tourist, historical and natural region of the country.  It is here that the purest rivers flow, the seas most visited by Russian tourists are located and friendly people live.  And in the middle of all this splendor is the wonderful city of Temryuk. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="temryuk sights" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/466879.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is it located and how did it originate? </h2><p>  If you look at Temryuk on a map, you can see that it is located in the center of the Temryuk district (in the Krasnodar Territory).  The city is located on the right side <span>of the Kuban River,</span> in the place where it flows into the Temryuk Bay of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov. </p><p>  Taman lands have always been attractive to people: mild climate, fertile soil, magnificent nature.  Here, from time to time, small and rather large settlements appeared: they flourished, experienced times of death, some were reborn again, others were forever erased from the face of the earth.  In the twelfth century, at this place was the Genoese colony of Cope.  But it ceased to exist a century later as a result of the invasion of the Mongol-Tatars. </p><p>  In 1556, Tumnev was destroyed by the Kabardian prince Temryuk.  The Russian troops helped him in this.  And at this place the commander erected a fortress, which he called his name.  But the prince did not own it for long, only fifteen years.  After this time, she became the property of the Crimean Khan, who called her Adis. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1778, Temryuk (Krasnodar Territory) became part of Russia.  The Starotemryuk fortification was erected here.  In the thirties of the nineteenth century, a hen belonging to the Black Sea Cossacks formed near it.  In 1843 he was transformed into a village.  And in 1860, the village became a full-fledged city with a certain status. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Temryuk Krasnodar Territory" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/466880.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Temryuk in the twentieth century </h2><p>  At the beginning of the last century, a seaport began to operate in the city.  As a result of the civil war, Temryuk was severely destroyed.  He changed hands twice.  No less damage was inflicted to the village during the Great Patriotic War. </p><p>  At the end of hostilities, the importance of the Temryuk port fell significantly.  The port began to revive after many decades, when the Soviet Union collapsed.  Only at the end of the twentieth century Temryuk (Krasnodar Territory) was honored to receive the status of a port of international importance.  Modern Temryuk is a tourist center and a famous port-type city.  And at the beginning of this century, the entire Taman Peninsula was declared a federal resort. </p><h2>  Temryuk: attractions </h2><p>  There is something to see in this city.  After all, this is a historical place, and therefore there are many architectural, natural and other masterpieces here.  Many, for example, are interested in the Rotten Mountain, which arose at the end of the winter of 1815.  It was then that the <span>volcano erupted.</span>  Its lava filled a small lake and thereby formed an elevation that reached around one kilometer in circumference.  The mountain is located next to the Zverosovkhoz stop, which is in the southeast of the city itself.  Rotten Mountain - a volcano, active to this day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="temryuk sightseeing tours" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/466881.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Temryuk also has attractions such as the Mikhail Yuryevich Lermontov House Museum, the Turkish Fountain, the Church of the Intercession and others.  In the Lermontov Museum you can see the poet‚Äôs two journeys to Taman.  The Turkish Fountain is a monument three hundred years ago, and the Church of the Intercession is considered the first Orthodox church in Taman. </p><h2>  Rest and excursions </h2><p>  This wonderful city is known for its mud volcanoes.  In the central part of Temryuk is one of the largest, we mentioned above about the other - this is Rotten Mountain.  There are small private hotels in Temryuk, most of them were built not so long ago.  You can also rent an apartment or a room in the private sector.  And outside the city there are affordable recreation centers and a children's camp.  The central streets of the city boast cozy cafes, numerous shops, a well-groomed central park with amusement rides.  The local market offers its residents and guests cheap vegetables, watermelons, fruits for every taste, melon.  All this is grown by local farmers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="temryuk sea" class="if" height="416" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/466884.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  All comers are invited by the city of Temryuk.  Sights, excursions introducing the history of these places will appeal to every traveler.  To get to know the whole <span>Taman Peninsula,</span> you can choose one or more routes in the city‚Äôs tour bureaus. </p><h2>  Some more places worth seeing </h2><p>  Temryuk (Krasnodar Territory) is also the tract ‚ÄúOak Forest‚Äù, located between Starotitarovsky and <span>Akhtanizovsky estuaries.</span>  This place is an extinct volcano, reaching a height of 76 meters above sea level.  Among the places that you should definitely visit, I would like to introduce the Taman-Zaporizhzhya Nature Reserve, covering an area of ‚Äã‚Äãthirty thousand hectares.  Here live swans, pintails, sea blacks, coots and other rare birds and animals. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Temryuk city" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/466882.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov </h2><p>  Near the city there is a beach.  But few come here.  Most guests, and the Temryukovites themselves, prefer to overcome a little more than four kilometers and soak up one of the luxurious beaches of shell origin, which are located in the village of Golubitskaya.  Temryuk, the sea off the coast of which is called the Azov Sea, has everything you need for a beach holiday.  There are many hotels, recreation centers, hotels, private rooms and apartments.  The resort infrastructure is also well developed. </p><p>  In the village, the most famous natural attraction is a lake with healing mud.  It is located near the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov.  It occupies a pond of five hundred square meters, its depth is one and a half meters.  The shallow depth makes the mud procedures comfortable and practically safe even for the smallest vacationers.  Local mud is enriched with bromine, calcium, hydrogen sulfide and iodine. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Temryuk on the map" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/466883.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Symbolism of Temryuk </h2><p>  Temryuk (its attractions and resorts) every year causes more and more interest among lovers of seaside recreation.  For a more complete acquaintance with Temryuk, let's talk about his coat of arms and flag.  The local coat of arms, as it is known today, was approved on December 29, 2005.  The heraldic shield depicts the sea, a golden anchor, a bunch of grapes and two fish.  An anchor symbolizes calm, reliability and firmness.  A pair of fish is a symbol of the current city as a center of <span>fisheries</span> and fishing.  A bunch of grapes has become a reflection of the main agricultural sector of the village.  The flag is a simplified imitation of the city coat of arms.  A lot of fun in Temryuk on the birthday of the city, which is celebrated annually on the last September weekend. </p><h2>  Modern Temryuk </h2><p>  Today the population of the city is 36 thousand people.  This is a quiet place, the inhabitants of which are very welcoming and friendly.  Temryuk, whose sights are not only museum reserves, but also a huge fish market, the city is prosperous.  An important role in the economic development of the city is played by the local port.  <span>Temryuk port</span> has a huge cargo turnover.  Also, tourism is not the last place in the development of the economy of a settlement. </p><p>  Visit this fabulous city, and everyday bustle will recede into the background, providing a place of joy and fun! </p>
