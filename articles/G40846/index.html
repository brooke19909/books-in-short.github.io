So, in Lublino, the shopping center ‚ÄúMoscow‚Äù became one of the first <span>trade and fair complexes</span> that implements the concept of the Department of Commerce of the capital to provide the population with goods in bulk and retail. </p><h2>  general characteristics </h2><p>  Initially, the market in Lyublino shopping center "Moscow" was opened to meet the needs of residents of nearby areas.  Here it was possible to buy first and second necessities at an affordable price. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lyublino shopping center moscow" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/1217914.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  For these purposes, equipped with 175,000 square meters.  m more than 5,000 retail locations.  The shopping center itself is not only a two-story building, where there are retail outlets, catering places, an ice rink and a cinema, it is also 2 construction markets that are located nearby, and a parking lot for 8,000 places.  From 30 to 70 thousand people visit the center daily, not only from the capital, but also from the regions. </p><h2>  The main groups of goods in the market </h2><p>  Most often in Lublin shopping center "Moscow" people come for clothes.  Here is one of the largest jeans markets in the region.  Moreover, their prices are much lower than even in provincial cities, which allows entrepreneurs to purchase here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are also household appliances on the market: from players and mobile phones, to televisions and refrigerators. </p><p>  On the second floor there are points selling clothing for adults and children, interior textiles and bedding, jewelry, accessories and leather goods. </p><p>  The structure of the shopping center includes two construction markets: one of them offers goods for repair, and the second sells everything for construction. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lyublino shopping center moscow address" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/1217916.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The assortment of the market is constantly expanding and updated in accordance with current trends.  But along with this, many notice a significant drop in the quality of goods offered at the Moscow Shopping Center.  Therefore, it is worth purchasing them with special care. </p><h2>  Skating rink and cinema in the shopping center "Moscow" (Lublino) </h2><p>  In order for the pastime in the shopping center to be comfortable, recreation areas are equipped here.  This is primarily an ice rink that operates year-round.  Therefore, people who come here for company with friends or relatives, but don‚Äôt want to shop, can skate in their free time. </p><p>  There used to be a cinema here, but visitors note that it has not been working for several months, so visiting it has become impossible. </p><p>  But the entertainment center "Balls and pins" receives visitors today.  Some young people come to the mall only to spend their leisure time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cinema in shopping center Moscow Lyublino" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/1217915.jpg" width="600"></div>

The rooms in it do not have a high level of comfort, but the cost of living is also not very high, when compared with other hotels. </p><h2>  The cafe and fast food system in the center </h2><p>  In Lublin, the Moscow Shopping Center offers a wide selection of Asian cuisine in a variety of cafes located on the second floor of the center.  Since most of the sellers in the complex are representatives of Asia, places to eat delicious food are open to their taste. </p><p>  Visitors to the complex can taste Chinese, Vietnamese, Tatar, Kyrgyz cuisine.  At the same time, the cooks are representatives of those nations whose cuisine they cook. </p><p>  For lovers of more traditional food, you can find a couple of cafes with European cuisine.  But in any case, you need to carefully approach the choice of the place where you are going to have a bite.  According to visitors, most of them do not adhere to sanitary standards, which often causes food poisoning.  Despite this, the food here is delicious, and many visitors specially go here for lunch or dinner. </p><h2>  Positive and negative reviews about the center </h2><p>  Many attend the largest shopping center Lublino "Moscow".  The metro is a short walk away.  This fact can be called positive, as is the fact that retail and wholesale prices are among the lowest in the capital.  But in order to find a worthy thing, you must still look carefully.  In addition, many visitors note that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find retail points of sale every year. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Market in Lublin shopping mall Moscow" class="if" height="499" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/1217918.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  And after the closure of the Cherkizovsky market and the transfer of some sellers here, the atmosphere here became almost unbearable. </p><p>  Buyers say it‚Äôs almost impossible to walk between the rows.  In the aisles, the Chinese constantly run around with carts, which strive to run into a visitor.  And Russian-speaking sellers in the market are becoming less and less.  Which also lowers the level of attendance in the Lublin shopping center "Moscow". </p><p>  Its address is Tikhoretsky Boulevard, Building 1. It is very close to the Moscow Ring Road.  At the same time, Lublino is located almost in the center of the capital, which makes it accessible to almost any citizen of Moscow and Moscow Region. </p><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  In Lublino, the Moscow Shopping Center plays an important role not only for this district or for the capital, but also for all neighboring regions, from which many wholesale buyers come to purchase goods for their business. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="shopping center lyublino moscow metro" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/1217917.jpg" width="426"></div>

    <p>  To skimp here normally, it is better to come in the morning, immediately after opening.  At this time, there are still not so many visitors, and the attendants still do not run along the aisles with wheelbarrows.  If there is no time to enter early in the morning, then you need to be in time before 17.00.  Although the center is open until eight in the evening, most sellers fold and close around seventeen hours. </p><p>  If you learn to buy and bargain in this market, then you can get good things at affordable prices.  If you get here by accident, then most likely you will not get anything good.  Meeting a marriage here is as easy as significantly overpriced. </p>
