However, once having seen this unique palace in photography, I want to visit this seaside city and get to know it firsthand.  The pavilion is interesting not only with an exotic appearance in the Indo-Chinese style, magnificent interior decoration, but also with a fascinating history. </p><p>  In the article we will introduce readers to the Royal Pavilion of Great Britain in detail, tell us where it is, how to get there from London.  It will be interesting to know all the details of the history of the structure. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="50.8223517" data-lng="-0.13768549999997504" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/9/0/9/4909.png"></div><h2>  A Brief History of Brighton </h2><p>  Bristemestune is a medieval small town on the coast, the inhabitants of which were engaged in fishing, trading with neighboring villages.  Fishing boats, setting sail for the sea, were guided by the top of St. Nicholas Church.  Not only was it a lighthouse leading sailors to their native shores, Saint Nicholas was considered the patron saint of fishermen. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.welovebrighton.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="royal pavilion in england" class="if uuid-2576670" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2576670.jpg"></div><p>  In the summer of 1514, during the war with the French, the city was burned down by enemy troops, only a small part of the church remained.  After the war, the city was called Brighthelmstone.  He gradually recovered, and the fishing fleet engaged in fishing.  Under Queen Elizabeth I at the end of the 15th century, ships of good quality and stable during a storm were used, which fishermen pulled beautifully onto a pebble beach.  However, trouble came unexpectedly.  Several storms completely destroyed the coast, most of the embankment collapsed.  Residents lost their main income from the sea, and the city, renamed for the third time in Brighton, fell into decay. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Dr. Russell's Marine Treatment </h2><p>  The city received a new life completely unexpectedly.  In 1750, Richard Russell published his doctoral dissertation, which talked about the benefits of sea baths, exercise for people with gout and other diseases, described the benefits of iodine in sea water.  The popular approval of the article had an effect on Brighton residents, and apartment houses for doctor's patients quickly grew at the seaside resort.  From other cities in England, vacationers stretched to Brighton for popular procedures with sea water.  Residents of the city perked up, because now they were all in business.  Special bathing machines were built, which on wheels with the help of bathers sent Russell's patients into sea water. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pixabay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="royal pavilion tower" class="if uuid-2576629" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2576629.jpg"></div><p>  The prince of Wales, whom the local "bather" Smoaker Miles taught to swim, decided to undergo treatment with a famous doctor and suffering from gout.  The procedures took place year-round, some bathed even in winter, but for the rest, sea pools were built. </p><h2>  Prince of Wales desire </h2><p>  The Royal Pavilion was built in Brighton for George IV, who came to treat his swollen glands around his neck.  The prince really liked to be away from the gusts of his father‚Äôs court, which fetters him.  Hiding, supposedly for procedures on the seashore, the prince arranged magnificent receptions, races, theatrical performances and gambling in the rented house, gathering his friends around him. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="pixabay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beauty of the royal pavilion" class="if uuid-2576631" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2576631.jpg"></div><p>  The solitude of the Royal Pavilion allowed the prince to enjoy not only the company of his comrades.  In his life there was an illegal connection with Maria Fitserberg.  His father was against marrying the prince to a girl, and then George went against his parent and secretly married Mary in 1785.  With his beloved woman, he spent all his free time in Brighton.  Even when, on the orders of his father, the prince was forced to marry his cousin, and they had a daughter, he did not cease to meet his beloved Mary in the Royal Pavilion. </p><h2>  History of the building </h2><p>  When George IV first arrived in Brighton for medical bathing, he rented a beautiful mansion farmer Thomas Kemp.  Deciding to stay in the city for a long time, the prince in 1787 called the architect Henry Holland to reconstruct the house.  He made several changes, completing the central dome, and tiled this marine pavilion in the neoclassical style.  Even after the first reconstruction, the building stood out against the background of neighboring buildings of simple brick and stone. </p><p>  The second reconstruction of the beloved Royal Pavilion of the Prince was already undertaken by another architect, John Nash, who made significant changes both in the exterior of the building and in its interior decoration.  It was under reconstruction for a long 7 years, and already in 1823 everyone saw the eastern appearance of the building. </p><div class="photo" data-original="footage.framepool.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="royal pavilion from above" class="if uuid-2576634" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2576634.jpg"></div><p>  During this period, the Prince of Wales became first regent, and since 1820 - King George IV.  However, the monarch did not increase the size of the house to emphasize his position in society, but still the king was criticized by his subjects for extravagance.  During the construction period there was a war, revolutionary events took place in France and America.  Some ministers were afraid that the reckless behavior of the monarch would lead Britain to similar sentiments of citizens suffering from lack of money and unemployment.  But the king did not pay attention to criticism, and the Royal Pavilion turned out to be extravagant.  In design, architect Nash mixed Indian, Chinese, Saracen and Moorish motifs.  He decorated the building with openwork terraces, bulbous domes, pipes that look like minarets, side towers that resemble pagodas. </p><h2>  Interior decoration </h2><p>  The premises of the palace are somewhat pompous, the king wanted to show luxury to foreign guests, so often the interior and furniture did not have functional significance.  For a long time the palace was not used, during the Second World War the hospital for the wounded was located there, therefore, partially the interior decoration was lost. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.victoriana.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="banquet hall chandelier" class="if uuid-2576662" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2576662.jpg"></div><p>  Now the Royal Pavilion in England is restored according to old engravings and surviving drawings. </p><p>  Tourists visiting the museum these days are impressed by the lobby, the banquet hall with a domed ceiling and a crystal chandelier that weighs 1 ton and is 9 meters long.  Amazing guests and the room is a huge kitchen. </p><h2>  additional information </h2><p>  The maritime pavilion is built in the center of Brighton, a 10-minute walk from the sea coast.  You can get to it from any <span>London station</span> by National Rail trains, it takes only 2 hours to go. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.artfund.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lobby of the royal pavilion" class="if uuid-2576676" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2576676.jpg"></div><p>  Using a rented car, get even faster.  You need to go on the highway M23 / A23.  There is no place to park a car in the city center, where the Royal Pavilion is located, so it is recommended to stop at parking lots on the outskirts of the city.  The museum is open from 10:00 to 17:00.  The price of an adult ticket is 10 pounds.  In the season of tourist influx, from April to October, the museum is open from 9:30 to 17:45.  The museum is closed for Christmas for 2 days. </p>
