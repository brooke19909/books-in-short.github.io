  <section class="page js-page"><h1>International economic relations and their significance</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The global economy is in constant development.  An integral part of it is considered to be <span>international economic</span> relations.  It is they who become the engine of cooperation between different countries in the world market.  All participants in the world market are subjects of international relations and make up the <span>world economy.</span> </p><p>  Today, the most massive is the cooperation of individual countries and their regions with each other.  Therefore, we can say that international economic relations are the interaction between individual representatives of all countries associated with commodity-money transactions. </p><p>  This system is quite complex and looks like multilevel international economic relations not only within the country as a whole, but even between individual companies and organizations of many countries. </p><p>  What distinguishes such interaction at the global level from internal relations within a single country? </p><p>  First of all, it is a covered territory.  International economic relations are not limited to national borders.  In this regard, large resources are involved in the process and their movement over long distances arises.  In addition, such cooperation involves the emergence of competition on a larger scale.  The result of such a struggle can be significant losses of manufacturers and other participants in the process. </p><p>  International economic relations presuppose the presence of certain infrastructure features and standards that meet world requirements.  This is a whole system of <span>international transport,</span> transport and communications, information technology. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  International <span>economic relations are</span> developing in accordance with the situation on the world currency market. </p><p>  This is a system associated not only with the development of the economy of each country, but with the political situation in the world. </p><p>  Forms of international economic relations imply cooperation between countries at the micro and macro levels. </p><p>  The macro level is the relationship of the economy of the whole country in the world market.  These include the country's foreign trade or the global movement of factors of production. </p><p>  But some large companies of any state can also become a participant in international relations. </p><p>  Highlighting the main forms of international economic relations, it must be said that <span>this is cooperation</span> in the field of import and export of products, services, scientific developments and production technologies.  A major role in these relations is played by the movement of capital. </p><p>  Any goods (raw materials, various materials, finished products, etc.) can be classified as objects of relations at the highest economic level. In addition, objects rendered at the international level, technologies <span>(trademarks,</span> patents, etc.) are also referred to objects. strength (international labor market) and capital (investments, loans, etc.). </p><p>  All companies, firms, unions and other forms of economic activity that carry out it on the world market are classified as subjects of international relations in the economy at the micro level. </p><p>  If we consider the macro level, then here the main participants are government bodies and the government. </p><p>  All forms are interconnected and constitute a single system.  There is a mechanism that regulates international relations in the global market.  It includes legal norms, acts and standards that are binding on all participants in this process.  They are developed and approved on the basis of the requirements of all participants with the involvement of regional and national representatives. </p><p>  International economic relations is a complex system, the participants of which are countries and their <span>economic entities.</span> </p>
