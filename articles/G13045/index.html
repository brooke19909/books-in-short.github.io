Account closing</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Any form of business involves cash flow.  <span>Individual entrepreneurs</span> with a small amount of work in the early stages of business development can accept payment for goods and services in the form of cash.  But sooner or later, the moment comes when there is a need to open a settlement account.  This does not mean that you need to immediately run to the bank and submit documents.  First you need to determine the general procedure for opening, maintaining and closing an account.  Then you need to analyze the conditions of different banks and choose the best option for yourself. </p><h2>  Why do I need a Sberbank account </h2><p>  From the point of view of legislation, the decision to open an account is made by the entrepreneur independently.  If the cash settlement scheme does not contradict the laws of the Russian Federation, then IE and LLC may not contact the bank at all on this issue.  Another thing is that the full functioning of an LLC without a current account is impossible.  For example, if an enterprise enters into a contract for a total amount of 100,000 rubles, then such a payment must necessarily be made through a bank.  This amount is statistically the lower limit of the value of LLC contracts.  In addition, taxes and other obligatory payments are paid exclusively by bank transfer.  It turns out that the account of the organization is simply necessary. </p>

The application and all documents of the client are returned to his representative on receipt of receipt. </p><h2>  FE Account Management Features </h2><p>  An individual account can be opened in any bank of the Russian Federation.  But the question is that some institutions have high tariffs for servicing such accounts.  Banks often share the fees for servicing limited liability companies and individual entrepreneurs with payment for the last two hundred rubles per month, provided that the number of transactions on the account was no more than twenty units per month.  If there were no transactions at all, then no commission will be charged.  Since individual entrepreneurs often work remotely, the availability of free Internet banking to quickly check balances and send payments will be a great advantage when choosing a bank for service. </p>

    <p>  Before concluding an agreement, you must pay attention to the cost of the following services: </p><p>  - opening, closing, maintaining an account; </p><p>  - connections and services of Internet banking; </p><p>  - fees for transferring funds to accounts in current and other banks. </p><h2>  Features of the withdrawal of funds from IP accounts </h2><p>  If the opening procedure for the LLC and the <span>individual entrepreneur is</span> relatively the same, then when removing the salary by an <span>individual entrepreneur</span> , questions may arise.  All funds in the current account belong to the entrepreneur.  According to the law of the Russian Federation, all entrepreneurial income received as a result of entrepreneurial activity, the entrepreneur manages independently.  In theory, you can deposit and withdraw funds for personal purposes from the account at any time.  In practice, it is better not to use an account for business activities for third-party purposes. </p>

    <p>  But if the settlement account is an account for transactions from entrepreneurial activity, then the question arises of how to withdraw the earned funds of an individual entrepreneur.  The best option is to transfer funds from the settlement account to the current account of an individual.  In the comments to the payment in such cases, it is necessary to indicate "Transfer of own funds, VAT is not taxed." </p><p>  The leaders of the LLC by law do not have the right to dispose of funds in the current account of a legal entity for personal purposes. </p><h2>  Termination of service </h2><p>  Closing a current account - <span>terminating a</span> banking service <span>agreement</span> .  According to the law, a contract can be terminated: </p><p>  - by agreement of the parties; </p><p>  - unilaterally; </p><p>  - based on a court decision; </p><p>  - for other reasons provided by law. </p>

    <p>  Unilaterally, at the initiative of the bank, a settlement account may be closed.  This means that the contract can be terminated by the court due to the lack of operations within 365 days.  If there are no transactions on the account within two years, the bank may refuse to service and terminate the contract two months after the day the corresponding notification was sent to the client. </p><p>  Also, unilaterally at the initiative of the client, a settlement account can be closed.  This means that the client can write an application for termination of service at any time.  The presence of unpaid documents is not a reason for refusing to close an account. </p><p>  By decision of the court, account maintenance may be stopped in the following cases: </p><p>  1. In the absence of money in the account, the contract is terminated.  The client can open a new account only after the cancellation of the decision by the tax authority. </p><p>  2. If there is money in the account, two options are possible: </p><p>  - the contract is not terminated and the account is not closed until the decision to suspend the service is canceled; </p><p>  - the contract is terminated, the account is not closed until the decision to suspend the service is canceled. </p><h2>  Special cases </h2><p>  The termination of service occurs on the day the bank receives a written application from the client, unless a later date is indicated in the application itself.  If at this moment there are funds in the account, the balance is issued to the client from the bank's cash desk or transferred to the account indicated by the client within seven calendar days.  In the absence of details for the transfer or assignees of the client, the funds may be stored in a special <span>off-balance account</span> until the expiration of the limitation period.  After that, they will be written off to the bank‚Äôs income.  Any money and settlement documents received by the bank after the close of the contract are returned to the sender with the corresponding mark.  If there is no opportunity to send money and documents to the client‚Äôs receiver, for example, the bank has closed, then they (money and documents) are stored in the legal department of the bank.  All customer documents are subject to inventory. </p>
