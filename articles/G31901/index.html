The store was loved by customers with its concept of inexpensive goods, and over the past ten years it has become very popular throughout the country.  Ikea was opened in many large cities throughout Russia: in <span>Moscow, St. Petersburg,</span> Rostov-on-Don, Omsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod, Kazan and others. Until now, this brand is one of the most stylish and high-quality firms producing furniture and other decor items in their price segment. </p><h2>  Why is the Ikea store so popular in Russia? <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ikea how to get a warm camp" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/1984712.jpg"></div></h2><p>  Its popularity in our country can be explained by the fact that this brand is famous for affordable prices and convenient location near shopping centers.  The price tag for goods remains low, because the assortment presented by Ikea is made from recycled materials, which, to one extent or another, indicates the environmental friendliness of the products.  In addition, the store has a wide range of colors for various household furniture, utensils, etc., which undoubtedly attracts customers.  As well as free pencils, which at one time magically increased the store‚Äôs revenue by about 7%.  Let us turn our attention to Ikea stores, which are located in Moscow. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where are Ikea stores in Moscow? </h2><p>  In the capital, Ikea stores are located at three different points in the city: </p><ul><li>  Teply Stan in the south-west of the capital; </li><li>  Khimki in the northwest; </li><li>  Belaya Dacha in the southeast. </li></ul><p>  How to get to "Ikea" ("Teply Stan"), we will consider a little lower. </p><p>  All "Ikea" are located outside the Moscow Ring Road, so they can not be reached simply by metro without additional transport.  If you are going to visit this store for the first time, then plan your trip carefully in advance.  Usually, there are free buses (which alas, but have long been paid due to the large number of visitors) to the <span>Mega shopping and entertainment centers,</span> near which Ikea is located, from the metro or minibuses.  Of course, if you have your own car, then you can easily reach your destination on your own. </p><h2>  In "Ikea" by personal transport </h2>

    <p>  Since all buses stop in front of the main entrance to Mega (Teply Stan), you need to take into account the opening hours and the shopping center.  Despite the fact that the mall itself works in the same way as Ikea, i.e.  <span>from 10.00</span> - 24.00 hours, so if you take your own bus, keep in mind that on Fridays and Saturdays they finish their work at 00.30, and on other days at 23.30. </p><p>  We hope that this article was useful to you, and the information on how to get to "Ikea" on the "Teply Stan" was relevant for you and certainly helped you to make a successful shopping! </p>
