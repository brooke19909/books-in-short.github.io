Popular are not only its islands, but also the mainland.  On the continent, spring comes earlier than in the middle of the sea chilled during the winter.  Therefore, if you go to Greece in May, then to the mainland.  The Aegean Sea at the continental plume warms up very quickly, and you can swim comfortably already at the end of April. </p><p>  Where exactly to go to mainland Greece?  Halkidiki Peninsula is very popular among tourists.  On the map, it resembles a hand with fingers.  And one such ‚Äúfinger‚Äù is the Kassandra Peninsula.  The most beautiful in this place is Cape Sani.  It is declared an ecological reserve.  Nevertheless, hotels are located in this beautiful natural area with dense pine thickets and golden beaches.  And in this article we will talk about one of them - Sani Beach 5 *.  We built the description of the hotel on real reviews from tourists. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dreamtours.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Greece in May" class="if uuid-3229871" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3229871.jpg"></div><h2>  Location and Management </h2><p>  In the conservation area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than a thousand hectares, along the sandy coast of the Aegean Sea lies the resort "Sani Resort".  It consists of five separate hotels, the name of which is the word Sani.  All hotels are five-star and are on the front page of the sea.  They are designed for different categories of vacationers.  After all, some people like noisy and funny parties, and others give silence and calm.  For example, the Club is more suitable for families with children, and the Porto is more suitable for sports enthusiasts, including boaters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  And the hotel - the heroine of our essay, is a classic.  It will be cozy and good for all categories of vacationers.  The resort has its own harbor - ‚ÄúMarina‚Äù, in which yachts are moored.  From the shore it is bordered by a beautiful promenade.  There are concentrated restaurants and bars of the resort.  From the middle of July until the end of August, the Sani Festival has been held there for the 21st year in a row.  At this time, concerts, performances, exhibitions and dance performances take place every evening.  Hotel "Sani Beach" is located among the beautiful pine forest.  Some rooms include Mount Olympus. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="40.09967940000001" data-lng="23.306704200000013" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/7/5/6/17756.png"></div><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Buildings Sani Beach 5 * were built a long time ago, but quite often undergo a major restoration.  The latter was held in 2014 in building A. The visiting card of this hotel is its location right in the middle of a pine forest.  Trees create a shadow and fill the air with the smell of needles.  In addition to residential buildings, the hotel has several restaurants, a swimming pool, playgrounds for children. </p><p>  Hotel guests will not feel like they are on a reservation.  Guests can freely walk throughout the Sani Resort.  And if they get tired, small electric cars will be at their service, which will take them to the right building for free.  If you want to plunge into the atmosphere of real Greece, then to the nearest village in Halkidiki you will be transferred by a shuttle that leaves from hotels several times a day. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Room Categories </h2><p>  The hotel has 395 guest rooms.  Guests can enjoy panoramic views of the Mediterranean garden, Mount Olympus or the Aegean Sea.  Sani Beach 5 * is proud that only natural materials were used in the construction of the buildings.  And the floors of the rooms are covered with marble.  All guest rooms have their own balconies or verandas. </p><p>  The cheapest category of rooms in the hotel is double eco (in building A).  The bedroom windows overlook a quiet patio.  These rooms are 25 square meters.  m. They have either two twin beds, or one large king size.  For families, the hotel has family rooms.  They are two eco rooms, interconnected by an adjacent door.  Some rooms have a sea view. </p><p>  In building B there are superior rooms.  Junior Suite (35 sq. M.) Consists of a bedroom with a living area.  Spacious furnished balcony overlooks the garden.  Junior suite panorama (40 sq. M.) Is also one-room.  But the view from the balconies opens onto the Aegean Sea and the peak of Olympus.  Family suites on the upper floors of Building B consist of one or two bedrooms and a separate living room.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãsuch rooms is 50 and 70 square meters.  m </p><p>  Family suites with direct access to the beach are located on the ground floor of Building B.  They consist of a living room and one or two bedrooms.  These luxury apartments are 70 and 105 square meters.  m. Recently, the hotel was built building E. It houses chic deluxe family suites.  They also come with one or two bedrooms.  In addition to an impeccably decorated living room, these guest rooms are also distinguished by spacious verandas (35 sq. M.). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Sani Beach 5 *: room description </h2><p>  To give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe luxury prevailing in the rooms of "Sani Beach", we begin the study with the cheapest category - eco.  The last reconstruction in Building A took place in 2014, so new modern furniture was installed in the rooms.  Of household appliances there is a plasma TV that broadcasts satellite (including Russian and music) channels, a free electronic safe, a CD / DVD player, a telephone, air conditioning, which can be adjusted for both cooling and heating with an individual remote control, as well as mini bar. </p><p>  Naturally, all hotel guests can prepare hot drinks in their room.  But for this is not some kind of electric kettle, but a Nespresso coffee machine.  Wi-Fi is free throughout.  The eco-friendly bathroom has a walk-in shower with rain shower.  Luxurious terry bathrobes, slippers and toiletries by Anne Semonin are exclusive.  They clean the rooms twice a day: morning and evening. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sani Beach 5 * - description of rooms" class="if uuid-3229857" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3229857.jpg"></div><h2>  Description of the suites </h2><p>  Now consider what additional services complement the standard set of eco rooms at the Sani Beach 5 * hotel.  We will not stop at the family rooms.  After all, they are simply connected by an adjacent door with eco numbers.  One has a matrimonial bed, and the second has two twin beds.  But the junior suite has some advantages over simple eco.  The king size bed features a Dream Bed orthopedic mattress, premium bedding and a duvet.  Many pillows are available.  The bathroom has two sinks and floor scales. </p><p>  In one or two bedroom suites on the ground floor of Building B, instead of balconies, there is a spacious terrace with armchairs and sun loungers, and even a private garden.  These rooms have direct access to the pool and the beach (the distance to the last is no more than 25 meters).  And in the bathrooms of such suites there is a bathtub and a rain shower.  The deluxe enclosures in E have very spacious verandas.  The bathrooms have a bathtub and two sinks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.telegraph.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sani Beach 5 * on the Aegean Sea" class="if uuid-3229859" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3229859.jpg"></div><h2>  Sled beaches </h2><p>  Many guests were satisfied with the 7-km sandy coast of Busoulas and thought that it was the only one in the resort of Sani.  This beach has been deserving the Blue Flag for several years in a row for its clean coast.  Busoulas is considered the main and adjoins the building In the Sani Beach 5 * hotel.  Sunny Hill and Ammos beaches are steps away from other buildings.  All three coasts are washed by the crystal clear waters of the Aegean Sea. </p><p>  You can talk about the conditions on the beaches for a long time.  Naturally, there are umbrellas with sunbeds covered with soft and comfortable mattresses.  On the beach of the ‚Äúfive‚Äù hotel you expect to see a shower, toilet, changing cabins, lifeguard station, first-aid post, bar.  And all this, of course, is present on the three coasts of Cape Sani.  But there are also many other services. </p><p>  You can use the Beach Buddies service, which provides reserving the best places on the beach, providing newspapers and waiter service.  Tourists with children say that the Busoulas coast is ideal for bathing children.  But adults will have to walk a hundred meters to get to the depths.  Babywatch is available on all three beaches.  Special nannies will ensure that your child does not drown.  Tourists say that there are toys on the beach that children can freely use, including inflatable boats.  Animation conducts various recreational activities on the coasts.  And in the evenings, parties with famous DJs are organized in Busoulas. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.telegraph.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sani Beach 5 *: beach" class="if uuid-3229863" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3229863.jpg"></div><h2>  Pools </h2><p>  "Sani Beach Hotel" is famous for its artificial reservoirs.  There are several pools.  One is in front of Building B, and the second, in the shape of a lagoon, is closer to the beach.  These open-air pools are filled with the purest fresh water.  They have departments for children.  There is another pool at the spa.  Only persons over 16 years old are allowed in it, since it has a powerful jacuzzi that can adversely affect the delicate bones of children.  All pools, like the three beaches, have booths where towels are provided from dawn to dusk. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sani Beach 5 * - pools" class="if uuid-3229856" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3229856.jpg"></div><h2>  Services for children </h2><p>  Greece in May is especially good for toddlers.  There is still no oppressive heat, but the water off the coast of Halkidiki has already warmed up.  Adaptation of the child's body to new conditions will also be quick because food in Greece is not so foreign as in exotic countries.
