  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Russian-Japanese war: the beginning of the end of the Russian Empire.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  From the middle of the 19th century, Russia was quietly and quietly strengthening its positions recently, almost invisibly, isolated and devoid of military power, in Russia.  For more than 50 years, she managed to achieve significant success in the field of industrial development, strengthened the army and navy.  This was greatly facilitated by the fall of the barrier that existed for centuries, which did not allow European and American scientific and technological achievements to penetrate the closed culture of Japan. </p><p>  From the moment Japan began to build up its military potential and at the same time began to think about expanding its more than scarce territories, the Russo-Japanese War became an inevitable phenomenon.  The beginning of the conflict that led to it is customary to designate the period when the interests of the two powers clashed in China.  The gradual strengthening of Russia's position in the Far East, coupled with the expansion of markets threatening England and the United States, led to the outbreak of hostilities. </p><p>  The beginning of the Russo-Japanese War dates from February 8-9, 1905.  Late at night, Japanese troops attacked a Russian squadron standing on a Port Arthur raid.  The surprise effect did not help the Japanese - the night battle did not bring the desired results and the fleet of the Russian army did not suffer significant losses. </p><p>  In addition to sea battles, the enemy‚Äôs plans included land battles.  But for the land landing, the Japanese fleet needed full control of the Yellow Sea.  During its establishment, the legendary death of the cruiser ‚ÄúVaryag‚Äù took place, which the Russo-Japanese War glorified for centuries. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Historians agree that the main reason for Russia's defeat in this confrontation was the incompetence of the command staff, the backlog in terms of armaments and the lack of a clear and clear plan of military operations.  But, despite the fact that the Russian army was quickly losing ground, in the ranks of soldiers and officers until the signing of the peace agreement and even after that there was confidence that the Russo-Japanese war would be won if it continued. </p><p>  But the continuation of hostilities in the Far East did not allow the authorities to concentrate on the struggle against internal opponents that were gaining strength.  That is why Nicholas II decided to sign the absolutely inglorious Portsmouth world, which outraged a huge number of officers by the fact that the blood shed by Russian soldiers was shed in vain. </p><p>  Interestingly, the results of the Russian-Japanese war did not suit not only Russia.  Japan, the victorious country, was also not particularly satisfied with the outcome of the war.  For some period there was even a danger of riots inside the country, since the participants in the war did not see the special advantages that the signed peace gave them. </p><p>  On September 5, 1905, the <span>Portsmouth Peace</span> was nevertheless signed.  According to this document, the Russo-Japanese War led to the following results: </p><ul><li>  Japan took possession of the southern part of Sakhalin Island; </li><li>  Russian troops left the rest of the island; </li><li>  Russia paid the maintenance of prisoners of war to the Japanese treasury; </li><li>  The southern branch of the CER and the rights to the Quatun Peninsula passed to the victorious country. </li></ul><p>  At the same time, the Japanese side remained unsatisfied with the claim to receive the remaining Russian vessels as trophies - the Russian Tsar categorically refused to issue them.  Also, the indemnity, originally declared by the Japanese as a prerequisite for peace, was not paid to the winner.  But the main result of this short war was the fall in the eyes of the people and the nobility of the prestige of the Russian army and the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãautocracy.  The direct consequence of the defeat in the Russo-Japanese war was the <span>first Russian revolution</span> and the further fall of the reigning regime. </p>
