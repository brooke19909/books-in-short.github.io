    <p>  The technology is based on two architectures: PCI Express, as well as DisplayPort.  The main advantage of the technology is its high data transfer rate, as well as its versatility.  It is possible to organize interaction with a wide range of devices - hard drives, multimedia devices.  A port that supports the Thunderbolt standard can transmit a high-resolution video stream through the DisplayPort protocol.  The total maximum power of the equipment connected to the Thunderbolt port is 10 watts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The technology allows you to transfer data both optically and electronically.  The second option is more economical.  But the demand for optical technology implementation is also expected to be palpable. </p><p>  The delay in data transmission within the framework of this standard is minimal - about 8 ns.  To connect devices, it can use a copper cable up to 3 m long or optical cable up to 100 m. Connecting devices to Mac computers equipped with Thunderbolt ports is possible in ‚Äúhot‚Äù mode - without turning off the device. </p>

    <p>  Through optical channels, a data transfer rate of 10 Gbit / s was provided.  It was also noted that it is possible to achieve indicators of 100 Gbit / s.  Intel representatives said that devices equipped with Light Peak could hit the market in 2010.  In multimedia online presentations, it was also shown that Light Peak technology is able to interact with a wide range of devices - cameras, computers, monitors. </p><p>  In May 2010, Intel showed the public a laptop equipped with Light Peak, thereby proving that the interface can be integrated into small-sized devices.  Intel experts also showed how two high-quality video streams can be transmitted simultaneously.  The brand announced that the factory release of controllers supporting the appropriate technology is possible at the end of 2010.  In the fall of 2010, some prototypes of devices that implemented the new standard were shown to the public at the Intel Developer Forum. </p><h2>  Market appearance </h2><p>  In February 2011, the Light Peak standard was implemented under a new name - Thunderbolt on Apple devices.  First, a new port appeared on the MacBook Pro, then on iMac computers, as well as on the MacBook Air, Mac Mini, as well as in monitors from Apple. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Now, on the basis of technology, a large number of devices have already been created.  Among them is Apple's popular Thunderbolt Display.  It is notable primarily for its size.  The number of inches Apple equipped it with is 27. Thunderbolt Display allows you to fully utilize one of the main advantages of the technology - data transfer speed.  Through this resource, a video stream in large resolution and high quality is displayed on a large screen. </p><h2>  Thunderbolt and PCI Express </h2><p>  We talked about Thunderbolt above that it is a technology that combines two standards.  Let's look at how the PCI Express architecture is involved in it.  This standard is high-speed, it is used to integrate various elements of devices such as a Mac - processor, video card, disk.  Thanks to the technological capabilities of PCI Express, the Thunderbolt standard can transfer data at a speed of the order of 10 Gb / s.  At the same time, two channels operate in each port - transmission and reception.  The indicated speed is higher than when using standards such as FireWire 800, or, for example, USB 3.0.  But high speed data transfer is not the only advantage of the technology. </p><h2>  Technology benefits </h2><p>  Among the key features of the technology is versatility.  This standard allows you to transfer the appropriate type of digital data, as well as power through a common port.  Thus, there is no need to connect a large number of cables to the computer.  Another aspect of the versatility of the technology is compatibility with USB ports and the FireWire standard through special adapters.  At the same time, Thunderbolt technology allows devices to operate within the speeds guaranteed by the corresponding interfaces, that is, it does not slow down their operation. </p>

    <p>  The next aspect of the technology‚Äôs versatility is the ability to simultaneously connect up to 6 devices to a single Thunderbolt port in a serial manner.  True, the channel resource will be shared between devices.  To ensure the optimal data transfer speed, it is important that each of the devices that form the chain maintain the appropriate standard without the use of adapters.  Another aspect of the versatility of the technology - compatibility with any processors and chipsets - it does not matter under which particular brand. </p><h2>  Competing Technologies </h2><p>  So, we examined the main advantages of Thunderbolt.  What is this technology, now you know.  But she also has competitors.  Consider their specifics.  The main rival standard for Apple's technology is SuperSpeed ‚Äã‚ÄãUSB, which is also referred to as USB 3.0.  What are its key benefits regarding Apple's solution? </p><p>  Among those: </p><p>  - support for equipment running on previous technology, USB 2.0; </p><p>  - compatibility with modern models of digital technology, motherboards; </p><p>  - growing market demand for the appropriate type of equipment; </p><p>  - The supply voltage is characterized by high power, and this allows you to run various portable devices. </p><p>  There are technological nuances in which the USB 3.0 standard is objectively inferior to Apple's technology.  Namely: </p><p>  - SuperSpeed ‚Äã‚ÄãUSB channel bandwidth is two times lower; </p><p>  - The largest suppliers of system solutions do not practice branded support for the standard; </p><p>  - Do not connect devices in a sequential manner. </p><p>  There is a thesis that SuperSpeed ‚Äã‚ÄãUSB technology will not be a direct competitor to Thunderbolt, which is the standard for another market segment.  Therefore, two interfaces, having both advantages and disadvantages, will be able to quite comfortably be present on the market at the same time. </p><h2>  Second version </h2><p>  Intel and Apple are actively developing the technology.  Thunderbolt 2 has already been introduced to the market. The new technology allows increasing the data transfer rate up to 20 Gbit / s.  Its name, however, sounds almost like the same A-10 Thunderbolt II attack aircraft.  With its help, you can broadcast video in UltraHD format.  Also, thanks to the integrated support of the DisplayPort standard in version 1.2, the new interface can transfer video to two displays operating in QHD mode.  Thunderbolt 2 technology is fully compatible with devices and accessories released as part of the 1st version of the interface. </p><h2>  Thunderbolt devices: monitor </h2><p>  What type of devices supporting the technology in question are common on the market?  Among the most popular devices is the Thunderbolt Display monitor from Apple.  This device has a large diagonal of 27 inches.  The Apple Thunderbolt Display is equipped with an LED backlight.  It is intended for use with Mac series computers, as well as with MacBook laptops.  The main advantages of the display: high resolution, excellent sound quality, the presence of a camera such as FaceTime HD, compatibility with the FireWire 800 standard, as well as with the Gigabit Internet interface.  Of course, all the advantages of Thunderbolt technology allows this device to be fully utilized.  You can also connect peripheral devices to the Apple Thunderbolt Display monitor also through FireWire. </p>

Such an opportunity can significantly increase the versatility of the device. </p><p>  The main <span>characteristics of the hard drive</span> : </p><p>  - data transfer rate - up to 200 MB / s; </p><p>  - the presence of one USB 3.0 port and two connectors such as Thunderbolt 2; </p><p>  - reduced noise emission and high cooling efficiency, thanks to the aluminum housing; </p><p>  - weak vibration due to the presence of shock absorbing elements in the housing structure; </p><p>  - the device is compatible with Time Machine; </p><p>  - In the delivery package, several programs are designed for backing up data; </p><p>  - the hard disk can be upgraded to the SSD model, so the data exchange rate can grow by 5 times; </p><p>  Thanks to the capabilities of Thunderbolt 2, the disk can be used as a powerful tool for <span>backing up</span> big data - for example, high-quality video editing files.  The device comes with a cable to connect to the Thunderbolt connector, a similar component for connecting via USB 3.0 (with compatibility with the earlier standard - USB 2.0), a power supply and installation guide. </p><p>  Of course, the Apple Thunderbolt Display, the LaCie d2 hard drive and Belkin express station are just some examples of devices using the new technology.  Devices that take advantage of the high-speed and universal standard from Intel and Apple are on the market in a wide range.  It is not surprising how many inches Apple equipped its display with - 27 "Thunderbolt Display presents a picture of the highest quality to the user‚Äôs review. Belkin‚Äôs interest in the new technology is also completely explainable - the standard developed by Apple and Intel implies universality, compatibility with a large number of other interfaces, and therefore market demand. </p>
