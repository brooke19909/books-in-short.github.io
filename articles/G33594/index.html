    <p>  Almost all Samsung push-button telephones, reviews of which are mostly positive, cannot boast of a huge display.  The screen of this unit has a diagonal of 1.8 inches with a resolution of 160 x 128 pixels.  He can not boast of the quality of images, since he is endowed with a rather weak camera - 0.3 MP. </p><p>  There is 8 MB of internal memory that can be expanded with memory cards.  A 1000 mAh battery will help the device work for thirteen hours without recharging.  You can buy a device for two thousand rubles. </p>
