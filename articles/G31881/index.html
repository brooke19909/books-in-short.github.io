    <p>  Children also have access to a mini club with all kinds of educational and electronic games, where they can have a great time while their parents relax on the beach or in the bar.  Upon special request, a cot can always be delivered to the room, while the main restaurant has a special menu for little guests and there are special chairs.  For a fee, you can use the services of a nanny who will not only look after the children, but also work out with them. </p><h2>  Business events by the sea </h2><p>  The hotel will also be a great place for holding a working meeting or an outdoor conference.  Indeed, for those who want to combine work with an excellent vacation on the Mediterranean Sea, MC Arancia Resort Hotel 5 * offers a good selection of conference rooms that are equipped with everything necessary for organizing business events. </p><p>  There are three rooms to choose from.

    <p>  The second room with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã60 square meters is suitable for events designed for 120 people.  If you plan to meet an even smaller circle of people, then you should choose the third hall with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãonly 40 square meters.  It can perfectly accommodate up to 50 guests. </p><h2>  Do tourists like MC Arancia Resort? </h2><p>  Read the reviews about the hotel MC Arancia Resort Hotel 5 *, of course, is primarily for those who are going on vacation to Turkey to this particular hotel.  There are a lot of comments, so they will help to make a real impression of the hotel. </p><p>  Of the virtues, tourists who relaxed here noted excellent animators who do their job well and keep all guests in a good mood.  I like the good location of the hotel, because just a few minutes walk from it there is a large shopping center, all kinds of shops where you can buy souvenirs, parks, and the local market.  The restaurant has a large selection of food, everything is tasty and fresh.  Although some guests lacked a variety of fruits and meat. </p>

    <p>  Of the shortcomings of the MC Arancia Resort Hotel 5 * hotel reviews of tourists distinguish not very high-quality housekeeping and a rare replacement of towels.  Guests also indicate that the room stock itself looks already very old.  A lot of discontent is caused by the local Internet.  Free of charge is a very small amount of traffic, everything else is for the money, and quite large.  Moreover, its speed also leaves much to be desired. </p><p>  In general, many write that the hotel MC Arancia Resort is not very attractive for the category of 5 stars.  But here 4 stars can be deservedly assigned to him and relax here for your pleasure. </p>
