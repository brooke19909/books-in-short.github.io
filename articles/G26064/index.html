  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Depth of field - what is it?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, photography is becoming more common.  At the same time, it can rightfully be considered a kind of fine art.  However, art is unusual, as it requires not only a creative approach, imagination, but also technical knowledge. </p><p>  Truly highly artistic photographs can only be taken with a good SLR camera.  At the same time, it is not enough just to possess such a camera, it is necessary to understand it.  And here theoretical knowledge will come in handy.  You need to know what depth of field, aperture and aperture, focal length.  Only knowing the theory, you can use the camera fully. </p><p>  <strong>Basic concepts of photography</strong> </p><p>  For a proper understanding of what is the depth of field, you first need to decide on the concepts of "focal length" and "aperture".  We can say that the <span>focal length</span> is the main thing for removable lenses. </p><p>  The focal length is the distance between the plane of the matrix and the optical center of the lens.  Moreover, the viewing angle of a specific lens is determined by the ratio of the focal length to the diagonal of the matrix.  Accordingly, the shorter the focal length, the wider the viewing angle. </p><p>  To understand what a diaphragm number is, you need to figure out <span>what the</span> lens <span>diaphragm is</span> .  This is essentially a hole through which light passes.  In order for this hole to change, the diaphragm is made of several plates.  When these plates are brought together, the hole decreases and less light enters the lens.  When breeding them, respectively, more light penetrates. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The diaphragmatic number is an indicator that is inversely proportional to the diameter of the hole in the diaphragm.  It is denoted by the letter f.  That is, when f is small, the aperture is wide open. </p><p>  Now let‚Äôs determine what the depth of field of the lens is.  This is the range of clear vision of objects that are in front of and behind the subject.  As it should be clear from the definition, much will depend on what kind of object the focus is on. </p><p>  <strong>What determines the depth of field?</strong> </p><p>  Of course, it is very important for the photographer to know all the above characteristics of the camera, as well as to be able to manage them.  Depth of field may vary depending on several parameters.  The main thing that <span>this indicator</span> depends on <span>is the</span> diaphragm number or the diameter of the diaphragm. </p><p>  The dependence in this case is directly proportional.  That is, the larger the diaphragm number, the stronger the depth of field.  You can feel it yourself by taking pictures of the same subject with a different aperture.  With f / 22 aperture, the depth of field will be greater than with f / 8. </p><p>  Many may think that in this case it is better to take pictures with the aperture as closed as possible, but this is not so.  After all, it is not always necessary for all subjects to be clear to get a good photo.  This is especially true in the case of <span>portraiture.</span>  Often, for a successful portrait, it is necessary that the background is blurred.  This is exactly what you can get by opening the diaphragm wide. </p><p>  Or there are times when you need to focus on a specific part of the face.  Then shooting with a wide aperture is also used. </p><p>  Also, the clarity of the image depends on the <span>lens aperture,</span> that is, the maximum amount of light that can pass through it.  Often for studio shooting, high-aperture lenses are used, which have such maximum bandwidth. </p><p>  If you are going to take pictures outdoors in good natural light, then you absolutely do not need to purchase such a lens.  Since natural light is quite enough to take photos with a clear image of objects. </p>
