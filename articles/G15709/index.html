The most popular transactions are addressed to suppliers of housing and communal services, the Internet and mobile operators.  Sberbank customers can replenish the balance of a mobile without a commission within 1-2 minutes.  There are several options how to put money on the phone with Sberbank. </p><h2>  Payment methods for mobile communications through Sberbank </h2><p>  Clients can replenish the cellular balance not only with a card, but also in cash.  Funds are credited almost instantly. </p><p>  How to transfer money to a phone from Sberbank? </p><ol><li>  With the help of SMS-information service "Mobile Bank". </li><li>  In self-service devices. </li><li>  Via the online bank Sberbank Online. </li><li>  In a mobile application for smartphones. </li><li>  Using the service "Auto payment". </li></ol><h2>  Paying your phone through the Mobile Bank </h2><p>  To use this option, the client must have a bank card with an active SMS information service.  It is allowed to pay for cellular communication if a free package of services - "Economical" is connected.  Sberbank does not charge a fee when using the service to pay a mobile phone bill. </p><div class="photo" data-original="finance.yahoo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to put money on a phone from a sberbank" class="if uuid-3234462" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3234462.jpg"></div><p>  How to put money on the phone from Sberbank at 900? </p><ol><li>  Send a message with the recharge amount to 900. For example, "200". </li><li>  After sending to the client in a response notification, a code will be received to confirm the operation.  It should be entered and sent again SMS. </li><li>  Check the operation by requesting a mobile balance. </li></ol><p>  If the client has several Sberbank cards and wants to send funds from a specific account, SMS to number 900 should be supplemented.  In the first message, a space after the replenishment amount must indicate the last 4 digits of the plastic carrier.  Example: "200 1234", where 1234 is the end of the bank card number. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Paying another customer‚Äôs number via SMS </h2><p>  Sberbank allows you to quickly replenish the balance of a loved one using USSD codes: send notifications to 900. For the operation, the requirements are the same: a bank card with an active Mobile Bank. </p><p>  How to transfer money from Sberbank via phone to another person? </p><ol><li>  In the message to the number 900 it is necessary to indicate the recipient's phone number without the number "8" and the amount of replenishment through a space.  Example: "9102008777 270". </li><li>  Confirm the operation by sending the code in the response message. </li></ol><p>  Money will be debited from one of the cards tied to the number.  There is no commission for replenishing the balance of a phone that is not connected to a Sberbank card. </p><h2>  Mobile payment in Sberbank terminals </h2><p>  In self-service devices, a commission is not charged when paying with a bank card.  Clients can deposit money in cash, but in this case, the bank will charge 5% for transferring money to the phone from Sberbank.  The self-service area is open around the clock. </p><p>  How to put money on the phone from Sberbank in the terminal using a card? </p><ol><li>  Insert the payment tool into the device. </li><li>  Enter code. </li><li>  Go to the "Payments and Transfers" section. </li><li>  Select the "Mobile Communications" function. </li><li>  Enter the phone number without a figure eight. </li><li>  Collect replenishment amount. </li><li>  Check and confirm the operation. </li><li>  Pick up a card. </li></ol><p>  When paying, a check is issued.  It contains details of the operation: phone number, mobile operator and the amount paid. </p><div class="photo" data-original="haberrus.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to transfer money to a phone from a sberbank" class="if uuid-3234459" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3234459.jpg"></div><p>  To pay in cash: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  select the "Top up mobile" tab; </li><li>  determine the operator or immediately dial a phone number; </li><li>  enter the amount of replenishment; </li><li>  check conditions, size of commission; </li><li>  deposit money into the terminal and confirm the payment. </li></ul><p>  When paying in cash, remember that Sberbank ATMs do not give change.

How to put money on your phone with Sberbank Online?  This can be done in 2 ways: through the "Quick Payment" function or the "Transfers and Payments" tab. </p><p>  How to transfer using a quick payment service: </p><ol><li>  Go to "Quick payment" by clicking on the icon with the image of the smartphone. </li><li>  Enter the phone number, amount and debit card. </li><li>  Confirm with code 900. </li><li>  View payment status.  A Done icon means the operation completed successfully. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="thefinanser.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="transfer money from Sberbank to phone number" class="if uuid-3234461" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3234461.jpg"></div><p>  The second option allows you to deposit cash by phone number in the general menu of payments "Sberbank online".  Here's how to make a payment: </p><ul><li>  Click on "Transfers and Payments"; </li><li>  select "Mobile Communications"; </li><li>  go to the operator search or click on the payment "Mobile communications, payment of any phone number"; </li><li>  enter data: phone, amount, debiting account; </li><li>  check and confirm the transfer; </li><li>  view status. </li></ul><p>  The ‚ÄúBank processed‚Äù icon means that the money has not yet been credited, since Sberbank is checking the payment.  It is recommended that you refresh the page and re-check the status of the transaction. </p><h2>  Activation of automatic recharge service </h2><p>  "Auto payment" of Sberbank allows you to forget about the need to deposit funds to the account of a mobile operator.  Money will be transferred automatically in the amount set by the client. </p><p>  The minimum payment is 50 rubles.  Cash is debited from the card after an account balance equal to or less than the specified amount when connected, for example, 30 rubles. </p><p>  Payment is available for a fixed amount with a frequency of write-offs once a week, month, quarter or year.  The service is activated in Sberbank terminals or online banking. </p><div class="photo" data-original="realnoevremya.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to put money on a phone from a sberbank" class="if uuid-3234449" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3234449.jpg"></div><p>  How to activate "Auto Payment" (for example, "Sberbank online")? </p><ol><li>  In the menu "My auto payments" click on "Connect auto payment". </li><li>  Select "Mobile Communications". </li><li>  Find an operator. </li><li>  Fill in the data: amount, write-off account, frequency, type of service, date of next payment, name. </li><li>  Check conditions and confirm. </li></ol><p>  No service fee is charged.  If there is no money on the card, the funds are not debited, the service is suspended. </p><h2>  Translation in a mobile application </h2><p>  The mobile version allows you to make transactions in the Internet bank, which is always at hand.  You can transfer money from Sberbank to a phone number in a mobile application according to the instructions similar to payment through Payments and Transfers in the desktop version of Sberbank Online. </p><div class="photo" data-original="diepresse.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to transfer money from Sberbank via phone" class="if uuid-3234460" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3234460.jpg"></div><p>  The difference between payments is the lack of confirmation: the version of the Internet bank for smartphones does not require entering a code when paying. </p>
