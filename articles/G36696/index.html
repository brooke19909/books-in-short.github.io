On the one hand lies a magnificent fresh lake, on the other - the Black Sea coast.  The hotel offers stunning views of the mountains of Krasnaya Polyana, the sunny coast and a stunning park with freshwater ponds and walking alleys.  From other windows you can watch the life of the Formula-1 race track, as well as watch the stunning Sochi Park. </p><p>  Surely you have already decided to visit the wonderful tourist city called ‚ÄúVelvet Seasons‚Äù (Sochi).  Chistye Prudy reviews dubbed the Russian tropics.  Judging by what seasoned tourists write, the hotel grounds are simply surrounded by greenery.  Even if you do not have the desire or the ability to go beyond the territory, there is something to admire and do.  This is especially important for those who come with elderly parents or young children. </p><h2>  The interior and exterior of the hotel </h2><p>  It was built relatively recently, in 2013.  Accordingly, it is a modern tourist complex, with fashionable furniture, layout and design.  Your best choice if you are going to Sochi is Velvet Seasons Hotel Chistye Prudy.  Judging by the reviews, this is one of the most beautiful places on the coast, and it will completely belong to you.

Frequent guests of the hotel note that during the design of hotels, emphasis was placed on accuracy and minimalism.  The room is decorated with natural materials, clear lines prevail, the contrast of white and black, that is, the true embodiment of the classics.  Cottages are located just 100 meters from the sea, so a walk to the beach strip does not take much time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="in sochi velvet seasons hotel clean ponds" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/990435.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  Before considering trips abroad, think about the opportunity to visit Sochi.  The city hotel Velvet Seasons (Chistye Prudy) provides no less rich opportunities for a good holiday, but the cost of such a trip will be much lower, that is, as a result, you will have free money to buy gifts for your loved ones. </p><p>  You can choose a single standard room, its area is about 20 square meters, that is quite enough for one person.  A single bed and the lack of space for extra bed make it an offer exclusively for bachelors.  The room has a bath and toilet, minibar and air conditioning. </p><p>  Every year a large number of tourists visit the hotel "Clean Ponds" (Sochi).  Reviews emphasize not only the luxurious territory and innumerable opportunities for recreation, but also the attentiveness of the staff.  None of the customer's wishes will be ignored.  If you come alone, then pay attention to the double standard.  Here, in addition to a double bed, there is a place for a folding bed, that is, up to three people can sleep in one room.  The room has a bath and toilet, minibar and air conditioning. </p><p>  For those who like special comfort and coziness, there is a two-room suite, as well as apartments with a large and comfortable kitchen.  Each room is equipped with everything you need, a small refrigerator, TV and air conditioning.  In addition, all apartments have a minibar, however, its filling is not included in the price of the ticket, but is paid separately. </p><h2>  Catering for tourists </h2><p>  For the beautiful nature, amazing conditions and developed infrastructure, tourists are very fond of the Velvet Seasons complex (Sochi).  Chistye Prudy is the standard of the hotel world.  Judging by the reviews of tourists, there are so many opportunities for an excellent vacation that it is impossible to even have time to see everything for a short vacation.  Therefore, there is a reason to return the next year, and then again and again. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel clean ponds sochi reviews" class="if" height="312" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/481436.jpg" width="466"></div>  Nutrition is one of the most controversial issues.  Some admire him, others are satisfied, and still others are always unhappy.  We are all different, it is very difficult to please everyone.  However, apparently, a team of chefs who work in a restaurant, cafe and two bars of the Chistye Prudy complex managed to do this.  The choice of a tourist offers several different systems: no meals, breakfast buffet, breakfast + dinner, three meals a day.  On the territory of the city-hotel there are about 50 different cafes and restaurants, so you can‚Äôt stay hungry here.  Judging by the reviews of vacationers, for 12 days to try all the dishes did not work.  Only breakfast offers several options for omelettes and cereals, various dairy products, casseroles with condensed milk and fruit, yoghurts, sausages with various side dishes, fruits, drinks, various cuts.

If you choose a breakfast + dinner catering system, the cost of these rooms will already be 2150 and 2350 rubles, respectively.  <span>Full board</span> and three meals a day are already 2650 and 2859 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd clean ponds sochi" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/990447.jpg" width="600"></div>  However, many tourists prefer a leisure system without food.  This makes it possible to go to lunch and dinner in different restaurants, each time to try something new.  In addition, this mode allows you to freely choose excursion routes and go to cafes located along the road.

    <h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  ZhK Chistye Prudy (Sochi) offers its guests a comfortable stay in the stunningly beautiful territory of the hotel.  Even just walking along its alleys and sitting in the shade of luxurious trees is already very interesting, but this is far from all.  There are fitness rooms and gyms, an Internet cafe and various beauty salons, hairdressers.  You can rent bicycles and electric cars and ride on special alleys.  However, the most interesting is, of course, excursions.  You can ride in sunny Abkhazia or Krasnaya Polyana, visit protected areas and take a walk in the arboretum.
