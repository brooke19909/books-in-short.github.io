There are three main criteria by which contributions of this type are divided: </p><ul><li>  there is the possibility of replenishment and partial withdrawal; </li><li>  without the possibility of replenishment and withdrawal; </li><li>  only with the possibility of replenishment. </li></ul><p>  Do not forget that no matter what type of product you are considering, you should always conclude a term deposit agreement. </p><p>  Let's consider each in more detail.  Which one to choose is up to you. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  These are three types of term deposits of Sberbank of Russia, aimed at the needs of various categories of citizens.
