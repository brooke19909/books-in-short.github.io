First of all, it saves electricity, ease of installation, the absence of high voltages and other advantages.  This <span>type of lighting</span> appeared relatively recently and has already become very widely used for various purposes. </p><p>  LED strip is a flexible plastic strip on which LEDs are soldered and connected to an electrical circuit.  Thus, they are already ready for operation and for this you only need to connect the power supply to it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to install led strip" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22199/514889.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  The main application of the device is decorating with light from any place or spot lighting.  Due to its brightness and color, it is used in car tuning, in the interiors of restaurants and cafes, in individual home design. </p><p>  However, for all the simplicity of operation and installation, there are features when using this type of lighting.  Before installing the LED strip, you need to select it correctly and determine the power supply capacity.  You also need to know how to cut the right length and connect the power wires.  The lines of this article will tell about all this. </p><h2>  The choice of LED strip glow </h2><p>  Before you make an LED strip, you need to decide what color glow is needed.  There is just white light and colorful.  A ribbon with different colors is labeled RGB (R - red, G - green, B - blue).  In the case of the usual one-color version, there are only two contacts, and in the color - four.  It is worth noting that a multi-colored ribbon can have different modes of glow, and one-color - only one. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Choosing the <span>type of LED strip</span> will also affect the characteristics of the power supply.  It should provide the necessary power and power polarity.  In addition, the power supply must have a power margin of 20% up. </p><p>  It is also worth considering that before connecting an RGB LED strip, you need to plan where the controller will be for it.  Since it is often controlled by a remote control, access to it should be within line of sight. </p><h2>  Calculation of LED strip and power supply </h2><p>  The density of LEDs per meter tape can be different.  Basically it is within 30, 60 and 120 pieces.  There is also a dual wide strip of 240 diodes.  The method of how to calculate the LED strip for its correct operation depends on this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect led strip" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22199/514899.jpg" width="250"></div>

    <p>  For SMD 3528 diodes, the <span>power consumption</span> is: </p><ul><li>  60 diodes per meter consume 4.8 watts. </li><li>  120 diodes per meter consume 7.2 watts. </li><li>  240 diodes per meter consume 16 watts. </li></ul><p>  For SMD 5050 diodes, the power consumption is: </p><ul><li>  30 diodes per meter consume 7.2 watts. </li><li>  60 diodes per meter consume 14 watts. </li><li>  240 diodes per meter consume 25 watts. </li></ul><p>  For all cases, if the length of the tape is more than one meter, it is necessary to summarize the entire load and select the appropriate power supply.  For example, if there are diodes of the SMD 5050 brand on the tape at a density of 60 pieces per meter, and the tape length is 5 meters, then the power supply must be at least 70 watts. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Power supply selection </h2><p>  To properly make an <span>LED strip with your own hands,</span> you need to choose the right <span>power source</span> for it <span>.</span>  After determining the power consumption, you need to determine the type of power supply.  This procedure depends on the location of the backlight.  If the tape will work in harsh outdoor conditions, then you should pay attention to sealed plastic or metal options.  They are completely protected from harmful effects and are compact in size.  But for these advantages you will have to pay a little more. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect the LED strip" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22199/514907.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  If the installation location is located in the room and there is enough space for installation, it is advisable to choose an open power supply.  It, in comparison with the previous options, is larger in size, but its cost is much lower. </p><p>  There are also portable power supplies that look like charging for phones.  They are designed to work in portable devices that do not exceed a power consumption of 60 watts. </p><h2>  Defined with protective properties </h2><p>  To protect against external influences, the LED strip can be coated on top with a protective layer of silicone or transparent plastic.  This applies to those options when an outdoor installation is needed.  If everything will be mounted indoors, then you can use tapes without protection. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The tape in silicone is suitable for use in corridors, large rooms or other places where both mechanical stresses and the likelihood of liquids are possible.  For outdoor use, complete protection is required.  Such a tape is a round elastic rod.  It has full protection against all influences, including temperature.  Therefore, before installing an LED strip of this type, special fasteners may be required. </p><h2>  How to connect two tapes together </h2><p>  For the diodes to work properly, you need to know how to connect the LED strip correctly.  Two options are possible for this purpose.  The first and easiest way in which you need to purchase special connectors, when used in a matter of seconds, you can make a connection.  The disadvantage of this method is the likelihood of oxidation of the contacts and, as a consequence, loss of nutrition. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to fasten led strip" class="if" height="245" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13387/518187.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Another method is more reliable, but requires some skills in handling a soldering iron.  The two ends of the tape are soldered with a special solder.  In this case, the connection is very reliable.  After this procedure, it is advisable to close the contacts with shrink tape or special glue.  In both cases, in order to know how to connect the LED strip correctly, you need not to reverse the polarity of the conductors.  They are connected on the basis of "+" to "+" and "-" to "-".  It is worth noting that a multi-colored ribbon cannot be connected with a single-color.  Only tapes of the same type may be added. </p><h2>  Tape connection by soldering </h2><p>  Before you <span>solder the LED</span> strip to the power cable or connect the two segments together, you need to purchase the necessary tools and supplies.  We will need: </p><ul><li>  Low power soldering iron. </li><li>  Tin based solder. </li><li>  Flux. </li><li>  Connecting wires. </li><li>  Sharp knife for stripping insulation. </li></ul><p>  First of all, we clean the contacts on the tape.  If there is a silicone protection, then carefully remove it with a knife.  We also strip the wires for soldering.  The length of the bare conductor should be approximately one centimeter.  Then we take a heated soldering iron and lower it into the flux, and then quickly into the solder.  After making sure that part of the solder adheres to the tip, we apply a stripped conductor to it.  After this operation, part of the solder should go to the conductor.  The next step is to solder the prepared conductor to the corresponding contacts on the tape.  To do this, a conductor is applied in the right place, and a little flux is applied on top of it.  After that, you need to touch the assembly with a soldering iron tip for one second.  The result should be soldering of the conductor. </p><h2>  Tape connection with connectors </h2><p>  Before you <span>connect the LED</span> strip to power or another tape using connectors, you need to select them correctly and attach them properly.  In the case of connecting two segments, you need a pair of connectors, which must first be soldered together.  For soldering, you can use the manual described above. </p><p>  After the two connectors are ready, insert the stripped edge of the tape into its special slot with the locking buttons open.  After that, you need to click on these buttons and fix the contacts of the tape.  In the case of connecting the power, everything will happen as well, but with one connector. </p><p>  In both cases, care must be taken to ensure that the polarity of the connection matches correctly.  If you mix something up, the tape will not burn.  But you should not be very upset with this outcome, from this it will not burn. </p><h2>  How to cut the desired tape length </h2><p>  Before attaching the LED strip, you need to make a segment of the required length.  To simplify this operation, the strip with LEDs has a clear arrangement of places for a possible cut.  Often these places are located every four light elements, but there may be another multiplicity of cutting.  Therefore, we find a suitable place and use a sharp knife or scissors to make an even cut.  It should turn out so that at both ends there will be two contacts to which you can connect power. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY LED strip" class="if" height="230" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22199/514912.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  If the tape has special protection in the form of silicone or plastic, then before you cut it, you need to clean a small gap.  For this purpose, you can use a knife.  You need to act very carefully so as not to damage the contacts. </p><h2>  Preparation for installation </h2><p>  Before attaching the LED strip in the selected place, the entire system must be checked for operability.  To do this, the entire electrical circuit is assembled on the table and checked.  If there are no comments in the work, then you can proceed to the inspection of the installation site.  To do this, make sure that the tape will not be affected by negative factors in the form of liquids and mechanical stresses.  It is necessary to design a place for laying the tape so that the bending radius is not less than 20 millimeters.  Otherwise, severe bending can damage the tape. </p><p>  Sometimes the LED strip has an adhesive side for installation.  It allows you to attach it to any solid surface.  But before you do this, you need to clean this surface and degrease with gasoline or acetone.  In the absence of funds for installation, you can use double-sided tape or other means. </p><h2>  Features of connecting RGB tape </h2><p>  Before connecting this type of LED strip to the power supply, you need to check its operation with a special controller that regulates the voltage.  It supplies power to those LEDs that should be lit.  When connecting, you need to match all four contacts.  On the controller and power supply, all terminals are signed, and this operation is not difficult.  If everything worked out, and the tape works in all color modes, then you can begin to install it on the workplace. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to solder the led strip" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22199/514908.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Special plugs and jacks can also be used to connect power.  They greatly simplify all work and provide a reliable connection.  To do this, a socket with the required number of contacts is soldered to the tape, and the corresponding plug to the power cord. </p><h2>  Installation in a car </h2><p>  Before installing the LED strip in the car, you need to make sure that it is not affected by harmful factors.  It can be physical exertion, excesses and increased vibration.  For this, it is usually installed in specially prepared places.  For example, it can be a special corner made of plastic or metal, which is attached to the body. </p><p>  In addition to the correct installation location, you need to use a stabilized voltage to power the backlight.  For this, a special electronic stabilizer is connected to the circuit.  It will allow you to equalize the voltage to 12 volts when lowering and raising it in the on-board network.  This device can be purchased at any auto parts store.  Instructions for connecting are always attached to it, and if it is not there, then the seller must explain everything. </p><p>  During direct installation and when connecting the power cord, remove the terminals from the battery.  This action will avoid a short circuit and other unpleasant situations. </p><h2>  General recommendations </h2><p>  This article provided basic tips on how to install an LED strip and connect it correctly.  Compliance with these rules will help to avoid in the process, as well as in the future, unpleasant situations in operation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to calculate led strip" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22199/514905.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  If you decide to make a spectacular highlight in the car or beautifully decorate certain places in the house, then for this purpose it is better to choose a ribbon with a multi-colored glow.  This allows you to flexibly control the external design. </p><p>  For lighting, which should be extremely practical, white light is more suitable.  It does not impose additional shades on the surrounding objects and will be more natural. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  LED strip is one of the long-lasting light sources.  It is preferred when low voltage power is needed.  When it is connected, it is impossible to cause an electric shock, since it is too small for this.  Therefore, such a backlight without fear can be used in damp rooms and basements. </p>
