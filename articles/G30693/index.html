Homeland of bullfighting, flamenco, ancient castles and structures.  Unearthly beautiful beaches with white sand and blue sea, stunning combinations of tastes of traditional cuisine and ingenious authors of fine art - all this is only a small part of the culture of this country.  Having visited Spain, none of its advantages should be missed.  The country of sun and fun is famous for its resorts, comfortable and beautiful beaches.  One of the paradises can rightly be called the city of Altea.  Spain is undoubtedly proud of such a small, but rather popular place. </p><h2>  History of the city </h2>

For many centuries, the owners of coastal lands were replaced, up to the eighth century of our time, the territory was first inhabited by Iberians, then Visigoths, until everything came under the possession of the Islamic empire.  In 1244, the city was again recaptured by King Jaime of Aragon, and only in 1279 received its official status and completely came under Spanish control.  Today, Altea is located on the most popular coast of the country - the Costa Blanca, and is a fairly popular tourist town.  The main part is at the foot of the mountain, and the Old Town occupies the upper part.  Once an ordinary fishing village selling fresh catch, today Altea is part of the province of Alicante and is part of the Autonomous Society of Valencia.

However, the origin of the name of the city has nothing to do with this word, and in Spanish sources there is no mention of the name of this word anywhere.  In fact, the name came from the ancient Greek "Althaia", which translates as "I pray."  There are also versions of the origin from the Arabic and Spanish languages ​​“attalaya” and “atalaya”, meaning “watchtower”, several ruins of which, by the way, are located in the city. </p><h2>  Features of Althea </h2>

Spain is considered one of the most densely populated countries in Europe, but it is in Altea that you can feel a little freedom and enjoy the vastness, because only 25 thousand people live there.  Its unusual appearance also brought glory to the city, it was popularly called the “snow-white corner of paradise”, and this is not surprising.  Almost all houses are painted in snow-white, blinding in the sun color, and the whole ensemble is completed by the main symbol of the city, located on a hill, the Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary with a bright blue dome.  All houses, by the way, are of very low height, since it is forbidden to build more than four floors.

Tourists have the opportunity to enrich themselves culturally through numerous galleries, exhibitions and theaters.  Despite the uniform life and architecture that has been preserved since ancient times, the city is not deprived of modern buildings.  At the entrance to the city, modern offices, expensive boutiques with clothes are striking, but all this is only on the surface, its inner part remains true to itself. </p><h2>  The city's attractions </h2>

It is not a historical monument, as it was built a little more than half a century ago, but, nevertheless, is quite popular in the city of Altea, Spain.  The photos that tourists take with them on holiday often depict the only Orthodox church in the whole country, Archangel Michael, located in Altea.  It was built with the money of Russian-speaking residents of the city in a very beautiful and picturesque place.  “Palau Altea” is a place that is also interesting for tourists in the city of Altea, Spain.  Sights are usually enticed by their history, but this city building is popular for other reasons.  It hosts arts evenings: art exhibitions, concerts, theater, including opera, performances and much more.  The promenade is no less popular, where tourists gather in the evenings, shops with souvenirs work, the lights of the night city are lit.

Since it is located on top of a mountain and rises above the whole city, special observation platforms have been arranged in it, from where a magnificent view of the sea opens.  In small shops that are found along the way, you can successfully purchase skillfully made handmade items.  Of course, it is rather difficult to climb numerous steps and climb up under the scorching sun, so it is best to explore the Old Town in the late afternoon.  At this time, from there you can enjoy the sunset, evening lights, dine with traditional cuisine, and at the end of the road, rising higher and higher, run into the famous church.

One of these legends tells of an enchanted pear tree and its mistress, Aunt Miseria.  Her name translates as "beggar," whom she was.  She lived in a cave, in front of which a tree grew with the fruits of pears.  She ate them, and also what was different from urban citizens.  Everyone knows about stories when saints put on the clothes of travelers or the poor to test people for kindness or to convict in evil.  The story of the old woman was no exception, once she was visited by St. Antonio, who was very pleased with the hospitality of the one that itself had practically nothing.  In gratitude, he awarded her the gift that she asked him: the opportunity to punish any thief who climbed onto her tree to steal pears.  Until she gave permission, no one could get off the tree.  It so happened that the cunning old woman managed to drive death itself onto the tree that came for her, but then let it go, taking from her a promise that she would come for her only when she asked about it.  Legend has it that if you find a pear tree in the city of Altea, Spain, then most likely the same woman lives next to him.

The Abako Alteya Hotel is considered to be one of the most popular, although tourists having a rest there note that it does not look like a hotel at all, but rather a big house with friendly hosts.  Guests also call it authentic, with a share of romance, and incredibly welcoming.  The five-star Biya Gadea hotel is no less famous due to its large territory and internal infrastructure in the town of Altea, Spain.  Hotels annually compete with each other, because the city is small, but these two hotels scored the most pleasant reviews.  The Tossal d'Altea, La Serena and San Miguel hotels are not so famous, but their customers also note a pleasant atmosphere and service.  It is worth noting the hotel "Altea Hills" (Spain), as a quiet and comfortable place to relax.

    <h2>  Weather for the whole year </h2><p>  As in any other city on the Mediterranean coast, the season in the city begins in May and ends in September.  These months of the year are considered the warmest and most suitable for swimming in the sea and relaxing on the beach.  Summer is very hot, the temperature rises to 35 degrees, but the nights are cool.  Because of the sea, the climate is humid, so high temperatures are felt much easier, especially when you can escape from the heat in the pleasant coolness of the sea.  In the city of Altea (Spain) in May and September it is not crowded, there is no stuffiness and heat.  This is almost the perfect time to relax.  In winter, the temperature does not drop below 15 degrees.  Although you can’t swim and sunbathe, this is a great opportunity to wait out the harsh Russian winter in pleasant conditions: there are no tourists, and the prices are lower than in season.  Most hotels close, but some continue to operate year-round.  Weather in Altea (Spain) does not cease to please tourists all year round. </p><h2>  Guest reviews </h2>
