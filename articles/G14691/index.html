    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The developer has chosen Mytischi for the construction of LCD "Barberry".  Just twenty minutes on foot - and you get into the subway.  But his address is Moscow Region, the city of Mytishchi.  What makes the cost of housing affordable for citizens, because the developer is forced to sell it not at Moscow prices, but at Moscow region.  And they are not an example below. </p>

    <p>  Each apartment has a total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthirty-five to eighty-six square meters.  This allows you to choose a living space according to your needs.  The housing stock has all kinds of sought-after apartments: from one to three-room apartments.  All apartments in LCD "Barberry" are rented without interior decoration.  Plastic windows with single-chamber double-glazed windows protect from wind.  Balconies are glazed with aluminum systems.  The height of the ceilings will please tall people.  The higher the apartment is, the lower they are.  So, on the ground floor, people with a height of three meters and sixty centimeters can be safely settled.  But the last floor is ready to accommodate only slightly above two and a half meters. </p><h2>  Lower level </h2><p>  The lower level in the LCD "Barberry", in contrast to conventional construction, is not non-residential.  It also designed residential apartments.  Only fifty square meters are allotted for offices.  In addition, technical premises are provided for household equipment and a control room.  Concierges will observe the complex‚Äôs security and access control, for which special groups with bathrooms will be built. </p>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  <span>The residential complex</span> will not force its residents to experience any inconvenience.  The project of its territory provides for improvement.  Children will be able to play on the brand new children's playground.  Adults have the opportunity to park their cars in the house parking lot.  And the eyes of all will delight lawns and flower beds with various colors. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition, if desired, you can use the underground two-level parking, located nearby.  It accommodates more than ninety cars.  Security will ensure the safety of expensive property. </p><h2>  Moscow or not </h2><p>  In the suburban city of Mytishchi, LCD <span>"Barberry"</span> is comfortably located <span>.</span>  <span>Moscow is</span> practically visible from the windows of the house.  A metro is within walking distance.  But territorially it is still not the capital.  And therefore, the cost per square meter is also not metropolitan.  That allows people to purchase it. </p><p>  And the rest is just like in the main city of the country.  Many supermarkets for every taste and budget.  For children there is a school and kindergartens.  If you suddenly need medical help, a network of medical centers, a clinic and a hospital are at your service. </p><p>  The construction of a <span>residential complex</span> in an already built-up area has its undeniable advantages: all infrastructure is already available, and there is no need to wait for its construction. </p><p>  The same thing is with the subway, or rather with its availability.  The complex offers easy access to the nearest metro station.  Since it is located only six kilometers from the Moscow Ring Road.  Moreover, the public transport stop is located right next to the complex.  In the future, it is planned to build a subway, the station of which will be located near the complex.  The new metro station will contribute to a significant improvement in the quality of life of the residents of the complex and increase comfort.  But at the same time, it will increase the cost of housing. </p><h2>  LCD "Barberry", reviews </h2><p>  Reviews about this <span>residential complex</span> are mostly only positive.  Which is not surprising.  After all, it was designed and built in the very ‚Äúheart‚Äù of Mytishchi.  The residents of the city are provided with the entire infrastructure of the city.  Of course, there are those dissatisfied with the small parking spaces.  But this is a misfortune not only of the complex, but of the whole of Moscow and the Moscow Region. </p><p>  By the silence and tranquility of life in the complex, you can put a solid five.  There is no roar of a big city, life is more leisurely.  Numerous fixed-route taxis and buses will take the inhabitants of the complex anywhere.  In the surrounding stores and hypermarkets you can find any necessary product: from a ballpoint pen to furniture. </p><p>  Among other things, nearby is the Pirogovsky Forest Park, where it is so pleasant to spend time with family and friends, fry the barbecue in the fresh air, swim in the Borisovka River, which flows nearby.  The megalopolis located nearby cannot offer this.  And Barberry - please. </p>

    <p>  Over time, the investment value of <span>living space</span> in the complex will increase significantly.  Therefore, even those who do not want to move here for permanent residence, but who are looking for where it is profitable to invest their savings, can buy an apartment and do not lose out.  Since over time it can be sold at a much higher price.  And thereby make a bargain.  Construction of a subway near will only increase the cost of apartments.  Therefore, if there are still doubts about moving to Barberry, they may be left behind. </p>
