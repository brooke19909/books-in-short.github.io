    <h2>  Parameters of the best conditions for capital appreciation </h2><p>  For a long time, citizens perceived deposits as one of the methods of saving money.  But as a way to increase their own capital, not everyone perceives them.  It should be noted that not all <span>deposits are profitable.</span>  In order for deposits to really bring income, you need to find a profitable offer.  So, we study and choose the best deposits in <span>banks in Moscow.</span> </p><ol><li>  The profitability of a bank deposit will depend on the initial deposit amount.  More amount - more profitability. </li><li>  Optimal interest accrual can be achieved by choosing a long term deposit.  But under such conditions, as a rule, there is no possibility of replenishment of funds. </li><li>  Fixed-term deposits have a higher interest rate than demand deposits.  For example, in one of Moscow banks the “Demand” deposit has an annual rate of 0.01%, and the Otkrytie term deposit is 11%. </li><li>  If two deposits have a single interest rate, the more profit is brought by the one on which interest is accrued through capitalization, that is, monthly, summed up to the initial deposit, and in the following month, interest is accrued on this increased aggregate. </li><li>  The best deposits in banks - with the possibility of replenishment under the terms of the contract. </li></ol>

What do they offer us? </p><h2>  Tinkoff Bank - a modern look at standard banking services </h2><p>  Many financial analysts position the Tinkoff Bank product (or as it is also called Tinkoff Credit Systems) as the most interesting and demanded.  The bank is unique because it does not have its own ATMs, numerous offices (there is one Moscow office with paid services), it works and offers services exclusively via the Internet.  However, this did not prevent Tinkoff Bank from occupying a leading position in the financial sector: 2nd place in the credit bank card market, 25th in Moscow in retail deposits, and 20th in terms of net profitability.  What are the “advantages” of Tinkoff Bank? </p><ul><li>  Would you like to get the best deposit in the best bank?  You will be given a Visa or Master Card debit card for your choice. </li><li>  A debit bank card with monthly interest accruals can be obtained free of charge even without opening a deposit, just leave a request on the website and a bank employee will bring the card to the specified address by prior arrangement. </li><li>  Tinkoff Bank does not have its own ATMs, which is more of a plus than a disadvantage: cash - from 3 thousand rubles or from 100 dollars or euros can be withdrawn from any bank and ATM without charging a commission. </li></ul><h2>  Russian Standard Bank - the largest percentage in a stable bank </h2><p>  The bank is stable and reliable, has 170 branches.  At the beginning of 2016, Russian Standard took 15th place in the Russian rating on deposits of individuals. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  For many citizens, stability and wealth are provided precisely by deposits in banks.  The best interest, preferential terms or unhurried growth of a contribution in a stable institution with a high rating - everyone chooses the conditions to their liking.  And there is plenty to choose from.  Every year, banks are developing more and more interesting proposals. </p><p>  When choosing suitable characteristics for a deposit, one must remember about individual bank rates for users and regular customers.  If you are the owner of a salary card, you can count on a bonus in the form of an increased rate or optimal basic services. </p>
