A beautiful bay, crumbly like flour, white sand, casuarines casting an openwork shadow - everything is like in a fairy tale about a paradise tropical coast.  Despite the popularity of Kata Beach, everyone can find a place here under the sun.  But when the sun sets, I don‚Äôt feel like leaving this wonderful beach and leaving for the noisy Patong.  After all, I so want to enjoy the sunsets and wander along the edge of the sea with the full moon ... There is nothing easier!  To do this, just book a hotel on Kata Beach.  In this article, we present to your attention the hotel Sugar Palm Grand Hillside 4 (Phuket, Kata).  We built his description solely on the reviews of those tourists who have already managed to visit there.  But first, we will report on the advantages and specifics of Kata beach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sugar Palm Grand 4" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1456670.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Resort Nuances </h2><p>  Phuket has a somewhat scandalous reputation, approximately the same as the resort of Pattaya.  But this island is big, and the city of Patong does not make weather in it the center of the sex industry.  There are many resort villages in Phuket, ideally suited for a quiet and measured rest, for families with children, for lovers of nature and excursions, for lovers of a healthy lifestyle.  And one of them is Kata, on the western tip of the island.  The main feature of the village is its gorgeous beach, known, like Karon, far beyond the borders of the island and even the country.  Not far from it, or rather, on the second line, the hotel Sugar Palm Grand Hillside 4 described by us is located. The beach of the village is divided into two unequal parts.  The first, large, is called Kata-Yai.  In the north, it starts from the island of Pu and stretches for a kilometer.  There are quiet waters, excellent entry into the sea, no currents.  In the rainy season, Kata-Yai turns into a Mecca for surfers.  A smaller part cannot boast of developed infrastructure.  But the scenery in Kata Noi is amazing.  Only a few hotels are located in this part of the beach.  And the center of the village of Kata is typically a resort.  It is full of restaurants, cafes, souvenir shops and shops, with a bazaar on Thursdays.  In a word, everything is quiet and calm.  If you want adventure of a dubious nature, Patong with its Bangla Road are a fifteen minute drive away. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sugar Palm Grand Hillside 4" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1456672.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where is the Sugar Palm Grand Hillside 4 (Phuket) located </h2><p>  It is appropriate to decipher the name of the hotel.  Sugar (Sugar) is a hotel chain.  Near the Palm Grand are several more hotels of this line.  And the last, very important word in the name of the hotel is ‚ÄúHillside‚Äù.  It means "hillside."  This arrangement does not at all concern those who are young and healthy.  A hill is not a mountain after all.  But those who climb a little up is a big problem, or those who are burdened with a small child with a stroller complain about the multi-level territory of the Sugar Palm Grand Hillside hotel.  Of course, the entrance to the hotel is cool, but it is calculated that you will go with your suitcases, not go.  Around the mass of cafes, restaurants, shops.  A maximum of seven minutes - and you are on the wonderful beach of Kata. </p><h2>  Territory and buildings </h2><p>  The Sugar Palm Grand 4 hotel was built in two thousand and nine - that is, not so long ago - in high-tech style.  The hotel building is interesting.  It is difficult to say how many floors are in it, since the house was erected in the form of a truncated pyramid.  The hotel was last renovated four years ago.  Many reviews note the beauty of the facade.  A water wall pours in front of the main entrance.  The hotel area is located on a hill.  This circumstance has the minus that there are stairs everywhere, you have to climb and descend.  But what a view of Kata Bay from the rooms!  Reviews are advised to choose the upper floors.  If the hotel is not 100% full (and this happens only in the "high season"), then at your request you can change the room.  The multi-level territory allows direct access to the pools (and there are eleven of them at the hotel) for residents of the upper floors.  All guest rooms are equipped with very spacious balconies, you can say, verandas.  The hotel area is well equipped.  Everywhere there are lawns and tropical bushes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sugar Palm Grand 4 Phuket" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1456674.jpg" width="600"></div>

This means that the rooms are very spacious.  There are simply no "standards" here.  Room classification starts with Deluxe.  This is a spacious and comfortable bedroom with a large bed and many comfortable pillows.  It also has a small seating area with a sofa.  In the corner is a small desk.  Reviews praise spacious balconies with table and chairs.  Of household appliances, tourists mention a refrigerator (aka a minibar).  Every day it was replenished for free with two bottles of drinking water, a can of beer, 0.25 L Pepsi and a bag of juice.  It also has air conditioning, a flat-screen TV, a safe, Wi-Fi and a hairdryer.  The bathroom adjoins the bedroom, where there is both a bathtub and a shower.  As a pleasant trifle, reviews note the presence of an electric kettle.  Supplied with replenished bags of tea, coffee, dried cream and sugar every day.  They also give different towels - for use in the bathroom and on the beach.  Bed linen is changed every three days, and cleaned daily. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sugar Palm Grand Hillside 4 (Phuket)" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1456673.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Grand Deluxe Jacuzzi </h2><p>  The very name of this category of rooms at the Sugar Palm Grand 4 hotel indicates that there is a spa bath.  It is located ... on the balcony.  The rest of the room resembles the usual "Deluxe".  With one ‚Äúbut.‚Äù  Deluxe Grand can accommodate up to four guests.  Therefore, it is equipped with one double bed, one with a double bed and a sofa.  Due to such an abundance of beds, the room may seem cramped, even if only two people live there.  There is only a large bed and sofa in the Grand Jacuzzi Deluxe.  Therefore, there is more free space.  Reviews repeatedly mention the original decoration of the rooms in high-tech style.  Especially many are surprised by the concrete-designed bathroom. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Grand Pull Access </h2><p>  If you are not lucky with the weather (for example, you arrived in Thailand out of season), a crystal clear pool can serve as an alternative to the stormy and muddy sea.  And even if the sun is shining and the Kata bay pleases with calm waters, you still want to plunge after the sunset, or even at night.  And do not be afraid of jellyfish, sea urchins and other living creatures, which in the evenings becomes very active near the coast.  To have an almost personal pool that you can literally step into from your room - isn't that a dream?  And it can be carried out in the Sugar Palm Grand 4 hotel if you reserve Grand Pull Access.  The name of this category of rooms is translated: "Access to the pool."  A small balcony adjoins the bedroom, which continues with a terrace lined with sunbeds.  The pool is designed for only four rooms.  He is a cascading type.  Water falls from the upper level to the lower.  Do not be afraid that the noise will disturb you.  The waterfall is turned off at ten in the evening, and turned on at eight in the morning.  The room has a player, coffee maker, bathrobes and slippers.  All tourists, regardless of the category of rooms they occupied, mention the first-class quality of bed linen.  Hygiene products are replenished daily in the bathroom. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sugar Palm Grand 4 reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1456676.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Hotel Sugar Palm Grand 4 does not constrain its guests in choosing.  You can pay only for a room or for accommodation with breakfast.  Thailand is famous for delicious and reasonably priced food.  The hotel is located in the center of Kata, within walking distance of many cafes and restaurants.  But reviews highly recommend paying for breakfast.  There are several reasons for this.  The first is a varied, hearty and very tasty food.  You can eat "from the belly", because breakfast is served in buffet style.  Thais take their morning meal very seriously.  Therefore, breakfast includes not only scrambled eggs with cereals and yoghurts, but also soups, rice, noodles, and meat dishes.  Not to mention the abundance of tropical fruits.  And the second reason is a very beautiful place, wonderfully ventilated and stylish, surrounded by water.  From five to eight in the evening, the Haven Bar (Heaven) is open on the seventh floor of the hotel building, from where you can admire the wonderful sunsets over Kata Bay.  When checking in, guests receive a bonus at the reception: a twenty-percent discount in the Palm Square Kata restaurant, as well as a free shuttle to it.  Those who took advantage of this offer argue that this institution has a varied menu, good cuisine and low prices. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sugar Palm Grand Kata 4" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1456675.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Sugar Palm Grand 4 reviews characterize it as a second-line hotel.  It is enough to go down the hill, as you get to the wonderful Kata-Yai beach.  Reviews say either about a three-minute walk to it, then about seven.  This probably depends on the speed of the person and the direction in which he is moving (back downhill more slowly).  Kata-Yai beach is public, but very clean and well maintained.  Umbrellas and sunbeds there are paid (two hundred butts one thing).  But you can do without them.  Many laid out beach towels in the shade of casuarines and so rested.  Sunset at sea is smooth, there are no dangerous currents.  If you arrived in winter or early spring, say reviews, Kata-Yai is the best option for families with children.  Well, if you are a born surfer, then you need to visit the beach in the "rainy season".  To the left of the cape (if you look at the sea) there is a coral reef.  There, assure reviews, it is interesting to snorkel, watch the motley inhabitants of the Indian Ocean.  And be sure to, at least once, come to Kata Noi.  There is simply stunning beauty. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sugar Palm Grand Hillside 4: reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1456679.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  The reception desk at the Sugar Palm Grand Kata 4 is open around the clock, and one of her staff speaks Russian.  The hotel also provides banquet and banquet services.  The hotel has a small SPA center where you can soak in the Finnish sauna, Turkish steam bath and, of course, undergo a massage.  Internet is available and free anywhere in the hotel.  Free parking is available.  This is very important because in Thailand, tourists often rent scooters.  For those who want to keep fit, a fitness room is available. </p><h2>  What to see nearby </h2><p>  Reviews recommend that you actively use the convenient location of Sugar Palm Grand 4. Phuket is an amazing island and there is something to see.  The excursion to Phi Phi will take at least two days.  And near there are lots of attractions.  For example, the sea gypsy village, James Bond Rock, monkeys and elephant nurseries.  It is for the sake of interest to visit the transvestite show in Patong - you can get there in a quarter of an hour by car. </p><h2>  Sugar Palm Grand Hillside 4: reviews </h2><p>  Tourists at the hotel liked its location regarding the infrastructure of the village and transport interchanges.  The hotel does not require a deposit.  The beds are made with very high quality linen, many pillows.  Beach towels are provided.  The hotel staff is very friendly and welcoming. </p>
