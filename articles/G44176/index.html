    <p>  The Peter and Paul Park (Yaroslavl), which will be indicated below, is one of the oldest, not only in the city, but throughout Russia.  But few residents of Yaroslavl know about this and are interested in its history.  But some moments of the park‚Äôs existence could be an excellent plot for feature films or documentaries.  But first things first. </p><h2>  Manufactory Project </h2><p>  Peter and Paul Park (city of Yaroslavl) has its history from the 1720-1730s.  It was at this time that, by decree of Tsar Peter I, the merchant Ivan Zatrapeznov, who had learned the so-called canvas business in Holland, created the Yaroslavl Big Manufactory.  It was the largest combined factory in Russia, including three complexes: paper - at the mouth of the Kavardakov stream, textile - at its source, where there was also a residential, which is a manor estate. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  During the construction of the manufactory, it was decided to make a cascade of ponds along the stream for the functioning of water and <span>windmills.</span>  There were five ponds: ‚Äúdirty‚Äù - for washing and rinsing clothes, ‚Äúclean‚Äù, which served as a source of water, two ponds for fishing to the gentlemen's table and the last, fifth pond, was the most picturesque, was located right next to the factory owner‚Äôs mansion and was even used for bathing gentlemen - male and female bathtubs were made in it. </p>

    <h2>  Park construction </h2><p>  A little later, a luxurious regular park was built.  The basis was taken of the images of the Dutch Baroque gardens beloved by Peter I to pleasantly impress the royal people.  The history of the Peter and Paul Park in Yaroslavl indicates that this idea was a success - it was a favorite place for many high-ranking people. </p><p>  The garden included two squares of paths that were inscribed in each other.  There was a pavilion in the middle, from it in the form of rays eight paths led in different directions.  Trellis of trimmed bushes, fountains and statues acted as decorations of the park at the intersection of paths.  To pump water in the fountains, a windmill was used. </p><p>  Interesting facts: Peter and Paul Park (Yaroslavl) was often compared to the Summer Garden in St. Petersburg, and the arbor in the middle was called the Hermitage.  Catherine II herself chose him as her temporary residence and arranged receptions here. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Peter and Paul Church </h2><p>  The main element of the park was the church, built a little later.  Construction was carried out from 1736 to 1742.  The architecture of the temple was made in the style of Peter's Baroque.  The basis was the image of the <span>Peter and Paul Cathedral</span> in the northern capital, due to which the resemblance to St. Petersburg became even more striking. </p>

    <p>  The church in the Peter and Paul Park (Yaroslavl) is the only architectural monument of the <span>"Peter the Baroque"</span> in this city.  It is not known who came up with her project, but the temple is very beautiful: a tall spire, an elongated upper part of the building, blue and white tones, rich decor ... Inside there is a winter church - it is on the first floor and the summer one on the second. </p><p>  The multi-tier bell tower is harmoniously inscribed in the main volume of the temple, due to which the height of the church is seventy meters.  The temple has long served as a spiritual center for people living and working in the Krasnoperekopsky district and its environs. </p><h2>  Peter and Paul Park in the 19th century </h2><p>  In the second half of the 19th century, the Yaroslavl manufactory, with all its complexes, was purchased by the landowners Karzinkins and Igumnov.  Old factory buildings are dismantled by stones and bricks, which are subsequently used for the construction of new buildings. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Over time, the Peter and Paul Park (Yaroslavl), the photo of which you see below, began to acquire for the most part landscape features and lose its regular layout.  Near the temple, a two-story almshouse building was built, where elderly working factories could find shelter. </p>

    <h2>  Park in the 20th century - loss of former grandeur </h2><p>  At the very beginning of the century, the garden was used by the family of its new owner, A.F. Gryaznov, as a summer residence, and only the owners themselves or their guests could rest in it.  Workers could come here only once a year - on the day when they celebrated Easter. </p><p>  In 1918, the Yaroslavl Big Manufactory underwent nationalization.  Later, in 1929, the Peter and Paul Church was closed, and a pioneer club was located in its building.  At the closing of the temple, his abbot Mikhail Nevsky, a well-known priest in the city, was brutally killed. </p><p>  During the USSR, the Peter and Paul Park (Yaroslavl) was renamed the "Culture and Rest Park named after the 16th Congress" and became publicly available.  The authorities tried to restore the park ensemble to its former regular layout, but they did not plan to restore its original historical appearance. </p>

    <p>  From 1986 to 1991, a project for the restoration of the complex was developed, in the discussion of which well-known experts from the fields of art, gardening and restoration and restoration took part.  Among them was Dmitry Sergeyevich Likhachev, academician, doctor of philological sciences and world famous art critic.  The restoration project was ready and approved, but, unfortunately, due to the economic and political changes that began at that time, it could not be embodied in real life. </p><h2>  City legends about the temple </h2><p>  There are many legends known to the residents of Yaroslavl related to the existence of the church in the Peter and Paul Park.  Firstly, they say that the frescoes inside the church were preserved only due to the fact that when, after the revolution, they gave the decree to cover the paintings in all the churches with oil paints, they simply could not be found in this place.  Therefore, they were simply covered with whitewash, which subsequently helped them easily recover. </p><p>  There are also sources that claim that once frescoes clearly showed through whitewashing.  It lasted no more than forty minutes, then the walls turned white again.  From a scientific point of view, this phenomenon is explained by a sharp difference in temperature and humidity.  But believers saw in this event a divine sign. </p><p>  In addition, there is a legend that the already mentioned Ivan Zatrapeznov, the founder of the temple, died before the completion of its construction and was buried in the merchant tomb, which was located in the winter temple.  Later, a plate was lost from his grave, and there are versions that it, along with icons recessed after the revolution, is at the bottom of one of the ponds. </p><p>  And another story that many parishioners of the temple believe in.  This is the legend of the "blood stain."  They say that inside the temple, between the floors, there is a red spot that could not be removed in any way - it only increased in size.  It is believed that it was at this place that the last rector of the church, Mikhail Nevsky, was killed.  In memory of him, a red spot keeps burning candles all the time. </p><h2>  Peter and Paul Park now </h2>

    <p>  Nowadays, the manufactory buildings continue their work, now it is a factory of technical fabrics called "Red Perekop".  The entire territory where the industrial complex used to be located is desolate.  Looking at what remains, it is hard to believe that once there was the largest manufactory in Russia for the production of cloth, paper and jacquard.  The former factory building is currently under reconstruction. </p><p>  The temple did not reach us in its original form.  There are no two-flight staircases outside leading to balconies on the second floor, there is no headquarters that crowned the eastern part of the roof.  But the grandeur and unshakable spirit of this building remained, a unique architecture that has no analogues in the city. </p><p>  Peter and Paul Park (Yaroslavl) is now in great desolation, but has not lost its charm.  The authorities promise to soon return the ensemble if not pristine, then at least a pretty decent look.  But now this place attracts tourists from different cities and even countries with its unique atmosphere of an ancient cultural monument. </p><h2>  Peter and Paul Park (Yaroslavl): how to get there or get there? </h2><p>  Few residents of Yaroslavl, and especially tourists from other cities, know where this place is.  In fact, as they say, an amazing thing is nearby.  It will not be difficult for you to get to such a place as the Peter and Paul Park (Yaroslavl).  His address is as follows: Krasnoperekopsky District, Zelentsovskaya Street, 25. </p><p>  You can get to it by bus at number 3, or on foot, through Vpolinskoe field, then go over the bridge and go through Komsomolskaya Square.  Then you need to navigate the spire of the Peter and Paul Church, which is visible from the square.  From <span>Komsomolskaya Square</span> to the park to walk about ten minutes. </p>
