    <p>  The beach of a small Sukko bay is covered with pebbles, respectively, the bottom in the sea near the coast is also rocky.  Due to this, the water here is much more transparent and cleaner than in neighboring Anapa or Vityazevo.

It is the last two types of trees that fill the air in these places with magnificent aromas throughout the summer that enhance the already healing sea air.  So Sukko is a great place not only to relax, but also to improve health. </p><h2>  How to diversify holidays in Sukko </h2><p>  Although the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe village is not very large, but there is everything so that the rest of any tourist goes well.  The abundance of cafes, restaurants and canteens in this place will not allow any guest to starve during their vacation.  In all kinds of shops and stalls you can find anything: from the necessary products to traditional Black Sea souvenirs and clothes for all occasions. </p><p>  A small amusement park will not leave indifferent any child, and all kinds of slides and trampolines on the beach will also certainly amuse the young guests of the village.  There are also water motorbike and catamaran rentals on the shore, a banana and cheesecake ride, and even rental of diving equipment. </p><p>  You can visit the beautiful lake located nearby, famous for its cypress trees.
