Lisbon is an incredible city that combines ancient history with beautiful modern landscapes.  Other cities of Europe’s westernmost country are no less interesting in their history and architectural beauty.  In the article we take a short tour of the most interesting places in Portugal. </p><h2>  Lisbon </h2><p>  From the reviews it can be considered that one of the most interesting and visited sights of Portugal in Lisbon is the famous cable car Park of the Nations, or Expo.  A trip on it is an opportunity to get to know Lisbon from a different angle and look at interesting places from above, such as the beautiful Belem Tower (1515-1521).  It was built in the golden era of Portugal in order to protect the city from invaders.  Over time, its protective function was lost, but over the years it has proved useful for various government functions. </p><p>  Since 1580, it has been used as a political prison, customs, and even as a telegraph station and a lighthouse.  In 1983, <span>the Belem tower</span> was awarded the UNESCO World Heritage Site, and today it is one of the most visited tourist destinations in Lisbon. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lisbonlux.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Belem Tower" class="if uuid-2326561" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2326561.jpg"></div><p>  Currently, the tower is surrounded by an artificial lake, forcing visitors to cross a wooden alley to visit the interior of this monument, one of Portugal’s seven wonders. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  One cannot help admiring yet another property of Lisbon.  This is the Vasco da Gama bridge over the Tagus River, linking Montijo and Alcoshe.  It was opened in 1998 and is the longest in Europe - 17.3 km, of which 12 km are in the waters of the Tagus estuary.  The span (length of the side) of the central viaduct is 420 m and a height of 155 m. </p><h2>  Statue of christ </h2><p>  The monumental <span>statue of Jesus Christ</span> in Portugal was built between 1959-1969.  It is installed on the rocks above the Portuguese capital in Lisbon, at a safe enough distance from the edge to avoid any chance that it will ever fall in the direction of the city.  The figure of Christ stands on a pedestal, arms open to the city, as if hugging him.  In the reviews, tourists talk about the greatness that comes from this object. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kuriositas.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Statue of Christ in Lisbon" class="if uuid-2326261" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2326261.jpg"></div><p>  If it looks familiar, then because the statue is similar to the one installed in 1931 in Rio de Janeiro, the former capital of Brazil.  <span>The statue of Jesus Christ</span> is 28 meters high, stands on an 82 meter pedestal on a cliff above the Tagus River.  The Portuguese monument of Jesus is the tallest in the world. </p><h2>  Sintra </h2><p>  One of the cities of Portugal, which is included in the list of tourists visited, of course, is Sintra.  It is a unique city surrounded by charm and unsurpassed beauty.  There are several reasons why this city is definitely worth a visit when traveling in Portugal.  You can, for example, visit the beautiful and majestic <span>Pena Palace,</span> which is a landmark of Portugal, in the style of architecture dating back to romanticism. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="gotoportugal.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Montserrat Palace" class="if uuid-2326770" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2326770.jpg"></div><p>  You cannot go past the magnificent Sintra National Palace.  Its building was built in the XV century, with medieval, Gothic, Renaissance and romantic architecture.  He was a stronghold of the Portuguese royal family until 1910. </p><p>  The stunning park and palace of Montserrat (pictured above) is described as one of the most beautiful creations when it comes to architecture associated with romanticism.  Sintra has beautiful beaches, as well as the westernmost point of continental Europe.  In the visited part there is a lighthouse of Cabo da Roca (22-meter height), built in 1758. </p><h2>  Monastery </h2><p>  The Jerome Monastery is one of the most beautiful monuments in Portugal and one of its seven wonders.  The construction of the monastery began in 1501 by order of King D. Manuel I, and was completed a century later.  Thanks to architecture inspired by India and all the exotic of the East, this World Heritage Site was built in the 16th century thanks to a tax imposed by the king.  This was done by taxing 5% of the gold brought from Guinea and the precious stones that came from India. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lisbonlux.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Jeronimos Monastery" class="if uuid-2326566" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2326566.jpg"></div><p>  Manueline architecture is especially unusual in monasteries with magnificent decorative elements.  D. Manuel I wanted to build this monastery in order to perpetuate the memory of Henry the Navigator and at the same time have a pantheon where his dynasty would rest.  Monks from the Order of St. Jerome or Hieronymity (hence the Jerome Monastery) were settled in the monastery.  The monks from this order lived in the monastery for more than 300 years, until 1834, when all religious orders in Portugal were dissolved. </p><p>  At present, visiting this monastery is free.  The monastery has the tombs of kings, queens and great personalities, such as the Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama and the amazing Portuguese poets Luis de Camoes and Fernando Pessoa. </p><h2>  Obidos Castle </h2><p>  According to tourists, the places of interest in Portugal include Obidos Castle, the construction of which began in the middle of the 1st century, when the Romans ruled the world.  However, it was during the occupation of the Moors that the castle developed, and at the same time a fortress was created. </p><p>  In 1147, the first king of Portugal, Afonso Henriques, conquered the village and its castle at the Moors.  Since then, the castle has been restored and enlarged several times.  The 1755 earthquake affected parts of the castle, and some medieval buildings were completely destroyed.  Until the 20th century, the castle was in ruins.  Then the Portuguese state decided to restore it, and in 1950 turned these ruins into a luxury hotel - the first that was built in a historic building. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gotoportugal.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Obidos Castle" class="if uuid-2326590" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2326590.jpg"></div><p>  It is interesting to take a walk through the labyrinths of streets of the village of Obidos among white houses decorated with beautiful flowers. </p><p>  In reviews, tourists write about the fabulousness of the country with stunning nature, where in November you can see many flowering plants.  Tasty food with large portions is also noted. </p><p>  For a more detailed acquaintance with Portugal.  You can watch a wonderful video: "Portugal. See better from above." </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="AUP3BO5tIFE" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUP3BO5tIFE" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/5/0/3/1503.jpg"></div><h2>  Monastery of Batalha </h2><p>  During a tour in Portugal, tourists are invited to visit an amazing monument, a masterpiece of Portuguese and European architecture - the Monastery of Batalha.  After his victory in Aljubarrot (1385) over the Kingdom of Castile (a region from present-day Spain), King D. João decided to order the construction of this monastery in order to thank the Virgin Mary for his triumph. </p><p>  Construction began in 1386 and was completed two centuries later, in 1517.  The monastery was granted to the Dominicans, who lived there until the collapse of religious orders in Portugal in 1834.  Since that time, the monastery belongs to the Portuguese state and is accessible to the general public. </p><h2>  Knowledge Capital - Coimbra </h2><p>  One of the oldest universities in the world, located in the city of Coimbra, is undoubtedly one of the attractions of Portugal.  It is a beautiful city with historical and ancient buildings.  Its architecture, bas-reliefs and decorative murals on buildings, sculptures contribute to the fact that this city is considered an exceptional value recognized not only by UNESCO, but also by the whole world. </p><div class="photo" data-original="trupedatrip.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="University of Coimbra" class="if uuid-2326633" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2326633.jpg"></div><p>  The university has a unique surviving library.  Guides tell a curious detail about it: bats live in the library, which eat moths, preventing them from spoiling books.  They sleep during the day, and at night, when the library closes, bats are taken for "work."  These are the helpers. </p><p>  The city's attractions include two cathedrals and a beautiful park that borders the Mondego River and is located near the university.  Students love to relax on his lawn with grass. </p><h2>  Portugal nature </h2><p>  Portugal has a long coastline full of beaches, but also wide plains, great mountains and pearls of the Atlantic, magnificent archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores. </p><p>  Throughout the country there are small corners where you can enjoy the tranquility of the surrounding nature.  Located in the heart of the Peneda-Gerês National Park, one of the most beautiful nature reserves in Europe, Serdeira Park can offer relaxation to those who love the mountains. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.feelingportugal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Azores" class="if uuid-2326878" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2326878.jpg"></div><p>  Serra da Arrabida is the best place for those who love mountains and the sea.  The magnificent island of Madeira is a place where the climate is different from any other place in Portugal.  If you prefer the sun and the beach, then you should visit Porto Santo, where there is one of the most beautiful beaches in the world. </p><p>  The Azores cannot be compared with anything - this is a real diamond in the middle of the Atlantic.
