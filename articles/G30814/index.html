    <p>  <span>It‚Äôs ironic, but the users themselves influenced this course of things.</span>  <span>Pressure from the audience and professional musicians did the trick.</span>  <span>Creative engineers have largely rethought their device and created a successful product.</span>  <span>Negative reviews affected only the design of the case.</span>  <span>These types of USB-to-DAC headphone and speaker amplifiers are usually more compact and ergonomic.</span> </p><h2>  Oppo ha-2 </h2><p>  <span>The Chinese company Oppo with varying success is trying itself in new directions, whether it be sound or smartphones.</span>  <span>With smartphones, they somehow did not work out, but in terms of sound, everything is fine.</span>  <span>The Oppo HA-2 is the most ‚Äútrue audiophile‚Äù external USB-DAC amplifier.</span>  <span>The role of the DAC in this gadget is played by the mobile DSP processor ESS Sabre32 9018. This is the best processor of its kind, living only in expensive amplifiers and other Hi-End technology.</span>  <span>Record performance is only half the battle.</span>  <span>Chinese engineers did the impossible and made it sound like no other competing brand product in the same category could.</span>  <span>At the same time, Oppo fit the entire ‚Äústuffing‚Äù into a compact and stylish case, which immediately stands out from the competition thanks to a leather coating on top of the metal.</span>  <span>This is without a doubt the best Chinese external USB DAC amplifier.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  <span>The opinion of professionals is confirmed by the townsfolk.</span>  <span>Oppo HA-2 is the most coveted gadget in the class.</span>  <span>A lot of tests were carried out, both on budget equipment and on Hi-End-class speakers.</span>  <span>The verdict was the same: you have to take it!</span>  <span>Fans of quality sound were deeply imbued with Oppo's achievements in this area, although they did not expect such a stunning success.</span>  <span>Those who at least a little understand what the ESS Sabre32 9012 DAC is, appreciated the work of engineers from Oppo and called it virtuoso, because making this processor play as it should is not an easy task.</span>  <span>This fact confirms the general dislike of Chinese crafts working on the same processor, but producing a completely faded and uninteresting sound.</span> </p><h2>  Denon DA-10 </h2><p>  <span>Hello from Japan.</span>  <span>Denon DA-10 is a typical representative of an amplifier with a USB-DAC from the Land of the Rising Sun.</span>  <span>As is the case with other models of the company, the TI PCM1795 chip became the heart of the amplifier.</span>  <span>The chip is capable of converting <span>analog sound</span> at a frequency of 192 kilohertz by the method of pulse code modulation.</span>  <span>The case of the device is made of plastic with decorative aluminum inserts.</span>  <span>Nothing interesting, it looks too simple and even a little tasteless.</span>  And it also affects the damage resistance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  As for the sound, everything is much better here.  The ASIO driver is configured perfectly.  And although this device is slightly limited in capabilities and assembled not so solidly as other models from the Hi-End class, it copes with its main task much better than its competitors, and Denon can only be praised for this. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  <span>The owners of the amplifier confirm the words of professional critics.</span>  <span>Denon DA-10 is very simple, but at the same time reliable and convenient.</span>  <span>The sound of this USB-DAC amplifier is often compared with that on expensive devices.</span>  <span>Moreover, many seriously put them in a confrontation, where Denon often wins.</span>  <span>Users also noted the manufacturer‚Äôs concern for the potential buyer and love for Apple.</span>  <span>Included with the amplifier is a large two-piece case with a pocket for a smartphone and a set of wires for the iPhone and iPad.</span>  <span>Provided that such devices are usually used precisely with mid-range smartphones and headphones, the Denon DA-10 package bundle can be regarded as successful.</span> </p><h2>  FiiO E18 Kunlun </h2><p>  <span>Another Chinese.</span>  <span>This one is not so impressive in terms of sound.</span>  <span>Yes, the same chip is installed here as in the Denon DA-10, but the sound, alas, is not the same.</span>  <span>Indeed, the FiiO E18 does not sound as ‚Äújuicy" as its competitors, but otherwise it is simply excellent.</span>  <span>The first thing that catches your eye is design.</span>  <span>The exterior design is truly impressive.</span>  <span>The case of the device is completely made of ferrous metal.</span> </p>

    <p>  <span>Firstly, the device has a USB port, but you cannot connect a player to it, for this you should definitely use a coaxial or optical cable.</span>  <span>Secondly, the amplifier is tuned using printed circuit boards.</span>  <span>That is, you can change the dumping factor of the amplifier by opening the case and replacing one of the boards or rearranging one of the jumpers.</span>  <span>The decision is extremely non-standard and clearly made for loyal fans who have not played enough in Lego.</span> </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  <span>As it turned out, there are many such fans.</span>  <span>Lovers who want to plunge headlong into the world of music, really "hooked" such a strange development.</span>  <span>Users understand that this is far from convenience, but there is a kind of romance in this design that attracts both home-grown engineers and people living with electronics.</span>  <span>Surely a bet was made on this.</span>  <span>Such asceticism is rarely present in modern devices.</span>  <span>For many, it's like a breath of fresh air.</span>  <span>The only thing that confused some owners of the amplifier was the mismatch between the characteristics that the manufacturer claims and the real ones.</span>  <span>And it's not even that the manufacturer inflated them, as is often the case.</span>  <span>Quite the opposite.</span>  <span>Tests have shown that amplifier equipment does even better than VentureCraft says.</span>  <span>It is likely that this fact scared off a dozen or two potential buyers.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  <span>That‚Äôs probably all.</span>  <span>The above models of USB-DAC amplifiers represent the golden five, which can be seriously considered for purchase even today.</span>  <span>The most interesting in the class were: Creative Sound Blaster and Oppo HA-2.</span>  <span>The first amplifier pleases (for the first time) with a competent balance between the capabilities of the device and the sound quality that it can give to users.</span>  <span>The second one impresses with its incredibly advanced technical equipment and cool design.</span>  <span>It is on these two models that you should pay attention in the first place.</span>  <span>If you want to save money, then without looking order the brainchild of Creative, if quality is still a priority, then fork out for a model from Oppo.</span>  <span>In both cases you will not regret it.</span> </p>
