    <p>  This is the highest indicator, especially when you consider that in a sunny and beloved by many Turkey, it is almost a month less.  Due to the abundance of sun and heat, the holiday season in Cyprus begins in May and officially ends in November.  What time is better to go to Cyprus?  To answer this question, you need to know about the features of rest in different periods.  Guests come here year-round, choosing a more comfortable period for themselves: <span>hot summers,</span> early and warm spring, comfortable and picturesque autumn with a long velvet season or very mild winters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cyprus which resort is better to go to" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/2121298.jpg"></div>

With the beginning of September, the weather does not deteriorate, but the tourist flow is noticeably reduced, which indicates the passage of the peak season.  If you plan to visit the island in the summer, then take care of tickets and accommodation in advance, because in the season it will be more difficult and more expensive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Cyprus when it is better to go" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/2121318.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Low season </h2><p>  If you want to visit Cyprus to enjoy a beach holiday, then you need to consider that the beach season on the island starts in early May.  The sea is still invigorating, but usually already suitable for swimming, especially for residents of more northern countries.  Spring arrives in Cyprus ahead of calendar dates: already in January, beautiful orchids bloom, and from mid-February meadows turn green and <span>almonds bloom.</span> </p><p>  Of course, in March it can still be quite cool, rains are frequent, but the temperature approaches +19 ° C.  Of course, it’s still too early for a beach holiday, because the water in the sea is still cool, but you can soak up the sun under the gentle rays of the sun and enjoy the waking nature, you can get acquainted with many attractions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="when is it better to go to Cyprus to relax" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/2121297.jpg"></div>

But only desperate daredevils bathe at this time.  Only in May, a full-fledged beach season comes into force, or rather, in the second half of the month, when the thermometer rises to +30 ° C.  The water temperature in May warms up to +22 ° C.  In addition, the last decade of September or the beginning of October is suitable for a beach holiday.  The weather at this time is sunny and warm, and the water in the sea cools down gradually and very smoothly. </p><p>  Those who are interested in when it is better to go to Cyprus to relax, and at the same time a beach vacation they are not too attracted, but more concerned about the presence of warm sunny days, sea air and an abundance of excursions, are suitable for March and April.  Spring on the island is truly beautiful. </p><h2>  Limassol </h2><p>  Naturally, you are interested in which resort in Cyprus is better to go in spring and autumn.  We recommend you pay attention to Limassol.  This is the second largest city in the country, which <span>is known for its good</span> beaches, but most of all it is suitable for admirers of excursion vacations.  And not only because there are many historical monuments, but also because from this city you can quickly get to any area of ​​Cyprus.  The sights of the island can be reached in about an hour. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="when is it better to go to cyprus with a child" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/2123712.jpg"></div>

For example, from February to March, the Apocreo Carnival is held, in September - the wine festival, and in July - the art festival.  By the way, Limassol is known far beyond the borders of the country, because it is a wine-making center. </p><h2>  Beach season in Cyprus </h2><p>  And yet, most Russian tourists come to Cyprus to sunbathe in plenty under the gentle sun and swim in the Mediterranean Sea as much as they like.  The beach season for his fans begins in April.  You can take air baths, you can bask on the beach.  Particularly hardened and impatient can swim.  During this period, the air temperature is set within +23 ° C, and the water gradually approaches the mark of +19 ... + 20 ° C. </p><p>  The full season begins in the third decade of May, when it is already quite hot: the air heats up to +30 ° C.  Although the water is still pretty cool (for the local population), tourists actively bathe, not only adults, but also children.  High season falls on the summer months - June, July and August.  At this time, the water temperature is already reaching its maximum marks (+27 ° C), and the air is approaching +33 ° C. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what time is better to go to cyprus" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/2121296.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Hot and dry summer arrives on the island in mid-May and lasts until the middle, and often until the end of October.  It should be remembered that in the summer months the sun in Cyprus is very aggressive: do not forget to use sunscreens, because even in October you can get sunburn faster than in our latitudes at the height of July. </p><h2>  Where is better to go in the summer? </h2><p>  In the high season, many resorts are suitable for a beach holiday in the summer months - Ayia Napa, Larnaca, Paphos.  If you miss the cool, then go to the Troodos Mountains, where the air temperature is always lower than on the seashore.  Coolest on the coast in Paphos and in its immediate vicinity, but do not forget that the water here is much cooler. </p><h2>  The Velvet season </h2><p>  In mid-September, it is precisely the time — the velvet holiday season in Cyprus — when it is better to go to the island for those who do not really like the scorching sun.  During this period, it still pleases vacationers with its own rays, but they are no longer as burning as in summer.  But seawater is still comfortable and gives a pleasant freshness.  In the velvet season, the average air temperature does not exceed +25 ° C, and water +24 ° C.  Another advantage of holidays in Cyprus at this time is lower prices. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cyprus holiday season when it is better to go" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/2121295.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In October, it is still very warm (+22 ° C), and the sea has not yet had time to cool down (+20 ° C).  In the fall, in Cyprus, tourists enjoy the delightful nature - trees and shrubs are painted in crimson-golden tones.  New saturated colors fill and transform the island, making its beauty even more pronounced. </p><p>  When is it better to go to Cyprus for those who can not stand the heat?  In our opinion, the answer is obvious.  Autumn is a great time when you can get acquainted with local attractions, which are abundant on the island without the sweltering heat, and the compact size of this state allows you to move from one region to another in two to three hours. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="when is it better to go to cyprus" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/2121294.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Walking in the surrounding villages, enjoying the quiet life of the local population, you can buy great home-made wine, which is made in the fall, after harvesting.  In November, there are not so many tourists resting, the weather is not too pleasing, and the water in the sea is gradually cooling, but warm days are not uncommon. </p><h2>  Holidays in Cyprus in winter </h2><p>  When people think about when to go to Cyprus, most of them don’t even consider a trip to the island in the winter.  And in vain: the winter in Cyprus is very mild.  Of course, the water in the sea is cold, but the air temperature is firmly fixed at +15 ° C.  Occasionally precipitation (rain), but more often the weather is sunny.  Frosts are extremely rare. </p>

    <p>  Snow falls only in the Troodos mountains.  Snow cover lasts from December to April, and its volume is quite enough for skiing.  Many lovers of skiing come to Cyprus, in the winter it is quite crowded. </p><p>  When is it best to go to Cyprus in winter?  If you plan to visit interesting places in the country, come closer to Catholic Christmas to enjoy the holiday atmosphere and explore all the Cypriot attractions.  It is also a great time for exploring the island's winemaking and crafts. </p><p>  Shopping will also please many, as traditional pre-holiday sales take place at this time.  Fans of excursion tourism are advised to go to Strovolos, Nicosia, Paphos. </p><h2>  When is the best time to go to Cyprus with a child? </h2><p>  In recent years, the Republic of Cyprus has regularly received <span>Blue Flags.</span>  This is an international award awarded to beaches with very high quality water, which is suitable for safe swimming for both adult vacationers and very young people. </p><p>  Children-schoolchildren who do not have any chronic diseases can relax on the island at any time, since the intense heat on the coast is quite easily tolerated.  But if you want to show children the capital - Nicosia - then in the summer it can be problematic, since the center of the country is much hotter. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Cyprus when it is better to go" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/2123719.jpg"></div>
