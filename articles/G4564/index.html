In the 7th century BC, the settlement of Panticapaeum was founded on the Tauride Peninsula, which eventually turned into the main cultural and economic center of Eastern Crimea.  The ancient settlement, which became the capital of the Bosporus Kingdom, was famous for its magnificent palaces and wonderful temples. </p><p>  Panticapaeum, which survived the fall of the state that existed for nine centuries, is the main attraction of modern Crimea.  A restored historical site located in Kerch attracts great attention of tourists not only in our country. </p><h2>  The significance of the finds </h2><p>  During excavations of the settlement of the Bosporus kingdom, curious examples of ancient art were discovered.  Experts praised the scientific significance of the findings, and the collection takes second place in the world after the rarities stored in Athens by the number of exhibits. </p><p>  More recently, antique treasures were available only to a small circle of people, and now anyone who goes on an excursion to Lapidarii (Kerch), a museum of stone sculptures, with more than 2,200 exhibits, can admire genuine masterpieces.  Here are collected unique monuments, including tombstones, as well as the ruins of buildings that were once a single whole. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lapidary kerch address" class="if" height="415" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1390140.jpg" width="600"></div>
