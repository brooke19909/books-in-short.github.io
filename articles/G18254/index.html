    <p>  In Budapest, along the fault lines that run parallel to the Danube, many sources come to the surface, differing in composition and water temperature.  Lukach, Kirai, and Chasar baths are supplied with healing water that splashes near Rozhadomb Hill, and in the Gellert, Rat and Rudash baths, water comes from under Gellert Mountain.  The sources located to the north are unique, but they are cooler, and therefore they are more often used for swimming than for <span>treatment.</span>  <span>Water</span> from them flows into the baths ‚ÄúRomai‚Äù, ‚ÄúPunk√∂shd‚Äù and ‚ÄúChillaghedi‚Äù. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Budget Hotels in Budapest </h2><p>  One of the most popular hotels among guests of Budapest is Danubius Gellert 4 *.  It is on this territory that a medical bathhouse called "Gellert" is located.  The source of thermal waters that this hotel has been supplying has been an excellent tool for the comprehensive treatment of various diseases for more than 2000 years.  These are chronic diseases of the musculoskeletal system, gynecological problems, metabolic disorders, etc. Of course, the thermal springs of Transcarpathia also have many useful properties, but it‚Äôs better to visit Budapest to eliminate the above problems. </p><p>  No less famous is the metropolitan bathhouse located at the Danubius Thermal 4 * hotel.  As a rule, people come here with rheumatic diseases and anomalies of the motor organs.  ‚ÄúAdina‚Äù, ‚ÄúMariost‚Äù, ‚ÄúHilton‚Äù, ‚ÄúSofitel‚Äù - all these hotels have on their territory Budapest.  Thermal springs from each of them are either located at a slight distance, or are available directly on the territory. </p><h2>  Thermal springs Balfa </h2><p>  The Alps, Lake Ferte, the proximity of Sopron (7 km) and Vienna (75 km) and numerous healing springs - these are the main advantages of the Hungarian resort of Balf.  The local thermal waters were known during the time of the Roman Empire.  True, at that time they belonged to Sopron.  An interesting fact is that it was the first bathhouse in Hungary, the entrance to which was paid.  Of course, this kind of information does not surprise people today who visit thermal springs in the Mostovsky district or elsewhere, because at the moment, as a rule, payment is usually made almost everywhere, but for Hungary at that time it was unusual. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The composition of the local waters contains various salts, sulfur, bicarbonates and many other elements that have a beneficial effect on the musculoskeletal system, which is very much appreciated by patients who have problems with it.  People suffering from diseases of the gastrointestinal tract are prescribed drinking courses of this water. </p><p>  It is worth noting that Balf was badly damaged during the Second World War, and work on its restoration was completed only in 1957.  People undergoing treatment here love to visit the main attractions of the spa town - the cathedral, built in the XIV century, and the bathing chapel, whose murals are unique.  While Absheron thermal springs can only help improve health a little, you can also spend a pleasant and unforgettable vacation in Balf, enjoying not only the local nature, but also visiting nearby cities and places. </p><h2>  Balfa Hotels </h2><p>  Very popular among tourists are such hotels in Balf as the guest house "Stork's Nest" and "Foki".  In the closest location to the thermal springs is the <span>"Stork's Nest".</span>  This hotel offers comfortable rooms with a private bathroom.  There is a kitchen, and if you don‚Äôt want to cook yourself, you can always eat in one of the restaurants located 200 m away. </p><p>  At a distance of 500 meters from the thermal baths is Balf Camping.  The territory has a large garden, in the warmer months there is a swimming pool and a restaurant.  The rooms are equipped with comfortable beds, a fridge, a <span>bathroom</span> and a sofa. </p><p>  A little further from the sources, at a distance of about 1 km, is the Foki.  A big advantage of this hotel is its own garden with all the barbecue facilities.  The rooms are also equipped with everything necessary for a comfortable stay of guests.  There is free parking.  Such amenities can hardly be found in hotels near which there are thermal springs of the Absheron region. </p><p>  Among the four-star hotels in Balfa, it is also worth noting the "Anna Grand Hotel", "Flamingo", "Silver", "Ipoli Residence", "Alba", and the three-star hotels - "Fured", "Marina", "Anabella", "Margareta", " Green Guest. "  Which one of these hotels to choose should be decided by each person for himself, since everyone has different tastes, and therefore often to the place that one liked very much, the other has many complaints. </p><h2>  Buk: hot springs and hotels </h2><p>  Even 30 years ago, people visiting thermal springs in Hungary did not know about the existence of such a place as Buk.  But everything changed after a thermal spring was discovered during oil exploration drilling, the water temperature of which was 58 ¬∞ C.  This water contains magnesium, potassium, hydrogen carbonates, carbon dioxide, fluorine, iodine, and iron.  It is used by people with disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, urological diseases, problems with the cardiovascular system to improve their body as bathtubs or for ingestion before meals. </p><p>  After these thermal springs were discovered in Hungary, Buk began to develop rapidly.  The construction of a hydropathic center, hotels, rest houses, summer residences, polyclinics, an aqua park, gyms, restaurants and other facilities began that could make the wellness stay of guests of the place more enjoyable.  In 1997, a recreation park was opened in Buke, where guests of the resort can enjoy pleasant walks.  The golf course located here, which is the largest in Central Europe, deserves special attention, which you certainly won‚Äôt meet if you choose the thermal springs of the Krasnodar Territory for your wellness stay. </p>

    <p>  People who arrived in Buk for treatment can stay in the cozy Hotel Ingir Pansio, consisting of 14 double rooms.  The hotel has its own garden, where environmentally friendly vegetables, herbs, fruits grow, which are served on a table by vacationers.  Another advantage of this hotel is that its guests organize a sightseeing tour of Bukfurdo absolutely free. </p><h2>  Sarvar - treatment and accommodation </h2><p>  One of the youngest resorts in the country is Sarvar.  The first medical hotel was built here only 10 years ago, although much earlier it was known that there are thermal springs. </p><p>  Hungary, the prices for rest and treatment in which, I must say, are quite affordable, is generally a wonderful place accessible to everyone.  So, for 7 nights on average you have to pay 300 euros, the minimum cost of a wellness stay is 200 euros, and the maximum is about 500 euros.  This is for reference.  Next, we continue the conversation about Sharvar. </p><p>  In this town the world-famous salt ‚ÄúSharvar Thermal Crystal‚Äù is made, which is obtained by evaporation of water from local sources.  It is also used to saturate water in bathtubs, the stay in which is indicated for people suffering from diseases of the spine and joints.  In addition, inhalations for respiratory diseases are made on the basis of this salt.  The most famous source of Sharvar is Rabashemyen, which is located at a depth of 2000 m and has a temperature of 83 ¬∞ C. </p><p>  The best hotel of the resort is the "Spirit Termala SPA".  It was erected in 2008, but after a year of its work was awarded as the best ‚ÄúWellness‚Äù of Hungary.  You will definitely not be able to find hotels of this level if you choose Russian thermal springs for your treatment.  The Stavropol Territory, unfortunately, will not soon be able to offer accommodation in hotels of this level.  Among the best hotels in S√°rv√°r can also be attributed Danubius, which is located next to the local arboretum. </p><h2>  Heviz thermal springs </h2><p>  The largest and most famous resort in Hungary is Heviz and its unique thermal springs.  The Stavropol Territory is also famous for its waters, but, nevertheless, Heviz annually receives a much larger number of vacationers from around the world.  This resort enjoys such huge popularity due to the presence of a thermal lake on its territory.  Its depth is 36 meters and a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã4.7 hectares. </p><p>  The maximum temperature of the lake is 33-34 ¬∞ C in the summer months and 26 ¬∞ C in winter.  It is worth noting that in 28-30 hours the water in the lake is completely updated.  This happens due to the constant flow from the source and slow rotation clockwise.  Due to this mixing, the same temperature is reached at all points of the lake.  The composition of the local sources contains alkali, bicarbonate, sulfur.  In addition, the water in the lake is a little radioactive, due to which it has a therapeutic effect on the course of gout, diseases of the musculoskeletal system, ankylosing spondylitis, post-traumatic conditions.  Local mud is also widely used, which the thermal springs of Transcarpathia cannot provide. </p>

    <p>  A pleasant wellness stay in Heviz is ensured by the presence of such attractions as the forest park surrounding the lake, the city Hall, as well as the museum, which displays numerous exhibits related to the history of this place. </p><h2>  Popular resorts in Heviz </h2><p>  Many people who have arrived for treatment in Heviz stop at the ‚ÄúSt. Andras Rheumatic Clinic‚Äù.  But this is far from the only place intended for living and recovery.  Such hotels as Lotus Terme, Spring Heviz, NaturMed Carbona, Europe Fit, Thermal SPA Aqua, Palace, Helios, SPA Heviz deserve attention.  All of them have their own medical base and can offer their guests the best conditions for living and health.  These are comfortable rooms with everything you need, a menu with healthy dishes, and attentive staff.  The Panorama Hotel is also popular, which uses a city hospital to treat its guests, with which there is a corridor connection. </p><p>  In Heviz there is an opportunity to settle not only in sanatoriums, which is especially important for people who come here just to relax and visit the thermal springs.  Recreation facilities at this resort are the most diverse.  And among them, every tourist can find an option in which he will be satisfied with the equipment of rooms and territory, food, staff and the location of the hotel. </p><h2>  Harkany Hotels with a Pool </h2><p>  Near the Croatian border is another very popular resort in Hungary - Harkany.  Just 26 km from it is Pecs - the famous university and cultural center of the country.  Harkani thermal springs were discovered back in 1825, but this happened by accident.  Workers once dug a canal, and they had to stay for a long time in the water that came out from under the ground.  After such a ‚Äúbath,‚Äù they noticed the disappearance of joint pain. </p><p>  The local waters are distinguished by the presence in their composition of the highest sulfur content.  Water of any other resort in Hungary does not possess such properties, as well as Russian <span>thermal springs of the Krasnodar Territory.</span>  The temperature of Harkany water is 62 ¬∞ C.  It is widely used in the treatment of chronic gynecological diseases, all kinds of diseases of the joints and spine, skin diseases. </p>
