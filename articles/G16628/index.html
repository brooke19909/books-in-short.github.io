Credit Cards: Reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Almost everyone now has a credit card in stock, so to speak, ‚Äújust in case‚Äù.  This is a convenient banking tool for paying for purchases both in ordinary stores and on online resources.  Is it possible to withdraw money from a credit card without paying interest for it? </p><h2>  Why do we need interest </h2><p>  Any financial institution will never work at a loss for itself, therefore, creating credit products even on the most favorable conditions for the client, the bank will not offend itself.  Why are there commissions and interest for using cards? </p><p>  Firstly, servicing ATMs and paying rent is not cheap, so many banks charge interest on money withdrawals, and they can reach about 10% for some organizations.  Secondly, issuing and servicing a card also requires cash costs from the bank, therefore, usually a financial institution charges a fee for either issuing a card or servicing it in the form of a monthly or annual fee. </p>

    <p>  But banks compensate for these nuances by the fact that the percentage is not taken when paying for purchases or housing and communal services, as well as for operations in online stores and when paying for mobile. </p><p>  In addition, all banks offer interest-free periods for using credit cards.  They can be from 50 to 100 days.  If the debt is repaid within the prescribed period, the bank does not charge a fee for using the money. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But still, is it possible to withdraw money from a credit card? </p><h2>  How to cash </h2><p>  For cashing money from a <span>credit card, the bank</span> can take a percentage, and considerable.  But there are some tricks, knowing which, you can withdraw money without interest. </p><p>  Everyone is familiar with the WebMoney, Yandex.Money, Qiwi <span>e-wallets</span> , etc. It is with them that you can cash a credit card.  For the transfer of small amounts, of course, the bank will withdraw interest, and the service will take a commission.  But starting from 3000 rubles, you can withdraw money from a credit card without commission. </p><p>  The only thing, the payment system in any case will take its percentage when the money is withdrawn from the electronic wallet.  But here it‚Äôs worth considering whether to give 0.8% (commission of payment systems), or from 3 to 7% (bank commission).  The percentage for withdrawing cash from a credit card depends on the conditions of the bank. </p>

    <p>  Here is some of them: </p><ol><li>  Purchase any item in the store.  According to the law on consumer rights, goods can be returned within two weeks without explanation.  Having paid for the goods with a credit card, the return of the amount can be made in cash.  Thus, the percentage for the purchase is not withdrawn, and after a while there is cash in your pocket. </li><li>  Make a purchase in the online store.  When paying for a purchase with a credit card, the bank does not withdraw interest.  Then after a while you can cancel the order and request a refund to the debit card.  But in this case, you will have to wait up to five business days. </li><li>  Invite a friend to use a credit card for purchase.  In this case, a friend or acquaintance of the owner of the credit card pays for his purchase using the proposed credit card.  Accordingly, the cardholder receives cash in an equivalent amount. </li><li>  Payment by mobile phone.  Topping up a mobile account with a credit card occurs without interest.  Then you can withdraw this money to a regular card.  But here you need to remember that the mobile operator can take interest on their services.  It turns out that the money will leave the credit card without commission, but the operator will have to pay. </li></ol><p>  In addition to these tricky methods, there are probably more options on how to withdraw money from a credit card with a minimum percentage or no at all, but nothing is known about them yet. </p><h2>  Terms of registration </h2><p>  When issuing a card, it is better to check with the bank manager whether it is possible to withdraw money from a credit card and what percentage will be charged for this so that there are no surprises in the future. </p>

    <p>  The conditions for issuing a credit card are quite simple: </p><ul><li>  The borrower can visit the bank office or fill out an online application for a card. </li><li>  The age of the borrower must be from 21 years to 70 years. </li><li>  You must have a steady income. </li><li>  The borrower must have a residence permit in the region where he takes the card. </li><li>  It is necessary to provide the documents requested by the bank.  This is usually a passport and a second identity document.  If the amount on the card is large, the bank may request a statement of income. </li></ul><p>  In general, as can be seen from the requirements, they are similar to those presented when applying for any loan. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Credit cards, reviews of which are the most diverse, are very popular.  Bank customers say that this is a great helper in situations where money is needed urgently, and salary is still far away. </p><p>  The <span>grace period</span> that each bank provides is very helpful.  It turns out that money can be used without paying a commission.  If you wish, you can withdraw money, but here you need to consider the percentage for this process. </p>

    <p>  Since Sberbank is the most recognizable and widespread bank now, accordingly, the clients of this bank have questions: Does Sberbank allow withdrawing money from a credit card?  Interest for the service?  Is there a grace period after surgery? </p><p>  According to reviews, you can answer that this financial institution allows you to withdraw money from credit cards, as well as transfer them to electronic wallets.  In the first case, the commission will be from 3% and the grace period will not work, in the second - if the amount is above 3000 rubles, then the percentage is zero and the grace period is maintained. </p>
