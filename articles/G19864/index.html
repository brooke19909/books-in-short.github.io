In this regard, almost all financial institutions, including Sberbank, the obvious leader in the country's money industry, offer better rates to borrowers who have received insurance.  In this case, only those policies are accepted that are framed in accordance with the requirements of the credit organization, that is, in accredited companies. </p><div class="photo" data-original="primpress.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="insurance companies partners of a savings bank mortgage insurance" class="if uuid-3082241" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3082241.jpg"></div><p>  Sberbank's partner insurance companies will be discussed later. </p><h2>  Mortgage and conditions </h2><p>  Eighteen companies are currently accredited to carry out mortgage insurance in the financial institution in question.  This also includes the subsidiary of the institution - Sberbank Insurance.  There are other insurance companies-partners of Sberbank for mortgage insurance that meet the basic requirements. </p><p>  Each organization independently determines the conditions of the services offered to customers.  This is the essence of competition, when mortgage borrowers get the opportunity to choose more advantageous commercial offers for them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Consider the <span>insurance companies partner of</span> Sberbank on a mortgage loan. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bitcoinmagazine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="insurance companies Sberbank partners mortgage life insurance" class="if uuid-3082229" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3082229.jpg"></div><h2>  Mortgage Partners: A List of the Best </h2><p>  Here is a complete list of organizations that cooperate with this bank.  So, the most serious participants are: </p><ul><li>  One of them is RESO-Garantia, which ranks second in the ranking of institutions following the results of last year, second only to Sberbank Life Insurance.  Each year, this company collects from customers more than eighty-nine billion rubles in the form of bonuses.  Mortgage rates range from 0.15 to 0.67 percent.  It is better to get information about Sberbank partner companies in mortgage and life insurance in advance. </li><li>  VTB Insurance is the next in the ranking of the largest companies in the country.  Mortgage borrowers are offered preferential programs that provide for the issuance of policies not for one year, as is usually the case, but immediately for three or five years.  What other insurance partner companies of Sberbank exist? </li><li>  AlfaStrakhovanie Institution is a member of one of the leading financial holdings Alfa Group and the largest private member of the relevant market.  It is today in fourth place in terms of collected insurance premiums. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="novostivoronezha.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="insurance companies Sberbank partners in mortgage lending" class="if uuid-3082247" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3082247.jpg"></div><ul><li>  VSK currently ranks fifth in the rating of Sberbank's partner insurance companies for mortgage insurance.  Among competitors, a variety of types of services and offered products, including mortgage real estate, stands out. </li></ul><p>  Among the other insurance companies-partners of Sberbank for mortgage lending, there are two more that are among the top ten, namely: SOGAZ and Ingosstrakh.  Thus, customers of a financial institution are given the opportunity to choose the most advantageous offer from several made by the obvious leaders of the Russian insurance market. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  We continue to consider insurance companies-partners of Sberbank for mortgages and life insurance. </p><h2>  Life Insurance Terms </h2><p>  The list of companies accredited by Sberbank for various loan products, with the exception of mortgage services, includes fifteen companies that meet basic requirements. </p><p>  The life insurance conditions that are offered by different companies as part of a loan can vary very significantly.  As a rule, this is facilitated by the factor that the rate is tied to an amount that varies according to the client‚Äôs request, unlike the same mortgage, where there is a certain and understandable value of the property.  As a result, the price of insurance varies in the range from 0.74 to 3 percent of the value of the amount, and it is determined individually for each client and loan product.  Now consider the main offers of this service. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cheapestcarinsuronline.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank partners mortgage insurance companies" class="if uuid-3082231" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3082231.jpg"></div><h2>  Programs </h2><p>  The following programs are offered for the customers of Sberbank on the official website of this financial organization: </p><ul><li>  Registration of a multipolis, which is a unique offer that includes almost all types of insurance. </li><li>  Home Protection is intended for those who apply for mortgages. </li><li>  ‚ÄúProtection of near and dear ones‚Äù - this service provides guarantees to customers in case of damage to the health of relatives. </li><li>  Disease and accident insurance.  It is in great demand and in demand due to the low level of tariffs and a significant number of possible unforeseen situations that are included in the policy. </li><li>  Service for traveling citizens. </li><li>  For owners of plastic cards.  This offer is a relatively new insurance product that is popular, due to the large number of debit and credit plastics issued by the bank. </li><li>  Investment and endowment life insurance.  These types of insurance are offered to privileged clients of the financial institution in question who use the services of the Sberbank Premier and Sberbank First packages. </li></ul><h2>  Life Insurance Partner Companies </h2><p>  Most of the organizations described above as part of the list of accredited for mortgage insurance are approved by Sberbank even before life insurance.  These include VTB Insurance, Alfa Insurance, SOGAZ, Ingosstrakh, VSK, RESO-Garantia.  In addition, the following companies are among the partners: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.forbes.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="insurance companies partners of a savings bank mortgage life insurance rate" class="if uuid-3082252" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3082252.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Sberbank Life Insurance Company, a subsidiary of the parent organization.  She tops the rating of market participants.  The institution collected over the past year almost thirty two billion rubles of insurance premiums, which is significantly more than that of competitors.  An important role in this was played by lobbying for the interests of the company from Sberbank, which has the largest client base in Russia.  <span>The partner insurance companies of</span> Sberbank of Russia are basically all large and reliable. </li><li>  The institution "Zetta Insurance" closes the top 30 in the ranking in terms of the volume of premiums collected.  Among the main achievements of this organization is the offer of more than nine dozen different programs. </li><li>  Liberty Insurance Company is in the fortieth place among major participants in the domestic market.  It is part of the international group of the same name, which provides it with a very reliable financial base along with a stable position, which distinguishes the organization from many competitors. </li><li>  The Surgutneftegas establishment is owned by one of the large oil enterprises.  As a result, it is the leader in the insurance market of Western Siberia, where the main production capacities are located.  This company is a direct client of Sberbank, which is considered the main factor in mutually beneficial cooperation. </li><li>  The Absolute Insurance company is in the top 50 in the insurance market and ranks forty-eighth.  The main feature of this company is its active work with Sberbank customers along with participation in the ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù loyalty program.  As a result, leaders of the banking sector are provided with serious discounts for borrowers, which makes it possible to significantly increase their own client base. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="cmri.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="insurance companies partners of Sberbank mortgage insurance" class="if uuid-3082232" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3082232.jpg"></div><p>  The rate of Sberbank partner insurance companies for mortgages and life insurance is always calculated individually. </p><h2>  Sberbank and its insurance partners </h2><p>  This organization is the undoubted leader in the financial sector of the country.  As an example, one should cite the following data: by the criterion of the volume of assets, it is ahead of VTB, which is in second place in the ranking, by almost two and a half times.  The logical result of this provision is the presence of a large customer base.  Not surprisingly, any insurance company wants to be among the accredited by Sberbank.  True, it is not at all easy to do this even for well-known and large insurers. </p><h2>  Rosgosstrakh lost accreditation </h2><p>  For example, a recent leader in the insurance industry, Rosgosstrakh, has lost accreditation from Sberbank due to violation of several requirements.  This decision almost immediately affected the financial condition of the institution, which before that was not the most stable.  In addition, last year, Rosgosstrakh went down immediately to nine places in the ranking of the largest companies, falling from the first to the tenth.  It is important to emphasize that the forecasts for the coming year for this insurer are also unfavorable.  The above example demonstrates the importance of successful mutual cooperation with Sberbank and the availability of accreditation, which is a prerequisite. </p><p>  We also provide below information about Sberbank's auto insurance partner companies for car loans. </p><h2>  Auto loan partner organizations </h2><p>  By issuing such a service at a relatively small percentage, Sberbank seeks to minimize the risk of loan defaults.  In this regard, one of the basic conditions for car loans is an additional mandatory insurance of secured vehicles.  In other words, CASCO insurance policies. </p><p>  Each bank (and Sberbank is no exception) interacts with a specific list of insurance companies whose activities are verified and satisfy all the requirements of the financial structure.  Among these, it is worth noting: VTB Insurance, Ingosstrakh, VSK, Alfa Insurance, Regiongarant, Zhaso, Sberbank Insurance, Helios, Adonis, Sputnik and others. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.iii.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="insurance companies partners of Sberbank of Russia" class="if uuid-3082238" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3082238.jpg"></div><h2>  Conditions to be met by the organization </h2><p>  A credited citizen has the right, at his discretion, to choose the most suitable company for himself.  The main thing is that she satisfy the following conditions: </p><ul><li>  Has been active in the market for more than three years. </li><li>  Be sure to comply with all necessary norms and rules imposed by Russian law. </li><li>  Comply with banking requirements in terms of solvency and financial stability. </li></ul><p>  As part of the confirmation of the above factors, the borrower agrees to produce the relevant documents. </p><h2>  Features of car loans in Sberbank </h2><p>  Most financial institutions, including this one, prefer to issue a loan only subject to a CASCO policy.  What is it and what advantages does it give to the client?  The fact is that this service compensates for the risk associated with the theft of a car or an accident, causing damage to a vehicle, the occurrence of various accidents, such as, for example, a tree falling, a collision with a wild animal, and the like.  Compulsory motor third party liability insurance covers only the risks associated with road traffic accidents. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Nevertheless, regardless of the type of product chosen, customers trust Sberbank and its insurance partners.  This financial institution, as already noted, has many partner companies in this area.  It is worth noting that they all strive to develop the most favorable offers and conditions for customers. </p><p>  We examined Sberbank's <span>partner insurance companies</span> for mortgages, life insurance and car loans. </p>
