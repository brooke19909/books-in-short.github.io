However, sometimes there are situations when in such a tropical resort the goal is the same - to survive.  There may be many situations why this happened, but there is only one result.  Therefore, there are several rules that will help you best get out of the situation. </p><p>  Do not panic </p><p>  First, you should assess the situation, looking around. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Uninhabited island" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10523/138193.jpg" width="450"></div>  Quite often in such cases, people may have amnesia.  Therefore, you should calm down, think and remember what happened, what events preceded this.  It is also important at what time of day you are there.  If it is day and the sun is directly above you, it is worth exploring a desert island and finding a shadow.  In addition, you should not be very active in behaving: screaming, running, as this can attract the attention of animals, among which there may be predators.

    <p>  Try to locate </p><p>  Take a look around if there is a pond nearby.  Sometimes people get to an uninhabited island from the air.  Therefore, your fall can happen right in the forest.  In this case, you should try to find a pond.  It can be a river, ocean, sea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Survive a desert island at all costs" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10523/138192.jpg" width="600"></div>  If this is a river, following along the coast, you may come across locals and ask for their help.  In that case, if you can‚Äôt navigate, it‚Äôs worth starting the construction of an overnight stay.  Remember, in such places the darkness creeps up unexpectedly, it can be fraught with many dangers.

It will be enough to build a hut.  Temporary housing should protect against the scorching <span>sun during the day</span> and tropical torrential rains at night.  Do not forget about firewood.  If possible, it is worth stocking up as many of them as possible, however, it is desirable that they be dry.  If you don‚Äôt have lighters and matches, then you will have to turn to the experience of your ancestors and get fire using a piece of dry bark and a small twig.  They must be rubbed against each other until a spark appears, which later turns into a flame.  However, it is worth remembering that it can take more than one hour, so you should be prepared for this and show perseverance.  Fire will help drive away animals, cook food, warm you. </p><p>  Food search </p>

Therefore, it is advisable to find food in advance.  Here they can become berries and plants.  You may also see familiar fruits, such as coconuts and bananas.  However, if you meet a fruit that is not known to you, then it is better not to eat it.  Remember, it can be poisonous.  It may also happen that insects will have to eat, of course, they do not look very edible, but can be very nutritious.

    <p>  Fresh water </p><p>  You need to look around and look for a source of <span>fresh water.</span>  If he is found, you can consider yourself lucky.  However, it is worth remembering that many unknown microorganisms may not be able to survive at all costs.  An uninhabited island can bring unpleasant surprises in this case, such as poisoning or dysbiosis.  Therefore, water must be boiled.  If there is no reservoir, then it will have to collect dew and rain.  To do this, use large leaves.  Of course, this method will not allow quenching thirst, but it will not let die either. </p><p>  Signaling means </p><p>  Probably, everyone saw pictures in which a person fell on a desert island.  Photos usually reflect that torches are used as signaling devices.  It‚Äôs easy to build them using dry leaves and dumping them with a mountain.  You can put a word out of them.  When you see or hear a vehicle, you should immediately give signals. </p>
