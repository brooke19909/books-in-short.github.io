    <p>  Alexandria Park in Peterhof began its history in the 18th century, it was then that Emperor Peter 1 ordered to give these lands to cottages.  Over time, this territory becomes the property of Anna Ioannovna, who decides to equip here a wonderful place for hunting. </p><p>  To do this, an area of ‚Äã‚Äãalmost 6 square kilometers is fenced with a special fence and begin to build houses for guests.  On the shore of the bay was erected a gazebo "Tempel" - the queen's favorite place.  This building is a place often visited by tourists who came on an excursion to Alexandria <span>Park.</span>  <span>The menagerie</span> in Peterhof (the so-called hunting grounds) represented a wide variety of animals - wild boars, hares, deer, wolves, bears, arctic foxes, and even there were tigers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the seventies in Tsarskoye Selo they decided to build a summer imperial summer house for relaxation.  Already in the 19th century, Nicholas 1 presented these lands as a gift to his wife Alexandra Fedorovna. </p><p>  Alexandria Park is considered a monument not only of architecture, but also of history, because it was here that four generations of the Romanov family lived. </p><p>  Basically, the buildings in it are presented in the Neo-Gothic style.  They were created by famous architects: the Scotsman A. Menelas, the Russian A.I. Shtakenschneider and the German K.F.Schinkel.  During its existence, the park has undergone many changes, especially during the Second World War. </p><p>  Nowadays, it is one of the national attractions of the region, representing a palace and park ensemble.  It is also a great place for walking and relaxing with your family or friends. </p><h2>  Beauty Description </h2><p>  In addition to a wide variety of monuments located on the territory, Alexandria Park boasts its meadows, hills, glades.  Majestic oaks, slender beauties of birch grow in the square.  There are also rare species of trees and shrubs imported from exotic countries.  Due to the successful combination of terrain and green spaces, the landscape of the park is simply incomparable.  Also, the whole territory is decorated with small sculptures, arbors and guards. </p><p>  One of the main attractions is the Nikolskaya Alley, which begins at the western gate in a stone wall and passes a straight line through the entire Alexandria Park - to the Big Pond.  She divided the area into the northern coastal and southern upland. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  The history of one palace </h2><p>  Not far from the western entrance, on a hill, is the Farm Palace.  His story is very interesting.  Initially, a cowshed with a dairy farm was built in this place.  Subsequently, minor changes, which were constantly introduced by architects, led to the fact that the simple pavilion became a palace. </p><p>  Over time, this place became a favorite for summer summer vacation of the family of Alexander II.  Near the palace was equipped with a playground for games. </p><p>  The building also has historical value - it was here that the draft decree on the abolition of serfdom was considered.  In addition, during the construction of the building, a technical breakthrough was made - the first elevator was installed, although it worked manually. </p><p>  Throughout its history, the palace has seen a lot: children and grandchildren of emperors, a museum on its territory, a boarding house, destruction during the war. </p><p>  In our time, a complete restoration of the building began, but all the efforts were destroyed by a fire that occurred due to the fault of workers.  In this regard, everything was started all over again.  So, in 2010, the Farm Palace, completely renovated, opened its doors to guests. </p>

    <h2>  Famous buildings </h2><p>  The last in the list of major attractions of the park is the Lower Dacha of Nicholas II, which is located in a picturesque coastal location.  Here the signing of a historical document took place - a manifesto on Russia's entry into the First World War. </p><p>  During the revolution, this building received the most damage, therefore, for the safety of tourists, the remains of the building were blown up.  In our time, restoration work has not begun. </p><p>  Also on the territory of the park is the Big Ruin Stone Bridge.  Its name is associated with the nearby ruins of the Moncuraj Palace - it was not completed <span>by A.D. Menshikov</span> at one time <span>.</span> </p>
