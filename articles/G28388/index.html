It is full of varieties, design options, history, award conditions.  Previously, people, money, fame, their own interests were not so important.  The motto for everyone was this: first, the Motherland, then their own personal life.  This article will focus on the Order of Lenin. </p><h2>  Where are its origins? </h2><p>  Perhaps more than one person is interested in this.  The Order of Lenin first appeared in 1926 (then there was already the highest award for military personnel - the Order of the Red Banner).  The state adoption of such an order was to reward the commanders and soldiers of the Red Army and Navy.  He had to replace with himself all the highest awards, as well as those that were lower in the hierarchy.  Initially, they wanted to call such an order the "Order of Ilyich." </p><p>  However, the government‚Äôs idea was realized under the title of ‚ÄúOrder of Lenin‚Äù, and the official approval took place in 1930.  A special statute recognized that such an order can be awarded not only to citizens (individuals), but also warships, legal entities (organizations, enterprises), even cities and republics.  Just think how happy the person who was awarded this order was.  It was decided to issue him only for special military, labor and revolutionary services to the state.  Since the advent and existence of such a state promotion, it has undergone many species changes. </p><h2>  Order of the Lenin Banner </h2><p>  So the order was sometimes called because it was approved and approved along with the Order of the Red Banner.  For the first time, the citizen was awarded the Order of Lenin for special services to the state on May 23, 1930.  Such information was posted in the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda.  The next awarded, a year later, were servicemen who distinguished themselves after putting out a fire.  In 1934, for the first time such an award was awarded to foreigners.  In the same year, a new title of Hero of the Soviet Union appeared, so citizens who were awarded this title were also awarded the Order of Lenin. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.bloomberg.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Order of Lenin" class="if uuid-2303576" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69684/2303576.jpg"></div><h2>  USSR </h2><p>  He also was called among the people as an order of the Soviet Union.  Subsequently, the appearance of this award, the Institute of Engineers, which still exists in the city of Moscow, was renamed in honor of it.  And he began to be called the Moscow Order of Lenin.  Over the image depicted on the order, several artists and sculptors tried.  The basis for its creation was a photograph taken during one of the congresses of the Comintern.  In 1931, the first Decree was signed on the issuance of the Order of Lenin in the USSR to oil companies, as well as their individual employees. </p><h2>  Heroes Awarded </h2><p>  The list of those awarded the Order of Lenin for their exploits is quite large.  I would like to highlight a few people who received the award several times.  Among these people are N. Patolichev, F. Ustinov.  A soldier of the Red Army - R. Panchenko received the order in 1933.  We can say that the presentation of the order more than ten times was not the only case.  The awarded were listed as holders of the Order of Lenin.  The list also included: F. M. Abaev, V. F. Abramov, N. A. Babaev, I. A. Blinov, N. F. Bogatyrev, A. M. Bondarev.  This list goes on and on.  The list of those awarded the Order of Lenin is what remains in history so that future generations will know those who have done real things for their homeland.  He deserves a place of honor in history so that growing children and young people know who to look up to. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Order of Lenin - Labor Order </h2><p>  The order was issued as an incentive for a long and dedicated work, revolutionary movements.  The award was even given to heroine mothers (but the title "Mother Heroine" was approved for them).  The lucky owners wore such an order on the left side of the chest.  With other awards, he should have been prominently in front of them.  Sometimes other medals and insignia over the country served as an advantage for receiving it.  Incentives for labor were issued for the purpose of motivation, to improve the quality of labor. </p><div class="photo" data-original="goldbrothers13.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Order of Lenin list" class="if uuid-2303562" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69684/2303562.jpg"></div><p>  Presentation of such a ‚Äúgift‚Äù was very exciting.  And even more so in the USSR, when the people had a different worldview, stereotypes, principles of life.  Soviet man was responsible, collected, and hardworking.  And getting a medal or order is an important step towards further development, self-affirmation and respect from others.  The history also contains data on the awards of plant directors, the President of the Academy of Sciences, well-known oil companies and organizations.  The appointment indicated ‚Äúfor technical re-equipment, achievements in the field of labor‚Äù and much more.  And the name of A. Pugachev, it is worth noting, is due to the fact that he created the first test sample of the Order of Lenin.  By the way, the mentioned Komsomolka newspaper was also honored with such an award.  What was written in herself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.greatestcollectibles.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knights of the Order of Lenin" class="if uuid-2303563" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69684/2303563.jpg"></div><h2>  Order of awarding military personnel </h2><p>  In this case, the military had its own special procedure for awarding the award.  It has also been approved by government agencies.  And there were significant differences from the usual, general order.  This issue was especially acute during the war years.  Namely, when the award was issued, and the person at the end of hostilities was obliged to prove that he was handed it to the commander.  Although there was no Decree of the Presidium on her appointment.  In the pre-war time, the situation was different - there were few awarded, so there were no special problems. </p><p>  After a while, the right to reward lay on the shoulders of the commanders.  Among the awards there was a hierarchy of its own, everything was listed in a special table.  In addition to the Order of Lenin, servicemen were awarded "for the defense of Leningrad", "Partisan of the Great Patriotic War" and so on.  Subsequently, the adopted legal acts were changed and supplemented, which is happening to this day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.naver.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="awarded the Order of Lenin" class="if uuid-2303558" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69684/2303558.jpg"></div><h2>  First publications about the order </h2><p>  In the USSR there were a number of print publications, which included lists of awarded persons.  Such publications were ‚ÄúKomsomolskaya Pravda‚Äù, or popularly called ‚ÄúKomsomolskaya Pravda‚Äù, a compilation of the Presidium of the USSR, entitled ‚ÄúVedomosti of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR‚Äù, decrees of the President, and Decisions of the CEC of the Russian Federation.  They indicated a list with last names, first names and patronymics.  Information about the promotion, award, its name, date, reason for receiving. </p><p>  The so-called ‚Äúcrust‚Äù, that is, a certificate confirming receipt of the award by the very person to whom it was issued, came with the order or medal.  It indicated all the necessary data, and in some cases a photograph of the future owner was attached.  The certificate was small in size, about the height of a hanging medal, in the form of a small cardboard card folded in half.  One feature can be distinguished, such a ‚Äúcrust‚Äù was important, therefore the cost of the order without it was significantly reduced. </p><div class="photo" data-original="odysseus1.freeyellow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Awarded the Order of Lenin Award List" class="if uuid-2303565" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69684/2303565.jpg"></div><h2>  Varieties of the Order </h2><p>  Types of the order was enough.  Each was issued under its own identification number.  So, at number 170, a <span>silver medallion</span> was issued <span>,</span> and on top of it was a gold rim.  It depicted Lenin, as well as the inscription "USSR", a sickle and a hammer.  And of course the word Goznak.  In the thirties, a golden screw order with a bright red enamel banner was also issued.  Such awards were in several versions.  In the forties, up to the nineties, suspended models were in use.  The medallion was fastened by the ear to a special ribbon.  Despite this, such orders were also issued by different mints.  In the manufacture of them there was one interesting detail - the individual parts were then fastened together. </p><p>  Various alloys were also used and applied: platinum, silver, gold.  And the weight naturally varied.  And it was legislatively fixed how and how this order was to be made.  Among the indicators: length, width, weight, material, height, diameter. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.warrelics.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Order of Lenin Order of Labor" class="if uuid-2303573" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69684/2303573.jpg"></div><h2>  Order value </h2><p>  It is no secret that orders and medals, not only the Order of Lenin, but also others, interest modern society at a price.  Especially those who are not "clean at hand" who want to steal rewards by fraudulent means, so to speak criminal.  After all, the price of many awards among collectors is a decent amount.  For example, the Order of Lenin for military services to our country reaches just over one hundred thousand rubles.  In addition, many buyers believe that such an activity helps to invest their money wisely and profitably (since the price of certain awards only grows every year). </p><p>  From the point of view of sales, for some, this was a way out of a difficult life situation, when you can get some money for emergency treatment, a trip and so on.  But nevertheless, it is worth noting that for some orders of their relatives and friends - the memory that they keep and pass on by inheritance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.antiques.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Order of Lenin of the USSR" class="if uuid-2303568" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69684/2303568.jpg"></div><h2>  Order Value </h2><p>  Speaking about the importance of the order, of course, I want to highlight the features.  His appearance is historical.  Around him, there are several provisions.  Firstly, its significance and acceptance was determined only by the Presidium of the Supreme Council.  The request for the appointment of a citizen as such an award could come only at the initiative of state or military bodies.  The state also established a document that prescribed the procedure for wearing and rewarding.  The Presidium could decide to withdraw the award received by the citizen.  There are about four hundred people awarded this order. </p><h2>  Recollections of the awarded </h2><p>  People who received a well-deserved award or order from the state recalled that it was very honorable for them.  Especially grandmothers with tears in their eyes mentioned the orders and medals that had gone through hard work.  For them it was a tribute.  Now, the young generation is invited to the lessons of history, as a good example, a person who can tell about his life situation, when and how he was marked with an honorary title.  A person is pleased to talk about the fact that he received recognition, praise from the state itself.  Elderly people can happily tell how, when and why they received this medal, order, badge.  But there are those who receive in very rare cases.  This is correct.  Even in school museums original copies are kept that can be touched, as well as learn about a particular award from the teacher.  After all, knowing a piece of history, you begin to become aware, think and reason. </p><p>  At lectures in universities on historical disciplines demonstrate not only awards, orders and medals, but also diplomas, certificates, historical documents, money.  Pupils and students are beginning to understand that with their efforts, sports achievements, human attitude to others and the world as a whole, you can earn a reward to this day.  Certificate of honor, commemorative badge, medal, and in the future, perhaps the title and order. </p>
