Many market experts characterize it as being perfectly adapted to the needs of people who do not have much experience in using cameras, which have the ability to fine-tune shooting modes.  What are the most notable features of this device?  What are its competitive advantages over peers in the same market segment? </p><h2>  Canon EOS 1100D: general information </h2><p>  The Canon EOS 1100D camera, reviews of which are found on so many IT portals, is classified by most experts as a budget SLR camera.  Some experts distinguish such devices in a separate subtype - those that do not have a rotary display.  At the same time, the manufacturer, as some experts and users believe, having left reviews on thematic resources after studying the Canon EOS 1100D, probably decided to save also on the screen size. </p>

    <p>  The display resolution of this camera is several times less than that of many competing counterparts.  For this reason, it is difficult to shoot video in Full HD mode with it.  At the same time, the affordable price of the device, as well as a rather diverse functionality determine its high popularity in Russia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Modifications </h2><p>  There are several modifications in which the Canon EOS 1100D camera is available.  Feedback from experts and users regarding their spectrum allows us to say that the capabilities of each of them are the same.  However, there is still a difference due to a number of technological aspects. </p><p>  The full name of the camera is Canon EOS 1100D Kit 18 55. One of two indexes can be added to it.  Namely - IS or DC.  In addition, there may be a Latin digit - II or III.  Also, in some cases, a color or design concept is fixed - for example, Black or Body.  In this case, the sequence of letters and numbers that reflect a specific modification of the device may be different.  For example, in some directories it may appear as a Canon EOS 1100D 18 55 IS II Kit Black camera.  Reviews about this device, in turn, may contain a different sequence of numbers and letters in the name. </p>

    <p>  What does DS mean?  This is nothing more than the type of engine installed on the camera‚Äôs lenses - in this modification it is considered more budgetary, somewhat slowed down in focusing.  IS is a stabilizer.  In turn, the numbers II or III indicate the version of the camera lens.  So, II is the younger one.  Thus, different versions of the device differ, in fact, only in the lens.  The Canon EOS 1100D, reviews of which in some cases may affect certain features of the operation of elements with DS and IS indices, can generally be interpreted as referring to all modifications of the device.  In many cases, the choice of a particular version of the device is due not so much to the technological advantages of the lens as to the professional preferences of the photographer. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  Among the most popular modifications is the Canon EOS 1100D 18 55 DC III Kit Black.

    <p>  All cameras have this range of characteristics, including design modifications (such as, for example, the Canon EOS 1100D BoDy).  User reviews, which are among the positive, largely reflect the large number of camera features.  It is also noted that their practical use is sufficiently well adapted for beginners - both in the aspect of the interface, the controls which are located clearly and logically, and in terms of the availability of necessary documentation from the manufacturer. </p><p>  As many experts believe, the above range of characteristics of the camera is quite competitive in relation to the performance of similar devices. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  Consider the design features of the device - it is almost identical to other modifications, including, for example, the Canon EOS 1100D Kit 18 55 IS II.  The reviews of users who have studied the device indicate that the appearance of the device as a whole gives out that it is budget.  In higher-class devices, materials with a rough surface are used to make the case.  Here, all the details are smooth.  There are no auxiliary elements made of rubber, using which it would be more convenient to hold the camera (and it would look in this case, according to some users, more stylishly).  Also, some owners of the device, who left reviews on the factual research forums on the Canon EOS 1100D Kit 18 55 DC III, believe that the device lacks a separate slot for memory cards.  In many competing models, for example, it is located next to the battery. </p>

    <p>  At the same time, experts and users highly value the build quality of the camera.  There are no gaps or backlashes in the case.  All components are fixed securely.  The keys are made with high quality, do not vibrate if the device is shaken when walking or operating.  In front of the device is the lens, as well as the internal microphone of the camera.  Here is the shutter release indicator light.  At the back is the viewfinder, main keys and speaker.  At the top of the device there is a flash, a slider for choosing the optimal shooting mode, a shutter button, as well as a small additional key that can be programmed.  In the lower part of the case there is an opening for a tripod, as well as an area for inserting a battery with a memory card.  On the left are the connectors for the camera‚Äôs wired connections with other devices, covered with a rubber plug.  There are no elements on the right side of the case. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  Let's study the display that the Canon EOS 1100D Kit 18 55 DC III is equipped with.  The reviews about this component are rather contradictory - at the very beginning of the article we noted that the screen resolution is relatively small, in addition, it cannot be rotated.  The camera display has a diagonal of 2.7 inches.  The resolution is modest - 230 thousand pixels.  As for the positive aspects of the screen, then, as experts and users note, the image on it is perfectly visible at all viewing angles.  This property can be especially useful if a person takes pictures looking at the screen from below or from above - the picture will be clearly visible, and you will be given the opportunity to make an excellent shot.  The display is also sufficiently bright.  We also note that it is reliably protected.  The screen use interface is characterized by experts and users as convenient and functional. </p><h2>  Opportunities </h2><p>  What are the most notable features that this unit and its closest ‚Äúbrothers‚Äù have, such as the Canon EOS 1100D KIT 18 55 IS II?  Feedback from experts and users allows us to note that among them, for example, shooting in Live View.  True, when it is activated, the autofocus speed drops somewhat.  But this function is very useful, especially for those owners of the device who do not have sufficient experience with equipment of this level. </p>

    <p>  The device has built-in algorithms for uniform distribution of brightness in the image.  That is, if, for example, due to the peculiarities of lighting, some parts of the image look darker, then the device will automatically adjust the corresponding color balance - however, this is only effective for JPEG images.  If you take a photo in RAW mode, it is more convenient to process the images using third-party programs (including those that are attached to the camera on disks). </p><p>  What other notable features does the Canon EOS 1100D Kit have?  The reviews of experts and users indicate that many people are particularly impressed by the fact that the device can work in the automatic selection of camera settings depending on the environment.  It also has an interesting function for cleaning the matrix using ultrasound (although there is a similar one that works in automatic mode). </p>

    <p>  As for communication capabilities, this is all right with all modifications of the device, including the Canon EOS 1100D 18 55 IS II Kit Black.  User reviews often contain positive ratings characterizing the convenience of connecting the device to third-party devices through common interfaces - via an HDMI cable, as well as an AV / USB cable. </p><h2>  The quality of photographing </h2><p>  Having studied the characteristics of the device, we move on to the practical part.  How good is the device in real use?  What can be the objective criteria for evaluating the quality of photography with the Canon EOS 1100D?  Professional reviews often include opinions based on an analysis of the device‚Äôs focusing speed.  It can be measured, for example, by pointing the lens at a subject located at a short distance, after the device has been directed towards the open space for some time.  Expert tests of this kind showed that the focusing speed of this device is about 0.33-0.39 seconds.  As we noted above, in Live View, this parameter - and this is natural for almost all devices of this class - is characterized by higher values: about 2 seconds.  What are the competitors results of the Canon EOS 1100D Kit?  Expert reviews on the fact of testing analogues are different.  For some models, the device has an advantage.  For others, such as, say, <span>Nikon D3100,</span> which is the main competitor of the device we are studying, the device, based on the test results obtained by experts, loses a little.  At the same time, the device has a remarkable "hybrid" function, in which the camera from Live View can quickly switch to standard. </p><p>  As for the quality of images - it does not cause complaints from users and experts.  What is explained by the class of the device and its technological features.  There is every opportunity to fine-tune photographing modes, select the desired parameters regarding file formats.  In terms of image quality, the Canon EOS 1100D - most of the reviews confirm this - is not inferior to competing solutions.  Therefore, the possible disadvantages of the device in terms of focusing speed can well be compensated by the aesthetics of excellent shots. </p>

    <p>  In which components is the Canon EOS 1100D particularly clearly superior to its competitors?  Expert reviews on this part contain estimates that focus on such a parameter as, for example, automatic adjustment of the white balance by the device.  In particular, the results of shooting under any type of lighting - in the sun or under the light of lamps - as experts believe, are superior in quality to those that are shown, in particular, the Nikon D3100 camera.  The device under study does not allow, as experts especially emphasize, glitches in the exposure setting. </p><p>  There are some comments from IT professionals who tested the device in burst mode.  Again, this applies to frame processing speed.  However, as some experts note, for budget cameras of this class, some flaws in the aspect of this function are not critical. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  How productive is the Canon EOS 1100D in terms of battery life?  The reviews of experts who studied this aspect of the device during testing contain estimates that can be reduced to the following figures.  Considering that the battery capacity in the device is 6.8 W / h, we can expect that the device‚Äôs battery life is enough for about 600 frames.  Although some users who left feedback on the fact of researching the capabilities of the device managed to fix numbers that exceed the ones mentioned above.  Much depends on how intensively the Live View mode is activated, whether the video is used, and also on what the accompanying camera settings are. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  What are the most notable features of the Canon EOS 1100D?  Reviews from experts and users - this is what interests a potential consumer, right?  Let's try to summarize.  So, the owners of the device believe that it is ideally adapted for beginners.  Convenience of the interface, a wide range of functions, high quality shooting - all that is needed for a novice enthusiast.  It is important, users note that the device has several options for connecting to other devices at once.  It is believed that the manufacturer, endowing this device with such useful properties, thereby stimulates the purchase of more expensive models.  Or, at least, it encourages people to be regular customers in the segment of budget models. </p><p>  Among the most noticeable shortcomings of the camera, noted by experts and users, is the modest design.  Some experts believe that the main, as we said, competitor of the device - the Nikon D3100 camera - looks more stylish in this regard.  There are some complaints from experts regarding the use of the device in burst mode, as well as when choosing the Live View function.  The device could use the appropriate features at a more pronounced speed.  Also among the disadvantages is the fact that you can not record video in Full HD mode, since the available screen resolution is not enough. </p><p>  At the same time, in all modifications of the Canon EOS 1100D - user and expert reviews confirm this - it copes with the tasks that are faced by devices of this class.  As for the quality of the photos, the device in question is among the best in its segment.  As for the main technical characteristics, the device, as we noted at the very beginning of the article, is in no way inferior to its counterparts.  Thus, the camera from Canon can well be advised to both novice photographers and amateurs with experience - their basic needs are quite capable of satisfying the device. </p>
