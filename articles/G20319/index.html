  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The economic system of society</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The state economy is represented by a huge complex system.  It covers various activities.  The indicated structure can exist normally under the condition of interdependence and interconnection of all its links. </p><p>  The concept and types of economic systems </p><p>  In a narrow sense, the structure is represented by a set of relations between consumers and producers of goods.  This set has a certain order. </p><p>  The economic system of society provides for the organization and coordination of the economic activities of citizens.  To ensure the activities of the structure, special tools are used.  The main ones are institutions of money, property, government and labor organizations.  An integral part is taxes in the economic system of society.  A special institution has also been created to regulate revenue. </p><p>  In accordance with the foregoing, the economic system of <span>society in the broad sense</span> is an established or arising historically existing in the state complex of specific principles and rules enshrined in law.  At the same time, legal norms determine the content and form of relations in the corresponding sphere of public life. </p><p>  The economic system of the company in accordance with the method of doing business may be a commodity or <span>subsistence economy.</span> </p><p>  There is a separation in <span>ownership.</span>  Thus, the economic system of society can be private, state or (in traditional structures) community. </p><p>  As a classification criterion, forms are also used in accordance with which coordination of economic life is carried out.  These include market, central planning, and tradition.  In accordance with this, such economic systems as traditional <span>economy, mixed</span> structure, command system, pure capitalism are distinguished. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The latter concept provides for the concentration of material resources in private property.  Under the conditions of this economic system, prices and markets are the mechanisms by which coordination and direction of activities are carried out. </p><p>  Team structure is a special method of regulation.  This structure is characterized by a high level of centralization of the economic management function.  In such circumstances, directive methods are used.  The main types of resources are concentrated in state ownership. </p><p>  In a <span>mixed economic system,</span> signs of command and market structure <span>are</span> combined. </p><p>  With the traditional structure, great importance is attached to traditions and customs.  Under the conditions of this system, the economic role of a citizen is regulated by heredity and belonging to a certain class, caste.  Due to the fact that historically formed traditions and customs prevail, the introduction of technical innovations is extremely limited.  This is due to the likelihood of a conflict between the "new" and the "old", which, in turn, may threaten the stability of the traditional system. </p><p>  It should be noted that in modern conditions, states cannot develop in isolation.  In this regard, the leadership of any power faces the question of adapting the state system of the economy to the systems of other countries. </p><p>  Of course, making changes to the economic structure is a rather complicated process, consisting of several stages.  Experts identify the stage of reform, transformation and subsequent development.  The whole process thus appears in the form of a gradual change in social and <span>economic relations</span> in the previous structure, the formation and development of a new system. </p>
