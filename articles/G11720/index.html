Despite the fact that Russia (subsequently Russia) waged wars throughout its entire existence, the concrete division of the army, the assignment of each of its components to a separate role, and also the introduction of the corresponding distinctive signs began to occur only during the time of emperors.  Particular attention was paid to the infantry regiments - the indestructible backbone <span>of the</span> empire's <span>armed forces</span> .  This type of troops has a rich history, since each era (and each new war) introduced tremendous changes in them. </p>

    <h2>  Regiments of the new system (17th century) </h2><p>  The infantry of the Russian Empire, like the cavalry, dates back to 1698 and is a consequence of the army reform of Peter 1. Until that time, the archery regiments prevailed.  However, the emperor‚Äôs desire not to differ from Europe took its toll.  The number of infantry was more than 60% of all troops (not counting the Cossack regiments).  A war was foreseen with Sweden, and in addition to the available soldiers, 25,000 new recruits undergoing military training were selected.  The officers formed exclusively from foreign military and people of noble origin. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Russian military was divided into three categories: </p><ol><li>  Infantry (ground forces). </li><li>  Landmilitia and garrison (local forces). </li><li>  Cossacks (irregular army). </li></ol><p>  In general, the new formation amounted to about 200 thousand people.  Moreover, the infantry stood out as the main type of troops.  Closer to 1720 a new rank system was introduced. </p><h2>  Changes in weapons and uniforms </h2><p>  Uniforms and weapons have also undergone changes.  Now the Russian soldier is fully consistent with the image of the European military.  In addition to the main weapon - guns, infantrymen had bayonets, swords and grenades.  The material for the mold was of the best quality.  Great importance was attached to her tailoring.  From this time until the end of the 19th century, significant changes in the Russian army did not occur.  Except for the formation of elite regiments - grenadiers, huntsmen, etc. </p>

    <h2>  Infantry in the War of 1812 </h2><p>  In view of the upcoming events (Napoleon Bonaparte‚Äôs attacks on Russia), which became clear from intelligence reports, the new Minister of War, Barclay de Tolly, recently appointed to this post, considered it necessary to make massive transformations in the Russian army.  This was especially true for infantry regiments.  In history, this process is known as the military reforms of 1810. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The infantry of the Russian Empire at that time was in poor condition.  And not because there was a lack of personnel.  The problem was organization.  It was to this moment that the attention of the new Minister of War was devoted. </p><h2>  Army Training 1812 </h2><p>  Preparatory work for the war with France was presented in a memorandum with the title ‚ÄúOn the Defense of the Western Limits of Russia‚Äù.  It was approved by Alexander 1 in 1810.  All the ideas presented in this document began to be translated into reality. </p><p>  The central control system of the army was also reorganized.  The basis of the new organization lay two points: </p><ol><li>  The establishment of the Ministry of War. </li><li>  The establishment of the management of a large army. </li></ol><p>  The Russian army of 1812, its condition and readiness for military operations were the result of 2 years of work. </p><h2>  The structure of the infantry of 1812 </h2><p>  Infantry made up the bulk of the army, it included: </p><ol><li>  Garrison parts. </li><li>  Light infantry. </li><li>  Heavy infantry (grenadiers). </li></ol><p>  As for the garrison component, it was nothing more than a reserve of the land unit and was responsible for the timely replenishment of the ranks.  The structure also included marines, although the command of these units was carried out by the Ministry <span>of the Navy.</span> </p><p>  The replenishment of the Lithuanian and Finnish regiments organized a life guard.  Otherwise, it was called the elite infantry. </p><p>  The composition of the heavy infantry: </p><ul><li>  4 guards regiments; </li><li>  14 regiments of grenadiers; </li><li>  96 regiments of foot troops; </li><li>  4 regiment of the marine corps; </li><li>  1 battalion of the Caspian fleet. </li></ul><p>  Light infantry: </p><ul><li>  2 guards regiments; </li><li>  50 regiments of huntsmen; </li><li>  1 naval crew; </li></ul><p>  Garrison troops: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  1 garrison battalion of the Life Guard; </li><li>  12 garrison regiments; </li><li>  20 garrison battalions; </li><li>  20 battalions of internal guard. </li></ul><p>  In addition to the above, the Russian army included cavalry, artillery, Cossack regiments.  In every part of the country, militia groups recruited. </p>

    <h2>  Military Regulations of 1811 </h2><p>  A year before the outbreak of hostilities, a document appeared reflecting the correct actions of officers and soldiers in preparation for and during a battle.  The name of this paper is the military charter on infantry service.  The following points were prescribed in it: </p><ul><li>  features of training officers; </li><li>  soldier training; </li><li>  the location of each combat unit; </li><li>  recruiting set; </li><li>  rules of conduct for soldiers and officers; </li><li>  rules of construction, march, return of honor, etc .; </li><li>  firing; </li><li>  hand-to-hand combat techniques. </li></ul><p>  As well as many other components of the army service.  The infantry of the Russian Empire became not only a defense, but also the face of the state. </p><h2>  War of 1812 </h2><p>  The Russian army of 1812 amounted to 622 thousand people.  However, only a third of the entire army was withdrawn to the western border.  The reason for this was the disbandment of individual parts.  The southern Russian army was still in Wallachia and Moldova, since the war with Turkey had just ended, and it was necessary to exercise control of the territory. </p><p>  The Finnish corps, under the command of Steingel, was about 15 thousand people, but its location was in Sveaborg, as it was intended to become an amphibious group, which will land on the Baltic coast.  Thus, the command planned to break the rear of Napoleon. </p>

    <p>  Most of the troops were deployed in garrisons in various parts of the country.  A large number of soldiers were located in Georgia and other regions of the Caucasus.  This was due to the conduct of the war with the Persians, which ended only in 1813.  A considerable number of troops were concentrated along the fortresses of the Urals and Siberia, thereby ensuring the safety of the borders of the Russian Empire.  The same applies to Cossack regiments, concentrated in the Urals, in Siberia and Kyrgyzstan. </p><p>  In general, the Russian military was ready for the French attack.  This concerned the quantity, and uniforms, and weapons.  But for the reasons listed above, by the time the invaders invaded, only a third of them went to repulse the attack. </p><h2>  Armament and uniform of 1812 </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the command adhered to the use of rifles of the same caliber by the troops (17.78 mm), in reality, more than 20 different caliber rifles were in service.  The greatest preference was given to a 1808 model rifle with a trihedral bayonet.  The advantage of the weapon was a smooth barrel, well-coordinated impact mechanism and a convenient butt. </p><p>  Melee infantry weapons are sabers and broadswords.  Many officers had <span>award weapons.</span>  As a rule, it was a melee weapon, the hilt of which consisted of gold or silver.  The most common type was the saber engraved For Courage. </p><p>  As for the armor, it almost got out of infantry uniforms.  Only at the cavalry could one meet a kind of armor - armor.  For example, cuirasses that were designed to protect the torso of a cuirassier.  Such armor was able to withstand the blow of edged weapons, but not a bullet of a firearm. </p><p>  The uniforms of the Russian soldiers and officers were uniforms, finely stitched and fitted to the master of the vestments.  The main task of this form was to provide its owner with freedom of movement, while not at all constraining him.  Unfortunately, this could not be said of the parade uniforms, which cause serious inconvenience to officers and generals at dinner parties. </p><h2>  Elite regiments - huntsmen </h2><p>  Watching how special military formations of the Prussians, called "huntsmen", allow the enemy to achieve their goals, one of the Russian commanders decided to form a similar unit in the Russian army.  Initially, only 500 people with experience in hunting were candidates.  Jaeger regiments of the Russian Empire are partisans of the late 18th century.  They were recruited exclusively from the best warriors who served in the musketeer and <span>grenadier regiments.</span> </p>

    <p>  The uniform of the rangers was simple and did not differ in the bright colors of the uniform.  Dark colors prevailed, allowing to merge with the environment (bushes, stones, etc.). </p><p>  The armament of huntsmen is the best weapon that could only be in the ranks of the Russian army.  Instead of sabers, they wore bayonets.  And the bags were intended only for gunpowder, pomegranates and provisions, which could last for three days. </p><p>  Despite the fact that <span>jaeger regiments</span> played a key role in many battles and were an indispensable support for light infantry and cavalry, they were disbanded in 1834. </p><h2>  Grenadiers </h2><p>  The name of the military formation came from the word "granada", ie  "grenade".  In fact, it was the infantry, armed not only with guns, but also with a large number of grenades, which were used to storm fortresses and other strategically important objects.  Because  Since the standard Granada weighed a lot, in order to get to the target, it was necessary to get closer to it.  Only warriors with courage and great experience were capable of this. </p><p>  Russian grenadiers were recruited exclusively from the best ordinary infantry soldiers.  The main task of this kind of troops is to undermine the enemy‚Äôs fortified positions.  Naturally, the grenadier had to differ by a dozen physical strength in order to carry a large number of grenades in the bag.  Initially (under Peter 1) the first representatives of this kind of troops were formed in separate units.  Closer to 1812 divisions from the grenadiers were already being created.  This type of troops lasted until the October Revolution. </p><h2>  The involvement of Russia in the First World War </h2><p>  The prevailing economic rivalry between England and Germany caused the clash of more than 30 powers.  The Russian Empire in the First World War had its place.  Being the owner of a powerful army, she became the guardian of the interests of the Entente.  Like other powers, Russia had its own views and relied on land and resources that could be appropriated by intervening in world battles. </p>

    <h2>  Russian Army in the First World War </h2><p>  Despite the lack of aviation and armored vehicles, the Russian Empire in the First World War did not need soldiers, since their number exceeded 1 million people.  Enough of guns and ammunition.  The main problem was with shells.  In history, this phenomenon is known as the "shell crisis."  After five months of warfare, the warehouses of the Russian army were empty, which led to the need to buy shells from the Allies. </p><p>  The uniform of the soldiers consisted of a cloth shirt, trousers and a cap of a dark green protective color.  Boots and a belt were also irreplaceable soldier's attributes.  In winter, an overcoat and a hat were issued.  During the war years, the infantry of the Russian Empire did not suffer changes in uniform.  Unless the cloth was changed to moleskin - a new material. </p>

    <p>  In service were Mosin rifles (or a three-ruler), as well as bayonets.  In addition, soldiers were given <span>sapper shovels,</span> pouches and sets for cleaning rifles. </p><h2>  Mosin rifle </h2><p>  Also known as trilinear.  Why is it so called - the issue is still relevant today.  It is known that the Mosin rifle is a weapon that has been in demand since 1881.  It was used even during the Second World War, as it combined three main characteristics - ease of operation, accuracy and range. </p><p>  Trilinear why so called?  The fact is that before the caliber was calculated based on the length.  Special lines were used.  At that time, one line was 2.54 mm.  The Mosin rifle cartridge was 7.62 mm, which fit under 3 lines. </p>
