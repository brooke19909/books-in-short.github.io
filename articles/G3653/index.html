    <h2>  Djerba, Midoun </h2><p>  The island on which Djerba Holiday Beach (Tunisia) is located is the warmest resort in the country.  It is always several degrees hotter here.  Therefore, the season on it lasts a little longer.  The island is famous for its excellent beaches with fine and white sand, like flour, as well as good quality hotels.  French tourists love these places, and domestic travelers say: on Djerba it is immediately clear that Tunisia was a European colony.  Midoun is the second most important tourist area on the island after Houmt Souk.  Like any similar resort, it is famous for its beautiful hotels, promenade, water activities, bars, nightclubs - in a word, well-developed infrastructure.  True, the city by whose name it was named represents a sharp contrast with the coastal areas, and here you can really see the real oriental flavor of Tunisia.  Travelers are advised to visit not only local mosques and markets, but the Lal Khadriya historical museum, and the animalia crocodile farm. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Djerba Holiday Beach 4" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1556909.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Rest and treatment at sea </h2><p>  The hotel has its own beach.  Go there for about three minutes around the hotel, and then through a small road where almost no one drives.  Umbrellas, sun loungers, sun loungers and other accessories of sea recreation can be used for free.  The entrance to the water is very gentle.  If you want depth, you need to swim away.  On the beach there is a nice fine sand of white color.  He does not repent even in the heat.  Here you can not only indulge in relaxation and "seal" rest, but also engage in water sports, in particular, ride a sea scooter.  Sometimes algae takes to the beach, but they are immediately removed.  But mostly the water is clear.  Beach towels are issued on bail - ten dinars.  At the same time, tourists receive two receipts, blue and white.  The first must be kept until the end of the vacation, because without it they do not return the deposit.  And on a white receipt, towels are being changed.  On the shore there is a bar that distributes free Internet, which, according to tourists, works better than on the territory of the hotel.  In the LTI Djerba Holiday Beach hotel itself there are three swimming pools - a large one, in the air, for adults, a children's paddling pool and an indoor spa.  There, by the way, you can take a course of the famous Tunisian thalassotherapy.  Tourists leave very good reviews about spa specialists.  The main artificial pond is very beautiful, surrounded by palm trees.  Around him there are many sun loungers, and in the case of waves on the sea or other bad weather, he will always help out tourists who like to swim. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LTI Djerba Holiday Beach" class="if" height="323" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1556892.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Excursions and trips </h2><p>  But not only for the sake of swimming, sunbathing and body wraps come true travelers to Tunisia.  <span>Djerba (Djerba</span> Holiday Beach in particular) is a great place to go on various trips.  First of all, you need to inspect the island itself.  Visit the capital of Houmt Souk, the medieval fortress of Bordj el Kebir.  In the city of Gellal there is a popular museum of local lore, where you can learn all about the life of the inhabitants of the island.  There are many pink flamingos on the local lakes that are not at all afraid of people.  And from here it is very convenient to travel to the Sahara, especially to the famous area of ‚Äã‚ÄãTatauin, where they shot a sandy planet from Star Wars.  If you shop, you will see how big a difference there is between the local population and the Egyptians.  Tunisians are polite people, no one will pull you by the arms and urge you to buy their goods at all costs. </p><h2>  Reviews about the rest in the hotel Djerba Holiday Beach 4 * (Djerba) </h2><p>  Vacationers call the hotel a great place to spend a vacation in an exotic country.  Many write that they would come to this hotel again, because it is worth the money.  In the current difficult situation, when you have to choose between Sochi and Tunisia, it is better, of course, to go to Djerba to get higher-class services.  The hotel has excellent and varied food, friendly and friendly staff.  Many understand in English, and even in Russian.  The location of the hotel is excellent, and thalassotherapy, which tourists experienced in the spa, really helped many.  Most of the rest here are Europeans, mainly French pensioners or families with children. </p>
