But the price and reliability of the device attract the attention of buyers.  In addition, the Samsung G350E Galaxy Advance received the marking of the famous brand. </p>

    <h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  The bundle of the smartphone is very meager.  Here you will not see expensive headphones and additional protective films, this is the entire budget "Samsung G350E".  The characteristics of the phone correspond to the quality of the provided charger and headphones.  The manufacturer clearly saved on all of this.  It makes no sense to linger on the configuration, so go to the next section. </p><h2>  Smartphone design </h2><p>  The appearance of the Samsung G350E Galaxy Star Advance does not stand out for anything remarkable.  A fairly normal type of body with rounded edges.  The material of which it is made is plastic.  Present in the market in two colors: white and black. </p>

    <p>  Around the case is a frame mounted slightly protruding above the surface.  This does not interfere with using a smartphone, but rather, on the contrary, it does not allow objects to accidentally come into contact with the display.  In addition, the frame gives the phone expressiveness. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Above the display is a speaker, and a little lower - brand marking.  <span>There</span> are no <span>proximity</span> or light <span>sensors</span> .  Phone "Samsung G350E" received only an accelerometer. </p><p>  In order to avoid accidental clicks during a conversation, the developers came up with an unusual way.  When you answer the call, the display turns off and locks.  In order to end the call, you will have to press the unlock button, then tap on the lock on the screen and only after all these manipulations end the conversation.  Not very comfortable, right?  Samsung can both surprise and disappoint. </p><p>  The lower part of the front side is occupied by control buttons.  "Home" is made in the form of a mechanical key.  "Recently closed applications" and "Back" are touch-sensitive.  They do not have a backlight, so you have to get used to their location so that you do not poke the entire display in the dark. </p>

The display is made using TFT technology, so you should not expect a juicy picture.  At a right angle, everything is pretty good, but with a slight displacement, the picture fades. </p>

    <p>  Due to the cheap matrix, the Samsung G350E display glare.  Colors sometimes change color.  In the sun, expected to fade.  It‚Äôs not easy to see something on the screen.  Partially, the situation is saved by the maximum backlight level, but this is sometimes not enough. </p><h2>  "Samsung G350E": specifications and functionality </h2><p>  As mentioned in the introduction, you should not expect fast work and the latest features from this model.  Main characteristics: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  Cortex-A7 processor clocked at 1.2 GHz; </li><li>  Mali-400 MP serves as a video chip; </li><li>  512 MB of RAM (only about 188 MB available); </li><li>  4 GB of internal memory; </li><li>  installation of memory cards up to 32 GB; </li><li>  no GPS; </li><li>  3 megapixel camera; </li><li>  Android 4.4. </li></ul><p>  Now let's go through the characteristics in more detail. </p><p>  Since this is a budget model, there is no NFC chip.  But it‚Äôs not so scary.  The developer did not install a 3G module and a GPS receiver in the device, and this can already be called a significant minus.  Even cheaper devices today have 3G support.  Buying the Samsung G350E, the characteristics of which are not perfect anyway, the user voluntarily leaves for the 2000s.  Wi-Fi is capable of rectifying this position.  Perhaps for some users surfing the Internet and EDGE will be enough. </p><p>  The smartphone received Android 4.4, which has already managed to become obsolete.  Often you can notice the hang.  The flipping animation twitches almost everywhere.  Launching programs does not happen right away - the user will have to wait until the smartphone ‚Äúthinks through‚Äù everything.  This model is not recommended for those who are already familiar with flagship devices.  For exploring the possibilities of Android is suitable. </p><h2>  Games </h2><p>  It does not shine with the performance of the Samsung G350E.  Simple toys will go, but counting on comfortable fps in more demanding ones is not worth it.  3D games run, albeit with a low frame rate (10-15).  You understand, <span>this is a mockery</span> of the apparatus and your own psyche.  You can shorten the time on the trip, but fun in the latest releases will not work. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  There is only one camera in the device.  Resolution - 2048 x 1536 pixels, which is 3 megapixels.  The main disadvantage is that there is no autofocus.  There is no point in photographing any documents - it‚Äôs unlikely that you will disassemble something.  The camera in the Samsung G359E can be called a pleasant addition, rather than a full-fledged subject for shooting. </p><p>  With optimal lighting, you can take pictures.  Pictures of surrounding objects are tolerable, even discreetly color changes.  In the camera settings you can find quite useful functions: panoramas, filters, night shots and so on. </p><p>  A smartphone can also shoot videos.  It turns out in a resolution of 640 x 480 pixels.  In general, the videos are pretty good, considering the budget of the device. </p><h2>  Duos Features </h2><p>  As already mentioned, Samsung G350E got the ability to install two SIM-cards.  In the settings of the smartphone there is an item that allows you to manage them.  Here you can configure ringtones for each of them, as well as set priorities. </p><p>  The device has only one radio module.  It follows that when talking through one of the SIM cards, the other does not work.  Again, this is due to the low price of the model. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The device‚Äôs battery is removable and has a capacity of 1800 mAh.  This result is similar to many similar devices.  The manufacturer indicates that this is enough to listen to music for 32 hours or surf for 9 hours (via Wi-Fi). </p><p>  In fact, a smartphone with minimal use lasts for 3 days.  You will actively drive the device - the day will not work.  Autonomy is similar to that of more expensive devices.  But do not forget that they have more demanding hardware and high-quality displays, and the G350E can not boast of this. </p><h2>  Multimedia features </h2><p>  The speakers on the mobile phone are loud.  You can hear the call at a great distance.  The sound through the headphones is at a good level.  Not inferior even to flagship models.  Therefore, as a player, the smartphone is not bad.  The device easily copes with many formats of video and audio.  True, in order to run some of them, you will have to download a third-party application. </p><p>  The G350E FM radio also supports.  However, for it to work, a headset is required.  Standard functionality allows you to search and sort frequencies for yourself. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  In general, Samsung Galaxy Star G350E acts as a cheap smartphone for novice users.  And so it is.  For beginners studying the features of the installed operating system, it is unlikely at first to need high-speed Internet and powerful hardware.  To begin with, they should get used to such devices and understand whether they need them. </p><p>  There is no other way to explain the lack of such an important function today as 3G.  Why did the company decide to save on the module, which is present today even in the cheapest phones?  According to user reviews, it is the lack of a <span>G350E 3G that</span> becomes the main reason for refusing to purchase a model. </p><p>  Another disadvantage is the low speed.  The smartphone is already very thoughtful by today's standards.  Not impressive and autonomy, which should be higher. </p><p>  You can buy a model for an amount not exceeding 6000 rubles.  And still, this is too much for an apparatus with similar technical features and meager functionality.  On the shelves of shops you can find cheaper devices with better characteristics.  However, it is worth remembering that part of the amount the buyer pays for the brand, which promises reliability and quality.  Is it worth it to overpay - you decide. </p>
