  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The smallest surveillance camera. Wireless cctv camera</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, the need for video shooting is experienced by many people.  These are travelers, and special services, and private detectives, etc. </p><p>  Often, professional equipment cannot be put in a backpack.  It is quite massive, and also vulnerable and susceptible to water.  And today, small cameras are the best solution.  They do not have identified shortcomings, and they are excellent helpers in everyday life. </p><h2>  Motives for shooting </h2><p>  The desire to capture what is happening indoors or in a certain territory unnoticed can have several motives: </p><ol><li>  Observation of the object on the instructions of the police or special services. </li><li>  Territory control. </li><li>  Obtaining certain evidence. </li><li>  Just amateur photography for fun. </li></ol><p>  The smallest wireless camera allows you to get a clear picture.  This consumes a minimum of electricity.  Data is transmitted universally by special protocols. </p><p>  If you need to arrange video surveillance without changes in the interior and in the communication lines, the smallest camera will effectively help you with this. </p><h2>  The main principles for evaluating such optics </h2><p>  There are many devices for covert surveillance.  The main criteria for their assessment are not their parameters and characteristics. </p><p>  For example, there are video eyes.  They resemble spy appliances.  These are the devices that any resident can mount in his door, so he can monitor the area near the front door. </p><p>  If for any purpose a hidden mini video camera is required, then its installation is carried out strictly according to the instructions attached to it or it is worth inviting a specialist for this work. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Parameter and matrix format </h2><p>  Today, the smallest camera is usually based on a CCD matrix, it is a semiconductor sensor and its choice is logical. </p><p>  The matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãcharacterized by small parameters.  Here, progressive scanning is used, and even if there are few active pixels, the picture is in good quality. </p><p>  The sensor parameters depend not only on the type of installation of the camera, but also on its functionality.  So, if the camera has a good capacious battery, it has a rather large case, a massive matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãeasily placed in it. </p><h2>  About optics </h2><p>  Wireless surveillance cameras have the main specificity - a very modest eye clearance.  By area, it can reach a fraction of a millimeter.  Such optics can be classified as spy devices. </p><p>  The covert surveillance device operates according to the following principle: </p><div class="photo" data-original="securisat.co.za" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The principle of operation of a CCTV camera" class="if uuid-2865809" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100377/2865809.jpg"></div><p>  The technology of light transmission to the sensor can be located differently.  Devices, whose optics are concentrated directly on the case, are widely used. </p><p>  Other devices have a remote lens.  In this situation, the light is first converted, and then follows the photosensitive component.  The feed path is fiber optic cable.  The length of the path can be significant.  For example, it is necessary to mount the equipment behind the wall of the room where the observation will be carried out. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  About processor </h2><p>  Spy surveillance cameras have processors that perform the following functions: </p><ol><li>  Touch signal processing. </li><li>  Video stream generation for transmission. </li><li>  Maintenance of applicable translation protocols. </li></ol><p>  Wireless surveillance cameras with recording option fall into the category of exceptions.  Their processor can work with a variety of video formats on media. </p><p>  All the indicated tasks can be performed without problems by microcircuits, whose architecture is referred to as ARM.  They have a thorough study, economical energy consumption and heat generation. </p><p>  All processing methods, working with protocols and formats are the basic options of many modern microcircuits. </p><h2>  Recording and data transfer option </h2><p>  Camera manufacturers consider recording and broadcasting data the most energy-intensive task for themselves.  The miniature parameters of the cameras do not allow you to arrange a battery with high power.  In this regard, two methods are used for storing and transmitting data: </p><ol><li>  Writing to flash memory, which has a modest energy intensity.  In spyware, its scope is severely limited. </li><li>  Wireless dosed signal transmission.  It occurs after a designated period of time.  Often there is a partial range of functions.  For example, a camera can only provide photos taken at different time intervals.  Some models form a video with a modest number of frames per second. </li></ol><p>  They rarely put memory cards in such devices.  The reason is writing to them and maintaining them involves high energy costs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Hidden Wi-Fi devices </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.dhgate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wifi spy surveillance camera" class="if uuid-2865801" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100377/2865801.jpg"></div><p>  Wi-Fi technology consumes a lot of energy.  And even the smallest camera with such a system can start according to a schedule or a signal from a motion sensor.  Expensive spyware modifications have their own means of fixing objects on the work site. </p><p>  Spy surveillance cameras that perform remote video monitoring can work on android.  Connection to the broadcast occurs at any time from anywhere in the world.  For this, the device must have the following options: </p><ol><li>  Your transmitter. </li><li>  Connection to a router. </li><li>  Constant communication with the cloud. </li><li>  Acting as a motion sensor. </li><li>  Record a stream to a computer or to cloud storage. </li></ol><p>  Wi-Fi camera is convenient if powered by an external source. </p><h2>  Standalone Hidden Devices </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.takealot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Standalone Hidden CCTV Cameras" class="if uuid-2865806" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100377/2865806.jpg"></div><p>  They are very popular, equipped with their battery and energy-independent memory.  They also implement a wireless video stream. </p><p>  Although there are some limitations.  For example, in spyware with a wireless action and recording option, it is often not possible to view recorded material.  But it can be recorded again when connected to the device wirelessly (protocol).  This consumes very little energy. </p><h2>  Disguise as objects </h2><p>  The smallest camera can be disguised in a figurine, jewelry and other decor items.  This is a great method for video surveillance.  True, it is prohibited by law. </p><p>  For example, you can integrate the camera into a watch. </p><div class="photo" data-original="shopping.rediff.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Spy surveillance camera in watch" class="if uuid-2865802" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100377/2865802.jpg"></div><p>  If the item is large, it can be arranged in it: </p><ol><li>  Battery.  He will power the camera for a very long time. </li><li>  Fixture for data content. </li><li>  Devices for wireless transmissions. </li><li>  Antennas that stabilize the signal. </li><li>  SIM cards, memory cards, etc. </li></ol><p>  Inside the item, you can create protection against moisture and mechanical influence.  In this case, the camera can be found with difficulty. </p><h2>  About installation </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.vueville.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mounting a spy surveillance camera" class="if uuid-2865814" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100377/2865814.jpg"></div><p>  The installation of the camera is determined by its design and parameters.  Before purchasing the device, study the appropriate corners of whether it is possible to conduct external power supply there.  It is also important how the signal will pass, and what kind of illumination it will turn out. </p><p>  The main aspect - the camera should be inconspicuous and maximize its potential. </p><h2>  The question of legality </h2><p>  This is a rather sensitive issue.  In Russia, such hidden devices are devices of special action.  They can be bought with the permission of special authorities. </p><p>  Their use without a license can be allowed by police, the FSB and other similar structures.  Moreover, they should be issued appropriate sanctions. </p><p>  Ordinary citizens need to know that under the ban are: </p><ol><li>  Devices with an optical Pin Hole mechanism and an eye, whose diameter is less than 5 mm. </li><li>  Wireless appliances disguised as household items (books, figurines, etc.). </li><li>  Devices embedded in household appliances (lamps, alarm sensors, clocks, telephones, etc.). </li><li>  The camera backlight setting is less than 0.01 lux. </li></ol><p>  The use of such equipment by citizens without the approval of the authorities and the availability of regulatory documents may cost them their freedom.  There are cases when people fell for this for real terms of 2-3 years. </p><h2>  About the most popular models </h2><p>  Today the assortment of the smallest cameras is decent.  If you have settled the issues with the legality of their application, you can purchase such a product.  But how to choose the most suitable?  Much depends on your goals, conditions and duration of the recording. </p><p>  The following are some of the most popular models, these are: </p><ol><li>  Polaroid Cube. </li><li>  Polaroid Cube + </li><li>  GoPro Hero 4 Session </li></ol><h2>  Polaroid cube </h2><p>  This is one of the smallest action cameras in the world.  It is arranged in a cubic case.  His rib is 3.5 cm. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitalcamerareview.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Polaroid cube" class="if uuid-2865789" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100377/2865789.jpg"></div><p>  Camera Data: </p><ol><li>  Weight - 45 g. </li><li>  Fixed focal length. </li><li>  The viewing angle is 124 degrees. </li><li>  Photo - 6 megapixels. </li><li>  There is a video option with the parameters of 1920 x 1080. </li><li>  The presence of a microphone.
