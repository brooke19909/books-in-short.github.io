Primorsky Prospekt and Primorskoye Shosse are adjacent to the park from the north, and in the east it borders Yacht Street.

In its central part there is a fountain with a swimming pool and a 22-meter granite lighthouse, to which a paved central alley leads.  The granite embankment of the park is a continuation of other Neva embankments, teeming with descending steps of the amphitheater and viewing platforms.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe youngest Petersburg park is about 91 hectares. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Green Jewels </h2><p>  The 300th anniversary park is symbolically decorated with 300 pieces each: </p><p>  - <span>valuable tree species</span> (granted by public and educational institutions); </p><p>  - decorative apple trees (donated by Finland); </p><p>  - a variety of trees and shrubs (presented as a gift by honored guests and builders of the park, representatives of twin cities and heads of constituent entities of the Russian Federation). </p><p>  In addition, the German savings park presented 70 linden trees.  Growing green spaces, gaining beauty and strength, will contribute to the development of good neighborly relations and improve the environmental situation of this charismatic city.  But most importantly, more and more growing, young seedlings form a holistic perception of this still young coastal-park ensemble. </p><h2>  Russia Day in the park of the 300th anniversary </h2><p>  Large-scale celebrations take place during Russia Day, celebrated annually on June 12.  The 300th anniversary park offers a diverse musical and special military sports program, in which anyone can take part, from a child to an adult.  Such events are designed to contribute to the revival of patriotic feelings and national pride, raising young citizens of Russia to recognize themselves as an integral part of a great state. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Beach pleasures </h2><p>  A rather well-groomed sandy beach with incredibly clean fine-grained sand and a picturesque bay is located in the central part of the 300th anniversary park (St. Petersburg).  The park greets visitors with the heady sea air and relaxing atmosphere, thanks to which Petersburgers have already christened it local Miami.  Sunny days are an excellent occasion for friendly companies to sunbathe on the coast of the Gulf of Finland, play beach volleyball, as well as ride rental bikes or segways. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  "Fly in the ointment" in a beach vacation </h2><p>  Bathing in the cold and muddy waters of the Neva, which flows into the Gulf of Finland, is officially prohibited.  Often on water surface oil-oil stains are clearly visible, most likely due to the rather rapid movement of all kinds of ships and barges.  However, in sunny and sultry weather, all prohibitive measures are not effective: people, languishing from the heat, frolic and flounder, in spite of any warnings and threats. </p>

Photos can turn out to be funny and lyrical, lovingly mysterious and a little sad, often being a reflection not only of the surrounding atmosphere, but also of some kind of ‚Äúinner surroundings‚Äù.

    <h2>  You can believe in happiness so easily </h2><p>  In March 2012, a three-meter statue of Francisco da Miranda appeared in the park, donated by <span>Hugo Chavez</span> to the birthday of a Venezuelan national hero fighting for the liberation of the Spanish colonies.  At the end of the wedding ceremony, the newlyweds make a pilgrimage to this monument, located not far from the registry office (Staroderevenskaya St.).  Not only the newlyweds, but also their many guests, with particular enthusiasm and zeal, try to rub the boot of the famous Spaniard's left foot, which promises them a cloudless family life in the future. </p><p>  The attraction of the sculptural Francisco lies in its fresh novelty that distinguishes it from many similar talismans in St. Petersburg.  Other monuments have partially lost the power of their magic, giving happiness to many dreamers who passionately believe in miracles. </p><h2>  Abundance of leisure opportunities in the water park </h2><p>  Another water attraction and a place for enchanting relaxation is the Piterland water park, which undoubtedly adorns both the 300th anniversary park and the Russian metropolis.  This place is crowned by the highest dome in the world, incomparable with its kind, the height of which is about 45 meters.  This fact is consistent with the ambitious plans of its founders who want to capture the water park in the Guinness Book of Records.  Thanks to the ultraviolet film covering the dome, lovers of sunbathing can sunbathe throughout the year.  And in winter, you can realize the most indefatigable fantasies about a sunny beach, feasible in the local water park. </p>

Sand sculptures fascinate with the feeling of their amazing immutability, recreating waking dreams of childhood about the magic castles of ancient Egypt, fairy-tale and outlandish animals, epic and cinematic characters, as well as the visual embodiment of other exciting stories.  A special secret to the preservation of amazing works from such a fragile material is the use of special sand, coated on top with PVA glue.  Petersburgers and visitors to the city with euphoric enthusiasm look at and discuss the stunning Disney Castle.  Its seven-meter height and two-meter walls with tower buildings on an area of ‚Äã‚Äãover 2000 m2 can impress even the most sophisticated viewer.

    <h2>  Pillow Fights </h2><p>  At the end of August (the 30th) of this year, a very fun summer battle is planned ... with pillows.  All comers will be able to throw each other with these sleeping accessories, divided into two opposing teams.  The only criterion for getting into a particular company will be the date of birth: even (for the White team) and odd (for the Black team).  The event threatens to turn into a fluffy-feather snowstorm, under which hides almost the entire park of the 300th anniversary (St. Petersburg).  The park, in general, is trying to fulfill children's dreams.  For example, in June, young builders enthusiastically erected a cardboard city, building their own houses with unusual design ideas in their favorite color scheme. </p><h2>  300th anniversary park in winter </h2><p>  In winter, grandiose events are regularly held that can make sparkling frosty air warm from sincere smiles and extremely frisky entertainments.  During the traditional festivities on Maslenitsa you can ride a wooden sleigh, personally participate in quite serious fist fights and other events that the 300th anniversary park offers its visitors.
