Yekaterinburg, near which this amazing object is located, is not the only one in the world that can boast of this.  Lviv, Novosibirsk, Kozelsk, Elabuga - cities that have their own Devil's hillfort.  Therefore, when it comes to any of these objects, due to their large number, the city near which they are located is indicated in brackets.  But everywhere these places are notorious among local old-timers.  Therefore, the name can be interpreted in different ways - whether the devil knows what is fenced, or whether this is the residence of the “unclean” - Devil's hillfort.  Yekaterinburg has such an object, surrounded by legends and mysticism, which is very proud of.

    <h2>  Abnormal places </h2><p>  In addition, it has long been noticed that rare species of plants grow in such places.  Therefore, now the ridge of remnant towers and the mountain of the same name, the crest of which they are, has become a botanical, archaeological and geomorphological (relief science) and hydrological natural monument.  Hydrological because there are many small tributaries <span>of the Iset River</span> in this territory <span>,</span> the largest of them - Semipalatinka - washes the base of Mount Devil's Hillfort on one side.  Yekaterinburg is completely dependent on the Iset River - this is its main waterway. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Volcanic origin </h2>

    <p>  The mountain itself has a height of 349 meters above sea level, its crest crowning, stretching along the battlement in the north-west direction, reaches 18-20 meters in the center.  Of course, <span>this ridge</span> is a miracle of nature, which does not yet have a clear logical explanation of its formation.  As a rule, remnant cliffs (frozen magma that has come up to the top, freed from the soil cover) always have a bizarre and mysterious form, there are a lot of them in different parts of Russia - Pillars near Krasnoyarsk, picturesque cliffs of the Seven Brothers in the Middle Urals, crowning Semibratskaya Mountain (422 m ) other. </p><h2>  The similarity of the Ural objects </h2><p>  In general, the mountain of the same name, with the rocky crest of the Seven Brothers crowning its peak, is very similar to the Devil's Hillfort.  Yekaterinburg, like the village of Verkh-Nevinsky, owes its popularity among climbers all over the world to them.  The similarity of these remnants consists not only in the same name as the mountains and the crest, they have the same structure (mattress-like) - the rocks of which they consist, are cut into slabs and resemble masonry.  And the breed itself is the same - granite.  They have in common that both sights are of volcanic origin, they are about 300 million years old. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2>

Every citizen knows how to get to this place by car - first you need to get to the Iset station via the Tagil highway (the place is noteworthy because there is a border separating Europe from Asia), from there a good <span>road</span> leads to the Devil's Hillfort <span>,</span> which is in good condition .  The cordon at the foot of the mountain serves as a guideline for the end of the road - only further on foot (5 km).

    <h2>  Other advantages of these places </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the hillfort is being destroyed (especially the southern part), the slope of the mountain at the rocky foot is completely covered with stone fragments.  But this sad fact added to the uniqueness of the Ural sights - the mountainside looks very beautiful. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="damn city of yekaterinburg how to get there by car" class="if" height="435" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/465073.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Devil's hillfort (Yekaterinburg) has the most positive reviews - this is really a peculiar and beautiful place.  The nearby <span>Rock of Peter Gronsky</span> (Petrogrom) and Lake Isetskoye add charms to it, which in themselves are unique sights.  A pond with clear clear water, spread among boulders and giving rise to the Iset River, which flows from its southern end, is covered in the eastern part with small picturesque islands.  From this group stands out the island of Red, consisting of granite.  In the middle of <span>Iset Lake</span> is <span>Solovetsky Island,</span> and the shores of the lake are covered with ancient man’s sites discovered by archaeologists at different times.  Mount Petrogrom is one of the many granite tents that spread across the Urals.  It is a rock-outlier, like the Devil's Hillfort itself.  Sverdlovsk region is literally strewn with them, which makes it especially popular among climbers. </p><h2>  The tract near Kozelsk </h2><p>  The author of one article noted that such a name is very popular, and so named objects are found in almost every area - both natural and man-made. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="damned city of yekaterinburg reviews" class="if" height="353" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/465074.jpg" width="470"></div>

    <p>  Particularly noteworthy is the tract (a place that stands out from the environment) on the banks of the Chertovskaya river, not far from the city of Kozelsk, also called the Devil's hillfort.  Kaluga region has a number of attractions of federal significance, and the above object is one of them.  In this subject of the federation are aqueducts and waterfalls, rotundas and shrines.  There are parks "Sparrows" and "Ugra", Optina deserts.  The devil's hillfort, one of the favorite objects of ufologists, also, like all of the above objects, belongs to the Kaluga region.  It is a hill covered with sandstone cliffs (remnants) and boulders that come to the surface.  Mysteriousness is given to this place by cup-stones, investigators and crosses, which have long been associated with unclean legends by legends.  As well as near other settlements, relic plants grow here.  The fern and luminous moss of Schistosteg add mystery to this place.  The legend connects the ancient settlement with Kudeyar the robber, known for his bloodthirstiness.  In addition, the Devil's Hillfort, located on the territory of the Ugra National Park, is listed in the catalog of mysterious places on Earth, like the famous anomaly near Kozelsk, where people often disappear and unexplained things happen. </p><h2>  Man-made hillfort </h2><p>  In addition to the natural rock-outcrops of an unusual mysterious form, there are man-made objects known by this name - Devil's Hillfort.  Elabuga boasts just such a landmark.  This is the name of the stone tower, 7.1 meters high, a monument of Bulgarian culture dating back to the end of the first millennium AD.  These are the remains of a mosque-fortress, erected by the princes of the Volga or Silver Bulgaria - a historical state that existed in the X-XIII centuries in the middle Volga region, in the <span>Kama river</span> basin <span>.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="damn settlement Sverdlovsk region" class="if" height="373" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/465079.jpg" width="508"></div>  The only cylindrical tower that has survived since that time collapsed in 1844.  Only a small piece of the north wall remains, which still exists.  Through the efforts of the head of the Elabuga I.V. Shishkin, the tower was restored in 1867 and is covered with a low iron roof.  A new reconstruction, given the popularity of this place, was carried out in 2007.  To the restored tower, a log entrance gate was added, giving the corresponding flavor.  Paths are laid, the slopes of a high hill are dotted with benches, because it offers an amazing panorama.  The tower itself is covered in legends and is a monument under the care of UNESCO.  In addition, she is a symbol of Elabuga.
