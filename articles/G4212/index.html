It is not for nothing that residents of Ukraine and neighboring countries come here.  There is an airport, but inactive.  How to get to Berdyansk?  The reviews say that it’s better to get here by train, because the planes fly only to Donetsk and Zaporozhye, and from there you have to go by bus, which in the heat can be quite difficult.  Summer is dry, rains are rare, and the air is very suitable for people who have problems with the lungs or bronchi.  The city is named after the Berda River, which, falling into the sea, washed the famous scythe with clean sand and water.  There are <span>salt lakes</span> with brine that heals joints and soothes the nervous system.  And various amusing monuments - Ostap Bender, the "breadwinner" and many others - will entertain those who go for a walk in the old city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Berdyansk reviews" class="if" height="457" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/150322.jpg" width="600"></div><strong></strong>

    <p>  <strong>Rest in Berdyansk.</strong>  <strong>Tourists reviews</strong> </p><p>  Of course, this resort has its drawbacks, but even lovers of youth parties speak positively of it.  For example, those who can’t imagine a holiday without nightclubs recommend settling in the city center, that is, in the Lower District, the local “City”.  This will be closer to places of all kinds of entertainment and noisy "balls", as well as not far from the bank, post office, and other necessary places.  What else can Berdyansk offer?  The reviews and comments of people who have been here assure that Schmidt Park is definitely suitable for walking, especially since the anchor port canteen, which is located nearby, is the first place in the rating of “price-quality” among vacationers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest in Berdyansk reviews" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/150324.jpg" width="600"></div>  <strong>Berdyansk.</strong>  <strong>Guest reviews about the sea</strong>

If you settled in the center, then you can get here by bus or minibus, although there are boats too.  But it is much better to relax on the beach here than in any other place in Berdyansk, especially on the so-called distant spit.  That's where the real thalassotherapy is!  Beautiful views, breathtaking sunsets, well-kept beaches and the cleanest sea - everything is here.  Yes, and people even in season are quite few, and there is always the opportunity to see an empty seat.  The sea warms up very much, because it is shallow and always warm.  As for the safety features, it would be useful to recall not only sunblock, but also that it is best to spend a “siesta” from noon to three to four days somewhere in the shade. </p><p>  <strong>Berdyansk.</strong>  <strong>Reviews on local cuisine and attractions</strong> </p>

Fish is the main pride of the local gourmets.  The “fish penthouse” on Schmidt Street was praised for the fact that here, just like in Thailand, freshly caught and cooked seafood is served right on your plate.  This institution does not know what “frozen foods” are.  But most of all, this city will appeal to wildlife lovers.  The Zennzik Islands, a wildlife reserve near Byrd ... You can’t count the excursions inviting you to see the islands and these protected places where you can see so much surprising.  It was as if a man’s foot hadn’t stepped there, flocks of frightened birds — waders, swans, <span>wild orchids</span> bloom and rare plants grow there.  You can inhale the smell of the mowed steppe and think about the fact that Rousseau was right when he proclaimed his slogan - "back to nature."
