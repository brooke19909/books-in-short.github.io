    <p>  For more than a decade, dinosaurs have become the subject of close attention not only of ordinary people, but also of pundits.  They are trying to learn everything about these mysterious creatures: from how this species arose on Earth to why dinosaurs became extinct.  Although it is the latter topic that most scientists care about, who are developing new versions every year. </p><p>  <strong>Dinosaurs became extinct from an extraterrestrial invasion</strong> </p><p>  No, it‚Äôs absolutely not about alien invasion.  In this case, the main reason for the total disappearance of dinosaurs is the activity of <span>celestial bodies.</span>  It is believed that dinosaurs became extinct due to one of the following factors: the fall of a large asteroid, multiple ‚Äúbombardment‚Äù of asteroids on the Earth‚Äôs surface, the collision of the Earth with a comet and an increase in radiation due to an explosion of a supernova or another factor of a similar nature. </p><p>  Geological studies have repeatedly confirmed the fact that the surface of the Earth was repeatedly subjected to the fall of asteroids of various sizes.  Putting forward the version of why dinosaurs became extinct, adherents of the theory of ‚Äúasteroid bombardment‚Äù point out the approximate similarity between the moment of their fall and the mass extinction of the dinosaurs.  It is worth noting that scientists support this theory only partially: physicists say that a single fall was enough, citing studies <span>of the Chiksulub crater</span> and astronomical calculations of the <span>collision of the earth</span> with other celestial bodies.  They are opposed by geologists and paleontologists, arguing that dramatic changes in the composition of the fauna of the earth's surface could occur only as a result of multiple falls.  Be that as it may, in this case it does not matter from which the dinosaurs became extinct: from a single or multiple crash of an asteroid.  The main thing is that as a result of this, most species were destroyed almost simultaneously. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another version is put forward by those who, as the main cause of death, indicate an increase in the <span>level of radiation.</span>  This event, scientists say, has led to less sunlight coming to Earth due to the physicochemical processes that took place in <span>the earth‚Äôs atmosphere.</span>  As a result, there was widespread cooling, which had a detrimental effect on cold-blooded species.  In addition, the amount of radiation that penetrated through the atmospheric layers also had a negative effect on the biological processes of reproduction, reducing them to almost zero. </p><p>  The presented theories of why dinosaurs became extinct are, so to speak, one-sided.  As a rule, all ‚Äúextraterrestrial‚Äù hypotheses were built by pundits who are representatives of one direction of the indicated research.  At the same time, other factors that make it possible to more fully reveal the extinction of biological species are not taken into account. </p><p>  <strong>Biological versions</strong> </p><p>  If we turn to other sciences, then we can put forward another series of theories about why dinosaurs became extinct.  The first of these is the theory of the global change of the Earth.  It took into account a number of factors, namely: the movement of plates, the change in sea level towards the lowering, as a result of the first two - jumps in temperature and a change in the composition of flora and air. </p><p>  The second version of why dinosaurs became extinct is precisely the change in the flora of the planet, based on the movement of <span>tectonic plates.</span>  As a result of this, predators got the opportunity to more successfully destroy young growth and clutches of <span>dinosaur eggs,</span> and, thereby, regulate the reproduction of this species in the direction of reduction. </p><p>  These are basic theories trying to explain why dinosaurs became extinct.  As you can see, each of them relies on one factor, while the rest is given secondary importance.  Therefore, it seems important to combine those parts of the hypotheses that are confirmed by material evidence, and based on them to derive a single one. </p>
