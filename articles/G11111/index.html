Also in the immediate vicinity are numerous cafes and restaurants (but this can also be regarded as a drawback, because loud music plays in them until late).  Guests enjoy spacious and bright rooms with high ceilings, as well as friendly and attentive service. </p><p>  Among the shortcomings, it is worth noting not very satisfying breakfasts, as well as a rather inconvenient access to the hotel.  Also, the quality of cleaning is slightly affected (the carpet is very dirty and requires serious cleaning or a complete replacement).  If we talk about the positive aspects, then this is the presence of balconies with sea views, as well as coolers and microwaves on each floor.  In the hall there are children's corners with various toys and other entertainments for kids. </p>
