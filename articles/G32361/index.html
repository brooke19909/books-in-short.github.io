One of the most interesting representatives of the company is the S60 device.  What is this smartphone? </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Phone <span>"Lenovo S</span> 60" has a discreet, but pretty nice design.  This feature is inherent in almost all representatives of the C series, since smartphones in this line are more focused on performance and entertainment. </p><p>  The device with its appearance completely imitates the fellow C 90, as well as the flagship of Apple.  Despite the similarities, differences can be found in the phone.  For example, the S90 was made of metal, and the C 60 was made of polycarbonate.  It is difficult to consider this as a disadvantage, because the phone has not lost anything in the strength and quality of the assembly.  The use of polycarbonate made it possible to make the device lighter and much cheaper.  The case of the device is non-separable, which makes it even more similar to similar models. </p>

    <p>  Working with the device is very comfortable even with one hand.  Light weight, only 128 g, as well as a nice plastic do not allow the device to slip out of hand. </p><p>  Will delight fans and color options.  The smartphone is available in white, gray and bright yellow.  Attractive appearance and rich colors add zest to the device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As for the external parts, the display, sensors, touch buttons, camera, indicator and, of course, the speaker are located in front. </p><p>  At the bottom of the device are two speakers, a microphone and a USB jack.  On top, a headset jack and an additional microphone sheltered.  The volume and power buttons are located on the right side.  On the left is a nest for SIM cards and a flash drive. </p><p>  The back end got a camera, company logo, technical inscriptions, as well as a flash. </p><p>  Unfortunately, there is no backlight for the touch buttons.  However, for the device of the middle price category, the appearance turned out to be excellent. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  Quite a decent screen got a "Lenovo S 60", the characteristics of which we are considering.  Its resolution is 1280 x 720, which is acceptable for a 5-inch display. </p><p>  The phone has 294 ppi, which means, peering, you can notice minor pixels.  In general, for a not very expensive device, the screen quality is acceptable. </p>

    <p>  The image is saturated and quite bright.  Due to the use of the IPS matrix, viewing angles are also not satisfactory.  The phone also has automatic brightness control. </p><p>  Glass is used to protect the display, but there is no film.  To avoid the appearance of fingerprints, <span>an oleophobic coating is</span> implemented on the screen <span>.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The installed display looks pretty decent both in games and when playing HD.  For the average price category of devices, all parameters are at a decent level. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Chinese smartphones have long been able to take high-quality images, and the C 60 has not become an exception. The device has a camera of as many as 13 megapixels with an amazing resolution of 4160 x 3120. Accordingly, the images are detailed and high-quality.  Naturally, there are minor flaws in the form of excessive noise.  Pictures of the device are obtained approximately 3-5 MB. </p><p>  The camera functions noticeably worse in poor lighting conditions.  In such cases, too noticeable noises and even graininess appear. </p><p>  The front camera will also delight owners with the presence of 5 megapixels.  Good resolution (2592 x 1944) allows you to take pictures of decent quality. </p>

    <p>  The camera interface was slightly modified in the device, which made it more convenient.  Ease of control allows you to even intuitively adjust the quality of images. </p><p>  Video recording has disadvantages similar to photos.  With good lighting, the quality is good, but in the twilight appears graininess and noise.  Of course, you should not expect much from a middle-class camera.  The price requested for the Lenovo S 60 completely mitigates the flaws. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Filling </h2><p>  Chinese smartphones rarely use the SnapDragon processor, but the C 60 is exactly the case.  Replacing the familiar MTK with a more powerful counterpart for the better affects performance. </p><p>  The four cores present work on the 64th platform and have a performance of 1.2 GHz each.  Such a filling allows you to maximize the potential of the device. </p><p>  The 2 GB RAM installed in Lenovo S 60 also failed.  The price of the device looks just ridiculous, given such hardware.  In comparison with the <span>A 7000,</span> which has a similar cost, the phone looks more attractive. </p><p>  The Adreno 306 video accelerator looks definitely weak against the general background. However, it copes with all the assigned functions. </p>

    <p>  The smartphone comes exclusively with 8 GB of internal memory.  Part of it is spent on Android, and the user will have about 6 GB.  You can expand the memory capacity with a flash drive with a capacity of up to 32 GB, although the present filling will quite cope with 64 GB. </p><p>  The device shows itself perfectly in working with all applications, as well as demanding games.  Of course, there are some exceptions in which you have to use average graphics. </p><h2>  System </h2><p>  The reviews written about Lenovo S 60 make it clear that the device comes with several versions of Android.  Sometimes the old version 4.4 comes across, and periodically the device comes with the installed 5.0.2 system.  On top of the "Android" is the proprietary shell Vibe UI. </p><p>  Applications do not have a separate menu and are placed on the desktop, as in an iPhone.  Most of the necessary programs are immediately installed in the device.  The shell allows you to customize the appearance of many interface details.  The system works stably and without braking. </p><p>  If an outdated version is delivered, the owner will be able to upgrade the device to 5.0 without any problems.  It is possible to carry out updating both through FOTA, and with the help of special programs. </p>

    <h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The battery in the device is not removable, and given the capacity of 2150 mAh, this is a tangible problem for the Lenovo S 60.  User reviews report a 3-hour battery life with active use.  The smartphone in standby mode will last a day. </p><p>  The phone has modes to save battery.  With careful battery consumption, 7-9 hours will be enough. </p><p>  Undoubtedly, the battery in the device is not the most successful one.  Actively working with the device, the owner will be very dependent on additional charging. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  In addition to the phone, the kit includes instructions, a USB cable, an adapter, a key for trays and headphones.  In rare cases, the kit also comes with covers for Lenovo S 60.  Screen protection can be supplemented with film. </p>

    <h2>  Price </h2><p>  The cost of the device is approximately 15 thousand rubles.  The price is pretty nice considering the stuffing and the functionality of the device. </p><p>  Most likely, you will have to immediately add to the total cost and replace the headset.  Native headphones that come with the device are not very high quality. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  Having considered the review of "Lenovo S 60", I want to note the excellent smartphone camera.  Of course, there are flaws, but in general, the pictures are excellent. </p><p>  Another positive side of the device is the filling.  For its money, Lenovo has equipped the phone with impressive features.  A powerful processor and a large number of RAMs allow the smartphone to perform many tasks. </p><p>  Design can also be considered as an advantage of the device.  A simple and elegant appearance, no frills, will definitely appeal to users.  Although there is no metal in the device, the strength and build quality were not affected because of this. </p><p>  A good display should also be noted.  The large diagonal and quite acceptable quality make the screen pleasing to the eye.  Although the C series is a device for entertainment, not all phones in the line can boast of such a display. </p><p>  Almost all owners are satisfied with the price-performance ratio of Lenovo S 60.  Reviews are mostly positive, but minor miscalculations of the company come up.  Although it is difficult to blame the minor flaws of a mid-range smartphone. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Cons are much smaller, and for the most part they are not so noticeable.  The most noticeable drawback is the weak battery.  Although the smartphone, it seems, consumes a bit of energy, it is not capable of boasting the duration of work. </p><p>  Another unpleasant feature of the phone is the small amount of memory.  Only 6 GB available for use, do not satisfy all requests.  The only way out is to increase the volume due to the flash drive. </p><p>  After reviewing the reviews left about Lenovo S 60, you can see that not all users like the similarity to Apple's design.  Of course, there are not so many complaints, but they are. </p>
