But as it turned out during sociological surveys, most people do not know not only where the person‚Äôs heart is located, but they are also lost when they are asked about the position of other internal organs. </p><p>  On the one hand - what's the difference?  Especially if nothing hurts inside.  But on the other hand: what if the need arises to provide first aid to the deceased or just to a person who suddenly suddenly felt ill in the car? </p><p>  Unfortunately, unhappiness always lies in wait for us unexpectedly.  For example, in nature, suddenly one of the participants in a picnic suddenly grabs the area under the chest and begins to breathe often.  What should be done?  Call a doctor - it will be too long, a person can not stand it. </p><p>  Not knowing where the heart is located in a person, it can be assumed that these are ordinary gastric colic.  Meanwhile, often such pains occur with a heart attack or simply with heart failure.  Indeed, the heart, contrary to popular belief, is not at all in the left part of the chest, but just in the middle, but asymmetrically: its third is on the right, and the remaining two thirds are on the left.  Thus, pain in the area that is usually considered the stomach may well turn out to be heart pain. </p><p>  It is best for such a patient to lie on his back, free the upper <span>body</span> from the ties and buttons, and increase the access of fresh air.  If possible, you can turn on the fan, or fan the patient's head with a newspaper, a fan, a towel. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You also need to give him a drink of sweet water, you can put validol under the tongue.  Of course, movements in such a state and any physical activity, even the smallest at first glance, are contraindicated to him. </p><p>  Ignorance of where a person has a heart can play another evil joke in the opposite direction.  Especially with people who are fond of self-medication and neglecting qualified medical examinations.  So, for example, there are patients who for many years believe that they have a sick heart.  Therefore, they are trying hard to cure this ailment.  When the patience on their own to ‚Äúcripple" oneself is no longer enough, and they still decide to go to the hospital, the last advanced stage of a stomach ulcer or a serious pancreatic disease is suddenly determined. </p><p>  It is ridiculous, but too many do not know where the human heart is located, even despite the fact that at school anatomy lessons with a specially designated ‚Äúheart‚Äù topic are mandatory for everyone.  Although nature sometimes throws a "ring", because there are people with a mirror arrangement of internal organs. </p><p>  This is in no way an ugliness, absolutely does not affect human health.  Just such a physiological feature, and that‚Äôs it.  Although the individual needs to know about it in order to warn the attending physicians.  There were such cases when a man shot at point blank remained alive only thanks to such a peculiarity of his structure. </p><p>  But the presence of two hearts is not considered to be a good fact for the owner.  On the contrary, they are at greater risk and often do not live to middle age.  As they say, everything should be in moderation.  Even the number of hearts. </p><p>  So, we found out where the heart of a person is: the back part of it lies on the diaphragm, is surrounded on all sides by the lungs, with the exception of only part of the front surface, which is adjacent to the front wall of the chest.  Most of it is located on the left, and the smaller - on the right, up, back, and right its base is facing, and the top, respectively, goes down, forward and to the left. </p><p>  Knowing where the person‚Äôs heart is located makes it possible to properly massage him directly when suddenly stopped, to provide first aid to the deceased, also doing massage, alternating with artificial respiration, and in some other cases. </p>
