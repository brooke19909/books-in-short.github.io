Hotel "Dacha Del Sol" (reviews confirm that it is not difficult to find it) is located on Pionersky Prospekt, just 6 km from the train station.  From the airport, the path will take a little longer, as these two objects are separated by 9 km.  Finally, if you are traveling by car, then just 20 minutes after entering the city you will be in place.  Moreover, most tourists do not leave the area surrounding the hotel until the end of the vacation.  It has everything you might need.

    <h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  First of all, without exception, everyone is happy that there is a free transfer from the airport to the hotel.  Many come with families with children, and the road after a tiring flight is not at all encouraging.  And if the hotel management took care of you, it is perceived very well.  Settlement occurs quickly, usually does not take more than two hours.  If necessary, wait to be treated to a glass of martini or other drink of your choice.  If you have children, then they will be fed at this time. </p><p>  The second big plus is the hotel staff.  All employees are polite, pleasant in communication, which greatly improves the overall impression that ‚ÄúDacha Del Sol‚Äù (Anapa) will leave in your soul.  A hotel whose rating is growing day by day should take care of the comfort of its guests, and this hotel is a vivid example of this.  You do not have to drag suitcases, you are escorted to the house and your luggage will be brought.  Interior decoration pleases even more.  There is a dryer and an excellent coffee machine with capsules for it, an <span>ironing board</span> and an iron, a refrigerator and air conditioning, a safe and a hairdryer. </p><p>  Dining of tourists is generally a topic for a separate discussion, only because of this the choice of many for the next season becomes "Dacha Del Sol" (Anapa).  The 4 * hotel prepares for "5" with a big plus, all the dishes are incredibly tasty and healthy.  Soups and salads, red fish and diet rabbit, matchless desserts and cakes.  But there are no high chairs for children, take it with you or you will have to experience inconvenience when feeding babies. </p>

    <h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Dacha Del Sol is a great family-friendly hotel.  Here you can perfectly celebrate a memorable date and spend a weekend, vacation with your children.  Judging by the many reviews, here are excellent conditions that make it possible to get a lot of pleasure from time spent at sea.  Stunning nature, comfortable conditions, polite staff - all this in a complex makes your vacation the best.  At the same time, the cost of rest here is far from the most expensive.  All-inclusive accommodation will cost about 1200 rubles per day.  Rest here you will remember for many more years in a row and you will certainly want to return. </p>
