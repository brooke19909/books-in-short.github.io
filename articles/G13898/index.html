Reviews about him on the Internet are found only positive.  And the people who bought it no longer want to use other similar household appliances. </p><h2>  Dyson DC41C Origin Extra review </h2><p>  The vacuum cleaner from Dyson is designed for dry cleaning of rooms.  A special nozzle is supplied with the device, on which there are two modes: ‚Äúfloor‚Äù and ‚Äúcarpet‚Äù.  This device is suitable for absolutely all floor coverings.  In addition to this nozzle, a hard brush is attached to the vacuum cleaner.

It accelerates dust-filled air to high speed.  The strong centrifugal force that forms inside the body helps to filter out fine dust particles and traps them inside the container.  Thanks to this development, the vacuum cleaner is able to draw in dust up to 0.5 microns.

The casing is designed in such a way that the sound effect is minimized.  For its manufacture, Ball technology was used, thanks to which it was possible to arrange the heaviest parts of the product in the center of the ball.  This location of the elements shifts the center of gravity and improves the maneuverability of the unit.  That is precisely why a vacuum cleaner can be operated with only one hand. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Specifications Dyson DC41C Origin Extra show this device only with the best hand. </p>
