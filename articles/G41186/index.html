    <p>  The most unfavorable holiday season in Nha Trang is considered to be the period from mid-October to the end of December: small waves form on the sea surface that interfere with swimming. </p><p>  Above the bay of the metropolis towards Honche Island, there is a cableway - the longest on Earth.  Cabins, which accommodate eight people, move at an altitude of fifty meters above the sea.  In the Nha Trang area, this island is the most impressive of all. </p><h2>  Outstanding 3-star Nha Trang hotels </h2><p>  An incredible number of travelers dream of visiting Vietnam!  <span>3-star hotels in</span> Nha Trang are patronized in the first place, because they are in great demand among visitors.  In total, the best three-star hotels in the metropolis, there are 41 objects.  Below are the top ten outstanding: </p><ul><li>  Golden Rain Hotel 3 *. </li><li>  The Light 3 *. </li><li>  Prime 3 *. </li><li>  Barcelona 3 *. </li><li>  Asia Paradise Hotel 3 *. </li><li>  Que Huong 3 *. </li><li>  Sunny 3 *. </li><li>  The Summer 3 *. </li><li>  Vien Dong 3 *. </li><li>  <span>Dong Phuong 2 Hotel</span> 3 *. </li></ul><h2>  Expert Reviews for Nha Trang Hotels </h2><p>  A huge number of Vietnamese people are resting in Nha Trang.  It is this nuance that explains the presence of hundreds of mini-hotels located along the coast.  Many of them are unpretentious and work only in the summer.  In such small hotels there is a wonderful service and fairly reasonable prices. </p><p>  It is interesting that at 64 Tran Phu there is a ‚ÄúMini-Hotel Alley‚Äù, where you can find a hotel to your liking and facilities.  After all, it is in this area that many budget hotels are located.  By the way, this quiet side street is located near the leading tourist center and the beach. </p><p>  In Nha Trang, you can relax in both motels and guest houses.  In these establishments, at least $ 20 must be paid for one night.  Here all rooms are equipped with bathroom, air conditioning.  Each room has a nightstand, refrigerator, wardrobe and night light.  Wi-Fi is available in every nook and cranny of the building. </p><p>  Numerous motorcyclists roam the streets of Nha Trang - they are annoying.  But they can always be asked where the hotel or cafe is located.  In general, a motorcycle in Vietnam is the most common and democratic mode of transport.  It is better to perceive it as an inevitable condition of the resort's urban life. </p><p>  Many travelers prefer to stay in local luxury hotels, for example, in Ana Mandara and its branch of Evason Hideaway Ana Mandara.  These are the most famous hotels of Nha Trang. </p><h2>  What do tourists say? </h2><p>  Ah, how amazing the hotels of Nha Trang are!  Reviews of tourists confirm their splendor!
