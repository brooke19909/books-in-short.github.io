Many find the opportunity to relax only in the fall, for example, in October.  Some tourists do not want to go to tropical resorts, since a large number of tourists actually prefer to study the characteristics of a country, its history and culture.  Europe is an excellent solution in this situation.  A great place for such a vacation would be the <span>Czech Republic.</span>  <span>Prague</span> in October offers a large selection of excursions and activities.  So, what is the weather like in the city in the fall?  What to take on a trip?  We will talk about this later. </p><h2>  Climatic features of the Czech Republic </h2><p>  This is a country with a temperate climate, influenced by mountains that prevent the passage of cold air currents.  Thus, in the Czech Republic it is usually not too hot in summer, and winters are moderately cold and humid. </p><h2>  Weather in Prague in October </h2><p>  In Prague, as a rule, moderate temperature indicators in any season.  It is not very cold or hot here.  The weather in Prague in October allows you not to think about whether you will freeze or it will become hot.  Just put on a light sweater and you will feel good without worrying about temperature.  Even at night in Prague this month there is less than 5 degrees of heat.  Rains are usually short and do not interfere with walks. </p>
