  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sights of Dmitrov: photos and descriptions, tours, interesting places and reviews of tourists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Dmitrov is located in the north of the <span>Moscow region.</span>  You can get to it from the capital by train from the Sverdlovsk station.  The small town is interesting for its sights.  It is for their sake that many tourists come to it. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The city of Dmitrov in the <span>Moscow region is</span> only seven years younger than the capital.  It was founded in 1154.  By the 850th anniversary, the town was renovated and reconstructed, and in 2005 it was even recognized as the most comfortable among the small cities of the country.  In memory of the founder in Dmitrov, a monument to Yuri Dolgorukov was erected. </p><p>  Tourists recommend visiting the town in summer or spring.  At this time, Dmitrov is more handsome.  There are a lot of greenery and fountains around, and you can ride a boat on the canal. </p><h2>  Dmitrov Kremlin </h2><p>  One of the main attractions of the city is the Kremlin.  It dates back to the twelfth century.  At that time, the <span>Dmitrov Kremlin</span> was a well-fortified fortress with a deep moat, strong walls and high towers.  But its modern appearance is no less impressive for all tourists. </p><p>  Currently, a two-story museum called the Dmitrov Kremlin consists of nine exhibition halls.  Each of them has its own exposure.  Here you can learn about the history of the noble estates of the region, about crafts and agriculture, and about the difficult period of the Great Patriotic War.  According to tourists, the most interesting part of the exposition, which is dedicated to the history of the country. </p><p>  As for the Kremlin‚Äôs defenses, only a kilometer-long land rampart remained from them.  But the rest of the architectural complex has been preserved much better.  The Kremlin is especially beautiful in summer and spring, when the earthen rampart is covered with green grass.  Near the southern entrance to the territory, guests can see the monument to Yuri Dolgoruky, who founded the city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="voxxter.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dmitrov Kremlin" class="if uuid-2445413" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2445413.jpg"></div><p>  After watching the Kremlin, tourists usually go to the Assumption Cathedral, whose history has more than 500 years.  For all this time, the building has undergone a lot of rebuilding and reconstruction.  In certain years, there was even a local history museum.  Now in the Assumption Cathedral there is an active temple with a unique five-tier iconostasis.  There are services for parishioners.  And next to the cathedral is a monument to Cyril and Methodius. </p><p>  No less beautiful is another Kremlin church - Elizabethan.  Here is the building of a female gymnasium.  You can leave the Kremlin through the Nikolsky Gate, near which is the chapel of Alexander Nevsky and the Bridge of Happiness.  Local newlyweds traditionally leave locks on it as a symbol of eternal love.  If you have not met your soul mate, then you can stand at the Stone of Desire in Dmitrov and make a wish so that love appears in your life. </p><p>  As you can see, in a relatively small area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Kremlin there are a large number of places of interest. </p><h2>  Borisoglebsky Monastery </h2><p>  Another attraction of Dmitrov is the Borisoglebsky Monastery (male).  This is one of the most visited places in the city.  On the monastery territory there are two eponymous cathedrals - Boris and Gleb.  According to historians, they were built in the middle of the sixteenth century. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Its territory is surrounded by a fence, and you can get to it through the Holy Gates.  And not far from the monastery in a square there is a monument to the princes Gleb and Boris.  In the monastery, in addition to farm buildings, there is the Water Sanctuary Chapel.  It is best to come here in the summer, as there is a lot of greenery on the territory and there is a flower garden. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dmitrov-reg.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Borisoglebsky Monastery" class="if uuid-2445410" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2445410.jpg"></div><p>  The interest of believing tourists in the Borisoglebsky monastery is due to the fact that the relics of saints are stored in it.  Here they keep the particle of the Cross of the Lord carefully. </p><h2>  Peremilovskaya height </h2><p>  Near the city there is a unique historical place.  At the <span>Peremilovskaya height</span> in 1941, the fate of Russia was decided.  During the fierce battles, Russian troops were able to repel the offensive by the Nazis and thereby prevent the occupation.  Historians believe that the battle at height was a turning point during the war. </p><p>  Currently, on the slope of Peremilovskaya height, there is a memorial in the form of a figure of our soldier, running in an attack with weapons.  The height of the monument is about 30 meters.  From the top of the hill there is a beautiful view of the land where once desperate battles took place. </p><div class="photo" data-original="turbina.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Peremilovskaya height" class="if uuid-2445423" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2445423.jpg"></div><p>  Near the memorial there is a granite wall ‚ÄúTo the Heroes of the Battle of Moscow‚Äù.  It bears the names of the battalions and military units that took part in the liberation of the area from the Germans. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Sretensky church </h2><p>  Among the attractions of Dmitrov, it is worth highlighting the Sretensky temple.  They say that the first wooden church on the site of the current one appeared in the 4th century.  It was repeatedly restored after fires.  In 1814, they decided to dismantle the old building and erect a new stone church on this site.  Such a significant event was dedicated to the victory over Napoleon.  Funds for the construction were allocated by local merchants - Bolshakov Ivan and Korovaev Boris.  After the revolution, there were warehouses in the temple.  And only in 1992 the church again passed into the hands of believers.  Its restoration took place by the forces of the townspeople themselves. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.votpusk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sretensky church" class="if uuid-2445424" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2445424.jpg"></div><p>  The church is interesting for its style.  It is made in the spirit of neoclassicism, which was very popular in Russia in the 17-18 centuries.  But the interior of the temple is a treasure collected over the past 25 years. </p><p>  The city of Dmitrov in the Moscow region is rich in temples.  Each of them is interesting and worthy of attention. </p><h2>  Manor Danilovskoe </h2><p>  Among the interesting places of Dmitrov, one can distinguish Danilovskoe estate, which is a historical architectural monument of the Moscow region.  In the eighteenth century, the complex belonged to Prince Golitsyn.  Subsequently, the estate passed to the Polivanovs, and then to Rimsky-Korsakov.  And after the revolution, the building was run by the Pokrovskaya manufactory. </p><p>  The estate is of interest because it is made in the style of the "Elizabethan" Baroque.  And there are not many such complexes in the Moscow region.  But the place is interesting not only as a historical monument, but also by the surrounding beauty of nature.  Everyone can stroll through the linden park, see the unusual system of terrace ponds and go to the old Nikolsky temple.  The church is considered one of the most beautiful buildings of the eighteenth century.  Its facades are made in the late Baroque style.  For this reason, the estate was given the status of a historical and architectural monument. </p><h2>  Dmitrov Museum </h2><p>  The Dmitrov Museum of Local Lore was opened in 1918 at the request of the county zemstvo and representatives of the local intelligentsia.  It was headed by academician Tikhomirov.  The collection was already formed by 1920.  It includes household items collected during ethnographic expeditions, as well as works of folk, temple, fine, decorative and applied art.  The institution‚Äôs funds contain truly unique film materials, photographs and documents. </p><p>  The art collection of the museum is considered one of the best and most interesting in the Moscow Region.  In the halls you can see Western European and Russian paintings of the 18-19th centuries, artworks of folk crafts.  The museum offers diverse thematic tours. </p><div class="photo" data-original="riamo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum of Local Lore" class="if uuid-2445426" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2445426.jpg"></div><p>  No less interesting is the building itself.  It is made in the Baroque style.  And the green fronts harmonize beautifully with the surrounding green spaces. </p><h2>  Manor in Khrabrovo </h2><p>  The sights of Dmitrov could include the estate in Khrabrovo.  But quite a bit survived from her.  Its history goes back to the eighteenth century.  For 200 years, the estate belonged to only two noble families.  Initially, it was owned by the <span>princes Obolensky,</span> and at the end of the nineteenth century it was bought by the Lazarevs. </p><p>  In 1770, the estate consisted of wooden buildings, a park and an orchard.  Obolensky later rebuilt the church and house, making them stone.  It was he who managed to combine the previously fragmented estate.  The one-story manor house was small and made of stone.  He successfully survived the revolution and war, and then was destroyed at the end of the twentieth century.  Of all the buildings of the estate, only the Intercession Church, built in 1790 in the Baroque style, has survived. </p><h2>  Dmitrov in one day </h2><p>  What to see in Dmitrov in one day?  If you don‚Äôt have much time at your disposal, then the inspection should start from the central square, which is the favorite vacation spot of citizens.  Near it are the most important <span>attractions: a monument to</span> Yuri Dolgoruky, the Assumption Cathedral, the Kremlin, a fountain.  Legend has it that it was here that Yu. Dolgoruky was predicted to have a son, after which he ordered the city to be laid. </p><p>  Sovetskaya Square smoothly turns into a footpath.  The latter will lead you to the Kremlin and the Assumption Cathedral.  These attractions should be seen by every tourist.  It is worth noting that the territory of the Kremlin is very small, so its viewing does not take much time.  True, there are two museums here, they can also be visited if you are interested in the history of the region, life, clothes and so on.  By purchasing a ticket to the historical complex of the Kremlin, you can safely see all of its facilities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tourprom.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to Dolgoruky" class="if uuid-2445430" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2445430.jpg"></div><p>  Not far away is the Borisoglebsky Monastery, which could be the next point of a tour of Dmitrov.  Near the monastery walls a monument was erected in the form of two horsemen.  The territory of the monastery is not at all large, but quiet and green.  No city noise is heard here, a family of peacocks walks, and plants bloom in the flowerbed. </p><p>  Then you can go to Peremilovskaya Heights, which is known for fierce battles at the beginning of World War II.  It is located in the town of Yakhroma, it is about 1.5 km from Dmitrov.  You can get to it by minibus number 38. The road takes no more than ten minutes, buses run often, so you can not worry. </p><p>  The guided tour may be a little different if you want.  We have given only a possible option. </p><h2>  House of Klyatovs </h2><p>  The architectural sights of the city include the house of merchants Klyatov.  It was built in 1822.  A wooden building is a prime example of wooden classicism.  Lightweight construction made entirely of wood.  From the interior, little has survived to this day.  Only in the main hall there are corner stoves and double doors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rutraveller.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="House of Klyatovs" class="if uuid-2445432" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2445432.jpg"></div><p>  Klyatov‚Äôs House is the oldest building in the city.  In the post-revolutionary years he was transferred to apartments.  Now the building is recognized as an architectural monument.  It is periodically restored and maintained in good condition. </p><h2>  Church of St. Nicholas </h2><p>  The Church of St. Nicholas is an active church, which is located on the territory of the Nikolsko-Obolyanovo estate in the village of Podyachevo, near Dmitrov.  The first wooden building was erected here in 1711.  Seventy years later, a stone church was laid, the main shrine of which was the icon of Saints John the Merciful and Anna, which was presented by Elizabeth herself.  After the revolution, the temple suffered a terrible fate.  It was closed, and eventually looted.  Later in the building there was a hostel and workshops.  The Orthodox Church returned the building in 2000.  Now restoration work is underway in the temple, since it was almost completely destroyed. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  According to tourists, modern Dmitrov is significantly different from what it was ten years ago.  Now the city is incredibly transformed and looks very modern and comfortable.  Dimitrov is a small city, but it has an interesting history and a lot of attractions.  Guests recommend visiting it in the summer.  Fountains, green trees and flowering flower beds - all this makes the town incredibly attractive.  And walking along its elegant streets is much more pleasant in the warm season.  Clean and comfortable Dmitrov is open to tourists.  Its streets are decorated with unique modern sculptures, near each of which you will certainly see a person with a camera.  Everyone wants to take pictures as a keepsake.  If time allows you, and you want to walk around the city, you will probably notice its unusualness.  Here, modern high-rise buildings are adjacent to buildings of the twentieth century and very old houses and mansions.  From one block to another, as if moving in time.  Buildings of completely different eras wonderfully combine with each other. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of St. Nicholas" class="if uuid-2445433" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2445433.jpg"></div><p>  In the city you can find a lot of excursion bureaus offering their travel programs.  But experienced tourists recommend visiting the local sights on their own, especially since they are located not far from each other.  A walk to the Kremlin and other interesting places will allow you to admire the city and take a lot of pictures as a keepsake.  There are many museums and temples in the city, so it‚Äôs very difficult to get around at once.  You should choose three or four main objects that you can inspect. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  We tried to tell you as much as possible about all the interesting places in the city so that tourists had an idea about it.  We hope that our information will be useful and will help you determine the excursion program for the sights of Dmitrov. </p>
