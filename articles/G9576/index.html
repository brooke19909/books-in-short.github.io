    <h2>  History and Society </h2><p>  If we consider the concepts of "society" and "history" in their ratio, then an interesting fact is striking.  Firstly, the concept of "history", being a synonym for the concepts of "development of society", "social process", characterizes the self-development of human society and its constituent spheres.  From this it can be seen that with this approach, a description of processes and phenomena is given outside the lives of the individuals participating in them.  Thus, the replacement of latifundism in Europe and Africa by solonite, corv√©e corv√©e, or Taylorism in industry by human relations can be considered as stages of the economic sphere.  With this understanding of history, it turns out that some faceless social forces dominate people. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Secondly, if the concept of ‚Äúsociety‚Äù is concretized, the way of social reality is expressed, then ‚Äúhistory‚Äù concretizes the ‚Äúsociety‚Äù, its definition.  History, therefore, consists of the processes of people's lives.  In other words, it describes where these processes took place, when they took place, etc. </p><p>  Thirdly, if we deeply comprehend this concept, then its connection will be manifested not only with the past when trying to give a definition.  History, on the one hand, really tells about the past, based on the current state of socio-cultural life.  As a result of this, modern requirements for events that took place in the past become decisive.  In other words, the following is clarified when trying to define: history is explained in connection with the present, the knowledge gained about the past makes it possible to draw the necessary conclusions for the future.  In this sense, this science, encompassing both the past, the present, and the future, connects them with the activities of people. </p><h2>  Understanding the course of history in a developed society </h2>

In developed societies with strong dynamism, its course is considered from the past to the present and from the present to the future.  Usually the definition of <span>history as a science</span> is given in relation to the history of civilizations.  It is believed that it began about 4000 years ago. </p><h2>  Understanding History in Traditional Societies </h2><p>  In traditional, backward societies, the past is placed ahead of the present.  The desire for him as a model, ideal is set as a goal.  In such societies myths prevail.  Therefore, they are called prehistoric societies that have no historical experience. </p><h2>  Two possibilities of observing history </h2><p>  The "trick" of history lies in the fact that its course passes unnoticed by people.  It is very difficult to observe her movement and human progress from close range.  You can usually talk about two possibilities of observing history.  One of them is associated with the personal formation of the child, and the other is the sequential registration of specific forms of organization of the stages of social processes.  In other words, history is the evolution of social forms and personalities. </p>

    <p>  At the same time, it is important to define history as a science, to establish a boundary between the history of mankind and events that took place before a person appeared.  The difficulty lies in the fact that the answer to this question depends on the position of the author, his thinking, scientific and theoretical model, and even on the directly extracted materials themselves. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The dynamism that marks history </h2><p>  The definition of a concept that interests us would be incomplete if we had not noted that dynamism exists in history.  The nature of society itself is such that its existence is always variable.  This is understandable.  Reality, expressing the diverse relationship of people as material-social and practical-spiritual beings, cannot be static. </p><p>  The dynamism of the <span>history of mankind has</span> been an object of study since ancient times.  This can be seen by considering the attempts of the ancient Greeks to cognize the phenomena occurring in society, including their fantasies and delusions.  A comparison of the simple equality of the era of hunters and gatherers with the division of people into slaves and slaveholders that appeared in antiquity led to the emergence of the myth of the ‚ÄúGolden Age‚Äù in folklore.  According to this myth, history moves in a circle.  The definition of the concept that interests us, from this point of view, is very different from the modern one.  The following reasons were cited as the reason for moving in a circle: ‚ÄúGod so decided‚Äù or ‚Äúsuch is the command of nature‚Äù, etc.  At the same time, the issue of the meaning of history was peculiarly addressed in them. </p><h2>  The story from the perspective of the Christian religion </h2><p>  For the first time in European thought, the characterization of the past of humanity from the perspective of the Christian religion was given by Aurelius Augustine (354-430).  Based on the Bible, he divided the history of mankind into six eras.  In the sixth era, Jesus Christ lived and worked, as Aurelius Augustine believes (his portrait is presented below). </p>

    <p>  According to the Christian religion, firstly, history moves in a certain direction, therefore, it has internal logic and a divine meaning, consisting in a special ultimate goal.  Secondly, the history of mankind is progressively moving towards progress.  At the same time, God-controlled humanity reaches maturity.  Thirdly, the story is unique.  Although man was created by God, for the committed sins he must be perfected by the will of the Most High. </p><h2>  Historical progress </h2>

    <p>  If until the 18th century the Christian point of view on history reigned supreme, European thinkers of the beginning of the <span>New Age</span> preferred progress and the natural laws of history, and also recognized the subordination of the fate of all peoples to the single law of historical development.  The Italian J. Vico, the French <span>S. Montesquieu</span> and J. Condorcet, the Germans I. Kant, Herder, G. Hegel and others believed that progress is expressed in the development of science, art, religion, philosophy, law, etc. All of them, ultimately, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsocio-historical progress was close. </p><p>  K. Marx was also a supporter of linear <span>social progress.</span>  According to his theory, progress ultimately rests on the development of productive forces.  However, in this understanding, his place as a person in history is not adequately reflected.  The main role is played by social classes. </p><p>  A definition by history should be given, also noting that by the end of the 20th century, understanding of its course in the form of linear motion, or rather its absolutization, had proved its complete failure.  An interest reappeared in the views that existed in antiquity, in particular, in its movement in a circle.  Naturally, these views were presented in a new, enriched form. </p><h2>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcyclical history </h2><p>  Philosophers of East and West examined the course of events in history in a certain sequence, repeatability and a certain rhythm.  On the basis of these views, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãperiodicity, i.e., cyclicality in the development of society, was gradually formed.  As <span>F. Braudel, the</span> greatest historian of our time, emphasizes <span>,</span> periodicity is characteristic of historical phenomena.  In this case, the calculation takes into account the time from the beginning of the processes to their end. </p><p>  The frequency of changes is noted in two forms: systemically identical and historical.  <span>Social changes</span> taking place within the framework of a specific qualitative state give impetus to subsequent qualitative changes.  It can be seen that due to the periodicity the stability of the social condition is ensured. </p><p>  In historical forms of periodicity, according to scientists, the stages of development of human society, in particular, its specifically taken components, take place at a certain time, and then cease to exist.  According to the type of manifestation, the frequency, depending on in which system it unfolds, is pendulum (in a small system), circular (in a medium-sized system), wave-like (in large systems), etc. </p><h2>  Doubts about absolute progress </h2><p>  Although the progressive movement of society in one form or another was recognized by many, nevertheless already at the end of the 19th century and especially in the 20th century doubts began to arise regarding the optimism of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãabsolute progress.  For the process of progress in one direction led to regression in the other, and thereby created threats to the development of man and society. </p>

    <p>  Today, such concepts as history and the state have become an integral part of our life.  Defining them does not seem to cause any difficulties.  However, as you see, history can be viewed from several sides, and the views on it have changed significantly at different times.  For the first time we get acquainted with this science when we arrive in September in grade 5.  History, the definitions of which are given to schoolchildren at this time, is understood somewhat simplistically.  In this article, we examined the concept more deeply and comprehensively.  Now you can note the features characteristic of history, give a definition.  History is an interesting science, acquaintance with which many tend to continue after school. </p>
