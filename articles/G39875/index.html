    <h2>  Leisure activities </h2><p>  If you carefully study the reviews that people leave about holidays in Hanioti Melathron 4 * (Halkidiki), you can understand that this hotel is not for everyone.  Why?  Everything is simple.  Many in our time regard the hotel not only as a place of residence, but also as a way to organize their leisure.  But there is no such thing.  There is no animation, as well as various kinds of active entertainment. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But there is a deep clean pool with a sun terrace, opportunities for sailing and a bike rental service.  This type of transport is very popular with tourists.  Many people like to explore local attractions on a bicycle. </p><p>  Guests are advised to book several excursions at once.  Especially popular are excursions to Corfu and trips to its capital - Kerkyra.  And, of course, you can‚Äôt do without a walk around Thessaloniki, where countless shops and boutiques are concentrated. </p>

    <h2>  Traveler Comments </h2><p>  Special attention should be paid to the reviews left about the Hanioti Melathron 4 * hotel.  Guests are happy to talk about how clean the hotel is.  The territory is small, and it is constantly maintained in perfect condition.  The same goes for the pool. </p><p>  But the sea especially admires visitors.  It is clean and deep enough.  If you want empty beaches and privacy, then you should go here in October.  The atmosphere at this time of year in Chanioti is amazing, romantic in its own way. </p><p>  And one more nuance, which is noted by the attention of every tourist who has been here.  It's a kitchen.  Hanioti Melathron serves traditional Greek dishes, not cooked by the chef, but by a true genius of culinary art.  If desired, you can even find out their recipes. </p><p>  By the way, tourists vacationing here are advised to rent a car.  Using personal transport to travel around Halkidiki is much more convenient and interesting. </p><p>  But, of course, the most important thing is the attitude of the hotel staff towards the guests.  It is very kind here.  Every guest is given due respect and care.  If you need medication - try to get it.  Early departure from the hotel or on a tour?  There will be an early breakfast.  Questions by number?  Decide immediately.  So largely thanks to the staff, the hotel receives such warm reviews. </p>
