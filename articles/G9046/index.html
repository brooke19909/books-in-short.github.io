The period from 1917 to 1991 goes into the distant past.  However, things from those times are still stored in every house.  Pocket watches "Lightning" in the USSR were popular at that time, and now are considered a valuable and expensive rarity.  They are found either at private collectors or in museums.  Why is “Lightning” in the 21st century appreciated in all the former USSR countries and abroad? </p>

    <h2>  Production start </h2><p>  In 1929, on the orders of Stalin, “Duber Hampton” was bought and a plant was built in the Urals, which was proudly called “Lightning”.  The company manufactured watches for the army and aviation, working in Zlatoust. </p><p>  In the difficult time of the Great Patriotic War, the plant moved <span>to Chelyabinsk,</span> where it continues to work to this day. </p><p>  But no matter how good a pocket watch is, there will be a replacement for everything.  In the 80s, a period of quartz movements began.  This greatly affected sales.  However, the company continued to operate and even survived the collapse of the country. </p><p>  The factory made mechanical pocket watches "Lightning" (USSR), and even after the collapse of the Soviet Union, until 2007.  In 2015, they again restored production.  Now it is called the Chelyabinsk watch factory "OJSC Lightning" and creates some of the most high-precision watches on the world market. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Scale </h2><p>  Over the history of the plant, the plant sold goods not only in the territory of the Soviet Union, but also to other states.  Over thirty countries bought their products.  For each of them, the company created a different design. </p><p>  Party leaders, military or people of science could afford such a thing; for an ordinary citizen, it was too expensive.  Also, a pocket watch “Lightning” in the USSR was awarded for heroic deeds.  Moreover, the design of the award was individual for each feat. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Chronometers have a rounded shape, the lid rises on a hinge.  To create used silver or steel.  There is always a chain in the kit.  Enamel was used for decoration.  In the mechanism of 15-18 stones of ruby ​​or brass.  The case is shockproof. </p><p>  The quality is often compared with the famous watches from Switzerland.  In fact, the prototype was the French model "Lip 36". </p><p>  There are a huge number of <span>varieties of pocket</span> watches "Lightning" (USSR).  Design depends on the year of manufacture, occasion and country.  There are also special series that were released for specific dates, such as the opening of the Olympics-80, the 50th anniversary of the Victory Day, etc. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pocket watch lightning USSR diversity" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63487/2124656.jpg"></div>

Each era has its own model.  Thus, we can trace the entire course of events in the history of the USSR. </p><p>  Pocket watch "Lightning" has always been very expensive.  In addition to the original design, they were incredibly accurate and durable, which gave an advantage among competitors. </p><h2>  How to distinguish an original from a fake? </h2><p>  Even in this area, the Chinese have found a replacement for the original.  To understand which country is a real manufacturer is very simple for an experienced craftsman.  For the average person, there is also one piece of advice.  You need to open the case and look into the mechanism.  At the original you will see the engraving on the details “36 02”, which means that the item is of high quality and rare.  Also, the details will be larger than that of a fake. </p><p>  There are 2 types of mechanism bridges: </p><ul><li>  Smooth surface.  They began to be made closer to our time. </li><li>  Milled surface.  These were the early models of watches. </li></ul><h2>  Nowadays </h2><p>  The more we move away from the <span>times of the Soviet Union,</span> the more expensive things from the past become.  And so it happened with our rarity. </p><p>  Now high-quality pocket watches “Lightning”, made in the USSR, are found in private collections or arsenals of certain museums, especially this applies to rare series.  Ordinary people are in a hurry to sell such an inheritance, since any original will cost at least a couple of thousand. </p><p>  The modern "Lightning" is also popular.  Although they are not considered a rarity, they cost a lot of money.  Despite such a long journey, the plant has not lost the secrets of product quality. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Where to look for your favorite model? </h2><p>  A person who is at least a little interested in this area would like to have at least one such chronometer at home. </p><p>  The Internet is the market where all the necessary products are located.  Here you can find almost everything.  Often people put Lightning at online auctions and online stores.  But this method is very risky, there is a chance just to buy a fake.  Therefore, it is better to meet with the seller directly and contact the watchmaker. </p><p>  Rare models can be found in rare shops, but the price, accordingly, will be more expensive.  Another option is to find the contacts of private owners collecting this brand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pocket watch lightning USSR photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63487/2124655.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Despite the cost, watches are often found on sale. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  Getting a good watch is an important task.  Here it is worth considering many factors on which the price depends.  The cost ranges from 200 to 20,000 rubles.  Consider the following criteria: </p><ol><li>  Year of production of pocket watches "Lightning" in the USSR.  Naturally, the further the year, the more expensive the thing.  There is a special marking on the details by which the date is determined. </li><li>  Series of goods.  The fewer watches in this series exist, the higher the price tag.  Especially expensive are the "Lightning" with a release of 10 to 100 pieces.  Such a model is almost impossible to find, and the cost will go off scale and can reach hundreds of thousands. </li><li>  Working condition.  The main task of any watch is to show the time.  "Lightning" is particularly accurate.  This is checked by a special device. </li><li>  Chronometer case.  Any dent, scratch, abrasion reduces the cost of goods.  The more defects on the case, the lower the price. </li><li>  Dial, glass.  Must be original. </li><li>  Cover and decoration.  Of course, appearance also plays a role in selling. </li></ol><p>  The best decision when buying is going to the watchmaker.  Each watch has its own price, so only a professional can accurately determine it. </p><h2>  Examples </h2><p>  Photo of a pocket watch “Lightning” (USSR) from the rare collection “On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Victory”.  Regardless of the condition, the price of such a thing will be from 3000 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pocket watch lightning of the USSR" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63487/2119434.jpg"></div>

A milled surface indicates the authenticity of age. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Year of manufacture of pocket watches lightning USSR" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63487/2124654.jpg"></div><br>  And yet, “Lightning” from the USSR is not only a quality thing, but also the memory of each great date, the history of the Soviet Union, and that distant life.  That is why the modern watches of the Molniya factory will never be compared with their ancestors.
