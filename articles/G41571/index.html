It happened in the fall of 2004 during the seizure by the militants of the school building. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Andrei Turkin" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14449/1487343.jpg" width="386"></div></h2><h2>  Years of study </h2><p>  In October 1975, a boy was born in the city of Orsk.  He had to grow up without a father, but he was very inquisitive and hardworking.  He helped his mother by learning how to do men's work.  But he also paid due attention to his studies at school.  He managed to attend classes in the choir and the section of hand-to-hand combat.  After graduating from 8th grade, he enrolled in study at Vocational School of Technology No. 63 in order to gain a profession and start working soon.  So he wanted to help the mother, who raised him alone.  Additionally studied at the school of bodyguards.  After graduating from college, he received the specialty "driver-locksmith" and was drafted into the army.  He served in the Transbaikal border region at the outpost of the Argun border detachment. </p><h2>  Dream come true </h2><p>  Also, Andrei Turkin, whose photo can be seen in this article, served under a contract in Tajikistan, where he took part in military operations.  After the army he entered the Krasnodar Institute of Marketing and ITS in the correspondence department, but still continued to dream of military service.  Therefore, having abandoned his studies, he joined the FSB of Russia.  He was accepted into the Vympel management.  After training special forces, he began to take part in various operations, including the release of hostages on Dubrovka.  He went on a business trip to Chechnya. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  His first commander Sergey Shavrin, who also bears the title of Hero of Russia, warmly spoke about Andrei.  He noted such qualities of Turkin as sociability, housekeeping and reliability.  The sociable and generous Andrey always gathered around himself many friends who sincerely loved him.  He was thoroughly interested in other people's problems, always trying to help.  Turkin was ready to risk his life for the sake of others, once he carried a comrade in his arms who was blown up in a minefield. </p><p>  Over the years, he received the Order of Merit for the Fatherland, 2nd degree.  Also, Andrei Turkin, whose biography is described in this article, was presented to the <span>Order of Courage,</span> but did not manage to receive it during his lifetime.  After his death, there remained a mother, wife and two sons.  The youngest was born just 5 months after his father completed the earthly journey and was named after him. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="biography of Turkin Andrey Alekseevich" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40013/1487056.jpg" width="450"></div></h2><h2>  Tragic day </h2><p>  Terrorists held hostages for several days, including children.  The fact that they were not going to release them became clear on September 3, when the militants opened fierce fire on those people who tried to escape through the destroyed walls of the gym where they were being held.  Then it was decided to start the assault.  Several of our servicemen were sent to cover the evacuation of the hostages.  Among them was Andrei Turkin.  However, distraught with horror people, among whom were wounded, fenced him off with a partner from a general group of special forces.  The lieutenant and his comrade were already injured, but continued to participate in the assault.  Moving under a hail of shots, they headed for the dining room, where the terrorists held the remaining hostages.  Having destroyed one militant, Andrei Turkin noticed that the other threw a grenade right at a crowd of people.  He not only covered her with his body, but also managed to restrain the terrorist, dying with him.  Thanks to these actions, it was possible to save many lives, including children. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Andrey Turkin photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40013/1487063.jpg" width="384"></div></h2><h2>  After death </h2><p>  Such a feat, of course, did not go unnoticed.  By his Decree of September 6, 2004, the President awarded Andrei Turkin the title of Hero of the Russian Federation.  He was also posthumously awarded the Suvorov Medal and the Order for Courage.  Andrei Turkin was buried, as well as other dead Special Forces soldiers from Vympel, at the Nikolo-Arkhangelskoye cemetery in Moscow. </p><p>  The memory of the hero is honored in his native land in Orsk.  In the Heroes' Square on the Walk of Fame, his bust was installed.  Also, the <span>class of cadet</span> school No. 53 in Orsk bears his name, as well as secondary school No. 1 in the <span>village of Dinskaya,</span> Krasnodar Territory, and a <span>memorial plaque is</span> installed in front of the entrance to the building of this educational institution <span>.</span>  The same board is also on the building of the Academy of Marketing in Krasnodar, where Turkin studied. </p>

    <h2>  Everlasting memory </h2><p>  His border cot is still standing in the border Argun detachment.  He is still listed in the detachment, and his name is pronounced upon entering the service.  Andrei also has his own stand at the Beslan Heroes Museum at the Moscow Education Center.  Interestingly, this center does not present photographs of the heroes who died in Beslan, but their portraits, painted by a volunteer artist.  Schoolchildren and youth visit this place during the ‚ÄúLessons of Courage‚Äù to honor the memory of courageous warriors who sacrificed their lives to save others.  Among them is Andrei Turkin.  Many have tears in their eyes as they stand in front of his stand. </p><p>  The biography described in this article makes one think a lot.  Turkin Andrei Alekseevich will never be forgotten, as well as his courageous act. </p>
