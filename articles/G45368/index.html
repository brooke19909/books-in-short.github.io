As soon as it became possible to travel the world, contemplate the beautiful and enjoy the excellent service, the Russians took advantage of it.  More and more lovers of beach vacations can be seen in Turkey, Tunisia, some enjoy exotic in India and Thailand.  But far from always an expensive vacation can afford the Russians.  Moreover, some cannot leave the country or cannot draw up the necessary documents.  But this is not a reason to deny yourself a vacation.  In Russia, there are many resorts both on the Azov and the Black and Caspian Sea, but many have simply forgotten about them.  Indeed, up to a certain point, the tourism industry in our country did not develop, all that could be obtained from leisure was the sun, sea and beach.  Currently, the situation has changed radically: resort towns and resort areas are being actively built up, many excellent hotels are appearing, service is being improved, infrastructure is being developed, beaches are being equipped - all this creates excellent conditions for relaxing in the country.  Tourists do not need to issue a passport, and due to the advantageous offers of airlines and tour operators, they manage to save on their sea voyages.  All lovers of beach holidays, especially families with young children, will like to relax in Anapa.  It is here that we propose to go. </p>
