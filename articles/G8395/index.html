  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Nokia 2710: specifications, description and photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The gadget Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition can be called the first phone from the budget segment, which received the navigation services of the Nokia brand.  That is, this model can be used as a GPS navigator. </p><p>  For motorists, the form factor of the gadget and its characteristics may not be the best, but for pedestrians this is a very good option.  Moreover, the fashion for high-quality button devices comes back almost every year.  But first things first. </p><p>  So, we present to your attention a review of the Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition.  Consider the remarkable characteristics of the device, its advantages and disadvantages, as well as the appropriateness of the purchase.  Despite the venerable age for such a technique, the model can still be found on sale. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The Nokia 2710 received the classic candy bar form factor.  With dimensions of 111.2 x 45.7 x 13.7 mm, the model weighs 87 grams.  There are no complaints about the quality of materials and assembly.  Good plastic is designed for long hiking trips and appropriate handling. </p><div class="photo" data-original="imei24.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 2710 navigation" class="if uuid-3150567" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3150567.jpg"></div><p>  Naturally, extreme life is not for him, and Nokia 2710 will not stand serious falls or immersion in water.  But you can definitely not worry about scratches.  Due to its small dimensions, the model can be called ergonomic.  It is comfortably located both in the hands and in pockets or on the belt. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As for the colors of Nokia 2710, on the Russian market of mobile technology you can find models only in silver and black.  The device in more ‚Äúfun‚Äù colors is sold on foreign sites, but in this case you will have to tinker with localization, as well as with firmware. </p><h2>  Interfaces </h2><p>  On the right side of the Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition is a button to activate the camera.  On the left side is a slot for an external micro-SD format drive, as well as a micro-USB interface.  The latter is protected by a rubber plug. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gsmarena.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 2710 navigation edition" class="if uuid-3150568" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3150568.jpg"></div><p>  At the top end you can see the 3.5 mm mini-jack audio jack for connecting a headset, a 2-mm output for charging, and also an ear hook for fixing the strap.  On the back there is a camera eye and a speakerphone. </p><h2>  Keyboard </h2><p>  The working area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Nokia 2710 is made of plastic with horizontal and vertical separation.  The keys are large, it‚Äôs convenient to work with them.  Symbols also cannot be called small.  On the outstretched arm they are clearly distinguishable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mobilenet.cz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 2710 phone" class="if uuid-3150571" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3150571.jpg"></div><p>  Adds ergonomics and sensible illumination of the working area.  It is evenly located on all the keys, so it‚Äôs comfortable to work with the phone even in the dark.  There is also a special button on the front panel to enable navigation mode, which is very convenient. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Nokia 2710 has a screen size of 2.2 inches.  The TFT-matrix with a scan of 320 by 240 pixels can not offer much, but copes with visualization quite adequately.  It is also worth noting that the screen does not fade in direct sunlight due to the mirror substrate.  Of course, in the shade the information is visible much better, but even in a clean field everything is well read. </p><p>  The screen displays the battery charge level, current time and date, as well as the quality of communication in five ‚Äústicks‚Äù.  Additionally, you can configure the display of the icons of the selected programs for quick launch, the appearance of reminders, notes, etc. </p><h2>  Hardware and software </h2><p>  The phone runs on the S40 platform.  Judging by user reviews, the software behaves quite adequately - it works stably without failures, lags and brakes.  The platform is quite old, so the company had a lot of time to fix all the shortcomings.  Which they, in fact, did. </p><p>  If necessary, you can update the firmware using the proprietary software Nokia Software Updater.  It is better to download it from the official site of Nokia.  It is also possible to receive updates "over the air" using the FOTA function. </p><p>  The phone received 64 MB of RAM and 128 MB of internal memory.  Internal storage can be increased with external SD cards up to 32 GB.  There is enough RAM for both the trouble-free operation of the interface and for launching gaming applications.  The latter, with an eye on the platform, are not demanding on system resources, so they do not lag and do not slow down. </p><h2>  Navigation </h2><p>  The phone has a built-in GPS module of class A, which involves faster navigation and good detail.  In the list of regular software you can find pre-installed Nokia Maps version 2 or 3. They can be updated, but it‚Äôs best to immediately download competing counterparts with an eye to Russian realities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gsmarena.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 2710 navigation edition phone" class="if uuid-3150570" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3150570.jpg"></div><p>  There are no questions to navigation.  The phone is not in vain called Navigation Edition, it works out to the fullest.  The GPS module responds quickly and is not buggy for nothing. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The device received a modest camera with a resolution of 2 megapixels.  Autofocus, flash, and other elements associated with high-quality shooting are not here.  Pictures at the output are more or less normal, but subject to good lighting.  In the dark, and in bad weather conditions, photos are full of artifacts, "snow" and other shortcomings. </p><p>  Images can be saved both to the phone‚Äôs memory and to external media in JPEG format.  The settings for the camera can be adjusted using the classic interface for Nokia push-button models: white balance, timer, burst shooting, etc. </p><p>  The video sequence for quality is obtained by similar photographs.  In the daytime and in good weather, the videos are normal, but in other cases - frankly bad.  So it is better for lovers of high-quality shooting to go past this unit and look at the more expensive models of the brand. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The phone is equipped with a standard battery for such gadgets BL-5C class with a capacity of 1020 mAh.  The local set of chipsets cannot be called powerful, and yet the device boasts quite decent battery life. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.clickup.gr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 2710 battery" class="if uuid-3150569" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3150569.jpg"></div><p>  In continuous navigation mode, the battery lasts a little more than 6 hours.  Continuous talk will drain the battery in 12-13 hours.  And in standby mode, the device will last almost 500 hours.  Judging by the reviews, most users have enough charge for 2-3 days.  For the most active, the battery discharges per day. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  The model turned out to be quite competitive.  As a phone, the gadget showed itself exclusively from the positive side: stable communication, good subscriber audibility, responsive interface and a decent level of autonomy. </p><p>  As a navigator, the device is also not bad, but only for pedestrians - tourists and travelers.  As a car gadget, it is not so good, but all because of the lack of touch control and a small screen diagonal.  So lovers of rare ‚Äúpush buttons‚Äù can safely recommend this phone. </p>
