    <h2>  Technology History </h2><p>  The Intellowasher and Fuzzy Logic technologies in the washing machine are different names for the same ‚Äúbrain‚Äù control system of the mechanism, which is owned by Whirlpool. </p><p>  But regardless of the brand of the washing device and how its control system is called, the <span>quintessence of this</span> control technology is reduced to the concept of ‚Äúfuzzy logic‚Äù.  It was presented by experts in the 60s of the twentieth century in America and was intended for use in programming on the basis of human thinking. </p><p>  Fuzzy Logic generates transitional values ‚Äã‚Äãbetween constant estimates, such as "short - long", "soft - hard", "cold - hot" and others.  This property gave impetus to the beginning of its use as the main principle of controlling household appliances, such as washing, dishwashers and other devices. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Fuzzy logic functions what is it" class="if" height="312" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40889/1166060.jpg" width="600"></div>

The system of built-in sensors and sensors, thanks to which the volume of linen, the level of pollution of things, water hardness and many other initial parameters are estimated.  These sensors send information to the microprocessor, which, on the basis of the data received, sets the device to a program that takes into account the duration of the wash, the degree of heating, the flow rate of the powder, the amount of water rinsed, the spin power, and the operating mode as a whole. </p><p>  Fuzzy Logic in the washing machine is a system of built-in sensors that will analyze the level of soiling of the laundry, and the microprocessor of the device will calculate the duration of the wash.  In addition to the level of contamination, touch sensors will help establish the nature of the contamination, the composition of the fabric and the hardness of the water in order to choose the optimal, <span>gentle</span> operation. </p><p>  We can say that the technology fully controls the washing machine using several initial parameters.  In combination, they make it possible to operate with hundreds of mode options (!), This is a different automatic machine with Fuzzy Logic from a simple automatic device.  And between it and the model a semiautomatic device <span>(low-</span> class <span>washing machine</span> ) runs through the abyss. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine control" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40889/1166061.jpg" width="600"></div>

For example, during the preparation of the dough, an experienced hostess will never immediately take the amount of flour exactly according to the recipe, because she perfectly understands that the optimal amount depends on many circumstances.  A woman will take as much product as needed to get the desired density of the dough, adding flour several times during the batch, if necessary, to achieve the best result.  The same principle is at the forefront of the Fuzzy Logic function.  What is it then, if not female logic? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machines specialist reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40889/1166062.jpg" width="600"></div>

Important to consider </h2><p>  The main danger for equipment with Fuzzy Logic mode is power surges.  In our country, it often varies from 160 to 280 volts.  Such ‚Äújumps‚Äù have an extremely negative effect on the electronic ‚Äúbrains‚Äù of the mechanism and have sad consequences.  The machine starts to fail, for example, skips the spin time or ignores the rinse mode.  Such failures, when the washing machine modes are violated, will inevitably lead to damage, which can only be fixed by a master specialist.  To avoid difficulties, it is necessary to connect the machine to the network using a stabilizer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="semiautomatic washing machine" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40889/1166100.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Consumer Reviews </h2><p>  For washing machines equipped with the Fuzzy Logic intelligent mode, users rated it very highly.  Previously, manufacturing companies tried to add as many modes to devices as possible.  Buyers appreciated this and chose such models, but only, as a rule, they rarely used all the offered functionality.  Now the necessary mode carefully selects artificial intelligence.  Thanks to this, even the previously demanded function of half loading the drum has lost its relevance.  Semi-automatic (washing machine) was previously considered more practical than fully automated models, but now it can win positions only in the price category.  Buyers like the new models: </p><ul><li>  convenience and ease of operation; </li><li>  saving water and energy; </li><li>  washing speed; </li><li>  the ability to stop the program by pausing it and, if necessary, add linen and change the mode. </li></ul><p>  It is worth mentioning that the presence of Fuzzy Logic technology in the washing machine is not always a guarantee that absolutely every consumer will be satisfied with the work of his household assistant.  On intelligent machines, one can find the following claims from the owners: </p><ul><li>  sophisticated electronic control technology cannot be durable; </li><li>  Frequent adjustment of the mode during washing changes the time of the device‚Äôs shutdown and is confusing. </li></ul><p>  Basically, users focus on the positive aspects of the work of machines with this function.  People who have been using this technique for a long time at home claim that it would be difficult for them to abandon the smart device.  They compare a washing machine without Fuzzy Logic mode with a refrigerator without automatic defrosting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Fuzzy logic system" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40889/1166063.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The system guarantees impeccable quality of washing and rinsing, as well as simplicity and comfort during operation.  The price of a washing machine equipped with such a system is, of course, much higher than the cost of conventional washing machines.  Meanwhile, the difference in price pays off after some time due to the practical and economical process of operation of a household device.  The technology is a winning alternative to conventional washing machines equipped with a half-load program.  It makes it possible to wash a small amount of things without unnecessary expenses, saving literally on everything.  Based on this, it can be argued that it is especially important to make sure that you have an automatic weighing program for the selected model before buying.  Without it, there simply cannot be a Fuzzy Logic system, and all assurances of the opposite are nothing more than a marketing ploy of unscrupulous sellers. </p>
