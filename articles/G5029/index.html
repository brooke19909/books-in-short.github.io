    <p>  I am glad that the staff is at least a little, but speaks Russian.  Settlement takes place at any time of the day.  After filling out the questionnaire at the reception, they give out keys and a power card.  A porter can bring suitcases for small tips.  The rooms must be checked immediately, as some malfunctions may be present, for example, the air conditioner does not work.  If desired, the number can be changed, which happens very quickly.  Problems with equipment are also resolved in the blink of an eye, repairmen quickly fix malfunctions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The rooms are not very large, old but clean.  There are several beds, bedside tables, banquets, a mirror, a table, a wardrobe and a bathroom with a toilet, washbasin and bathtub.  The furniture is new, but everything is working properly.  The sewer system is poorly adjusted, the water from the sink and the bath takes too long.  The room does not have a refrigerator, safe and TV.  There may be problems with outlets, for the entire number of them there are only a few pieces.  They are located too high.  It is better to bring an extension cord and a tee with you. </p><p>  Hot and cold water is supplied without interruption.  Drinking water is provided free of charge at the bar opposite the property.  Balconies of rooms of the category "standard" overlook the water park, a neighboring hotel and the sea.  Of the minuses, it is worth noting the poor soundproofing in the rooms.  It seems that the doors are completely absent. </p><h2>  About location </h2><p>  According to tourists, the Sahara Beach Hotel is not the best location for shopping.  For shopping, you must go either to Monastir or to Sousse. </p><p>  The complex consists of three buildings.  The hotel is old, but apparently it is well disguised.  The area is clean and well maintained.  Around everything is buried in verdure, many flowers, trees and other shrubs grow.  A pleasant aroma is felt in the air. </p><p>  Although the complex has many elevators, queues may occur.  The restaurant is located on the ground floor.  There are also shops with clothes, beach accessories, jewelry, leather goods, spices and toys.  Sometimes locals bring sweets.  Sellers understand what customers say in Russian without any problems.  Prices are a bit overpriced compared to the stores of Sousse and Monastir. </p><h2>  Room Service </h2><p>  They try to clean the rooms when the guests are not there.  It can be at any time of the day.  Towels are changed regularly, but their quality lags behind.  For little money, cleaners can twirl the towels and shower the beds with flower petals. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  The staff is very nice, friendly and friendly, especially everyone is trying for small tips, which, by the way, must always be left.  In the restaurant you can enjoy delicious fruits for free, which are then sold at the hotel chilled and already for the money. </p><p>  The hotel is mainly inhabited by Arabs, fewer French, British and Germans.  There are also enough Russians.  Arabs create a lot of noise, the French, especially young people, behave very indecently.  You can hear provocative laughter and loud screams. </p><p>  The internet catches relatively well.  You can communicate in social networks and check mail. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The food at the Sahara Beach 3 * hotel (Tunisia, Monastir) is very good.  The food is tasty and varied.  Guests are offered dishes of meat, fish, all kinds of salads, eggs in various variations, cakes, yogurts, nuts.  Of the drinks - cappuccino, coffee, tea, hot chocolate.  Assorted juices, soft drinks and alcoholic drinks.  From fruits, oranges, apples, watermelons and melons.  During the day, you can take delicious ice cream from the refrigerators. </p><p>  Upon check-in, a restaurant card is issued.  The first time it must be presented to the manager, who will fix the table and the waiter for you for the entire period of rest.  For breakfast - self-catering.  For lunch and dinner, the waiter serves drinks. </p><p>  The restaurant itself is huge.  Guests of all buildings eat there.  The restaurant itself is clean, but there is always something to complain about.  But the food is good.  The food is varied, drinks are diluted within normal limits. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2>

    <p>  The beach is very large, but rarely cleaned.  Cigarette butts and other rubbish are common.  The sea is warm, sometimes there are waves.  But during a storm, seaweed and jellyfish can be nailed to the shore, which can even sting.  In this case, you can go to a restaurant on the coast.  You will be given some remedy that can treat burns. </p><h2>  Spa treatments </h2><p>  Not all connoisseurs of bath procedures are delighted with the services offered at the Sahara Beach 3 * hotel (Skanes).  The hammam is represented by a steam room, shower and a simple massage, which makes the Arab woman.  Everything does not look very professional.  But for those who have never encountered such procedures, it may seem that everything is fine.  Advanced travelers are not advised to spend money on this. </p><h2>  Pools </h2>

    <p>  The hotel Sahara Beach 3 * (Tunisia) has 4 pools.  The largest is equipped with waterfalls that include at noon.  The central pool is the deepest.  Animation programs are always held here.  The heated pool is located in the spa area.  Another one near the bar.  All pools are highly chlorinated.  The smell is almost the whole hotel.  Many bleach cough. </p><h2>  Aquapark </h2><p>  There is a water park on site.  Almost always, it is packed with noisy Arabs with naughty children.  The design of the water park itself does not inspire confidence, everything is very fragile.  But you can have fun here.  Children have fun. </p><h2>  Animation </h2>

    <p>  Entertainment at the Sahara Beach 3 * hotel (Tunisia) is excellent.  Animators give performances, hold games and all kinds of competitions near the central pool.  The hotel has its own theater, which offers various performances in the evenings.  For children, the same programs are carried out every day. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Sousse is a 40-minute drive away.  Bus stop right outside the hotel.  The city itself is not very clean, but there is something to see here.  You can go shopping at local stores.  Prices for silver and leather products are quite low.  In the central supermarket you can find anything. </p><p>  Also nearby is the town of Monastir.  The resort center is spacious and beautiful.  The city itself is clean and well maintained.  But the local market is better not to visit.  Stench and dirt reigns there.  Although here you can buy jewelry almost for nothing. </p><p>  Especially tourists are advised to go on an excursion to the Sahara for a few days.  A ride is offered right at the hotel.  You can really spend time with benefit and learn a lot.  In two days you will see almost all the sights of Tunisia.  The tour includes visits to the amphitheater, monasteries, homes of ancient settlements, camel riding, meeting dawn in the desert, spending the night in another hotel, visiting an oasis where the film "English Patient" was shot.  After such a journey, fatigue catches up, but his impressions exceed all expectations. </p><p>  Hotel Sahara Beach 3 *, Tunisia is definitely suitable for relaxing without frills.  Reviews of tourists confirm this. </p><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  The hotel deserves its stars.  It is located on a well-groomed territory, surrounded by lush fragrant vegetation.  The complex is old, but this does not prevent it from pleasing many vacationers year after year.  It is deliciously served with a variety of dishes.  The work of all staff deserves respect.  The rooms have everything you need.  The hotel has several pools, a spa area and even its own mini-water park.  You can safely go here with young children.  Local tour operators offer sightseeing tours for a small fee.  You should definitely visit local attractions and go shopping. </p><p>  The hotel even has its own stable where you can go and feed the animals.  But the main plus is nutrition.  It is rare that in hotels three stars are so tasty and varied fed.  The cooks here deserve special praise. </p><p>  Of the minor drawbacks, one can note a not-so-clean beach area (although they clean it every morning), poor soundproofing in the rooms, lack of a refrigerator in the apartments and a not very solid water park design.  Nevertheless, here you can have a great time with the whole family.  It is better to book a tour at the Sahara Beach 3 * hotel (Tunisia).  The price for a room here starts at 6,000 rubles.  If you arrange a trip through a tour operator, it will be somewhat cheaper.  But excursions are best purchased locally.  In addition, local residents can tell what to see and where to go first.  And the cost will be significantly different.  The hotel has a tour desk. </p>
