    <p>  The attraction of the holiday home is the PADI Equator-Katran-K diving center, which provides training in diving.  As a result, an international PADI certificate is issued, which will confirm the qualifications received.  The focus of the course is on diving safety.  A tourist who has taken a course in a diving center can already be considered a scuba diver who knows how to dive under water.  He is able to adequately assess the situation during the dive, knows how to breathe correctly, raise various objects from the bottom, correctly carry out ascent. </p><p>  The diving center provides rental and sale of equipment for scuba diving, refueling cylinders and repairing equipment.  For students, test dives and underwater excursions are organized with inspection of sunken ships and grottoes.  Those who wish can take a boat trip and take part in sea fishing.  Reviews about the rest house "Equator" (Olenevka), below, will tell about all its advantages and disadvantages. </p><h2>  Guest Comments </h2><p>  Without exception, all vacationers who have visited the guest house note the availability of the widest opportunities for diving and water sports.  According to some tourists, the entertainment industry in the village of Olenevka (Crimea) and directly in the rest house "Equator" is underdeveloped.  In addition to diving, here you can still ride a scooter. </p><h2>  Positive sides </h2><p>  The guests also note the beautiful, untouched by human activity nature.  But the main advantage of the guest house "Equator" (Olenevka) is the beach. </p>

    <p>  Some vacationers rate it as the best on the entire Crimean peninsula.  As an advantage, guests of the holiday home note the proximity of the beach to the hotel.  It is only ten minutes walk to the sea.  There is a lack of a large number of tourists, which will appeal to lovers of secluded relaxation and silence. </p><p>  Many guests like the well-maintained, paved with paving stones, cozy territory of the holiday home.  In their reviews, guests note an abundance of flowers and vineyards.  However, some complain about the lack of shade on hot days. </p><p>  As a positive point, the presence of playgrounds on the territory is noted.  They are open-air disco and games with small guests. </p><p>  Many reviews speak of competent catering of guests and excellent quality of food prepared in the restaurant and dining room.  Tourists write that the food served in the cafe is very tasty, and the menu is diverse.  At the same time, according to some guests, the prices are somewhat overpriced. </p><h2>  Minuses </h2><p>  Reviews about the boarding house "Equator" are not always positive.  There are those in which vacationers write about the insufficiently modern design of rooms and furniture.  Some reviews say that air conditioners can not cope in hot weather.  However, this drawback indicates to a greater extent that modern technology is not designed to work in hot climates. </p><p>  Many tourists are not happy with the frequency of housekeeping and linen changes.  In one of the reviews, the client complained that one of the nights he had to face the presence of bugs in the room.  These circumstances, according to many vacationers, indicate that the hotel administration does not sufficiently control the staff working in the buildings.  At the same time, as a rule, there are no complaints about the quality of guest service by the employees of the dining room and restaurant.  The reviews often expressed wishes for the administration of the holiday home to tighten control over the work of the staff and more carefully carry out the processing of bed linen. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2>

    <p>  Despite the presence of some negative reviews, most tourists generally give a positive assessment to the quality of service and organization of leisure in the rest house "Equator".  Almost all the disadvantages are more than compensated by the excellent climate, the presence of a beautiful beach and clean sea water, which allows you to have a wonderful time and relax with health benefits.  Children here will also be interested.  Parents can not worry about the leisure of their children.  The coastal zone is wonderfully equipped to stay with young children. </p><p>  And for diving enthusiasts, according to most guests, it is better not to find a place on the entire peninsula.  Having your own diving training center adds a huge plus to the other benefits of this placement. </p><p>  Staying at the Equator Holiday Home is an excellent option for spending leisure time in the Crimea. </p>
