  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We build it ourselves: pouring the foundation with our own hands</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In order to build a house with your own hands is not enough just working hands and high industriousness, you need to be disciplined and have golden hands, because everything, starting from digging trenches, requires strength, experience and knowledge of the process, and it costs a lot! It is justified by the fact that all of its technology will have to be supervised by itself, to be sure that excellent waterproofing of the base of the house is ensured, and therefore its durability. </p><p>  An indispensable condition that must be observed when the foundation is started is the timing, by the way, very tight.  The first, even minor precipitation, will make the soil soft, loose and will have to be compacted, remove water.  After trenches have been dug to the depth of freezing, the axils of the foundations are filled with soil, and 20-30 cm pillow of crushed stone or sand is laid out, and then tamped, in private housing, as a rule, this kind of foundation is used as a tape.  This is one of the most time-consuming and expensive ways, but on it it is possible, firstly, to save considerable money, and secondly, to erect a building of any severity on any soil, even with columns, with <span>basement floors,</span> underground garages and basements. </p><p>  Before the time comes for the final chord - pouring the foundation with your own hands, you need to solve the following problems: -Calculate how much concrete will be needed, and which one - it is desirable that it be factory, balanced and of a uniform consistency, rather liquid, like sour cream;  -obtain a deep vibrator, which will be required for ramming the solution, of course, this work can also be done with a shovel, chopper or armature.  After that, the formwork is thoroughly tapped along the entire contour.  This stage of work requires great care, otherwise the foundation will begin to collapse after the first wintering. Filling the strip foundation in case there are no additional upper stiffeners is not done at first - leave a couple, a little more, centimeters to the formwork, and if there is, then leave on day to cool, remove the ribs, add the solution and smooth the surface with a trowel.  After pouring the foundation is almost completely ready, do ironing.  This procedure is as follows: even wet concrete is sprinkled with an even layer of dry, sifted, cement powder.  As a result of ironing, the foundation is stronger, sets faster. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Then they watch how the concrete dries: in hot weather, so as not to crack, the foundation is periodically moistened, and in rainy - it is covered to provide normal conditions for setting the foundation for one week.  When the foundation is completely ready, it remains only to process it, and then, after all these rules are followed, you can safely proceed to the construction of walls.  Pouring the foundation with your own hands does not end there.  Recent work related to the removal of formwork.  Determining when the time has come for this is simple - cracks are found between the foundation and the formwork, and the boards that covered the foundation have moved away from the surface.  From the foundation fence, all the fasteners, struts, props that were used to fix the shape of the strip foundation are listened to, and the formwork is tapped with a hammer.  Then they take it out if the boards give in somewhere with difficulty, carefully help themselves with a shovel or other tool, since the foundation is still damp. The foundation pouring with your own hands is considered complete and completely when the foundation is freed from formwork boards and defects. </p><p>  Subsequently, during the week, the foundation is moistened daily with cold water to help it gain strength and eliminate moisture loss.  It is worth noting that such a process as pouring the foundation with your own hands with a certain skill is not so difficult, but in the end giving a significant <span>economic effect.</span> </p>
