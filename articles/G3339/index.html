  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Old Town in Prague: history, sights, reviews of tourists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the original European cities is Prague.  In the Old Town, the historical center of the Czech capital, the main attractions of the country are concentrated.  There are many tourists here at any time of the year.  Unusual small buildings, fabulous narrow streets, museums that display unique exhibits - all this is about the old district of Prague, the Old Town. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.praga-praha.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="old town prague" class="if uuid-2533204" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2533204.jpg"></div><h2>  History </h2><p>  Once upon a time there were small settlements on the territory of the historical center.  Over time, they merged into a major trading center.  Stare Mesto (in Prague this is the name of the historic district in which famous Czech sights are concentrated) is located on the opposite bank of Prague Castle, in a lowland.  In 1118, a flood occurred that claimed most of the houses, and forty years later the Juditin Bridge was built, which connected the old part of Prague with the new one. </p><p>  Sights of the Old Town of Prague: </p><ul><li>  Old Town Square. </li><li>  Old Town Hall. </li><li>  Powder gate. </li><li>  Public house. </li><li>  Tyn Church. </li><li>  Church of St. Nicholas. </li><li>  Dancing House. </li><li>  Bethlehem Chapel. </li><li>  Staron synagogue. </li></ul><p>  The symbol of the Czech capital is Charles Bridge.  The first stone structure in its place was built in honor of Queen Judith.  However, this bridge was destroyed by the flood of 1342.  The Czechs built a new one, which today belongs to the main attractions of Prague.  Charles Bridge, whose history is closely connected with the history of the city, is more than six hundred years old.  On both sides it is fortified with towers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="dailygeekshow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The Charles Bridge" class="if uuid-2533244" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2533244.jpg"></div><p>  At the base of the pylon you can see the remains of the former fortification, which was replaced by order of the king with a new stone structure - Charles Bridge.  The history of Prague includes many tragic events - bloody battles, fires, and floods took place here.  But the bridge stood.  Apparently, the whole thing is the magic of numbers.  Choosing the time to begin construction, Charles IV consulted with astrologers.  They long calculated something, analyzed and came to the conclusion: the first stone must be laid on July 9, 1357, at 5:31 a.m. </p><h2>  Old Town Square </h2><p>  This Prague landmark dates back to the 12th century.  It occupies about 15 thousand meters. The area is surrounded by buildings of various styles.  But in the 12th century, of course, there was nothing of the kind here.  At that time, the square was a large and noisy market. </p><p>  The landmark got its modern name at the end of the 19th century.  Various festive events were held here, both joyful and sad.  In the 15th century, a Hussite hetman was executed on this square.  After 200 years, participants in the Stavovsky resistance died here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Old Town Square" class="if uuid-2533216" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2533216.jpg"></div><h2>  Old Town Hall </h2><p>  In the XIV century, the self-government of the Old City was located here.  The Gothic tower dates back to the second half of the 14th century.  On the chimes every hour, from nine to eleven in the evening, 12 apostles appear.  The Granovsky Palace is an architectural complex - a building in the Renaissance style with wall murals, arcade loggias, graffiti on biblical and ancient Greek themes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Powder Gate </h2><p>  The Gothic architecture monument is located on <span>Republic Square,</span> near the Public House, which is connected by a covered bridge.  Powder Gate was built at the end of the 15th century.  It was planned to build another 12 entrances to the Stara Mesto.  But this project could not be implemented. </p><p>  The gate has a rich finish, but they remained unfinished.  For some time, the building served as a warehouse of gunpowder, hence the name.  The gates were badly damaged during the siege of the city by the Prussian troops, restored in the XIX century. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vyletnik.cz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="powder gate" class="if uuid-2533225" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2533225.jpg"></div><h2>  Public house </h2><p>  This is a relatively new building.  Built at the beginning of the 20th century and is an example of craft and art.  Earlier on the site of the Public House in Prague was the royal palace, which served as the residence of Czech rulers in the XIV-XV centuries.  Concerts are often held here, including events during the Prague Spring festival.  The main hall of the Public House is named after the Czech composer Bed≈ôich Smetana.  The museum dedicated to the musician‚Äôs work is located in the building of the former water station. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pingallery.deviantart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="public house prague" class="if uuid-2533228" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2533228.jpg"></div><h2>  Tyn Church </h2><p>  This impressive Gothic building is the main attraction of the Old Town Square.  The temple was built in the 16th century.  At the end of the 17th century, restoration was carried out, after which baroque elements appeared in the architectural appearance. </p><p>  The cathedral houses a gallery of works in the Renaissance style, Gothic art and rare altar paintings by K. ≈†kreta, one of the largest Czech artists of the Baroque era.  Here is the grave of astronomer Tycho Brahe.  The organ whose sounds can be heard in the cathedral is the oldest in the Czech capital.  You can visit this attraction on any day except Monday.  From Tuesday to Saturday, the temple is open from 10:00 to 13:00 and from 15:00 to 17:00.  On Sunday - from 10:30 to 12:00. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vyletnik.cz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tyn temple prague" class="if uuid-2533230" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2533230.jpg"></div><h2>  Church of St. Nicholas </h2><p>  The construction was erected in 1737.  Part of the building, the one closer to Paris Street, has recently undergone renovation.  A statue of St. Nicholas was installed in a niche.  The author of the temple project is K. Dintzenhofer.  The interior is decorated with the best works of a German architect. </p><h2>  House of the Black Mother of God </h2><p>  In 1912, a building was erected near the Powder Tower, designed by the architect Joseph Gochar, to complement the unique collection of Prague architecture.  The Cubist-style building is located in the very center of the Czech capital, between eletna Street and the Vegetable Market Square.  At the beginning of the 20th century, the house belonged to the merchant Frantisk Herbst.  Joseph Gochar is the first Czech to use cubism in architecture. </p><h2>  Bethlehem Chapel </h2><p>  Here the servant of the Czech Reformation Jan Hus read his sermons.  The chapel was founded in 1391.  After the Battle of White Mountain, the Bethlehem Chapel passed to the Jesuits.  In 1786 it was demolished, and in its place 60 years later a new building was erected, which retained the name of the former chapel.  The chapel seats up to three thousand people.  Since 1962, it is included in the list of national cultural monuments of the Czech Republic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cz.prague-stay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bethlehem chapel Prague" class="if uuid-2533233" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2533233.jpg"></div><h2>  Staron Synagogue </h2><p>  It is the oldest functioning synagogue in Europe.  It was called not Old, but Big until other synagogues appeared in the city.  There are several legends associated with this building.  The most famous one says: in the attic of the synagogue lies the body of the Golem, which in the years of World War II a Nazi agent tried in vain to destroy.  The attic of the synagogue, which holds many unsolved secrets, is closed to the public. </p><h2>  dancing House </h2><p>  This attraction is very popular among tourists, but refers to modern architecture.  The dancing house in Prague appeared in 1996.  The authors of the project are the famous architects Frank O. Gehry and V. Milunich.  The American dancers Fred Astaire and <span>Ginger Rogers</span> inspired them to create an unusual building <span>.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.seepraha.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dancing house in prague" class="if uuid-2533239" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2533239.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Many tourists claim that the <span>main attractions of Prague</span> can be bypassed in three days.  And it is not necessary to use the services of guides.  It is more pleasant to walk freely and leisurely along the winding streets of the Old Town of Prague, rather than relentlessly follow the guide.  In the center there are many cozy restaurants and cafes where you can enjoy a beautiful view from the window with a cup of coffee or a glass of Czech beer. </p>
