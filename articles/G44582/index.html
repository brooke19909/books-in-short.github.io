Some connect this process with the manufacture of baskets from vines, others with the creation of elegant necklaces from beads and other jewelry.  All this is so, since this type of creativity is expressed in the ability of the master from relatively soft raw materials to create hard objects and structures that can keep their shape.  In our article we will talk about several types of weaving and materials used for this kind of art. </p><h2>  What is weaving? </h2><p>  In ancient times, such a craft as twisting was the manufacture of fishing nets, bags, ropes and screens to distinguish between living space.  Initially, untreated plant stems were used for these purposes, a little later more elastic materials began to come into use - animal hair, jute, hemp and linen fibers.  Over time, this skill gained wide scope, resulting in many types of weaving.  Fans of creativity began to combine them with other technical methods: knitting knots, winding and all kinds of dressings of threads.  Thus, the so-called half-weave with elements of puncturing and binding. </p><p>  The development of art as a vitya led to branches such as lace, beadwork and macram√©.  The latter is used to decorate women's handbags, clothes, shoes.  Often, macrame elements are found in bracelets and jewelry. </p><p>  Currently, twisting elastic bands into a single unit is a separate branch of creative activity related to decorative and applied art.  From works of this kind it is expected that they will have an artistic effect and serve to decorate the interior and everyday life.  Accordingly, to expand multifaceted creativity, the assortment of necessary materials has been significantly expanded.  They can be very different both in quality and in value.  These include: leather stripes, fishing line, waxed cord, sisal, satin ribbons, wire, braid, <span>decorative rope,</span> paper and precious materials.  In the review below, you can get acquainted with the types of weaving chains and an interesting occupation - the manufacture of accessories from paper tubes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.icreativeideas.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Types of weaving, tubular weaving" class="if uuid-2467983" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53349/2467983.jpg"></div><h2>  Paper vine souvenirs </h2><p>  The newspaper vine is an original modern material from which you can create stylish accessories, for example, a frame for a photo, a box for documents or for small things.  Its peculiarity is that with a certain type of painting on finished objects, printed text is viewed.  Another option is also possible - you need to saturate the paper blanks with bright colors, and then your product will look very exclusive.  Basically, for the manufacture of baskets, flowerpots and caskets <span>from newspaper tubes, the types of weaving</span> used are the same as when working with vines.  Needlework by twisting is carried out in the following ways: </p><ul><li>  simple; </li><li>  twisting rows; </li><li>  layered; </li><li>  weaving in the technique of squares; </li><li>  twisting with a rope in several rods. </li></ul><h2>  Harvesting raw materials </h2><p>  To make it easier to decide on the choice of a particular type of weaving from a newspaper vine, you need to immediately make the necessary blanks.  When the inventory and a sufficient amount of material are at hand, you can proceed directly to the creation process: </p><ol><li>  If you settled on the decision to create an elegant element of decor, then a suitable option would be a newspaper or other thin paper.  Tapes from it are cut with a width of 8 to 12 cm. </li><li>  The length is measured out depending on the intended product.  It is inconvenient to work with long tubes, however, some craftswomen still recommend increasing their length to carry out large structures. </li><li>  The needle on which the strip will be wound must be positioned at an acute angle.  Then, as the paper is wound, it is accordingly rotated. </li><li>  The edges of the tube should be fixed with glue.  If it turned out to be too short, then the next workpiece is inserted into a wider opening and immediately fixed.  However, you will often have to perform this technique while working with the product, since it is not possible to calculate its size in advance. </li><li>  The final stage is painting the paper rod.  For this purpose, it is better to use acrylic paints or gouache.  On the finished product, it will be necessary to highlight some accents with the help of light shades.  Here you can use food colors or spray can with water-based paint. </li><li>  On finished products, it is necessary to apply a protective layer of varnish.  It is better to do this several times for reliability and decorative appearance. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="djirecords.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Types of weaving from newspaper blanks" class="if uuid-2467940" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53349/2467940.jpg"></div><h2>  The easiest way for beginners </h2><p>  Beginning needlewomen should consider the simplest option with elementary methods of weaving tubules.  The type of weaving is not the only criterion by which the subject of creative activity is evaluated.  We take for the sample a candy box connected in the easiest way.  If during work weave a multi-colored paper vine according to the intended pattern, you will get a good motley bowl for children.  Plain products can be decorated with decoupage napkins.  The picturesque coloring of the finished containers gives them weight and a rich look.  A jug-shaped configuration with a large original handle can be used as a pot for indoor plants.  Those wishing to master paper skills need to perform only a few sequential actions: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  We take a cardboard and cut out a round bottom.  Along the entire circumference, we arrange the vines so that they go a little on the base.  In this place they need to be fixed with glue. </li><li>  We cut out the same dense circle and glue it to the bottom.  The edges of newspaper strings should remain between them.  The first vines will serve as a frame for further weaving the remaining tubes. </li><li>  A working strip is attached to one of the main rods.  At the bottom, the capacity of the desired configuration is immediately set, which will need to be entwined. </li><li>  A working tube needs to be alternately wrapped around the wire rods.  The first is on the inside, the next is on the outside. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Types of weaving chains" class="if uuid-2467943" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53349/2467943.jpg"></div><h2>  Precious metal chains and bracelets </h2><p>  Depending on the process used for the manufacture of chains, the types of weaving are divided into machine, manual and stamped.  According to the quality and method of manufacturing the links they are divided into hollow and solid. </p><p>  Bound silver or gold ribbons obtained in an automated way are extremely thin (0.2 mm).  However, innovative equipment is not able to completely replace the hands of a professional in working with precious metals. </p><p>  Carrying out his <span>work, the jeweler</span> can use only small machines with compartments for links and posts.  Handwork involves only the production of originals that are not subject to replication.  Since this process is painstaking and time-consuming, it is also the most expensive. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The stamping method involves the manual connection of pre-made ringlets on special equipment.  Such work is inexpensive.  Stamped decorations are subject to deformation and, accordingly, are short-lived. </p><h2>  Product Types </h2><p>  Of the many variations, three main types of weaving are distinguished: anchor, shell and bismarck.  They served as an impetus for the development of new types of twisting of metal products (there are more than 50 of them in total).  They are the simplest and most ornate.  Master jewelers create intricate elements of silver and gold, then combine them into polysyllabic chains.  From here follow the types and names of <span>weaving chains.</span>  We suggest conducting a joint review of popular jewelry, in which, perhaps, you will find your own version. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Types of weaving chains" class="if uuid-2467779" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53349/2467779.jpg"></div><h2>  Anchor </h2><p>  A classic, very popular type of weaving gold chains that goes well with pendants and pendants.  Links are square, round or oval.  Regardless of their configuration, the weaving of chains in this technique is carried out according to the principle of perpendicular connection of each individual element.  The finished product resembles <span>an anchor chain</span> in shape <span>.</span>  Such ideas are a great solution for men, especially when they are made of large links.  Representatives of the stronger sex are attracted to these jewelry by their simplicity and reliability. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fashionbelief.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Types and names of weaving" class="if uuid-2467838" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53349/2467838.jpg"></div><p>  Consider the most common varieties of this weaving: </p><ul><li>  Sea anchor.  Each link in the chain is endowed with a jumper designed for reinforcement. </li><li>  Venetian.  Products created by this type are assembled from flattened, wide links, alternately connecting in opposite directions.  Individual fragments can be either rectangular or square. </li><li>  Belzer (roll).  The chain is made of smooth round rings. </li><li>  Cordoba.  An interesting idea, in which several links are combined in one fragment at once.  Between the assembled elements there are two single links.  The whole product has a twisted configuration. </li><li>  Garibaldi.  The type of weaving in which the elements are connected in pairs.  It is also classified as a double roll. </li><li>  Double sea anchor.  It is a simple chain made of oval double links. </li></ul><h2>  Shell </h2><p>  The most durable type of ligament in which the rings are attached in one direction.  Similar works are flat stripes polished on both sides with a wide variety of ornaments.  The product fits nicely on the neck, does not twist and has a chic sheen.  In the arsenal of jewelry made in this technique, there are elegant variations for women and massive, strong chains for men.  This is the most convenient technology used to weave bracelets.  The types and sizes of armored gold items are different, which allows you to choose the accessory to taste: </p><div class="photo" data-original="hotlife.en.alibaba.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Types of weaving bracelets" class="if uuid-2467806" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53349/2467806.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Rope.  In its form, the product resembles a tow made using the macrame technique.  Its peculiarity is that small rings along its entire length are very tight and merge into a single whole. </li><li>  Figaro (nona).  This type of weaving is interesting in that it can include several types of materials, for example, gold in three colors.  Another characteristic feature is the alternation of elements of different sizes. </li><li>  Love  Original performance, where the links are made in the shape of hearts.  An exquisite masterpiece of jewelry looks great on young women, because it has an element of romance. </li><li>  Snake (cobra).  Carapace method made of compressed links continuously assembled in one track.  In integral types of weaving, chains are most often hollow.  The decoration is more suitable for a business style of clothing. </li><li>  Snail.  The collecting elements in this method of twisting are curls imitating paper clips. </li></ul><h2>  Bismarck </h2><p>  Bismarck technology is distinguished by sophistication and complexity of work, which distinguishes it from other types of weaving.  Photos with jewelry samples can be viewed in the provided review.  The principle of linking the links is multifaceted and full of fantasies.  Due to the multidirectionality of the rings, such chains are reliable and are worn for a long time.  They are openwork and multi-row, often handmade. </p><div class="photo" data-original="goldlazer.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Types of weaving from newspaper tubes" class="if uuid-2467860" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53349/2467860.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Moscow.  A single fragment in the chain is a kind of springy spiral.  In the process, they are connected in two and placed under a press. </li><li>  Royal.  On the sides of the rings there are wound spirals made of thin precious material. </li><li>  Python.  Exquisite work performed with the participation of the master.  These are openwork products that can leave a lasting impression on beauty lovers. </li><li>  Triple.  The golden track is twisted by fastening elements consisting of three spiral twists. </li></ul><p>  When it comes to choosing the type of weaving in the bracelet, Bismarck is undoubtedly the leader here.  In addition to the fact that this method guarantees high quality, finished products are unusually beautiful.  Despite the fact that the jewelry collection has more male options, many women like this skillful twist.  For example, you can pay attention to the volumetric knitting of a rose.  It consists of parts in which the links are collected in a circle and create the impression of lush flowers. </p><p>  When choosing women's jewelry for the neck, it is necessary to take into account the thickness of the precious wire, otherwise the product will look rough. </p><div class="photo" data-original="russiangold.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Types of weaving from newspaper" class="if uuid-2467914" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53349/2467914.jpg"></div><h2>  How to choose a jewelry? </h2><p>  The sea anchor is a universal type of product, so it is suitable for everyone.  Carapace tracks are tender and light and are a wonderful option for the fair sex.  Bismarck - purely masculine massive jewelry, but there are variations for women. </p><p>  Any execution technique is suitable for a bracelet if it goes well with a pendant and a chain.  If you intend to wear it as an independent decoration, then it is better to give preference to the type of Bismarck or shell. </p><p>  You can create sets in which a medallion, chain and bracelet from different types of knitting.  The main thing is that they suit the color and thickness of the metal.  For example, massive armor-clad harmonizes with the Bismarck technique.  Figaro chain combines well with hand-made jewelry made on the basis of a rhombus. </p><p>  It is important to observe the principles of proportions in size, weight and color of jewelry wire.  A miniature pendant does not fit into massive weaving, just as a graceful chain cannot serve as the basis for large pendants. </p><p>  An important role is played by the length of the product.  In jewelry, short - 40 cm, medium - 50 cm and elongated - from 60 to 70 cm are distinguished. When choosing a jewelry, the type of appearance is necessarily taken into account.  The shortest items will look good on a long neck.  The average size is the most popular - when worn, the product is located in the upper neckline.  Men should opt for chains whose length is more than 50 cm. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  This is not to say that the names and types of weaving presented above are all that jewelers can offer.  Nevertheless, we hope that our review will help you orient yourself when you find yourself surrounded by beauty, representing the world of jewelry art. </p>
