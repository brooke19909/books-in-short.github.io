"Khorol", "Poltava", "Mirgorod", "Birch guy": photos and reviews of tourists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The city of Mirgorod is a regional administrative unit of the <span>Poltava region.</span>  Today it is a quiet and cozy village, located on the banks of the Khorol River.  The distance from Mirgorod to Poltava is 105 km, and to the capital of Ukraine - 250 km.  The city spreads over an area of ‚Äã‚Äã19 square kilometers.  About forty-one thousand people live in it. </p><h2>  The emergence of the resort </h2><p>  The history of the city is divided into two parts.  The first of them includes the period when mineral water sources were not yet discovered in Mirgorod.  The second period, when the city received the status of a resort, began in 1912. At that time, Mirgorod was a small settlement with about 8,000 inhabitants.  There was an acute problem with drinking water in the city, because all the wells were dry due to droughts. </p><p>  The local authorities saw a solution to a sore point in <span>drilling an artesian well.</span>  The work was done.  From a depth of 673 m a powerful fountain was hammered, the water of which was initially considered unsuitable for drinking.  This opinion was formed due to the salty taste of the liquid and its specific hydrogen sulfide smell.  It was even decided to fill the well, however, water was still supplied for the needs of the bathhouse and the fire yard.  This was a turning point in the life of the city.  Locals after bathing in the bath began to celebrate the amazing properties of this unusual water.  In people, the healing process accelerated, joint pain disappeared, and health improved.  Rumors of healing Mirgorod water began to spread far beyond the city.  As a result, doctors became interested in this source. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

He retired, being in the rank of major general.  Zubkovsky visited Mirgorod, and taking water samples, he sent them to several research laboratories.  The results convincingly proved the healing benefits of the source.

    <p>  Mirgorod water was assigned to the group of sodium chloride slightly mineralized.  In its healing qualities, this source was close to those located in such famous European resorts as Aachen, Soden and Baden-Baden.  That is why Mirgorod water was recognized as curative, and it was recommended not only for external use (in the form of bathtubs), but also for internal use. </p><h2>  Mirgorod during the years of Soviet rule </h2><p>  I.A. Zubkovsky is deservedly considered the founder of the resort.  Indeed, it was thanks to his perseverance and initiative in Mirgorod in 1917 that the hydropathic clinic was opened, which was the beginning of the first treatment season.  All subsequent years, the resort has developed and expanded.  In the 20s and 30s of the last century, a dormitory was built, a summer cottage, and attention was paid to the improvement of the territory.  To ensure uninterrupted supply of mineral water, two more wells were drilled. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  War and post-war periods </h2><p>  During the years of battles with fascist Germany, Mirgorod suffered tremendous damage.  However, already in 1943, immediately after the expulsion of the enemy from the city, the restoration of the resort began.  In 1944, a military hospital began work here.  Two years later, a sanatorium hospital with a capacity of 300 beds was opened in Mirgorod.  Disabled people of war were sent to this medical and rehabilitation institution.  Full restoration of the resort was completed by 1959. The further development of Mirgorod was resumed.  New medical and dormitory buildings were erected in the city, biochemical and clinical laboratories were opened, and a mud and water treatment clinic began its work. </p><h2>  Modern city life </h2><p>  Thanks to the discovery of the source of mineral water, Mirgorod from a provincial and unremarkable town turned into a world-famous resort.  The most modern medical and diagnostic base has been added to the natural sources of healing water and mud.  The sanatoriums have the latest medical equipment.  In addition, the popularity of the resort is supported by the use of modern techniques and the high professionalism of medical staff.  It is worth mentioning that the resort employs about 1,500 experienced specialists, including one hundred people with the title of Honored Doctor of Ukraine, 17 with the highest qualification category, 60 with the first.  The state of sanatoriums includes about two hundred nurses, ten of which are honored health workers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>
