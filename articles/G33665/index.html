  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Comfortable and warm hand clutch on a stroller</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A crumb has appeared in your family, and walking with a stroller in the fresh air has become your daily but enjoyable duty.  In the warm season, nothing bothers you.  You feel comfortable and ready to walk for hours.  And what to do in the winter, when even 30 minutes in the cold can create the impression that you are frozen to a stroller.  An excellent solution to the problem is the <span>hand clutch</span> on the stroller.  It will help you warm, protect against piercing winds and turn a walk with your baby into a pleasure. </p><p>  How to make such a thing necessary for every mommy?  Actually very simple.  You can choose the most suitable option for yourself.  The hand clutch on the stroller can be sewn from natural or artificial fur, raincoat fabric with a layer of synthetic winterizer or a down layer.  It is not so important how it will be insulated.  Your main task is to create the most comfortable conditions for your pens during winter walks. </p><p>  Even if sewing is not your thing.  You can still easily make such a desired item as a hand clutch on a stroller.  But your source material will be a cut of genuine leather with fur.  Cutting a rectangle with the dimensions of 45x40 centimeters from the back panel of the old and outdated sheepskin coat, you will get the finished main part.  Fold it in half, wrapping around the handle of the stroller, mark the location of the buttons or buttons on the sides. </p><p>  Only two buttons will be enough to fix the coupling on the handle and close your handles on the sides.  If putting buttons is a problem, sew on buttons.  The loops for them can simply be cut into the skin and overcast by hand or made from small pieces of elastic braid.  To do this, you need to pierce small holes with an awl in pre-marked places, thread a piece of elastic folded in half in them and tie a knot on the wrong side.  Are you afraid that the <span>rubber loop will</span> slip out?  Instead of a knot, make a few locking stitches. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The stroller clutch is almost ready.  It remains to connect the center so that it does not move down and tightly clasped your hands located on the handle of the stroller.  Using buttons for this purpose is the simplest and most reliable.  You can make welt loops and attach buttons, or sew a small strip of adhesive tape. </p><p>  A great accessory will be a hand clutch on a stroller made of <span>faux fur,</span> padding polyester and raincoat fabric.  A big plus of this model is its good breathability and heat dissipation, protection against moisture and ease of washing.  A wide <span>range of colors</span> will allow you to choose the right color for your stroller. </p><p>  <span>A simple pattern of a</span> hand clutch on a stroller is a rectangle with a size of 50x60 centimeters.  To save material, you can sew it in two parts.  In this case, it is enough to buy strips with a width of 30 centimeters. </p><p>  We cut out double parts with dimensions of 30x50 centimeters from fur, synthetic winterizer and raincoat fabric.  We sew them into single parts, folding the blanks with the front sides inward and laying a line at a distance of one centimeter from the cut. </p><p>  It is enough to lay a sintepon on top of each other, stepping aside just 1.5 centimeters and grind it, having previously laid a strip of paper on top and bottom.  This is done so that the synthetic winterizer fibers glide well over the surface of the sewing machine, do not get stuck and keep their shape.  After the seam is laid, simply tear off the paper. </p><p>  On parts of raincoat fabric, you will need to lay an additional finishing stitch.  To do this, we connect the parts with a seam, retreating one centimeter from the edge.  We turn off the allowance on either side and, stepping back from the junction 1-2 mm, sew along the front side of the part. </p><p>  Now we connect the synthetic winterizer with raincoat fabric.  Fold the parts, fix them with sewing needles and connect with several lines, laying them in random order.  After that, we fold the finished part with the fur blank face inward and connect it with a line, retreating one centimeter across all the slices.  Do not forget to leave a small open area.  We turn the clutch and straighten all the corners.  Using a needle, we straighten the fur from the connecting seams.  The open area is sewn by hand. </p><p>  Fold the finished base in half and outline the location of the buttons on the side slices and the middle.  We install them and enjoy using the finished clutch while walking with the baby. </p>
