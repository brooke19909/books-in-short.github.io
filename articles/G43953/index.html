And it is not necessary to run to the store and buy the trinkets there.  It is much nicer to make cute crafts yourself.  The Christmas angel that you lovingly made will be a wish for good and happiness to the person you give it to.  And do not think that you can not cope with such a task.  There are many ways to create a winged creature.  You can choose the one that you can do. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself christmas angel" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13542/336743.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <h2>  Paper and scissors </h2><p>  Perhaps making a paper craft is the simplest option.  Even a child can easily cope with this.  You just need to print the stencil and carefully cut the figure, and then hang it on a string. </p><p>  To make you have voluminous Christmas <span>angels, with your own hands,</span> draw a contour on a piece folded in half: an elongated mantle, one wing and two semicircles.  Why two?  One semicircle will turn into a head, and the second (the one that was located above it) you will bend - these will be handles folded with palms together.  Do not flatten the paper strongly at the fold.  Take the thread and stick it to the head. </p><h2>  Paper and Thread </h2><p>  It‚Äôs a little harder to make an angel using threads.  Wings should be cut out of paper.  Then take the thread and cardboard.  The process itself resembles the manufacture of a brush.  Wrap threads on a cardboard, then cut them from one edge.  Carefully, so as not to spill the workpiece, tighten the uncut folded edge with a thread.  Form a loop.  A little lower, grab the brush - you get a head.  Now you need to lay the wings between the two layers of thread and, again, a little lower to intercept the brush thread.  The craft is almost ready!  It remains to decorate the resulting keeper a little.  You can stick sparkles on the wings or decorate the skirt with foil asterisks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself christmas angels" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13542/336745.jpg?1392538533578" width="300"></div>

Doing it yourself is not so difficult.  Pick up a few pieces of <span>flesh-colored</span> fabric <span>,</span> take a dense shiny fabric, prepare a synthetic winterizer.  From the material of a flesh-colored shade (some craftswomen use old <span>nylon tights</span> for this purpose <span>)</span> sew the head by placing a piece of padding polyester inside.  Make a face: beads or small buttons will fit for the eye, the mouth can be embroidered.  Now make two pens from the same fabric.  It was the turn to put smart shreds into action.  Make a cone out of them - this is the body of an angel.  Two smaller cones are sleeves; you must insert and secure the handles into them. </p><p>  It remains to connect all the parts and attach wings to the back.  The latter can be cut from flax and starched.  Sew strings on the head to make hairs.  Further design depends on your imagination. </p>

    <h2>  Wool angels </h2><p>  Very warm and homely figures are obtained from felted wool.  Now this needlework is very popular.  For a baby angel, you will need to dump your head, wings, arms, body.  For clothes, prepare bright beautiful shreds.  For decor, you need beads, ribbons, sparkles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Those who have not yet mastered the art of felting, can be advised to buy a ready-made thin wool felt for crafts.  Wonderful Christmas angels come out of it.  With your own hands you only need to cut out a silhouette with wings from a piece of wool and generously decorate it with shiny glass beads, sequins and braid. </p><p>  A more difficult option is to make a volumetric toy.  From felt it is necessary to cut a triangle, roll it into a cone, glue any ball on top (wooden, plastic, large bead).  Then, behind, you need to attach the carved wool wings and bring heavenly beauty.  The figure turns out to be somewhat abstract, but this has its own charm. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself christmas angels" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13542/336748.jpg?1392538626052" width="225"></div>

    <h2>  Bead miracle </h2><p>  Glass beads and thin glass beads are suitable not only for the final decoration of the toy.  Beadworkers assemble on the wire simply amazing masterpieces!  So to create a little angel is a simple task for them.  Of course, novice masters need to take simpler schemes. </p><p>  Measure and cut a coil of wire, find its center, put on and fit 12 beads to this very center.  Then pass the ends of the wires through one large bead (head).  Next, individually weave out and form two wings.  In the final of the procrastination, attach an angel at shoulder level.  Take one bead, again pass the ends of the wire into it.  Need to form pens.  This is done as follows: the required number of glass balls is collected on the wire, then a flexible metal thread is launched on the return trip.  In the final, weave out a simple triangle of beads, which gradually expands to the bottom.  That's all! </p><h2>  Crochet Christmas Angels </h2>

    <p>  A little higher we talked about the fact that the symbol of Christmas can be blown out of wool.  Now let's learn how to tie an angel from wool or other threads.  To do this, you need a hook and the actual yarn.  Many needlewomen easily knit figures of animals, little men.  Work on winged creation is not much different from proven schemes. </p><p>  So, knit a round ball - this is the head.  Without putting the workpiece far away, immediately embroider the celestial eyes and mouth.  Next, you can tie the body and arms.  And you can show a little imagination.  Probably everyone remembers how to knit napkins.  Now make two round napkins: a larger one and a smaller one.  Starch them.  A big skirt will turn out, and a small one should be folded in half, cover this ‚Äúponcho‚Äù with a skirt, sew the head on top.  You can even stick a toothpick under the sleeves so that it holds the handles.  Untie the wings separately and sew them to the workpiece.  It remains only to add smart details. </p><p>  Whichever way you choose, Christmas <span>angels</span> created <span>with your own hands</span> will never be ignored.  The gifted will appreciate your work and efforts.  They will be pleased that you tried especially for them.  And the good thoughts and wishes that you kept in your head while working on a gift will certainly come true.  No wonder in many cultures such gifts are considered amulets and talismans. </p>
