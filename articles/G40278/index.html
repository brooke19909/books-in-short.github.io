    <p>  Very high quality and powerful phone.  The case of the device is made of soft-touch plastic, which allows the phone to comfortably lie in your hand.  A significant difference between this clamshell and many similar mobile phones is the presence of a TFT-touch screen.  The diagonal of the display is 2.2 inches, and the resolution is 240x320 pixels.  On the body there are volume buttons, connectors for charging and headphones, as well as a small screen that shows time and missed calls. </p><p>  The main advantage of the device is an amazing 5 MP camera, which is equipped with a flash, as well as four-time digital zoom, stabilization and autofocus.  This point is noted in the reviews.  Thanks to the built-in player, you can play many well-known formats. </p><p>  The memory in the device is 100 MB, but you can install MicroSD on 16 GB.  There is support for wireless communications through GPRS and WAP.  The phone already has a browser and an email client installed. </p><p>  The battery capacity of 880mAh will allow you to be connected up to 5 hours, and in standby mode, the battery lasts for 300 hours. </p><h2>  Samsung SGH-E910 Serene </h2>

    <p>  Extremely unusual mobile phone.  It will especially appeal to those who value not only functionality but also a memorable appearance in the device.  The phone will help you stand out among your friends with its extravagant look.  Its main unusual feature is management.  It happens with the help of a rotary push-button dial.  In addition, the phone screen itself can be rotated 180 degrees. </p><p>  The phone‚Äôs display is made quite high quality and has a resolution of 320X240 pixels.  The clamshell case also does not cause disagreement.  The device is quite small and fits easily in the hand. </p><p>  The internal memory in the phone is 16 MB, but it can be increased using cards.  Like many similar devices, Samsung SGH-E910 Serene can easily reproduce all the usual formats.  Separately, it should be said about the camera phone.  A VGA camera is installed here, which is endowed with a fourfold zoom.  The pictures are very solid and saturated. </p><p>  In the call mode, the phone is able to live about three hours. </p><h2>  Clamshell smartphone </h2>
