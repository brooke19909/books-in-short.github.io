The advantage is not those who have never borrowed money, but those borrowers who took loans and repaid them on time. </p><p>  Credit history is information about the borrower, characterizing the fulfillment by this person of obligations to return money received in debt.  The purpose of this document is to stimulate bank customers to be honest with credit issues.  Everyone should know that if he once received money on credit, but did not repay it, all subsequent lenders will find out about this in the future.  Therefore, being a responsible borrower is beneficial. </p><div class="photo" data-original="stnmedia.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to find out a credit history through public services" class="if uuid-3162983" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3162983.jpg"></div><p>  How to find out your credit history through Public Services is interesting to many.  A similar "dossier" is formed upon requesting a loan.  The borrower agrees to the transfer of information to third parties.  Credit histories are kept in the credit history bureau for 15 years from the date of the latest changes. </p><p>  Credit history is divided into three main parts: </p><ul><li>  title part (name, place and date of birth, passport details, number of pension insurance certificate, TIN); </li><li>  the main part (place of residence and registration, amount of debt, term of repayment, information on changes in the loan agreement, on default, litigation, other official information, individual rating of the borrower); </li><li>  additional part (information about the information source, user and request date). </li></ul><p>  How to find out a credit history through "State services"?  And can this be done at all? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Credit History Information </h2><p>  According to modern legislation, every Russian has the right to know his own credit history.  On the Gosuslug portal this can be done absolutely free.  If a certain bank rejects an application for a citizen to obtain a loan, the user can independently verify the dossier and understand why this happened.  A free personal credit report request is only available once a year.  Find out which official sources can provide this information. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gobankingrates.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to find out your credit history through public services" class="if uuid-3162986" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3162986.jpg"></div><h2>  How to find out a credit history through "State services"? </h2><p>  Every citizen of Russia is entitled to receive such an extract.  Reception is absolutely free.  However, here there is one limitation.  Check credit history through the "State Services" is possible only 1 time per year.  You will have to pay for the repeated procedure in the future. </p><h2>  Procedure </h2><p>  Is it possible to find out a credit history through "State services", it is important to find out in advance.  In order to receive a dossier, it is recommended to follow the following step-by-step instructions: </p><ol><li>  Go to the official page, go to the "Services" section. </li><li>  Find the ‚ÄúTaxes and Finance‚Äù tab, click on it. </li><li>  Go to the column "Information about the credit bureau." </li><li>  Open the application form on the "State services" and check the correctness of the automatic input of personal data - PSRN, ITN. </li><li>  Send a request. <div class="photo" data-original="www.jpost.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="checking credit history through public services" class="if uuid-3162985" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3162985.jpg"></div></li></ol><p>  After all of the above actions, a message should appear in the notification ribbon that the application indicating its date and number has been accepted. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Appeal on "State services" on obtaining a credit history after filing an application is recorded within 5-10 minutes.  The deadline is 1 hour.  At the end of the procedure, the result of the verification is sent to the applicant. </p><h2>  What information can be obtained from the extract from the BCI? </h2><p>  On the Gosuslug website, the report is submitted within 60 minutes.  It contains information on all loans available to the borrower: in which bank did the citizen take a loan, an indication of existing arrears in installments.  This dossier helps credit organizations conduct an appropriate audit, assess the capabilities, responsibilities and solvency of a future borrower.  Even if a person has never borrowed money from a bank, a credit history is established for him anyway, however, in this case it is ‚Äúzero‚Äù. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bacu.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="check credit history through public services" class="if uuid-3162984" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3162984.jpg"></div><h2>  What does the report consist of? </h2><p>  Credit history consists of the following information data: </p><ul><li>  name of institution; </li><li>  data on the borrower - name, passport information, address, TIN; </li><li>  information on submitted applications and issued loans; </li><li>  data on repayment of loans received, as well as on overdue obligatory payments; </li><li>  records of CI requests; </li><li>  decisions of banks on loans and borrowings. </li></ul><p>  Credit statements are stored in special institutions - BKI.  On the website of the Central Bank there is a state register of BKI, which allows you to view a list of credit organizations, where is the history of each individual user.  A credit statement can be obtained from the Central Bank.  To do this, register on the site, enter personal data and send an application. </p><p>  On the "State Services" service, every Russian has the right to receive an extract for free once a year.  For the following appeals, you will have to pay from 500 rubles, which depends on the organization to which he will apply. </p><h2>  How else to get a credit history? </h2><p>  If a citizen has already used up his attempt to obtain an extract and credit history at the State Services, there are alternative options: </p><ol><li>  Get a credit dossier at Sberbank - here the cost of this order will be 580 rubles. </li><li>  You can contact Euroset, where they will quickly provide such a service for 990 rubles. </li></ol><p>  The choice of organizations by these companies is not limited, they are simply present in almost any city where you can get any information without difficulty. </p><p>  However, the best option would be to obtain a credit history through the State Services. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fastpaydaycashadvanceloans.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="credit history through public services" class="if uuid-3162988" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3162988.jpg"></div><h2>  BKI - what is it? </h2><p>  The credit history bureau or BKI is a set of organizations whose activities are aimed at creating a single database of all banking customers.  Before making a final decision, credit institutions without fail seek help from the BKI in order to assess the borrower's responsibility and solvency. </p><p>  Today in Russia there are more than 20 such organizations, however, the largest of them are: </p><ul><li>  NBCH; </li><li>  "Russian standard"; </li><li>  Equifax </li><li>  United BKI (Sberbank). </li></ul><p>  In fact, credit histories are generated by the banks themselves, and the central bureau stores loan histories, reflecting how diligently customers paid off the obligatory payments.  At the same time, a banking organization has the right to refuse a loan or approve it at its discretion. </p><h2>  Why do I need to check credit history through the "State Services"? </h2><p>  Today, there are many cases of fraud using personal data of citizens.  Such situations are most often a variety of financial fraud using passport data. </p><p>  To make sure that a citizen does not have any extraneous credit that he did not take, you need to periodically review your story.  This will help stop the actions of scammers and prevent subsequent difficulties. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.brennancenter.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="public services service" class="if uuid-3162987" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3162987.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, a credit history may be needed if a person plans to take out a loan - for example, in order to make sure that such a dossier does not contain information that would serve as a reason for refusing credit. </p><p>  And the last purpose of obtaining a credit statement may be just such a case.  A person gets a story in this situation in order to understand why he was refused a loan. </p><p>  We looked at how to find out a credit history through State Services. </p>
