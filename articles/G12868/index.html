Specifications, technical parameters and other important information will be given in this review.  Both the first device and the second one went on sale 2 years ago.  But even now they can still be bought.  However, their parameters over the past 2 years are both morally and physically outdated. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc desire v specifications" class="if" height="220" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/585008.jpg" width="345"></div>

    <h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  They have identical equipment.  In addition to the device itself, it includes: </p><ol><li>  Battery (for ONE <strong> </strong>  its capacity is 1500 mA / h, and for DESIRE - 1650 mA / h). </li><li>  Standard stereo headset. </li><li>  Charger. </li><li>  Cord "MicroUSB / USB". </li><li>  The manual for the device. </li><li>  Warranty card. </li></ol><p>  Everything else (for example, a cover or protective film) will have to be purchased separately at an additional cost. </p><h2>  Case and usability </h2><p>  The case of the ONE smartphone is made of metal (the back cover and side ribs, as well as the lower protrusion under the screen) and tempered glass (front panel above the display).  Everything is done with high quality, there are no gaps or backlashes.  An unusual feature of this device is the lower protrusion.  You need to get used to it, but there are tangible advantages from its appearance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first of them - the phone is more convenient to hold in your hands, and the second - the microphone is closer to the lips, and the sound quality during a conversation becomes an order of magnitude better.  A slightly different situation with the case of HTC DESIRE V BLACK.  Its characteristics indicate that the case is made of plastic (the back and sides), and the front panel is made of the same <span>tempered glass.</span>  Build quality is worse in this case.  There are certain backlash.  And the body does not turn to call monolithic language. </p><p>  Another nuance that this smartphone distinguishes from the previous one is the lack of a lower bend.  ONE screen size <strong> </strong>  and DESIRE is almost the same.  In the first case, it is 3.7 inches, and in the second - 4. To operate any of these devices with just one hand will not be difficult.  In addition, the buttons and keys are located identically with them.  The power button is on the top side of the gadget, and the volume swing is on its right edge.  Three standard touch keys are located above the bottom edge of the device. </p>

    <h2>  CPU </h2><p>  An interesting situation for these devices turned out with a central processor.  Both in the first and in the second case, we are talking about the chips of the company Kualkom.  Only now, ONE has a more efficient CPU installed, and its cost is much lower (the price for it now is $ 150, and for DESIRE - $ 160), and it is positioned in the initial devices segment.  The only thing worth adjusting for is the number of supported SIM cards.  ONE has only one slot for their installation, and DESIRE has 2. So, ONE has a single-core processor MCM8255 based on the Scorpio architecture.  Its maximum frequency in peak load mode is 1 GHz. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In turn, the MCM7227 CPU is installed in HTC DESIRE V. Its technical specifications are more modest.  Yes, the frequency is similar - 1 GHz, but the architecture of the A5 is much weaker than the Scorpion.  Therefore, from a performance standpoint, it is preferable to choose ONE, but today this difference is not so significant.  The computing power of the microcircuits is enough to solve such problems: watching movies, listening to audio files, surfing Internet resources, reading books and launching simple games. </p>

    <h2>  Graphics and display </h2><p>  As with processors, a more powerful graphics card is installed in ONE.  We are talking about the Adreno 205 accelerator, which from a position of computing power will be better than the Adreno 200, which is used in HTC DESIRE V. Its characteristics will be slightly worse.  But, again, over the past two years, both of these adapters are outdated and are not suitable for solving the most complex tasks.  DESIRE has a slightly larger screen - its diagonal is 4 inches.  The ONE has a slightly smaller diagonal of 3.7 inches.  But their resolution is identical - 480 by 800. And the number of displayed colors is the same - more than 16 million. The touchscreen is designed for 2 touches at the same time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  It should be noted right away that there is no front-facing camera in either the first or second device.  At the time of the release of these gadgets, such an attribute could be found only in very expensive devices.  Hence the problem, which is that the ability to make full-fledged video calls is missing.  You can either see the person you are talking to, but he will not see you, or vice versa.  In both cases, the cameras are based on an identical 5 megapixel matrix.  There is also an autofocus system and LED flash.  But video recording is better with HTC ONE V. Camera specifications indicate support for 720 by 1280 resolution, that is, a full-fledged ‚ÄúHD‚Äù, than the second smartphone can no longer boast (DESIRE can record only 480 by 800 pixels).  And here the problem is not with the camera, but with the processor, which is in ONE V <strong> </strong>  more productive. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  Impressive organization of the memory subsystem can not boast of HTC DESIRE V. Characteristics in this regard, he has the following: </p><ol><li>  0.5 GB of RAM. </li><li>  4 GB has a built-in drive. </li><li>  The maximum size of external memory cards in this device can be 32 GB.

    </li></ol><p>  ONE V also has similar characteristics. That is, we get full parity between these smartphones in the memory subsystem. </p><h2>  Accumulator battery </h2><p>  An interesting situation from the standpoint of autonomy develops in these devices.  DESIRE has a larger battery capacity - 1650 mA / h versus 1500 mA / h for ONE V. But it also has a larger screen diagonal and the number of SIM card slots - 2 versus 1. Hence, the first battery will have less battery life. .  Therefore, from the standpoint of continuous operation from one battery charge, it is better to buy a HTC ONE V phone. The manufacturer‚Äôs characteristics for this parameter guarantee 3 days of battery life. </p><h2>  System software </h2><p>  One of the first smartphones running Android with a serial number 4.0 was HTC ONE V. His specifications at that time were really good.  A similar situation with DESIRE V. It operates on the basis of exactly the same operating system.  Even the add-on for the OS is identical - HTC SENSE 4.0.  With it, you can completely change the gadget's interface to fit your needs.  Say what you like, but from the perspective of system software, equality is obtained between these models. </p>

    <h2>  Application software </h2><p>  An identical set of applications is installed on both DESIRE V and HTC ONE V. The characteristics of the memory subsystem, previously discussed, do not allow you to install many applications on them.  But still the standard utilities (calculator, SMS messenger and calendar) are installed.  Also, the developers did not forget about the Google programs that are installed on them in full.  There are international social services: Facebook, Instagram, Google + and Twitter.  Everything else will have to be taken from the Play Market. </p><h2>  Interface support </h2><p>  The same communications set on HTC ONE V and HTC T328W DESIRE V. Features <strong> </strong>  in this regard, they have the following: </p><ol><li>  The Wai Fi module allows you to receive information on the Internet at speeds of up to 150 Mbps.  Great for files of any size. </li><li>  Full support for the most common networks.  These are both ZhSM and 3Zh.  In the first case, the maximum data transfer rate is 0.5 Mbps (you can view simple websites and communicate on social networks), and in the second - 15 Mbps (in this case, there are practically no restrictions on the amount of downloaded information). </li><li>  The Bluetooth module allows you to almost instantly transfer small files to similar devices. </li><li>  The navigation module "ZHPS" makes it easy and simple to find the shortest route in the city or locality. </li><li>  There are only 2 wired interfaces: MicroUSB and a 3.5 mm audio port.  The first of them allows you to charge the battery and, if necessary, connect to a personal computer.  The second makes it possible to output an audio signal to an external speaker system. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Reviews from the owners of these gadgets </h2><p>  Both the first and second models of smartphones have long been sold, and very successfully.  Therefore, reviews about them can be found without problems.  They indicate the following advantages for ONE V: </p><ol><li>  Case and design. </li><li>  "Android" with the current version 4.0 yet.  This is one of the first gadgets running such an OS. </li><li>  Add-on "Sens 4.0" allows you to optimize the interface of the device. </li><li>  Flawless operation of the navigation system. </li></ol><p>  Its disadvantages are: </p><ol><li>  Bad antenna location (in the lower bend).  Under certain circumstances, the signal may be lost due to this. </li><li>  Unstable operation of the firmware.  Often, the smartphone restarts for no apparent reason. </li></ol><p>  Now about DESIRE V. It has the same advantages as ONE V, but it also adds the following: </p><ol><li>  Support for 2 SIM cards. </li></ol><p>  The minuses, except for those listed earlier for ONE V, are as follows: </p><ol><li>  Bad back cover design.  The openings in it collect dirt, and getting it out of there is quite problematic. </li><li>  Low build quality of the plastic case. </li><li>  Low speaker volume. </li></ol><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  As part of this short review, 2 smartphones were examined in detail: HTC DESIRE V and HTC ONE V. The specifications, price and other important information about these two gadgets were given in it.  It is more preferable to buy ONE V at the moment. It has a more efficient CPU, and autonomy is better, and the case is made of metal.  The only exception is when you need a smartphone with two SIM cards.  In this case, there is no alternative to DESIRE V. </p>
