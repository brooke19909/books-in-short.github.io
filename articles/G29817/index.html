Over the 7 years of its existence in the country, all democratic institutions have been abolished.  Opposition destroyed, king exiled, media tightly controlled.  After the study of this period of Greek history began, scientists called their power nothing more than a fascist military dictatorship, attributing to it the anti-people character of activity. </p>

    <h2>  Reasons and premises for the coup </h2><p>  In 1965, King Paul, a good politician, died in Greece.  He skillfully maneuvered between political parties, the army, and civil servants.  After his death, his son Constantine ascended the throne.  Unfortunately, the heir did not have such influence in higher political and military circles as his father.  The country began a period of political crisis.  The king could not find a common language with any government, so he often dismissed it.  As a result, there was an extremely unstable situation in the political life of the country, which, accordingly, had an impact on economic and social development.  This situation existed until 1967, when the black colonels (or junta) seized power. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Greece on the eve of the coup </h2><p>  Already in 1966, a wave of demonstrations and rallies swept across the country.  In January, 80 thousand workers and employees went on strike, in June - 20 thousand bank employees and 6 thousand postal employees, 150 thousand Athenian civil servants took to the streets of the city, and by October builders of all Greece rose, numbering 180 thousand people in their ranks .  The demands of the strikes were mainly of an economic nature, although there were political slogans: ‚ÄúFree elections,‚Äù ‚ÄúDown with the government.‚Äù </p><p>  Some politicians predicted a military dictatorship would come to power.  In the history of Greece of the XX century, this happened often: in 1923, 1925, 1936, 1953.  As a rule, a dictatorship came to power for a short time to establish stability and order in the country, then transferred power to civilians.  Black Colonels in Greece 1967-1974  were an exception. </p><p>  While some predicted the military would come to power, others argued that the era of dictatorships in Europe had already passed.  "The population of our country and other states will be against this, and the soldiers themselves, who have taken an oath to protect the rights of citizens, will not raise their hands on them," said the people who denied the possibility of the junta coming to power.  However, everything went exactly to that!  A course of lectures was even delivered at the University of Athens, promoting the benefits of dictatorship in difficult political conditions. </p>

    <h2>  Military coup </h2><p>  By the spring of 1967, the <span>political crisis</span> had become rampant.  <span>On April 21,</span> an important event took place - the legitimate authority in the country was overthrown.  At the helm of the state was the junta of black colonels.  This was not a bloody revolution, it was a coup.  In the early morning, the population of the capital was awakened by the movement of tanks along the streets of Athens.  Announcements were already heard on the radio that power had passed into the hands of the military.  They stated: until the coup, Greece remained a politically underdeveloped European state, and the parties acted in an undemocratic way.  Power had a leader, and who opposed, were expelled from the government.  There was complete moral and political chaos. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The military managed to seize power without any problems, because the population was almost 100% for them.  The military for the entire XX century has formed the image of ‚Äújust judges‚Äù, establishing stability and balance throughout the entire century.  In addition, black colonels gained support from the population after their statements that they had first-hand knowledge of the problems and aspirations of the common people. </p>

    <h2>  Triumvirate 1967-1974 </h2><p>  After the coup, the country was officially ruled collectively, but in reality power was concentrated in the hands of the triumvirate - G. Popadopoulos, S. Pattakos, N. Makarezos.  The first of them subsequently became the sole ruler of Greece.  In <span>1967,</span> the military came to power, which, in fact, were the black colonels.  Greece after more than 20 years of democracy remembered <span>what a dictatorship is.</span> </p><h2>  Papadopoulos Georgios </h2><p>  He was born into a family of a rural teacher in the Peloponnese region.  That region was historically very poor, so the population either sought to leave it, or went to serve in the army, and remained there.  Such a fate befell Georgios.  He quickly advanced through the ranks, rising to the rank of colonel.  He was engaged in affairs of strict secrecy, was involved in making contacts with Mexican intelligence and the CIA.  He was very reserved and suspicious, suffered from claustrophobia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Makarezos Nicholas </h2><p>  According to the memoirs of contemporaries, he was the most intellectually developed member of the representatives of the triumvirate.  He was distinguished by rigidity and cunning, he was able to find and translate into reality original and, most importantly, necessary ideas.  I listened to my advisers and listened to them.  During the dictatorship, he was responsible for the most important sphere of the state - the economy, believing that reforms in it are possible only if stability within the state is achieved.  As a member of the Black Colonels triumvirate, he still remained an ardent supporter of the republican system. </p><h2>  Pattacos Stillianos </h2><p>  He was completely ‚Äúsaturated‚Äù with military characteristics, although otherwise he remained a rather limited personality, however, he did not seek to look like an intellectual.  In 1940 he graduated from the military academy with Papadopoulos.  Its distinctive feature was that, unlike other senior figures of that time, did not have personal protection.  He was a very religious person and everywhere he carried a family icon.  Often replaced Papadopoulos at official meetings. </p>

    <h2>  Counter-coup attempt </h2><p>  Of all the representatives of the political elite of the "pre-Khunt" regime, only one offered open resistance to dictatorship.  It turned out to be King Constantine.  He found two associates, which turned out to be P. Canellopoulos and G. Papandreou.  They perfectly understood that there was practically no chance of overthrowing the triumvirate, but, nevertheless, they supported the king. </p><p>  The black colonels knew about the impending counter-coup and even provoked it themselves.  So, on December 12, they presented the monarch with an ultimatum, according to which he was to remove K. Collias from the post of prime minister and appoint Papadopoulos in his place.  The actions themselves began the next day.  It was planned to seize the post of chief of the general staff of the army.  The king spoke at one of the radio stations with an appeal to the Greek people.  However, <span>the Greek population</span> did nothing of what the monarch called for.  Moreover, the troops remained loyal to Papadopoulos, the suppression of the uprising passed as quietly as it began.  The king himself was forced into voluntary exile in Rome. </p><p>  The next day, the black colonels themselves spoke on the radio.  They said that the criminal organization wanted to destroy the state and remove power, using the king himself.  Thus, the monarch was not accused.  Moreover, members of the government showed their devotion to the monarchy, and portraits of members of the royal family ‚Äúadorned‚Äù the offices of public servants. </p>

    <h2>  Political features of the junta </h2><p>  The regime of black colonels in Greece clearly adhered to a certain sequence in their actions and relied on specific ‚Äúrods‚Äù. </p><p>  Firstly, there was a struggle with the entire opposition.  It was banned, and all those who had other political views were prosecuted.  At this time, the activities of concentration camps were expanded. </p><p>  Secondly, all the years the junta has been in power passed under the slogans of the struggle against communism.  Greece was surrounded on all sides by the countries of the socialist camp.  And, according to the government, communism could "break into the heads of the Greeks." </p><p>  Thirdly, the parliament and all political parties of the country were dissolved.  At the same time, Papadopoulos himself rejected the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating his own party, because, in his opinion, this was not necessary.  The authorities coped with their duties in full. </p><p>  Fourth, the black colonels created the ideology of the Greek-Christian spirit, contrasting it with the Communists, who fought with religion.  The junta built a society based on Christian ideals, with the goal of creating a "great Greek people."  The ideas of Christianity were propagated everywhere: in schools, educational institutions and even in the army.  Posters calling for the cultivation of Christian values ‚Äã‚Äãwere posted in all <span>cities of Greece</span> . </p>

    <h2>  The crisis in the economy 1973-1974  and the fall of the junta </h2><p>  Black colonels came to power under the slogans of solving economic, political and social problems.  The part of the population who believed this, over the years, became disillusioned with the power of the military, who were not going to leave, transferring power to the civilian government.  Years passed, the economic situation worsened.  Inflation processes began, the rate of which greatly exceeded the growth of wages in the country.  The population no longer supported the junta.  Then the government decided to set a limit on price increases, to which manufacturers responded sharply negatively, after which the dictatorship of black colonels sent prices for more than 150 types of goods and services free float.  Prices have risen even more! </p><p>  The country held open protests against the existing regime demanding democratic elections, as well as the return of the king.  The government responded to claims regarding wage increases that the level of wages directly depends on labor productivity, making it clear that no increase is expected.  The repression continued. </p><p>  In order to somehow distract the population from internal problems, the regime of black colonels decided to conduct a small victorious war, during which it was supposed to annex Cyprus.  It happened in July 1974.  However, the attacks of Greece were repelled, the troops were forced to leave the island.  After this, the junta was ousted, and power passed into the hands of a democratic government.  On this, the 7-year period of the rule of black colonels in Greece ended. </p>

    <p>  Over the years in power, the black colonels failed to get Greece out of the political and economic crisis.  The situation inside the country was further aggravated, the population became poorer day by day.  Everything led to the fact that a counter-coup would occur, it only remained to wait for the highest peak of dissatisfaction with the dictatorship.  This happened after another failure in Cyprus.  Dictators were convicted.  Papadopoulos, Makarezos, Pattakos were sentenced to death, but then changed the sentences to life imprisonment.  Thus ended the era that remained a black spot in the history of Greek civilization. </p>
