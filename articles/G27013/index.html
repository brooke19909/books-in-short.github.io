    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  To avoid unpleasant surprises during the holidays, travelers should be prepared for some negative moments that they may encounter at the Cretan Village Hotel 4 * (Greece).  Based on the reviews of travelers, we can talk about the following disadvantages of this institution: </p><ul><li>  given the mountain landscape, it is quite problematic to drive to your villa by car (it is better to ask for help from the hotel staff or transfer things to your room on your own, leaving the car in the parking lot); </li><li>  you will have to go to the nearest store for at least a quarter of an hour, which is especially inconvenient, given the lack of outlets in the territory; </li><li>  too high prices for products such as drinking water and ice cream;  to get to the beach, you need to go through a busy road; </li><li>  the hotel does not have animation or any entertainment (but it is possible to attend entertainment shows that are held in a neighboring hotel); </li><li>  the hotel is quite far from the airport, and therefore you have to endure a tiring trip; </li><li>  despite the fact that the staff is very polite and friendly, a little annoying slow service; </li><li>  Wireless Internet is not available throughout, but only at the pool and at the reception; </li><li>  the rooms are tiled, so it‚Äôs cold enough to walk without slippers; </li><li>  due to the old sewer system in the bathrooms, the drain does not work well, and there can also be an unpleasant smell; </li><li>  tap water should not be drunk even after boiling; </li><li>  maids rather strange approach to the issue of replacing towels - they bring new ones in a day, but they do not pick up used ones; </li><li>  lack of wet cleaning; </li><li>  after ten o‚Äôclock in the evening you will not find any of the staff on the premises, and all services will be closed (in case of unforeseen situations there is a telephone number of the hostess, as well as emergency services); </li><li>  not practiced buffet; </li><li>  there is no infrastructure for children (although, for guests who want to relax in silence, this can serve as a positive moment); </li><li>  guests have to get up the stairs to their room, which is rather difficult for older people, as well as for those who have health problems; </li><li>  the pool on the territory is very small. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  At the first acquaintance with the resort complex Cretan Village Hotel 4 * (Ammoudara) the word "hotel" does not come to mind.  This house is warm, cozy, welcoming.  Naturally, such an atmosphere can be attributed to the traditional Cretan interior and architecture, but do not forget about the people who work here.  The family owning this hotel literally puts their soul into their brainchild.  The hostess personally supervises the work of subordinates, and also ensures that the guests do not need anything.  Perhaps the only thing that staff can be blamed for is slowness.  But even this primordially Greek trait can be considered part of the local flavor. </p><p>  Cretan Village Hotel Apartment 4 * (Lassithi) is an ideal place for those who are looking for peace and tranquility.  This is due to several factors.  Firstly, there are no playgrounds and other infrastructure on the territory that would attract families with small children who would disturb the peace of other guests.  Secondly, there is no animation, nor any opportunities for fun and entertainment.  In addition, after 10 pm, the hotel does not have a single service (including a restaurant and bar).  But this does not mean that you have to be bored.  After enjoying the silence, you can go to the territory of the neighboring five-star hotel, where concerts, discos and other entertainment events are held every evening. </p><p>  Perhaps one of the most serious shortcomings of the hotel is its remoteness from urban infrastructure.  Therefore, this option is most often chosen by tourists with a car or those who like to walk.  In addition, older people, as well as those who have health problems, should be careful about this accommodation option.  Be prepared for the fact that every day you have to go down and climb the steep stairs many times (unless, of course, you plan to spend days in your room). </p>
