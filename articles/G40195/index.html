It is located on the shores of the <span>Gulf of Guinea,</span> which belongs to the Atlantic Ocean.  The population reaches seven million, and more than 12 million people live in the district.  So, what is Lagos and what should a tourist see in the city?  We will talk about this later. </p><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  The territory on which the modern city of Lagos is located previously belonged to the African Yoruba tribe.  The current name of the settlement (which translates as "lake") is due to the sailors from Portugal, who landed there in the 15th century and began to trade in slaves.  The slave trade was later banned by the Nigerian king in the 19th century.  From the middle of the same century, these were already British possessions. </p>

    <p>  Nigeria became an independent state only in 1960, when the process of gradual economic growth began.  Thanks to this, Lagos (Nigeria) is a real metropolis, the territory of which is almost equal to the lands of the state of the same name. </p><h2>  Climatic conditions in Lagos </h2><p>  The city is located on the African continent near the equator.  There are special climatic conditions.  Almost all year round temperature indicators reach 25-26 degrees of heat.  The hottest time is considered the period from November to May.  In these months, the temperature is in the range of 27-30, and sometimes reaches a mark of 35-38 degrees.  Thus, the climate here is defined as subequatorial.  Time in Nigeria (Lagos) is determined by the time zone UTC / GMT +1 hour. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Natural world </h2><p>  Flora and fauna in the area near Lagos are quite diverse.  There is a large number of swamps and mango forests (especially in the northern direction from the city), where many species of crocodiles, monkeys and snakes live.  The presence of golden sand beaches near the ocean with clear water, as well as the opportunity to explore the underwater world, makes the south coast an attractive tourist center. </p>

    <p>  Vacationers from all over the world come here all year round to plunge into the extraordinary African culture. </p><h2>  The device of the city of Lagos </h2><p>  The center of the metropolis is located on the territory of the island of the same name, which is connected to the mainland by a bridge and a dam passing to the neighboring island called Iddo.  Here you can find a large number of buildings for offices, and in the old district - traditional buildings that stand on narrow curved streets. </p><p>  Lagos is a port city with its history and exotic flavor.  The main part of the metropolis is quite equipped.  There are government buildings, churches and many residential tall buildings. </p><p>  The former capital of Nigeria provides for all the signs of a modern African lifestyle.  This also applies to congested streets with a high degree of development.  When the buildings were erected massively here, they did it in different styles.  That is why in Lagos you can find both traditional houses and unusual Brazilian baroque.  In the central part of the city there are ultramodern buildings, as well as industrial facilities.  The special flavor of Lagos ensures the presence of ducts and channels connecting its areas.  Of course, this is Africa, and as in many other cities of the continent, there are neighborhoods for the poor, but other parts of the city are quite equipped. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  At night, you will be surprised at how beautiful the Carter Bridge, which is two kilometers long.  It offers a picturesque view, especially in the evening, when the lights are on. </p><h2>  City Economy </h2><p>  In Lagos, transportation is quite well developed.  This is due to the fact that it is a large commercial center.  In addition to being a port city, there is also a modern airport, which is considered the largest on the African continent.  Rail transport is not fully developed, however, construction work is underway in Lagos to create rail transport.  There are too many cars in the city, which is why the roads are very busy, and traffic jams often occur on the streets.  However, passenger transportation operates according to the speed principle: an average of ten thousand people in 60 minutes in all directions (there are eight of them). </p>
