    <p>  Phone <span>"Lenovo A7000"</span> with its design is very similar to the predecessor <span>"Lenovo A6000".</span>  Somewhat changed the look of the camera, and also changed the location of the speaker.  In general, the appearance of the device is rather plain-looking, like most state employees. </p><p>  The body of the device is made of inexpensive plastic.  This is the whole problem of appearance.  The material very quickly collects fingerprints due to the lack of a special coating. </p><p>  Although the plastic is not very good, the assembly of the phone is excellent.  Squeaks will occur only if you squeeze the device.  The missing Soft Touch makes the phone too slippery, and accordingly, when working, this will be a huge drawback. </p><p>  The front panel has become a haven for the screen, speakers, sensors, camera and touch buttons.  On the right side is the volume control along with the power button.  At the bottom of the device is a USB input, as well as a headphone jack.  At the back are the speaker, camera, flash and company logo. </p><p>  In addition to cheap plastic, the lack of key illumination on the front panel hints at the cost of the device.  The owner will be forced to determine their location in poor lighting conditions from memory. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A nice feature of the device is its low weight, only 140 grams.  Of course, this is more than in the A6000, but significantly lower in comparison with many flagships. </p><p>  In total, the design turned out to be inconspicuous, although this does not spoil the <span>Lenovo A7000.</span>  <span>User reviews</span> find even their advantages in inconspicuous devices. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  It might seem that the screen as much as 5.5 inches is awesome.  However, large displays in the budget series have a certain drawback.  The Lenovo A7000 was no exception.  Resolution characteristics are rather mediocre, only 1280 by 720. </p><p>  Such parameters would be perfect for 4.5 or even 5 inches, but for such a device this is the very minimum.  Pixels, of course, are not particularly striking, although they are noticeable. </p><p>  The use of the IPS matrix in the <span>Lenovo A7000</span> somewhat improves the overall picture <span>.</span>  Characteristics of viewing angles are significantly improved due to the use of this technology. </p><p>  The sore spot of this giant is low brightness, and in sunlight it drops even more.  In the predecessor (A6000), a similar problem did not arise. </p><p>  There is an A7000 display and a less significant problem.  Although there is <span>an oleophobic coating</span> on the screen, fingerprints remain. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  The company installed the usual 8 megapixels for all budget devices.  The camera cannot boast of special quality.  At the same time, it is impossible to say that the pictures are very bad.  The quality is slightly above average, and this is already good for a state employee. </p><p>  The front camera will surprise you more.  The manufacturer equipped it not just with a peephole for video communication, but with as many as 5 megapixels.  A rather interesting solution will allow you to take good quality pictures. </p><h2>  Filling </h2>

    <p>  Chinese manufacturers, without changing their traditions, installed the MTK processor in the device.  This solution allows you to significantly reduce prices, which is very important for such state employees. </p><p>  Despite the cost, the processor is pretty good and has 64-bit performance.  The device has as many as eight cores, each of which operates at 1.5 GHz. </p><p>  It is this filling that brings the device closer to the middle category.  This high performance can be compared with many expensive smartphones. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Does not fail and the device‚Äôs RAM.  Lenovo equipped their brainchild with 2 GB of memory.  After evaluating the processor and RAM, you can understand that the device does not take up power. </p><p>  Things are somewhat worse with the built-in memory of the Lenovo A7000.  Productive device has only 8 gigabytes to use.  Of course, part is reserved for the system, and about 6 GB remains. </p><p>  Installing a flash drive will help smooth out the lack of this parameter.  The device supports a card up to 64 GB. </p><h2>  System </h2><p>  The device is controlled by Android 5.0, and this is a definite plus.  Like the A6000, it uses the proprietary Vibe UI shell.  Compared to its predecessor, the system is more stable.  The changes also affected the shell; now there are no small braking of the interface. </p><p>  The appearance of the system on the device has gained significant similarity with iOS.  This is noticeable in the style of design of the icons, as well as system folders. </p><p>  There is also a lot of interesting and useful abilities.  For example, automatic volume control or gesture control. </p><p>  The device is delivered with applications already installed.  Sure, some of them are useful, but most just take their place. </p><p>  An unpleasant fact will be the lack of the ability to remove the Lenovo A7000 branded shell.  Reviews of some owners express dissatisfaction with this fact.  Launchers will help smooth out sharp corners, allowing you to change the style.  Of course, it will not be possible to completely change everything. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  Installed a 2900 mAh battery in the device.  It might seem like a great battery for the Lenovo A7000.  A review of the device makes it clear that the economical processor and the not-so-bright display only slightly increased the duration of the work. </p><p>  With almost 3 thousand mAh, the device can last only 2 days without additional charge and subject to minimal use.  Active work will reduce the duration to approximately 6 hours. </p><p>  In fact, such a battery is enough to work with the <span>Lenovo A7000.</span>  <span>User reviews</span> suggest that they are happy with the battery's ‚Äúlife‚Äù.  The charge capacity is quite capable of satisfying all phone requests. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  All installed fillings significantly affect the cost of the Lenovo A7000.  The price reaches about 13 thousand rubles.  We can definitely say that the smartphone has left the budget category.  Of course, the cost is justified, the device turned out worthy. </p><p>  Unfortunately, due to the shortcomings present, the owner will need additional equipment.  The use of cheap plastic with a slippery coating makes the case for Lenovo A7000 very popular. </p><h2>  Sound </h2>

    <p>  The company has applied an interesting novelty regarding the sound of the device, namely working with headphones.  The technology is called Dolby Atmos and improves the sound of the headset. </p><p>  Surprisingly, the improvements are really noticeable.  The sound becomes deeper as well as realistic.  This function works in movies and even calls. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2>

    <p>  The set is pretty standard: the Lenovo A7000 itself, instructions, USB cable, adapter.  An interesting feature of devices of this level is a rare addition to the headset.  Although this is a small problem, still standard headphones are not of the best quality. </p><h2>  Advantages </h2><p>  A huge plus of the device is its hardware.  The performance that the filling provides will be enough to run demanding games and perform many tasks at the same time. </p><p>  Do not leave your smartphone indifferent and music lovers.  The excellent sound in the headphones equates the model with the musical brothers. </p><p>  A little twofold impression is formed on the screen of the phone.  The undoubted advantage is the large diagonal, convenient for watching movies and games.  But the display has its own miscalculations. </p><p>  The relevance of the device increases its operation on a modern 5.0 system.  "Android" allows you to most effectively realize the capabilities of the device.  The only upset is the lack of the ability to disable the branding. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  The main painful point of the device is its screen.  A large diagonal allows you to have fun at work, but a small resolution and noticeable pixels worsen the impression. </p><p>  Another noticeable problem of Lenovo A7000 is the price.  Previously, a cheap series has grown to middle-class devices.  A lot of fans of the A line are likely to be unhappy. </p><p>  A tangible drawback of the A7000 is its appearance.  For a state employee, it is quite suitable, but the design asking for the price of the device does not justify absolutely. </p><p>  You should pay attention to a rather mediocre camera.  The presence of 8 megapixels has not been a surprise for a long time, but certainly in a device with such a price. </p><p>  A less significant drawback is the Vibe UI shell, or rather, the inability to switch to stock firmware.  The owner will be forced to come to terms with the corporate design. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2>
