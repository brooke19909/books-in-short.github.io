Any financial institution has its own range of programs, characterized by advantages and disadvantages.  But what conditions can be called really beneficial for the client?  Which bank should be trusted and which not?  How can I start working with?  Commercial banks in the Russian banking system are presented in the widest assortment.  And before choosing a financial institution, it is worth exploring the nuances. </p><h2>  Rating </h2><p>  It often seems to customers that on every square meter of the territory of one or another bank they are waiting for deception and falsehood.  This is not entirely true.  The best Russian commercial banks are fairly honest and operate in accordance with the law.  Good financial institutions aim for long-term cooperation.  Therefore, repelling a client at the first meeting is unreasonable. </p>

    <p>  And in order to make sure of all this, it is enough for a potential client to look at the rating of banks, according to reviews of people who used the corresponding services.  Thus, it will be possible to choose a financial institution, the transaction with which will be really profitable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The rating itself will be presented below.  And for starters, some factual information. </p><h2>  Basic information </h2><p>  Today in Russia more than 1000 banks are registered.  But not more than 100 are popular among them. Here the whole range of services is provided - from consumer lending to the conclusion of deposit agreements. </p><p>  It is worth noting that among the hundreds of top financial institutions, there are also those that over the years of their work have managed to accumulate a lot of negative reviews.  Therefore, turning to a particular bank, you need to weigh the pros and cons, given the numerous reviews about them. </p><h2>  <span>The best banks</span> in the field of lending </h2><p>  The unstable economic situation has led people to become cautious about a service such as lending.  Not everyone will borrow money if there is no confidence in the future.  However, there are also many who still decide to make a deal with the bank.  <span>Commercial organizations</span> lure customers with loyal conditions and low interest rates. </p>

    <p>  Which financial institution should I apply to?  Both Gazprombank and Sberbank have been operating on the market for quite some time.  They offer a huge range of additional services.  But according to statistics, many still prefer to contact the commercial savings bank of the Russian Federation. </p><h2>  VTB 24 </h2><p>  This financial institution fully justifies its third place.  Loans are offered to customers with a rate of 17% per annum, which is also not bad.  A huge advantage is the possibility of concluding a contract for a long period.  Everyone can take money here for 7 years, despite the fact that the maximum loan term in many other financial institutions does not exceed 5 years. </p>

    <h2>  The worst commercial banks of the Russian Federation </h2><p>  To financial institutions, where people began to apply much less often, include: </p><ul><li>  Tinkoff Credit Systems. </li><li>  "Russian standard". </li></ul><p>  These Russian commercial banks were previously very popular.  However, everything changed with the onset of the economic crisis.  With people who are in a difficult situation and cannot fully fulfill their obligations, financial institutions refuse to make contact.  They work with debtors in a rather rude manner. </p><p>  Huge interest on loans is another minus.  Not happy also is the lack of deposit insurance.  Not everyone will decide to sign a deposit agreement here.  And he will be right - there is absolutely no guarantee that money will be returned if the bank declares itself bankrupt. </p><h2>  Summarize </h2><p>  What to do?  Leaving money under the pillow?  It is not advisable to go to extremes.  It is worth choosing only trusted financial institutions that have existed on the market for more than one year.  Where to go to a Russian commercial bank?  Addresses in Moscow we can offer you. </p><ul><li>  Sberbank  Bank address: Moscow, Vavilova street, 19. </li><li>  Bank of Moscow.  Branch address: Moscow, st.  Sadovaya-Triumfalnaya, d. 4/10, p. 1. </li><li>  VTB24 Bank.  Bank address: Moscow, Red Square, 3. </li></ul><p>  These are the most popular Russian commercial banks.  In any case, before concluding a deal, you should study all the proposed conditions and read the reviews. </p>
