For example, one of the methods of settlements between people is the ability to send funds using the phone.  In this article you will learn how to transfer money from a card via SMS. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pymnts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mobile banking" class="if uuid-3181285" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90067/3181285.jpg"></div><h2>  Card settlement methods </h2><p>  A bank card in use is a very convenient tool.  It can be paid in a variety of ways: </p><ul><li>  Payment at the trading terminals.  It is made by drawing a magnetic strip through the terminal, inserting a card with a chip or attaching it if the card supports NFC technology. </li><li>  Payment on the site by entering card details. </li><li>  Payment or transfer through your personal account and special mobile applications. </li><li>  The ability to conduct operations via phone, such as transferring money from a card via SMS. </li></ul><h2>  "Mobile Bank" </h2><p>  All major banks have a service connecting your card with a mobile phone.  SMS with card operations, expenses and income, SMS for card operations is sent to your phone number.  You also get into your hands tools for calculations.  Therefore, having a card from one of the banks in Russia, it will be useful for you to know how to transfer money to a card via SMS. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.bridgeviewbank.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Card with a mobile bank" class="if uuid-3181288" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90067/3181288.jpg"></div><p>  Usually this service is called "Mobile Bank".  Its cost is different from the bank.  And sometimes on the type of card.  For example, in Sberbank, this service for classic debit cards costs sixty rubles a month, for credit and gold / platinum - for free, and for social - thirty rubles. </p><h2>  How to make mobile transfer </h2><p>  So how to transfer money to a card via SMS?  You need to send a message to a short number with a certain text, where the recipient's card number and the transfer amount will be indicated.  Each bank has its own short number and its own text template, according to which the message is written.  Banks do not charge for such SMS, and the mobile operator - depending on the tariff.  Unfortunately, at the moment, only Sberbank and Alfa Bank have such a transfer service. </p><p>  This method of translation is quite convenient.  Most people successfully use online translations through mobile applications.  But there are situations when the Internet does not work well, and SMS is sent normally.  Also, a similar method of sending money is more suitable for older people who find it difficult to learn the personal account of the bank and easier to send SMS. </p><h2>  Teams for transfers of Sberbank and Alfa-Bank </h2><p>  How to transfer money via SMS to a Sberbank card?  You need to send a message to number 900 with the text "Translation xxxxx..xxxx 1000", where xxxxx..xxxx is the recipient's card number (it consists of sixteen or eighteen digits), and 1000 is the transfer amount.  The maximum amount of shipments that can be made per day through the Mobile Bank is eight thousand rubles.  At the moment, in this way you can only transfer to Sberbank cards.  Instead of the card number, you can also specify the phone number if it is connected to the Mobile Bank service.  However, if different people‚Äôs cards are connected to the same phone number, the transfer will fail.  You have to enter exactly the number of a specific card. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Alfa-Bank has a similar method of transfer.  You need to send SMS of the same content: "Transfer 7hhhhhhhhhhh 1000", where 7hhhhhhhhhhh - the recipient's phone number, and 1000 - the amount in rubles.  The only difference is how to transfer money from the card via SMS between him and Sberbank - the request must be sent to number 2265. </p><p>  In both cases, after SMS is delivered to the bank, you will receive a message from him with the details of the transfer.  If you read them and agree that everything is entered correctly, you send SMS with a one-time code that comes to you in the message. </p><h2>  Advice </h2><p>  You already know how to transfer money to the card via SMS request.  It's time to get acquainted with a few tips and tricks that not everyone knows about: </p><ul><li>  Carefully read the text of the SMS and the message that comes in response to confirm the transfer.  If you make a mistake in the phone or card number, the bank will not refund your money.  When sending SMS with confirmation, you put your signature, as it were, that all the data is correct, and you agree with the transfer.  The only thing you can hope for is that if you transferred by phone number, then you will call there and the recipient will agree to return the money to you. </li><li>  You can transfer between your cards, and not eight, but as many as one hundred thousand rubles a day.  To do this, the sent request must be of the form "Transfer 1234 5678 1000", where 1234 is the card with which the transfer is made, and 5678 - to which. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank transfer" class="if uuid-3185889" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22293/3185889.jpg"></div><p>  If your phone has a negative balance and you can‚Äôt send SMS or, for example, you have paid ones, and you don‚Äôt want to spend money, then Sberbank has the option of free inquiries using a mobile phone called USSD: </p><ul><li>  * 900 * 9hhhhhhhhh * 100 # - pay someone else's phone number, where 9hhhhhhhhhh - this number, and 100 - the amount; </li><li>  * 900 * 100 # - pay your phone number for the specified amount; </li><li>  * 900 * 12 * 9hhhhhhhhh * 100 # - transfer funds to the card of another Sberbank client by phone number.  12 is the team number that remains unchanged. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="blog.opiums.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="USSD - Sberbank Requests" class="if uuid-3181293" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90067/3181293.jpg"></div><h2>  Fraud </h2><p>  Naturally, fraudsters could not ignore such a sphere of human activity as mobile transfers.  The schemes of attackers in such cases are simple and beaten, but unfortunately, they still affect not too knowledgeable or attentive people: </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kenya-aircargo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Online scam" class="if uuid-3181305" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90067/3181305.jpg"></div><ul><li>  A fraudster calls you or writes on a social network, introducing himself as your friend, and asks you to enter some code on your phone or make a transfer to his card.  As a rule, this happens when hacking pages in Odnoklassniki or VK.  The easiest way to protect yourself is to ask a "friend" a question that only he knows the answer to, or call his real phone number and see if it is before transferring money from the card via SMS. </li><li>  Viruses.  If you have a phone controlled by the Android operating system, then it can be infected with a special virus or rootkit, which itself generates SMS commands on your phone, sending money to its owner, and then deleting all SMS so that you do not immediately miss out.  For security, it is recommended to put a good antivirus on the phone or use equipment based on IOS. </li><li>  False translation.  A fraudster writes you an SMS from a regular phone, disguising it as a message from 900, in which he writes that you have completed a transfer for some amount.  Then he calls or writes to you that he mistakenly transferred the money and asks for it to be returned.  An inattentive person may not understand that this is not a real translation, but a simple SMS, and sends out money out of kindness.  Read carefully before transferring money from the card via SMS, and make sure that the messages came from 900, and not disguised as it. </li></ul>
