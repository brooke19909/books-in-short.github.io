  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Washers with dryer: pros and cons</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Manufacturers of washing machines regularly delight consumers with new models.  So, relatively recently, the line of such equipment was supplemented by devices with a drying function.  Many have already managed to acquire such new products, while others are still eyeing them.  A more detailed acquaintance with such equipment, an overview of its advantages and disadvantages will help to decide on the purchase of a washing machine with dryer. </p><h2>  Device and principle of operation </h2><p><noindex>  <span>Washer dryer</span> </noindex>  equipped with an additional heating element.  The heater is located at the rear of the device.  He is responsible for heating the air, then he, with the help of a fan, enters the drum of the washing machine through the duct.  He processes linen, the moisture from which enters the drainage system of the equipment.  During drying, hot air acts on textiles from all sides due to the fact that the drum periodically changes its direction of movement. </p><h2>  The advantages of washer-dryers </h2><p>  The main advantage of such new products is the combination of a dryer and a washing machine in one device.  Therefore, you will not need to purchase such equipment separately, which will save space on its placement. </p><p>  Since the washing machine immediately dries the laundry, then there is no need to subsequently hang it on the street or on the balcony, which is especially important in the cold season. </p><p>  Such washing machines provide protection against creasing.  During drying, the laundry is straightened.  Therefore, the process of ironing things is significantly simplified, and for some types of textiles (synthetics, spandex and others), the need for it disappears. </p><p>  The design of washing machines with dryer is in no way inferior to classic models.  All the same concise personal and streamlined forms, a variety of colors and styles.  Particular attention is drawn to the washer-dryer <noindex>  <span>HOTPOINT-ARISTON AQD1070D 49 EU / B</span> </noindex>  which provides cutting-edge design. </p><h2>  Disadvantages of washing machines with dryer </h2><p>  Now let's talk about what the disadvantages of washing machines with drying.  Their main drawback is the need to load the drum only halfway.  Suppose the equipment is designed for 6 kg, it will be possible to wash and dry only 3 kg of laundry at a time.  What will happen if you load the drum completely?  Drying will be done poorly.  As a result, you will have to lay out half the laundry in the basin.  Then you need to activate the drying function again for each serving of things.  Therefore, it is better to immediately load the machine halfway, because it will be possible to reduce the consumption of resources. </p><p>  Appliances with drying have a low energy saving class.  It rarely exceeds the mark B. Whereas conventional washing machines by this criterion have the characteristic A + and higher, which indicates their high energy efficiency.  Of course, it is important to understand here that since the technique immediately solves two problems - it dries and erases the laundry, then it cannot a priori consume little electricity.  However, if you buy such devices separately, their energy consumption will be higher than that of the combined model. </p><p>  And another drawback is the high price.  For washing machines with drying, the cost is an order of magnitude higher than for low-performing models.  But again, if you purchase the equipment separately, then the costs will be higher. </p><p>  Of course, washing machines with dryer deserve the attention of buyers.  Their purchase will become especially relevant in an apartment, where in the winter season it is problematic to dry clothes. </p></div></article>
