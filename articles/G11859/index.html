    <p>  But Beeline has quite advantageous offers in terms of roaming.  For example, the service "Multipass", "Seductive roaming", "Beeline +", etc.  Going to the CIS countries, Europe or, possibly, Asia, it makes sense to choose roaming before each trip, which is suitable at the moment.  After all, tariffs are changing, and a reasonable approach will save money. </p><h2>  "Multipass" is ... </h2><p>  This tariff is a service for those who travel abroad often.  It has fairly low rates for international calls and for sending SMS messages.  But for those who choose to go abroad by force once a year, it is better to turn off the Multipass upon arrival home, so as not to overpay. </p><p>  Depending on the features, this tariff will cost differently.  Prepayment is charged from the subscriber account 15 rubles per day.  If a certain tariff is set for the number, then the cost will be 450 rubles per month for the user.  But the Multipass service is connected for free. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Pricing Details </h2><p>  An outgoing call costs 15 rubles per minute.  This is regardless of whether it is local, in Russia or international.  The incoming call charge will cost the subscriber 5 rubles for the same conversation period.  Billing is per minute here.  The countdown starts from the first second. </p><p>  Sending an SMS from a number will cost 5 rubles.  And MMS and receiving messages - 29 kopecks.  The price for using the World Wide Web for 20 Kb will be, like when sending MMS, 29 kopecks. </p><p>  Deactivation of the “Multipass” service should be made to those who are sent to North and South America, Africa, as well as to Australia and Oceania. </p>

    <p>  The service will work where there are mobile operators - partners of Beeline (Russia).  These are Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, Armenia, Uzbekistan, Georgia, Laos, Moldova, etc.  Somewhere they are also called Beeline, and in some countries they have other names. </p><p>  Even if a person came from where there is a partner operator, the MultiPass shutdown must still be performed. </p><h2>  Tariff connection </h2><p>  The Multipass service is available only to those who have been using it for a long time.  No one will be able to connect to this service again.  That's because “Multipass” is a tariff that Beeline sent to the archive and replaces it with “The most profitable roaming” subscribers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Moreover, this tariff does not need to be connected.  “The most profitable roaming” includes a package of ten free minutes of conversation and 40 MB of traffic per day.  All minutes and megabytes that will be spent in excess of the permissible norm must be paid separately. </p><p>  Another advantage of this tariff is that if the Beeline client has not made a single call in a day, sent a single SMS and did not go online, he will not have to pay anything.  In addition, Beeline subscribers can use 4G Internet when connecting to the “Most Profitable Roaming” tariff.  Its coverage affects many European countries and beyond.  To learn more about the distribution zone, you need to go to the Beeline official website. </p>

    <h2>  How to deactivate the Multipass service? </h2><p>  Two methods are offered to your attention: directly by phone or via the Internet. </p><p>  To turn off the MultiPass, you need to dial * 110 * 590 # on your phone and return to the call button when you return from abroad. </p><p>  You can also disable this service via the Internet.  This is done using the Beeline service management system.  To refuse the tariff, you need to go to your personal account on the operator’s official website.  And at the end, turn off the "Multipass". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It is worth noting that after this action it will be impossible to restore the service.  Therefore, if you like its conditions and tariffing, then you should think before you turn it off. </p><h2>  Roaming in Russia </h2><p>  In Russia, one of the unpleasant moments is domestic roaming.  This is such a service, when the connection is automatic, only a person needs to leave his region.  Why is the moment unpleasant?  Because it is an expensive pleasure. </p><p>  Most of all, perhaps, this alignment afflicts those who live at the junction of different regions, and who have to overpay, being almost a couple of kilometers from home.  This situation will not appeal to those who like to travel around Mother Russia.  And although they promise to cancel all roaming within Russia, nobody is going to restrain their words so far.  Only one thing pleases: the Beeline operator offers profitable roaming, which can help reduce the cost of mobile communications. </p>

    <p>  Such tariffs from Beeline include: </p><ul><li>  "My country"; </li><li>  "Our country +". </li></ul><p>  They differ in the cost of calls, SMS and Internet.  For the connection of the My Country service you will have to pay 25 rubles.  The amount is small.  And the connection of the service "Our country +" is absolutely free.  But from the point of view of saving on calls, “My Country” will still be cheaper. </p><p>  Roaming is available inside Russia and from other operators, so people don’t need to buy a local SIM card while traveling to another city. </p><h2>  What to choose if you had to turn off the Multipass? </h2><p>  Firstly, when traveling abroad, you must definitely turn off mobile Internet in your smartphone.  Of course, if he will not be needed there, say, for work or for other valid reasons.  The fact is that if there are no special options, then the megabytes spent will fly into a huge penny.  Well, save on communications abroad, in addition to the Multipass service, will help: </p><ul><li>  "Planet Zero"; </li><li>  “Seductive roaming”; </li><li>  SuperVisa. </li></ul><p>  If you need to use abroad the benefits received from the World Wide Web, such an additional option from Beeline as the Sea of ​​the Internet will help.  In fairness, it is worth noting that other Big Three operators also have such options, and they are sometimes cheaper. </p>

    <h2>  Geography "Multipass" </h2><p>  Before you turn off the Multipass, it makes sense to find out - what if this service is useful in a particular country?  In the end, it is more profitable than many. </p><p>  And if to be objective, it is worth recognizing that the majority of tourists from Russia go just to Asia, Europe and the CIS countries.  And “Multipass” is a rather balanced service in terms of price.  Therefore, you need to think a few times before turning off the Multi-Pass, if there is a high probability of departure to one of 62 countries in the near future.  Their list can be found on the official Beeline website.  More than 60 is not so much when it comes to traveling the world.  For example, the Beeline + countries have only 18 states. </p><p>  However, it makes sense to disable the described tariff with replacing it with “Seductive Roaming”.  If Beeline “Multipass” has a lower monthly fee, then this is an insignificant difference - only 5 kopecks.  And incoming calls are more expensive by a whole ruble per minute.  Despite the more expensive mobile data transfer, “Seductive roaming” can win only due to the low cost of incoming calls.  After all, few use the Internet abroad. </p>

    <p>  Thus, “Multipass” is one of the few roaming services that allows communicative people abroad to continue communication that does not bite evil prices.  The only negative that forces you to turn off this good tariff is the constant charging of a monthly fee.  And its sending to the archive will make many people think not only about changing the roaming service, but also, possibly, about changing the operator. </p>
