These can be handicrafts made of waste material, wall panels and mosaics made of stones and mirrors.  Decoupage frames for paintings or photographs look beautiful.  Masters even from simple plastic disposable spoons manage to create a beautiful <span>frame for a mirror</span> or crafts for the holidays.  Wood cuts and used plastic bottles, disposable cups and leather flaps are used.  What beautiful and spectacular <span>glass</span> bottles turn out after <span>decoration</span> ! </p><h2>  Foreword </h2><p>  In the article, we will consider several different options for making decorative bottles with our own hands for the kitchen.  We will describe in detail how to perform such work, what materials will be needed.  After reading, be sure to try to make such crafts to decorate your living space.  Indeed, it is precisely such bright accents in the interior that attract the eyes of guests and households.  The presence of decorative bottles in the room will bring a sense of comfort and beauty. </p><p>  To get started, first look at all types of jewelry, both from glass containers and from plastic ones.  It is advisable to pick up bottles for decoration of some unusual shape, then when decorating you get a double effect.  You don‚Äôt have to buy a lot of material, many have everything they need in the kitchen. </p><h2>  Beautiful bottles with cereals and grains </h2><p>  The kitchen in the apartment is a place where a huge amount of time is spent.  It will not be possible to place an article made of any material there, since the humidity in the room is often increased, and the surfaces are covered with a layer of fat over time and absorb kitchen odors.  But decorative bottles for the kitchen will be appropriate in any case.  They occupy a minimum of space in the room, they can be wiped or washed under water, located in the back of the cabinet or on an open shelf. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After a suitable container is selected, it must be peeled off so that there are no traces of the old label, washed thoroughly and sterilized.  There are many types of decorative bottles for the kitchen.  Do it yourself with your own hands is very simple.  Grains and cereals, beans and peas can be poured into the container.  These are all bulk substances that you just need to pour layers in a bottle.  For this, it is most convenient to use a funnel.  If you want to arrange the layers not evenly, but with slopes, then when pouring you need to tilt the bottle in one direction or another. </p><div class="photo" data-original="djirecords.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="decorating with cereals" class="if uuid-2293148" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2293148.jpg"></div><p>  You need to alternate cereals and seeds not only in structure, but also in color, for example, after white rice you can pour brown buckwheat, yellow millet, red beans or orange lentils.  Large grains of bright yellow corn look beautiful.  Beans can be selected both large and small.  Her colors are also diverse, from bright white to burgundy and even black. </p><p>  When the decorative bottles are completely filled, they are closed with a cork and filled with wax.  The main thing is to thoroughly dry the container before starting work so that there is not even a drop of liquid, otherwise the fungus may appear over time and the ingredients will deteriorate.  The neck of the finished bottle can be wrapped in a piece of burlap and tied in a contrasting bow. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Decorative bottles with vegetables </h2><p>  To decorate the kitchen, they also use bottles in which sliced ‚Äã‚Äãvegetables are placed in layers.  The principle of preparing the bottle for work is similar.  The container is washed thoroughly, the sticker is peeled off, the inside is sterilized and thoroughly dried. </p><p>  Then you need to prepare the vegetables necessary for packing in decorative bottles.  Elements of different shapes and colors look beautiful.  For example, hot peppers of red, green or yellow colors are cut in equal sections, garlic is peeled.  Small cherry tomatoes will help to diversify the contents of the container, only you need to remove all the tails.  It is convenient to fill up olives. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="decoration with vegetables" class="if uuid-2290263" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2290263.jpg"></div><p>  Layers with alternating colors and shapes are arranged.  Pieces of pepper can be laid horizontally and vertically.  For convenience, when laying use a thin knitting metal knitting needle or wooden skewer.  If you cut orange or lemon slices in addition to vegetables, you can place them in one outer layer on top of other vegetables.  It is interesting to make of them not only a strip of circles, but also to build a spiral or a central wavy line. </p><p>  To prevent vegetables from spoiling, they are poured with a preservative.  Some use vinegar and some use vegetable oil.  Then, a handmade bottle made by hand is closed with a cork and filled with wax or paraffin.  The cork is beautifully tied to a bow with a ribbon or hemp rope, you can attach a flower. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Funny crafts </h2><p>  When making decorative bottles in the kitchen, you can use plastic containers.  For the filler to be colorful and bright, you need to use various dyes. </p><p>  You can create a layered drawing of sand or salt.  And as a coloring matter, you can take food colors or natural juices from beets, carrots or spinach.  After the granular substance has colored, you need to put everything on napkins in separate bowls. </p><p>  When all the components have dried, the filling of the container begins.  Do not forget that the bottle must be completely dry.  Due to the fact that the structure of both salt and sand is small, the filling of the bottle is dense, without voids.  Everything is poured with a funnel, if it is not, then use a curled sheet of paper, in the shape of a truncated cone or bell. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="funny crafts" class="if uuid-2290232" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2290232.jpg"></div><p>  When everything is filled up to the top of the bottle, it is closed with a cork and filled with wax.  Fluffy yarn is wound around it, and the remainder is straightened vertically upward.  It remains to decorate the surface of the bottle with funny faces, having glued eyes, mouth and nose onto PVA.  You can make small items from paper using the application method or cut out from self-adhesive, as in the photo of a decorative bottle in the article. </p><p>  The design of the neck is also different.  You can make a hat for "little man" out of fabric or felt, or a scarf knitted with a simple 1x1 elastic band on the neck.  If you portray a girl character, then on the neck of the bottle you can impose a satin ribbon and make a rose on the side or attach another artificial flower. </p><h2>  Bottle coloring </h2><p>  One of the easiest ways to make a decorative glass bottle is to stain it with a spray can.  Different or identical containers are selected, you carefully need to peel off the old sticker so that there are no traces of paper or glue.  The bottles should be absolutely smooth.  After cleaning, they are wiped dry and prepared for painting. </p><p>  First you need to prepare a workplace so that the paint from the spray does not color the entire kitchen at once.  You can do this on the balcony or on the street, if possible.  Then you need to take care of the variety of the picture.  If the bottle is painted in one tone and does not have any patterns, then it is simply placed on an old newspaper, away from the gas stove and fire, and blown from the spray from all sides.  If you want to paint the bottom also, then you need to put the bottle upside down, putting it on some kind of stick or stand. </p><div class="photo" data-original="homedesignrev.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="painted bottles" class="if uuid-2292906" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2292906.jpg"></div><p>  If the bottle is painted with stripes, but they are sealed with tape or tape before painting.  When the paint is completely dry, they are removed and these places remain unpainted.  It is possible in this way to make not only strips, but also another pattern - leaves, stars, flowers. </p><h2>  Twine decoration </h2><p>  If the kitchen is decorated in a rustic style, made of natural wood, then it will be appropriate to place decorative bottles glued with twine of natural flowers or hemp rope on the shelf.  It‚Äôs easy to do.  Thick PVA glue is applied to the surface of the bottle and wound tightly around the string with twine.  Glue is applied as needed so that it does not dry ahead of time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rope decoration" class="if uuid-2290209" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2290209.jpg"></div><p>  When the whole bottle is decorated, you can create additional spectacular details on it, for example, as in the photo above, tie seashells brought from the sea coast to the neck.  You can stick a pattern of coffee beans on top of the rope.  The main thing is that all elements of decoration should be natural, natural.  Then the craft will suit the style of the kitchen. </p><p>  Take a natural cork for the bottle cap.  It is suitable in color, and it is also a natural material. </p><h2>  Bright bottles </h2><p>  If you want to diversify the interior of the kitchen with bright colors and interesting drawings, then it is quite realistic to perform such simple crafts as in the photo below.  Used glass bottles for wine, you will also need acrylic paints of the necessary colors, a thin brush for drawing from natural hairs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="favim.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="drawings on glass" class="if uuid-2290221" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2290221.jpg"></div><p>  First, you can use the spray and paint the entire surface of the bottle, creating the main background.  Then begins the application of the ornament.  It can be either geometric or floral.  A bottle will look beautiful, on the surface of which the ornament covers the entire area.  You can also draw any picture. </p><p>  If you like the brilliance and splendor of colors, then you can attach a lot of pebbles to the glass surface.  You can arrange them in a chaotic manner, as in the photo in the article, or you can also lay out an ornament or arrange them in colors in layers. </p><h2>  Decorative plastic bottle </h2><p>  I don‚Äôt feel like transporting things like a flower vase from a city apartment to my summer cottage.  You can perfectly decorate the dining table in the kitchen by placing fresh flowers in a plastic vase.  Make it from a used one and a half liter plastic bottle.  Color does not really matter. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hhomedesign.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vase to the country" class="if uuid-2290240" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2290240.jpg"></div><p>  Part of the container with the neck must be cut with sharp scissors.  Then the main work on decorating is to be done.  To do this, use a burner.  Leaning the hot rod against the plastic, the latter begins to melt, forming holes.  If you hold the burner longer, then the hole will become large.  Thus, any pattern can be melted. </p><p>  Then the bottle is blown with spray paint and dried on a stick upside down.  The remaining flat part of the bottle is enough to pour water and put flowers in it. </p><h2>  Bunches of grapes </h2><p>  For the <span>design of kitchen</span> shelves, you can make decorative bottles with your own hands.  See photo of these crafts below in the article.  To make such interesting bulk clusters of grapes, you need to purchase several dozen half-beads or transparent pebbles.  They can have a shine of different colors - greenish or yellow overflows.  Of these, a bunch of grapes is laid out on a bottle. </p><p>  To attach each element you will need a glue gun or transparent superglue.  It is preferable to make a bunch of large size so that the grapes are located on the entire front surface of the bottle from the base to the neck.  The cluster should be triangular in shape.  At the bottom of the picture there are only a couple of berries arranged vertically one above the other. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mentootlet.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bunches of grapes" class="if uuid-2293091" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2293091.jpg"></div><p>  In order to somehow hide the upper part, artificial grape leaves are glued to the glass.  They can be purchased in stores where artificial plants or flowers are sold, and they are also in the markets.  The top of the crafts is decorated by wrapping a natural rope or straw.  You can snap an additional decorative element.  In our sample, this is a ceramic grape leaf. </p><h2>  Combining decoration techniques </h2><p>  How to make a decorative bottle with your own hands, you already understand.  But what to choose?  If you can not decide on the option of decorating containers for decorating the kitchen, then you can advise combining them in one craft. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pianotiles.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="combination of technology" class="if uuid-2293358" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2293358.jpg"></div><p>  For example, you can paint the entire surface of the bottle with acrylics, making strips of a different, contrasting color.  Kitchen furniture will help you choose a color scheme.  If your kitchen is decorated in plain low-key colors - beige or light green, then the decorative bottles can be bright in color to stand out from the general situation. </p><p>  After staining and applying the main background, you can begin to work further.  We take a natural rope and, smearing a little glass of the bottle, wrap it around.  Beautifully decorated with ropes strips, but you can fill most of the surface.  Then it will be beautiful to apply an additional element to the central part of the decorative bottle.  The sample in the article shows that the middle is framed by a heart made of ropes of a different color. </p><p>  Several layers of twine are applied on the neck, and on its edge you can attach a shell found in the summer on the sea coast. </p><p>  As you can see, it‚Äôs easy to do beautiful things for interior decoration, and a lot of material will not work.  But how spectacular they will look in your kitchen.  All the attention of guests to such crafts is provided to you.  Collect bottles of non-standard shape, buy the necessary materials and get to work!  You will surely succeed, even if you create such a craft for the first time.  Good luck and creative ideas! </p>
