    <p>  The great leap of economic recovery in the 1930s, and then in the post-war years, allowed us not only to avoid the fate <span>of the third world countries,</span> but to make it one of the most highly developed in the world.  This could not have been achieved if there had been no colossal national industriousness and literally a cult of labor created in the Union.  It is not surprising that the Veteran of Labor medal became not just an occasion for pride, but almost the most significant award of the country, recognition of the greatest merits for the good of the fatherland.  In its significance, it did not surpass, perhaps, only <span>military awards,</span> celebrating the exploits of the Great Patriotic War. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Veteran of Labor medal and its history</strong> </p><p>  The order establishing this award was adopted by the Soviet leadership in 1974.  His strength remained until the collapse of the state in 1991.  Interestingly, over all these years, the Veteran of Labor medal was published in more than 39 thousand copies.  This number is very, very large.  However, the mass does not detract from its merits.  This regalia was a very valuable and <span>honorable</span> distinction.  And such a large volume of circulation is explained by the following fact.  The Veteran of Labor medal was received in all spheres of activity of the Soviet state: scientists, collective farmers, directors of machine-building enterprises and machine tool workers, officers and school teachers could be awarded this award.  It is interesting that in society it was also ironically called the ‚ÄúOrder of Sutulov,‚Äù which was a hint of postural defects caused by many years of </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Veteran Labor Certificate" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/223041.jpg" width="340"></div>  labor and retirement.

    <p>  The Veteran of Labor medal was made of brass (a mixture of copper and zinc), and silver-plated on the surface.  On the obverse of this product, the name of the state ‚Äî the USSR ‚Äî was written in convex letters, on which the country's coat of arms ‚Äî the sickle and hammer ‚Äî was placed on top.  Under this image was a laurel branch, which was surrounded in a semicircle with the inscription ‚ÄúVeteran of Labor‚Äù.  The reverse of the product had absolutely no relief.  It was matte with the inscription on it: "For long-term conscientious work."  It is believed that the medal had some varieties, cast in different years, its variants could differ from each other.  All regalia were registered, therefore, a certificate for the medal "Veteran of Labor" was issued without fail.  Unfortunately, the deplorable situation of the population in the 1990s, especially pensioners, led to the widespread trade in these regalia, which in our time have become not a well-deserved distinction, but only a collection item. </p>
