    <h2>  The origin of the name of the city </h2><p>  For the first time the word "Maykop" is found in Russian military documents from the time of the Caucasian War of 1810. It was then that the Maykop Gorge, the Maykop Heights, were first mentioned. </p><p>  There are two versions of the origin of the name of the city.  From Adyghe the word "Maykop" can be translated as "Valley of apples".  This name included all the beauty and tenderness with which residents relate to their city.  According to the second version, the name came from a mountain bearing this name, which means Meot mountain in translation from Meot (the ancient language of the Indo-Aryan group). </p>

    <h2>  City Formation </h2><p>  Maykop originally originated as a military town.  This happened in 1825.  On the Belaya River, the military found a place to build a fortified settlement (later Maikop will be here), where the future city was laid against Taglik Mountain.  During his education, martial law was introduced.  In principle, it was a military fortress. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After 45 years, Maykop becomes a county town.  The territory of Adygea has officially been part of Russia since 1556, this happened after the marriage of Ivan the Terrible to the daughter of the Kabardian prince Temryuk.  With all the good attitude of the Circassians to the Russians, the majority of the Circassian population (Muslims) went to Turkey during the Caucasian War due to the difference in religion. </p><p>  The military could not be in Maykop for a long time, where the civilian population grew due to immigrants and Circassians, so martial law was subsequently changed to urban (estate self-government), according to which registered citizens of all classes could elect a city duma. </p>
