    <h2>  Device Overview </h2><p>  We will learn the basic facts about the device. </p><p>  Many experts in the field of photography technology pay attention, first of all, to the equipment of the device with two high-performance Digic 6 processors. Another significant advantage of the device is the availability of powerful autofocus, which is capable of supporting a large number of cross-points.  The camera implements a combined exposure metering mechanism - RGB indices and infrared light are taken into account. </p><p>  The device has the highest automatic shooting speed, which is 10 frames per second.  Experts note that the device in question has a technologically advanced, relatively quiet shutter, with a resource of about 200 thousand cycles.  The minimum shutter speed is 1/8000 seconds.  Thus, the device can rightly be attributed to one of the most advanced developments from Canon. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Modifications to the device: Body and Kit </h2><p>  It can be noted that there are two main modifications of the Canon EOS 7D Mark II camera on the market - Body and Kit.  The first comes without a lens - and this is their main difference.  The Canon EOS 7D Mark II Body can be equipped with a wide variety of optical elements of the appropriate type.  The main thing is that they fit the bayonet mount. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Let's study the main characteristics of the Canon 7D Mark II.  These can be represented in the following spectrum: </p><p>  - the camera is classified as SLR; </p><p>  - the device supports interchangeable lenses that have an EF / EF-S mount; </p><p>  - the resolution of the <span>matrix of the camera</span> is 20.0 million pixels (of which effective - 20.2 million pixels); </p><p>  - crop factor of the device has a value of 1.6; </p><p>  - maximum shooting resolution - 5472 by 3648 pixels; </p><p>  - the matrix of the camera belongs to the type of CMOS; </p><p>  - camera sensitivity - from 100 to 3200 ISO, a number of advanced values ‚Äã‚Äãare supported; </p><p>  - <span>white balance</span> can be adjusted automatically, manually or selected from a list; </p><p>  - the camera has a built-in flash, effective when shooting at a distance of 11 meters from the subject; </p><p>  - the speed of automatic shooting activated on the device is 10 frames per second, the maximum number of pictures in a series is 130 if they are presented in <span>JPEG format,</span> 24 if they are recorded in RAW; </p><p>  - the camera is equipped with an LCD display with a diagonal of 3 inches and a resolution of 1 MP; </p><p>  - camera exposure is 30 - 1/8000 seconds, if necessary, the shutter speed can be manually adjusted; </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  - the device is able to use 65 cross points when focusing; </p><p>  - the device can be controlled using the remote control; </p><p>  - the camera can record video in <span>MOV</span> and MP4 <span>formats</span> in a maximum resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels and a recording speed of 60 frames per second, in HD mode - the rate can be reduced to 50; </p><p>  - the maximum size of a video file created when using the camera is 4 GB, which corresponds to a movie duration of 29 minutes. </p><p>  We will now study the features of the appearance of the device. </p><h2>  The appearance of the camera </h2><p>  Magnesium materials are used in the design of the camera body, and this is understandable based on the price segment in which the manufacturer positions the device.  The build quality of the device is up to par.  Note that the device is manufactured directly in Japan - its production is not given for a contract to other Asian states.  Of course, today the difference in assembly quality in the country where the brand is registered and the state in which the equipment is assembled for economic reasons is not so great.  But for the connoisseur of photography technology, where the device is assembled is often no less important than the prestige of the brand. </p>

    <p>  The Canon 7D Mark II's video finder is located just above the screen.  To the left of the display is a built-in microphone.  To the right of the screen is a video recording button that allows you to simultaneously select the shooting mode.  Nearby are autofocus controls, focus settings.  The built-in flash is located in the central part of the device.  A GPS antenna is installed in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãit. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Device Management Features </h2><p>  It will be useful to consider the specifics of controlling the apparatus in question.  First of all, it is possible to note the presence on the device of a number of innovative tools - such as, for example, a navipad that functions according to the sensory principle, a special button with which the user can compare 2 captured frames. </p>

    <p>  It is also worth paying attention to the fact that in the device you can set individual settings in 3 modes.  There are not many buttons on the camera - but this is partly explained by the fact that they are multifunctional - depending on the position of the control switch, the key starts to answer for one or another option.  In addition, a significant part of the functions is called up through the program menu, and there is little sense in associating separate buttons with them. </p><h2>  Viewfinder Nuances </h2><p>  You can consider some of the nuances of using a Canon 7D Mark II element, such as the viewfinder.  Its main feature is that it allows the photographer to see an area of ‚Äã‚Äãspace that is fully consistent with the frame.  In addition, the viewfinder allows you to enlarge the image.  The viewfinder screen displays data on key settings of the camera - such as, for example, white balance, autofocus options, and the format of the recorded file.  The functionality of the Canon 7D Mark II viewfinder allows in many cases not to use the device display.  Actually, we now consider its most remarkable properties. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  Speaking about the display, first of all, it can be noted quite large even for devices of this type, the diagonal is 3 inches.  Resolution, in turn, is quite standard - 1 megapixel.  The display of the Canon 7D Mark II (user reviews and experts presented on thematic online portals confirm this) has excellent viewing angles, excellent contrast, brightness and color reproduction.  In addition, the screen of the device is very well protected from external influences and has an anti-reflective coating. </p><h2>  Software interface </h2><p>  The photographer, working with the display of the device, will constantly use the program interface of the camera.  What is its specificity?  As many experts note, Canon 7D Mark II cameras, in terms of the structure of the program interface, are not too different from other popular models of SLR devices from Canon.  But there are still certain differences between the software installed in the device in question and its analogues.  For example, in the interface of the device in question, certain tabs are displayed as a square.  Moreover, the one selected by the user is painted in the color of the active section.  In general, the Canon EOS 7D Mark II software interface (user reviews confirm this) works quickly, without failures, and allows the photographer to quickly get to the desired setting. </p>

    <h2>  Features of the operation of the device </h2><p>  We will study the main features of using the camera in question.  First of all, it can be noted that the Canon EOS 7D Mark II device - the price and characteristics of the device to some extent testify to this - in principle, it is legitimate to classify as amateur cameras.  In a similar way, the brand manufacturer itself positions it on the market.  But with the involvement of the device in question, many professional tasks can also be successfully solved.  This is possible, in particular, due to the camera supporting a number of remarkable functions. </p><h2>  HDR mode specifics </h2><p>  Among those are options available in HDR mode.  They, for example, allow the camera user to combine 3 frames when the exposure is activated in several steps.  HDR mode allows you to impose various effects on images - for example, add a relief.  It is noteworthy that the options under consideration can be used when recording images in both file formats that the Canon EOS 7D Mark II - JPG and RAW supports.  In addition, not only ready-made processed frames can be stored in the device‚Äôs memory, but also all those that were captured individually by the device. </p>

      <p></p>
    <h2>  Multiple exposure </h2><p>  Another noteworthy feature of the device in question is the multiple exposure.  It allows you to combine from 2 to 9 captured frames with different exposures in various modes - for example, higher or lower brightness.  In the memory of the camera, again, the results of processing files or each frame individually can be recorded. </p><h2>  Features of the GPS module </h2><p>  The device in question has a built-in GPS module - many competing solutions are not equipped with the corresponding component.  Among the most popular functions of this module is fixing the geographical coordinates of the image.  Also, the interfaces of this hardware component allow recording the coordinates of the device‚Äôs movement with a certain interval - for example, 1, 5, 30, 300 seconds, in the camera‚Äôs memory.  The GPS module also has a compass function. </p>

    <h2>  The effectiveness of the device in practice </h2><p>  Now let's look at how the Canon 7d Mark II device works in practice.  A review of the capabilities of the camera, compiled by us, will be incomplete without studying this aspect. </p><p>  First of all, it can be noted that the device during operation fully complies with one of the most important characteristics that are declared by the manufacturer - automatic shooting speed of 10 frames per second.  Of course, we are talking about photographing, followed by recording frames in JPG format.  But even with this camera engagement mode, few competing solutions are capable of providing a similar indicator.  To ensure the stability of recording frames that are shot automatically, it is desirable to use fast memory cards - best of all, those that work in the SDHC standard. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that photographing in automatic mode, launched by the user, can be carried out by the device until the memory resource runs out.  In turn, when recording files in RAW format using the appropriate type of shooting, you can get a sequence of about 34 frames.  If you use a combination of JPEG and RAW, then this indicator is reduced to about 24 frames.  In this case, a criterion such as the buffer capacity of the camera also plays.  But it decreases as the ISO used increases. </p>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Regarding the focusing speed of the device, its indicator is fixed in the interval between 0.18 and 0.31 seconds.  This indicator can also be considered as more than decent. </p><h2>  How much does a camera cost? </h2><p>  How much does a Canon EOS 7D Mark II device cost?  The price of the camera in the catalogs of Russian retailers is about 85-90 thousand rubles.  How much does it justify the corresponding cost in its capabilities?  First of all, it should be borne in mind that the price put on the Canon 7D Mark II camera in Russia as a whole correlates with the cost of the device also abroad, and therefore greatly depends on the ruble exchange rate against foreign currencies.  Which, as you know, has recently declined significantly.
