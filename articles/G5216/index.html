In order to bring an element of the fabulous into these holidays, we have developed the custom of decorating our houses, offices and courtyards with various toys, garlands, and symbols.  And if it used to be popular to buy toys and jewelry in the store, now at the peak of popularity is hand made, that is, things made by yourself.  And this means only one thing: we must also learn to do something similar in order to <span>be in trend.</span>  Although scientists believe that it‚Äôs even useful for people to make decorations for their Christmas tree and home, because the process itself has a positive effect on their <span>emotional state.</span>  So the ideal option for you is to create a festive mood for yourself by carving snowflakes on windows, sticking garlands, folding various figures from snow-white paper.  If you are tuned in to a fashionable hand-made wave, then we are ready to help you with practical advice.  So, let's put together something fabulous and incredibly beautiful - this is an origami angel. </p><p>  There are many varieties of paper Christmas angels, including the <span>modular origami</span> angel.  Each of them is beautiful and unique in its own way.  Therefore, we will consider several options for creating this figure.  So, first you need to decide what kind of origami angel you like, and only then look for the appropriate scheme. </p><p>  It is advisable that you, when creating your little Christmas masterpiece, rely not only on the diagram and step-by-step drawings, but also necessarily watch videos of various master classes on this topic.  This will help you better navigate when working with paper and be in the subject. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, how can we use our Angel origami craft? </p><p>  Origami Christmas angel has always been a classic home decoration for Christmas and New Year.  Let us recall the old traditions, but we will make the New Year‚Äôs angel in a new way - according to the modular scheme of paper.  What does modular mean?  This folding of different individual parts without the aid of glue.  For beginners, a simple scheme of an origami angel is more suitable.Therefore, we will first consider this option from a single sheet of paper. </p><p>  Fold half the sheet, then again.  After this we unfold the paper - two cross-shaped bends should turn out.  Then we bend all the corners to the center, turn the craft over.  We extend the pocket and begin to give the central part the shape of the head.  Then again we turn two corners to the right and to the left - these will be two wings.  Origami is ready.  It can be hung on a string, the figure will flutter in the wind. </p><p>  Origami "Angel" in a modular way can be done as follows: </p><p>  For simplicity in explanation, we will divide folding into stages - modules.  So, for the first module you will need blue paper, with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã20 by 20 centimeters.  For stage 2 - you need yellow paper - this will be a rectangle with a perimeter of 21 by 12 cm. Then the third module is also yellow <span>paper measuring</span> 5 by 15 centimeters, the fourth module contains a rectangle of white paper with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 9 by 30 centimeters. </p><p>  If you are familiar with the origami technique, then you should not have any problems with the assembly.  So, you will need to make the following parts: head, halo, wings - 2 pieces and a conical dress.  An angel's outfit can be made in the same way as an <span>origami</span> flower <span>vase</span> , only in this case the vase will be used upside down.  We sculpt the head on the principle of puppetry.  Then with paints we draw a pretty face to our little angel.  The main thing is that he turn out to be good-natured.  Wings are made of 4 or 8 paper feathers - you should know how to make them.  You can additionally stick hair to the head, and decorate the paper nimbus with shiny sequins.  This cute angel can be made of multi-colored paper, but you need to make sure that the paper is the same color on both sides. </p><p>  Let your origami angel please your eye, set it up for positive and give you a good mood!  And most importantly, let him become your guardian angel! </p>
