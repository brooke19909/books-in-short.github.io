  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Digestion in the oral cavity</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Digestion of food is a rather complicated process, which boils down to the breakdown of large molecules of proteins, fats and carbons into monomers, which are easily absorbed by the cells of the body.  In different parts of the digestive tract, various compounds break down, which are then absorbed by the mucosa of the small intestine and spread throughout the body.  Digestion in the oral cavity begins. </p><p>  Before considering how digestion occurs in the <span>oral cavity,</span> it is necessary to at least briefly familiarize yourself with its structure. </p><p>  <strong>The structure of the oral cavity</strong> </p><p><strong></strong>  In anatomy, it is customary to divide the <span>oral cavity</span> into two sections: </p><ul><li>  The vestibule of the mouth (the space between the lips and teeth); </li><li>  Actually the oral cavity (limited by teeth, bone sky and the diaphragm of the mouth); </li></ul><p>  Each element of the oral cavity has its own function and is responsible for a certain process of food processing. </p><p>  Teeth are responsible for the machining of solid foods.  With the help of fangs and incisors, a person bites off food, then crushes it <span>with</span> small <span>molars</span> .  The function of large molars comes down to grinding products. </p><p>  The tongue is a large muscular organ that attaches to the bottom of the oral cavity.  Language is involved not only in food processing, but also in speech processes.  Moving, this muscular organ mixes the crushed food with saliva and forms a food lump.  In addition, it is in the tissues of the tongue that taste, temperature, pain and mechanical receptors are located. </p><p>  Salivary glands - the parotid, sublingual and <span>submandibular glands</span> enter the oral cavity through the ducts.  Their main function is the production and elimination of saliva, which is of great importance for digestion.  The functions of saliva are as follows: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Digestive (saliva contains enzymes by which the breakdown of carbon is carried out); </li><li>  Protective (saliva contains lysozyme, which has strong bactericidal properties. In addition, saliva includes immunoglobulins and blood coagulation factors. Saliva protects the oral cavity from drying out); </li><li>  Excretory (with saliva, substances such as urea, salts, alcohol, some medicinal substances are released); </li></ul><p>  <strong>Digestion in the oral cavity: mechanical phase</strong> </p><p><strong></strong>  A wide variety of food can enter the oral cavity and, depending on its consistency, it either immediately passes into the esophagus during an act of swallowing (drinks, liquid food), or undergoes mechanical processing, which facilitates further digestion processes. </p><p>  As already mentioned, with the help of teeth, food is ground.  Tongue movements are needed to mix chewed foods with saliva.  Under the influence of saliva, food softens and is enveloped in mucus.  Mucin, which is contained in saliva, takes part in the formation of the food lump, which subsequently passes into the esophagus. </p><p>  <strong>Digestion in the oral cavity: enzymatic phase</strong> </p><p><strong></strong>  The <span>composition of saliva</span> also includes some enzymes that are involved in the breakdown of polymers.  In the oral cavity, the cleavage of carbon occurs, which continues in the small intestine. </p><p>  Saliva contains a complex of enzymes called ptyalin.  Under their influence, the decomposition of polysaccharides to disaccharides occurs (mainly, this is maltose).  Subsequently, maltose under the influence of another enzyme breaks down to glucose monosaccharide. </p><p>  The longer the food is in the oral cavity and lends itself to enzymatic action, the easier it is to digest it in all other parts of the herbal tract.  That's why doctors always recommend chewing food as long as possible. </p><p>  On this, digestion in the oral cavity ends.  The food lump passes further and, getting to the root of the tongue, starts the reflex swallowing process, in which food passes into the esophagus and subsequently enters the stomach. </p><p>  To summarize, processes such as grinding food, analyzing its taste, wetting with saliva, mixing and primary breakdown of carbohydrates occur in the oral cavity. </p>
