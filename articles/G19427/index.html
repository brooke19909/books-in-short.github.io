  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Chemist stadium in Kemerovo for children and adults</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the pre-war era, sports began to develop in our country at an accelerated pace.  Many songs, poems, literary works and films have appeared in honor of sports achievements.  The result of this promotion was the emergence of numerous stadiums and sports fields throughout the country.  In almost every courtyard, a place was reserved for playing soccer or hockey, as well as ice rinks for figure skating.  Horizontal bars were the main attribute of the Soviet classical court.  But professional athletes were not forgotten.  Each city, not even the largest, could boast of its own stadium.  It held training, championships, friendly matches. </p><h2>  First post-war reconstruction </h2><p>  So in the city of Kemerovo was allocated a place for the construction of the stadium.  Initially, it was just a field surrounded by a fence.  In the summer they played football, and in the winter they poured an ice rink.  In the same field, a football team called Nitrogen conducted its training.  The stadium "Chemist" in Kemerovo was wooden and was located from west to east. </p><div class="photo" data-original="oldkemerovo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="stadium Chemist Kemerovo ice rink" class="if uuid-2256178" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43507/2256178.jpg"></div><p>  In 1948, during a grand reconstruction, the location of the sports venue changed, the stadium began to settle down from south to north.  The stadium itself became stone, and the team received the same name.  He was beautiful and pompous, like all similar buildings of the Stalin era. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Concrete bowl and the Kuzbass team </h2><p>  The project of the architect Donbai L.I. was a success, the stadium accommodated 5,000 people at a time and looked like a real gymnasium with beautiful, majestic columns and arches.  By the end of the 70s, another reconstruction was carried out, then the stadium "Chemist" in Kemerovo found a concrete bowl.  Due to this, the capacity of this sports facility has increased to 30,000 people. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kemerovo.wikimapia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kemerovo Stadium Chemist today" class="if uuid-2256176" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43507/2256176.jpg"></div><p>  During the reconstruction, almost all buildings were redone; the Khimik stadium in Kemerovo became the international sports arena, the largest in the Siberian region.  The host team of this stadium changed its name and became known as Kuzbass.  The stadium has already held hundreds of ball hockey matches. </p><h2>  Brandy World Championship </h2><p>  Here were held football tournaments with a ball for the prizes of the newspaper Sovetskaya Rossiya, numerous regional matches and championships.  In 2003, a compressor station was built at the stadium.  With its help, it was possible to maintain the required quality of artificial ice (even if it was summer outside).  True, the outside temperature should not have risen more than 15 degrees above zero. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.stadion-himik.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Chemist Kemerovo stadium schedule" class="if uuid-2257624" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43507/2257624.jpg"></div><p>  Therefore, training and sports at the rink of the stadium "Chemists" in Kemerovo take place all year round.  A little later, an indoor module was rebuilt, where 3000 spectators can be simultaneously.  This happened in 2007, before the World Brandy Championship, which was held at the Khimik stadium in Kemerovo.  This championship was won by Russia.  And the indoor module has been used for everyone to skate in any season. </p><h2>  Sport involvement </h2><p>  Today, the Chemist stadium in Kemerovo is an international arena where ball hockey matches are held.  But they don‚Äôt forget about football and classic ice hockey here either.  In addition, the stadium also has a gym for everyone who wants to have a slim body.  In total, four halls are equipped for classes, each of which has cardiovascular equipment and power equipment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tambov.kp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="stadium Chemist Kemerovo" class="if uuid-2256179" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43507/2256179.jpg"></div><p>  Exercise in the gym "Physics" is possible both individually and in a group that trains in a separate room.  In the summer, a stadium for children of all ages is open on the territory of the stadium.  There are specially equipped slides, horizontal bars, stairs for children's fun.  The staff of the stadium is watching over the order, and parents are allowed to be near the children and observe them.  A velodrome and a rollerdrome are recommended for visiting.  This is where true pleasure and any teenager will rightly appreciate the quality of coverage of these sites. </p><h2>  Ice skating </h2><p>  The stadium often hosts charity events and interesting programs in which you can take a lively part and enjoy.  Despite the fact that entrance to the skating rink of the Khimik stadium in Kemerovo is paid, children from orphanages and boarding schools get the right to go out on ice for free as part of a charity program.  Going out onto the ice, anyone can get the opportunity to ride with an experienced instructor.  At the same time, the schedule at the Chemist stadium in Kemerovo should be taken into account, because during training and competitions, mass skating does not take place.  At any time of the year, the stadium hosts numerous promotions and sweepstakes.  High quality equipment of the ice rink allows for unique holiday performances and ice performances.  Every year, the stadium hosts the festival of children's creativity among children from orphanages "Good Childhood", the children enthusiastically show their capabilities and talents.  At the same time, both the participants of the Festival and the organizers receive positive emotions. </p>
