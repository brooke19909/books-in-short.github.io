    <h2>  What are the footprints? </h2><p>  Experienced needlewomen make money by creating unique tracks from different yarns (thin for the summer, more dense for the cold).  Want to join them?  Or do you just dream of learning how to make such products yourself?  In any case, you need to figure out how to knit the henchmen.  With a description, this is easy to do.  Then we will not waste precious time, let's get started.  So what is a footprint? </p><p>  Allen Erwin Gant is considered to be the inventor of the first factory-made stockings such as heirs.  He was the manager of the Glen Ravin Mills textile factory in North Carolina.  Although they say that in fact the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating comfortable stockings belongs to his wife - Ethel Gant.  Recall the French favorite saying - cherche la femme ("look for a woman"). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Footprints (second name) - a practical product that covers the feet completely.  Usually it is made in a classic style or using various knitting techniques.  The main difference between the sock and the socks is the lack of gum on the ankle.  A characteristic feature is their shape in the form of a ‚Äúboat‚Äù that fits snugly against the foot.  Many are familiar with shortened hosiery made from cotton material.  So the underlings are their copy. </p><h2>  What are the benefits of the followers? </h2><p>  Based on this, the practicality and universality of such things becomes clear: </p><ul><li>  protection against mechanical damage to the skin that can provoke the appearance of corns (small pebbles trying to get into sandals will no longer cause discomfort, and new shoes will not rub your feet); </li><li>  their use allows you to emphasize femininity (you must admit, because neat lace, barely noticeable under the shoes, looks very stylish); </li><li>  thanks to them, you can correctly complete the image (no longer have to think about how to hide the elastic from socks, putting on shortened trousers); </li><li>  products made of cotton and natural materials allow the skin to breathe, preventing overheating processes (remove sweat, leaving the legs dry); </li><li>  warm products warm the colds in the season (it is convenient to wear them under shortened boots or boots - not visible, but warm). </li></ul><p>  Can't figure out what the knitted heels look like with knitting needles?  The photos below will help correct the situation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to distinguish between footsteps and other knitted things? </h2><p>  It remains to remember that the footprints <span>knitted with</span> needles differ from <span>knitted slippers.</span>  What does this consist of?  Here are a few differences: </p><ul><li>  knitted footrests fit tightly on the leg; </li><li>  there is a minimum of seams on them (to avoid injury to the delicate skin of the legs). </li></ul><p>  It is worth noting that products connected by a seamless method are ideal.  Next will be presented a variety of workshops "How to knit the undersea knitting needles" for beginner needlewomen. </p>

    <p>  If you are a pro in this matter, then do not rush to close the article, because as you familiarize yourself with the review, you will get the opportunity to expand your knowledge by becoming acquainted with new patterns and knitting techniques for hosiery. </p><h2>  Seamless footsteps </h2><p>  Before you start knitting the footrest with knitting needles, you need to prepare the necessary materials.  This is any yarn (depending on your wishes), approximately 100-150 g, and number 3.5 knitting needles on a fishing line. </p><p>  Walkthrough: </p><ol><li>  <span>Knitting of the followers with</span> knitting needles begins with a set of a certain number of loops.  Since we are giving a master class on foot size 36-37, we dial fifty-two loops.  Carefully count each row so as not to make a mistake with the length. </li><li>  Knit four rows with an elastic band (one front, one wrong side).  Tip: remove the first loop, and knit the last back; only then you will get a beautiful edge of the product, which is not a shame to show and convenient to use when stitching individual parts. </li><li>  Next, start knitting with the front stitch (in even rows all the loops are front, in odd rows the wrong) according to the following pattern: one row - one hem (remove), twenty-four front, yarn, two front, yarn, twenty-four front, one edge (wrong side) )  The second row - according to the figure, the third row - one hem, twenty-five facial, yarn, two facial, yarn, twenty-five facial, one hem.  The fourth row - according to the drawing. </li><li>  The next row must be tied with purl loops.  It turns out that you need to add loops along the central part of the canvas, and to do this very carefully and accurately.  Therefore, it remains for you to continue knitting until you get six increase loops (eleven rows). </li></ol><h2>  Front knit pattern </h2><p>  Next, proceed to the rest of the details.  So, in order to connect the front part of the product, it is necessary to perform each step of the scheme in turn: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  Knit thirty-seven loops face, then combine the next two loops.  After that, expand the knitting and, forming the wrong loops, knit twelve pieces, and combine the next two.  Continue work until fourteen stitches remain on the knitting needles.  After that, knit the row to the end with purl stitches.  As a result of the manipulations you will get a practically ready track (it remains to make a beautiful heel). </li><li>  Make a set of purl loops from the remaining hem.  You will get eight pieces on each side.  Now you just need to continue knitting according to the scheme described earlier (decrease in the foot).  Work continues until there are two loops left on each side intended for reduction. </li><li>  Continue to decrease, changing the front surface to an elastic band (one front loop, one back loop). </li><li>  Close the hinges in a way convenient for you, and hide the sticking tails with a hook or needle. </li><li>  So one follower is ready.  The second one also fits.  If desired, you can sew crocheted flowers to them. </li></ol><p>  That's so simple, and most importantly, without seams, you can knit the heels with knitting needles.  If you easily repeated the master class and were satisfied with the result, then you can safely include imagination and create your masterpieces using famous patterns. </p><h2>  Recommendations </h2><p>  Be careful when sewing loops so as not to change the density of knitting.  If you cannot connect the loops accurately, that is, without a hole, then dial plus one additional loop, and when approaching the next row, throw it on a new knitting needle, and already from it drop the loop on the main canvas. </p><p>  Important: be careful with the foot, it should always remain even (smooth), so as not to cause discomfort when wearing the finished product.  If you wish, you can strengthen it by adding an additional thread.  This solution allows your product to remain intact longer. </p><p>  Woolen yarn must be knitted in two threads.  And when changing colors, cross the threads on the wrong side of the work.  Do not change the direction of knitting until the toe. </p>

    <h2>  Workshop: knitting footprints on 5 knitting needles </h2><p>  To get stylish and neat hosiery, you need to prepare: </p><ul><li>  knitting needles - 5 pcs.; </li><li>  yarn - according to your desire (not less than 100 g). </li></ul><p>  Those needlewomen who are familiar with the technique of knitting classic socks on five needles can easily repeat this master class.  If you are just starting your way into creativity, then pay attention to accuracy when completing the steps (otherwise you can get the product in the wrong shape or size). </p><p>  Walkthrough: </p><ol><li>  Knitting the underlings with knitting needles starts with a set of thirty loops. </li><li>  Using a garter stitch, you need to knit fifteen rows. </li><li>  Divide the canvas into three knitting needles.  Start making loops, leaving the central part constant.  To do this, you have to knit together the last loop of the central part and the first side.  So do just four rows.  You have formed a heel. </li><li>  It remains to dial another ten loops on an additional knitting needle and knit about eight centimeters with the front surface. </li><li>  Re-start the reduction of loops according to the already known method. </li><li>  It remains to divide the canvas into two equal parts.  With further knitting, it is necessary to carefully shorten the rows, knitting the extreme two loops together. </li><li>  Close the remaining loops, knitting them in two, and hide the tail of yarn. </li><li>  Repeat steps one through seven to get a second item.  Knockers are ready for knitting. </li></ol><p>  Harness with a hook.  If you wish, you can add decor - flowers, beads, sew on ribbons, etc. Usually it seems to many that it‚Äôs very difficult to knit small details.  For the first time, you can use the hook, because with it it is much easier to knit volumetric decorative elements without seams.  Do not be afraid to show imagination.  This method of knitting is slightly different from the first, because a larger number of knitting needles are used in the work, therefore, you need to work carefully, be sure to follow the front and back side of the future product. </p><h2>  Master class: footsteps with a Norwegian pattern </h2><p>  Any needlewoman will be able to connect the original and beautiful footsteps if she understands the scheme and correctly calculates the number of loops.  How to make a correct calculation?  There is only one way out: to tie a probe (a square-shaped cloth with a side length of ten centimeters).  After knitting, it remains to count the number of loops and rows.  For example, you got twenty-four loops and the same number of rows, which means that to get tracks of size 36-37 you will have to dial about thirty-two loops.  The knitting pattern for the under-heels is shown in the photo below. </p>

    <p>  An undoubted advantage of this particular scheme is the presence of decoding of symbols, which significantly saves the time of the needlewoman.  Therefore, there should be no problems with reading the circuit.  To knit such interesting undersea knitting needles, you need only a few components.  These are yarn of two colors (preferably wool), knitting needles No. 3 and a hook for tying the finished product. </p><p>  Important: correctly calculate the loops (this will help the exact layout of the followers with knitting needles), because the tracks should sit neatly on their feet. </p><h2>  Baby footsteps </h2><p>  Caring for the health of the children begins with keeping the legs warm, therefore, the connected footprints with knitting needles are a great gift for the crumbs.  Such products will be used often: at home, on a walk, even at night.  You can tie them for your children or give a friend who is waiting for the baby.  Such footsteps will be a pleasant surprise, because they create an unforgettable atmosphere of tenderness and will keep the warmth of my mother‚Äôs hands. </p><p>  How to make original and comfortable tracks for the baby? </p><p>  First, you need to determine the size of the foot, and then choose the right yarn.  It can be wool, acrylic, mohair or even cashmere.  Looking ahead, we will stipulate that hypoallergenic children's wool is best suited.  It allows the baby‚Äôs delicate skin to breathe and does not cause any allergic reactions. </p><p>  And secondly, you should decide which technique to knit.  For beginner needlewomen, it is recommended to choose simpler methods.  One of the most favorite ways is a cross-shaped set of loops of thread (in other words, the Bulgarian conception).  Its advantage is that it is performed very simply with the help of two knitting needles and, unlike openwork or tubular dialing, does not require much time.  Products associated with this method are voluminous, neat, dense and pleasant to the touch. </p>

    <p>  Your attention is represented by knitting of the followers with knitting needles with a description of: </p><ol><li>  Draw thirty-six stitches on the knitting needles and knit them according to the following pattern about fifteen centimeters: twelve front, one wrong side, eleven front, one wrong side, twelve front. </li><li>  Change the pattern to an elastic band (alternate one front and two wrong loops) and knit in this way twelve centimeters.  Important: remember about the edge loops - first to remove, last to perform the wrong.  Using this advice, you will forget about what are the nodules at the edges of the finished product. </li><li>  Reduce the loops.  To do this, you will have to repeat the following manipulation several times: on the front side of the fabric throughout the row, knit three loops together, on the wrong side - according to the drawing or your finished pattern. </li><li>  It remains only to tighten the thread and carry out the final stitching of the workpiece.  A hook is perfect for this manipulation.  If you are uncomfortable with crochet stitching, you can use a thread with a needle.  Try to make the seams less convex, so as not to injure the delicate skin of the child when wearing the footprints. </li><li>  Repeat the master class from the first step to get a second heir. </li></ol><p>  Important: you should use special children's yarn, it costs a little more, but is considered hypoallergenic and therefore does not create any discomfort when it comes into contact with the baby‚Äôs delicate skin. </p>
