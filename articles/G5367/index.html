Beach holidays in July</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Where to relax in July at sea?  A similar question at the beginning of the holiday season is one of the most relevant for the vast majority of tourists.  The desire to plan a route in advance and determine the country of visit is quite understandable.  In the middle of summer, comfortable conditions for recreation do not exist in every region.  What, then, to stop at, where to go?  What to choose: domestic south or direction a little further? </p><h2>  General recommendations: beginning of the month </h2><p>  So where to go in July to the sea?  If you are going to relax in the early days of the month, it is recommended to pay attention to countries such as Turkey, Montenegro, Greece and Cyprus.  In the first decade of July it is still moderately hot, and the sea heats up to the most optimal temperature.  In just a couple of weeks, the air will reach maximum levels, and being in resorts can hardly be pleasant, especially if tourists and children go on a trip. </p>

    <h2>  Where better not to go? </h2><p>  Answering the question of where to go to the sea in July, it is important to immediately discard the least comfortable tourist destinations.  A large number of tourists arrives very short-sighted and acquires permits in the most <span>popular countries,</span> not taking into account their climatic features.  It's about Egypt and Thailand.  In the first case, in mid-summer the air temperature reaches its maximum, and intolerable heat reigns everywhere (about 45 degrees, the air is very hot and dry).  Such conditions for an unprepared person, and even more so a child, can be not only uncomfortable, but also dangerous to health. </p><p>  In the second case (Thailand) - over the most part of the country there are prolonged rains that make relaxing on the beach a very unpleasant activity.  Of course, there are exceptions to the stated rules.  So, the island of Koh Samui, belonging to the territory of the Kingdom, - may be an ideal option for a vacation in the month of July. </p>
