The population in it exceeded one million inhabitants and therefore, naturally, there is a need to provide all of its Novgorod residents with housing.  The developer Vysokovo (LCD, Nizhny Novgorod) offers an excellent option for acquiring apartments in a premium residential complex. </p>

    <h2>  Location of the complex </h2><p>  In the city center at the intersection of Republican and Poltava streets will be located residential complex "Vysokovo".  This ensures access to a full social and cultural infrastructure.  On the other hand, the complex is located away from noisy highways, such as Belinsky, Vaneeva and Rodionova streets.  This enables its residents to enjoy peace and tranquility. </p><h2>  Description of the complex </h2><p>  What will Vysokovo ultimately be?  LCD (Nizhny Novgorod) is designed in the form of five residential buildings of various floors - from nine to eighteen floors.  In total, 431 apartments are provided.  All houses are built using a monolithic frame technology using the most modern techniques. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Residential complex &quot;Vysokovo&quot;" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/1733556.jpg" width="600"></div>

Separately provided for the construction of underground parking. </p><h2>  Internal infrastructure </h2><p>  Vysokovo (LCD, Nizhny Novgorod) provides for its own infrastructure.  As in almost all newly built residential complexes, in Vysokovo all the first floors are planned by the non-residential developer.  They will be given for the placement of various social facilities: shops, pharmacies, etc. On the territory of the complex will not only be comfortable living, but also relaxing.  The project provides recreation areas, ennobled and landscaped, children's play and sports grounds. </p><p>  Each house has two or three elevators, garbage chutes.  All stoves in the houses are electric.  Apartments will be rented to buyers with a rough finish, which will significantly save the efforts and resources of future owners, and they will not have to spend money on dismantling the old repair.  In addition, this will allow them to realize their ideas about how their home should look. </p>

Therefore, its residents have no problems with social infrastructure facilities.  The very convenient location of the complex right in the center allows its residents to use all the facilities that already exist in the city.  Within walking distance from Vysokovo (ZhK, Nizhny Novgorod) there are a school, hypermarkets, a hospital, public transport stops, bank branches and all kinds of infrastructure. </p><h2>  Regarding ecology </h2><p>  The environmental situation in the Soviet district of Nizhny Novgorod, where the Vysokovo residential complex is located, receives mostly good reviews.  According to statistics, the city has a heavily polluted atmosphere, especially water bodies and groundwater.  From this point of view, Nizhny Novgorod is not the most prosperous place to live. </p>

    <p>  Against the background of all this, Sovetsky district stands out favorably, where there are no industrial enterprises.  Accordingly, in the place that the developer has chosen for the construction of his project, there are no industrial zones.  This means that the air in the area is fresher than in others.  This favorably distinguishes ZhK from a number of similar buildings in other areas. </p><h2>  Build quality </h2><p>  "Vysokovo" (LCD, Nizhny Novgorod) the quality of the buildings erected offers excellent.  Rapidly developing infrastructure, favorable environmental conditions, multi-level underground-ground parking - all this gives special appeal to the residential complex and makes the area prestigious. </p><p>  The reputation of the developer is reliable and unshakable, this is already evidenced by the completed houses, and confirmed by their satisfied residents.  In accordance with the developer‚Äôs project, the premises in the complex are positioned more like business-class housing.  This is due to their layout.  In some rooms there are no <span>partitions between the kitchen and the living room,</span> which allows owners to realize all their wildest ideas and significantly save money on redevelopment. </p><h2>  Apartments and layouts </h2><p>  The developer offers for sale one-room apartments, the total area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich begins with fifty square meters.  Two-room apartments reach 76 m <sup>2,</sup> and three-room apartments fluctuate around one hundred square meters.  Office space will also vary in area. </p>

    <p>  Various layouts of rooms are also provided.  LCD "Vysokovo" offers prices not the highest.  The cost of one square meter varies in the region from sixty seven thousand rubles per square meter of living space. </p><h2>  What customers say </h2><p>  Residential complex "Vysokovo" in Nizhny Novgorod has earned a lot of reviews.  This makes it possible to draw conclusions about the prospects of living in it or about the negative consequences of moving to these residential buildings.  Some people say that the price indicated by the developer for the apartments is unrealistically high for this area and housing of this class.  Someone, on the contrary, believes that the developer provided business-class housing at a very reasonable price. </p><p>  But of course, the presence of multi-level underground and underground parking for many cars, a closed courtyard, which ensures the safety of not only children but also adults, the presence of non-residential premises on the ground floors of buildings adapted for social facilities and designed to ensure the comfortable existence of residents of the complex, quiet , a calm area, located at the same time in the very center of a huge city - all this speaks of the quality of housing. </p>

    <p>  The complex, of course, has its drawbacks, but there are many advantages.  Many did not regret that they had sold their former housing and chose the Vysokovo residential complex as their permanent place of residence.  This is an opportunity to breathe clean air and live in a relatively calm, comfortable environment in the city center and at the same time use all its rich and wide infrastructure.  Thus, those moving here do not break away from their former habitual life, but only enjoy the fullness of comfort provided by the complex and its infrastructure.  Excellent transport accessibility is another big advantage. </p>
