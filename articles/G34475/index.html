  <section class="page js-page"><h1>State concept</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The concept of the state is inextricably linked with the history of its origin and development.  First of all, it is necessary to take into account the goals for which it was created, and those functions that it is called upon to carry out.  Initially, it was created to protect against external enemies, regulate <span>economic relations</span> between the population, satisfy the needs of certain social strata, and also to consolidate power over the conquered peoples.  Subsequently, its functions and goals set before it expanded significantly.  For example, <span>social support</span> began to be provided to poor people, and cultural development of the population was ensured. </p><p>  <strong>State concept</strong> <strong></strong></p><p>  To date, there is no single definition.  Almost all sources contain various interpretations.  What is common to them is that they contain the characteristics of the state: territory, people, and <span>public authority.</span>  Given the fact that the latter, as a rule, is aimed primarily at protecting the interests of certain classes, nationalities, layers and elites, the following generalized concept of the state can be derived.  <span>This is a</span> power <span>organization</span> that arose and develops as a result of economic, social, cultural, spiritual, political and other transformations, contributing to the implementation of national, class, religious and other interests in a certain territory.  The state is the governing system of society, which has a certain structure and mechanism of interaction of its constituent elements. </p><p>  <strong>The concept of the state and its signs</strong> <strong> </strong></p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In order to reveal the concept of the state, it is necessary to establish the signs that it possesses.  These include: </p><ul><li>  territory availability.  The state extends its power and ensures the protection of all people who are its population.  In this regard, the institution of citizenship, as well as citizenship, arose; </li><li>  sovereignty, that is, the independence of the state in international relations and supremacy throughout its territory; </li><li>  the presence of the population, that is, the totality of people living in the country; </li><li>  the presence of state symbols: flag, coat of arms and anthem; </li><li>  the presence of public authority.  To govern the country, a state apparatus is being created, which includes: the police, the army, the courts, etc .; </li><li>  legislation that is necessary to regulate existing relations; </li><li>  a monopoly on the legal use of physical coercion and force; </li><li>  a system of taxes that form the state budget necessary for the material support of the country; </li><li>  a monopoly on representing the interests of the population in the international arena. </li></ul><p>  <strong>The concept of the state</strong> <strong>and its functions</strong> </p><p>  There are internal and <span>external functions of the state.</span>  The former include educational, economic, cultural and educational, social and others.  The second - the country's defense, the function of mutually beneficial cooperation with other states in the cultural, political, economic and other fields. </p><p>  The educational function is aimed at providing citizens with the opportunity to obtain scientific knowledge and mastery of professions.  Economic - is expressed in the regulation of existing commodity-money relations in the country, in ensuring financial stability.  Cultural and educational - is to create conditions to meet the needs of people in the <span>field of spiritual</span> development. </p><p>  The social function is expressed in supporting vulnerable groups of the population, providing those in need with housing, work, providing free education and medicine, etc.  The constitutions of many countries enshrined the concept of a social state (including the Russian Federation), whose policy is aimed at creating and ensuring conditions for a decent life and free human development. </p>
