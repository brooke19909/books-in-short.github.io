Located by the Pacific Ocean, it is adjacent to the states of Idaho, California, Washington and Nevada.  Here you can see deserts, steppes and mountains, stunning beauty of the lake and sleeping volcanoes.  There are several nature reserves, cave complexes and turbulent rivers.  There is still controversy over the name Oregon.  The main existing version says that the word means ‚Äúhurricane‚Äù in translation from French.  But not all language scholars agree with this assumption. </p>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚ÄãOregon is approximately 250 thousand square kilometers, and it is one of the ten largest in the territory (occupying ninth place in this indicator).  As for the population, here the region can not be compared with California and other leading regions.  Oregon is only 27th.  The population is close to 3.9 million inhabitants.  In accordance with the traditions of the country, the state has an original motto that sounds like: "Flies on its wings."  Officially adopted in 1854. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="oregon usa" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56862/2086312.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The capital is the small city of Salem.  But there is a settlement several times larger.  This is Portland, or the City of Roses, which is known for annual flower festivals. </p><h2>  Characteristic </h2><p>  The exact time in Oregon is Pacific, UTC-7.  The population is mainly <span>white people,</span> but there is a certain percentage of Latinos and African Americans.  About 1.3% remained in these parts of the Indians who originally lived in Oregon. </p><p>  In large cities, you can see many foreigners and people of <span>mixed race.</span>  The main religion is Christianity, but according to the results of sociological research, we can conclude that the inhabitants are not too religious.  The church is rarely visited, a high proportion of atheists.  There is the town of Woodburn in the state, where a significant part of the population is represented by Russian Old Believers.  In former times, these people left Russia due to persecution of the church.  Now the community has grown and is the largest in the States. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  The second name of the state of Oregon jokingly consider "Beaver".  The reason is that the beaver is the official symbol of the region.  The animals are satisfied with the climate of the territory, clean air and the presence of many rivers.  And people respect the inventive animals.  Beaver can even be seen on the Oregon flag.  By the way, the flag is also special: it has two sides. </p><p>  Another state symbol is labradorite stone.  There are deposits of a certain variety, capable of the effect of irisation.  In bright light, the surface of the stone casts in different shades, which is especially noticeable after polishing operations.  Therefore, the mineral was nicknamed the "sun stone." </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Division into zones </h2><p>  By geographical and natural features, several areas can be distinguished.  The coast of the ocean and the coastal ridge are in the west.  It rains more often, but the climate is milder.  Closer to the center, in the southwest, the Klamath ridge rises.  In these places there are peaks of 2700 m and higher, amazing forests with a wide variety of tree species, alpine meadows.  On the contrary, on the north side, the Willamette Valley is located.  This is where most people in the US state of Oregon live.  Residents are engaged in winemaking.  For visitors, even special tours are organized where you can see how grapes are grown and in what ways they get a drink.  Local wine is highly regarded not only in the United States, but also in Europe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="oregon state attractions" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56862/2086311.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In the northeast lies the Colombia plateau with the river of the same name flowing through it.  Nearby is the Blue Mountains chain, with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãalmost 50 thousand km <sup>2</sup> .  Finally, the last zone is called the High Desert.  It has such an unusual name due to the fact that it is located on a small plateau, about 1200 m above sea level. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The territory was inhabited by people another 15 thousand years ago.  It is known that in the XVI century the tribes of the Indians lived here: the Klamaths, the non-Persians, the bannocks and some others.  The non-Persian people still exist, but now their representatives can only be found in Idaho.  And Klamath families can still be found in Oregon.  This people, by agreement with the Europeans, agreed to move to the reservation for the Indians. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  From the 18th century, the first expeditions of the British visited the region.  They began to study the land, and Astoria became the first city founded.  There was a fort founded by the Pacific Fur Company.  Since the XIX century, conflicts began between Indians and Europeans, then between the countries of Great Britain and the USA.  The state recognized Oregon in 1859. </p><p>  During World War II, the territory was somewhat affected by the bombing of Japanese soldiers.  As a result, fires occurred in the forest, which were quite successfully extinguished. </p><h2>  State Attractions </h2><p>  Arriving in Oregon, travelers seek to see the Hood volcano, which is the highest point of the state.  Its peak is at 3426 m. The panorama of the area leaves a lasting impression.  The snowy peak rises above the numerous trees and clear waters of the lakes.  There is a possibility that the volcano will still erupt: it is included in the list of potentially active ones.  The purpose of visiting most visitors are ski resorts.  There are many tracks of varying difficulty on the territory.  Attracts the volcano and professional climbers. </p><p>  There are other attractions in Oregon.  You should definitely visit the Pacific coast.  Perhaps the most amazing place here is the Torah well. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Oregon State Photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56862/2086309.jpg"></div>  Formation on the ocean looks like a deep funnel.  The water entering there is like a small waterfall, lost in the depths between the stones.  This point on the map is a favorite place of all photographers.

    <h2>  Cities of Oregon </h2><p>  Among the largest settlements should be called Eugene.  The second largest city after Portland is famous for the annual Bach Festival.  There is another attraction: the University of Oregon, famous in the country.  Students receive a quality education, the opportunity to seriously engage in scientific research and find a good job in this area. </p><p>  The list of cities in Oregon includes Springfield, Gresham, Medford, and that's not all.  The first is known to many by the series The Simpsons, where in the story the action took place in a town with the same name.  Every year, an event dedicated to jazz music takes place in Gresham.  Medford is small in size, its population is mainly engaged in agriculture, grows juicy pears for sale.  There are several National Parks and beautiful lakes nearby.  You can get to the city by car or bus from Eugene Airport. </p><p>  Does Gravity Falls exist in the United States, Oregon?  This is the name of the cartoon about the Pines twins and their summer adventures.  The action takes place in Gravity Falls, but in reality the city is fictional. </p><h2>  Portland </h2><p>  It is worth to separately talk about Portland.  The city has many unique features and extraordinary places.  For example, there is the smallest park in the world, with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãonly 0.3 m <sup>2</sup> .  The object even got into the Guinness Book of Records several decades ago.  In this place, various plants are constantly planted: flowers, small shrubs, cacti. </p><p>  Portland Esplanade Eastbank, built at the turn of the XX-XXI centuries, offers a gorgeous view of the river and the historical part of the city.  The coastline stretches for several kilometers, passers-by can stroll under bridges and enjoy the city panorama.  Often there are group excursions along the way, as this is one of the most popular destinations in Portland, Oregon. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Oregon cities" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56862/2086319.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The city has about 40 breweries.  Portland even surpassed German Cologne.  Visitors can taste beer of different grades and tastes.  Some establishments are located in historic buildings. </p><h2>  What else to see? </h2><p>  Those who wish to visit the wild, to arrange camping in the fresh air, can recommend a trip to the Siskaya mountains.  They belong to the Klamath ridge zone.  The climate is humid, it often rains, which caused the growth of a large number of conifers.  The highest point of the mountain system is Mount Ashland (2296 m). </p><p>  Among the Oregon National Parks in the United States, the area near the Jefferson Volcano should be highlighted.  This stratovolcano, named after the American president, last erupted only in 950 BC.  Mountain tourists are advised to climb the summer months of the year or in May.  A physically trained person can calmly climb to the peak, with the necessary equipment (‚Äúcats‚Äù, ice axes, safety cables). </p><p>  A certain danger to residents of the state is a complex of volcanoes "Three Sisters".  These are three mountains of different ages, the ‚Äúyoungest‚Äù of which is only 50 thousand years old.  Therefore, this volcano is considered active.  US geologists are constantly monitoring changes in the natural site and nearby lands. </p><h2>  Caves </h2><p>  Scientists from the University of Oregon are engaged in research in the field of archeology.  In particular, some archaeological sites are explored, such as Fort Rock Cave.  It was here that the oldest shoes on the planet were found.  The sandals found in the grotto are about 10 thousand years old!  They were made from wormwood, as shown by the results of archaeological analyzes.  The cave itself is located in Lake County.  There is a similar cave complex near the city of Paisley.  A whole reserve with a complex system of underground tunnels can be found near the Siskayu forests.  Trails are conveniently equipped for tourists.  The numerous groups are accompanied by a guide who tells about the history of the object on the road.  When visiting, it is worth paying attention to safety rules and a warning to people with chronic diseases (lungs, heart, and others).  Children whose growth is below a certain mark are not allowed to enter the caves. </p><h2>  Oregon Lakes </h2><p>  Oregon‚Äôs water bodies are over 150. The largest Upper Klamath is 1,200 m above sea level.  Plus, it is in Oregon that the country‚Äôs deepest Crater Lake is located.  To reach its bottom, you must go down 589 meters!  A pond formed on the site of a former volcano more than 7 thousand years ago.  To see the attraction, you should come to the local National Park, which offers stunning views of the lake. </p>

The lake was chosen by birds.  More than 200 of their species live on the shores.  Here you can meet a blue heron, a <span>Canadian goose</span> and take excellent photos of Oregon, giving an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe flora and fauna of the region.  People should be wary of possible dust storms near the lake. </p><h2>  Local celebrities </h2><p>  Few people know that several famous writers come from Oregon or have lived here for a certain period of life.  At the beginning of the last century, Beverly Cleary was born here.  The future children's writer lived in the small village of Yamhill, and at a more advanced age she moved to Portland.  The American reader knows her books about Henry Huggins and a mouse named Ralph.  Studied and worked for some time in Portland, and the author of the best-selling "Fight Club" Chuck Palahniuk. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Oregon cities list" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56862/2086308.jpg"></div>  His name was recognized around the world after the release of the film on the work, starring Brad Pitt and Edward Norton.
