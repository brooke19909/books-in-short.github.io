  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Where to relax in Italy?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In recent years <noindex>  <span>Holidays in Italy</span> </noindex>  became especially popular among many of our compatriots.  Well, there is nothing strange here - everyone wants to spend their vacation so that positive memories of him would be enough until next year.  Well, visiting Italy, everyone will be able to find exactly what he likes best and what he lacks in everyday life.  Of course, for many people, these are primarily golden beaches, warm water and good service.  Therefore, it is not surprising that many people prefer to relax in the resort of Rimini.  This resort town boasts a magnificent climate, as well as a whole dozen kilometers of a magnificent beach with pure golden sand.  It is no coincidence that this place is one of the most popular beaches on the entire Adriatic coast.  Many tourists also like the fact that the journey from Rimini to the largest Italian cities - Rome, Florence, Venice and others, takes only one day. </p><p>  Swimming begins here at the very beginning of May, and the swimming season continues until the very end of September.  Therefore, tourists can enjoy the warm sea water for five months a year.  So, any swimming enthusiast can buy enough here.  Well, supporters of a more relaxing holiday can at least lie for days on the sun, enjoying the gentle rays and hot sand.  However, the entertainment on the beach does not end there.  After all, at any time you can visit special volleyball and basketball courts, sailing and windsurfing stations, scuba diving, try canoeing, go jogging on a jet ski or a water bike. </p><p>  With all this, Rimini is not only a wonderful climate and conditions for relaxation, but also an amazing story.  Yes, this resort was not created decades or even centuries ago.  They founded it at the beginning of the third century BC!  So, to this day the town is divided into two parts - one of them is interesting for resorts, and the other is history.  Therefore, even if you are heading to Italy to have a good swim, it is worth taking at least a day or two to see with your own eyes many of the architectural monuments of the Middle Ages - the Malatesta Temple, the Palazzo del Podesta, the Rubicon River, as well as the Franciscan church of Tempio Matatestiano. </p><p>  Of course, when visiting Rimini, any girl or woman can not resist shopping - there are a huge number of department stores, boutiques and shops, most of which are located in the city center. </p><p>  Not a single gourmet will be disappointed in local cafes and restaurants, but lovers of seafood cuisine will be especially pleased.  After all, fresh seafood is one of the main components of Italian cuisine.  Shellfish, fish and algae are almost always present on the table.  Of course, here you can also taste real Italian wine, which is grown in many tiny towns throughout Italy. </p><p>  So deciding <noindex>  <span>buy a ticket to Rome</span> </noindex>  , you will give yourself a few days of unforgettable vacation. </p></div></article>
