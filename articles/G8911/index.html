It is first mentioned as a Celtic settlement that was captured in 80 BC.  After this, the city remained under the control of the Roman Empire for a long time, until the invasion of Muslims in Spain.  In their hands passed Segovia, which turned into a devastated area.  The former greatness of the city was returned only in the XI century, when it became the most important center of trade and culture of the country.  Now about the times of Roman dominion resembles a majestic aqueduct in Segovia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="aqueduct in segovia" class="if" height="378" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/380617.jpg" width="570"></div>

    <h2>  Highest and majestic </h2><p>  The aqueduct was built around the 1st-2nd century BC.  In this era, the city was under the protectorate of the Roman Empire, and, in all probability, it was built under the emperor Nerve or Vespasian.  The most important feature of the structure is that it was built without mortar or any other fasteners.  Incredibly, almost 21 thousand granite blocks are held only by the force of their gravity.  It was created using arches of different sizes.  The aqueduct in Segovia is a unique graceful building that immediately catches your eye. </p><p>  There are 800 such objects built by the Romans in Europe, but the Segovia aqueduct is considered the longest of them.  Its length reaches 815 meters and a height of 30 m. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="aqueduct in segovia spain" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/380620.jpg?1398351941459" width="600"></div>

He even found his reflection on the coat of arms of Segovia.  This amazing structure was created under the strict control of the mechanic Vitruvius.  This scientist later decided to lay out the project of the aqueduct in his book "Architecture", in particular, in the section "Plumbing Systems". </p><p>  The aqueduct in Segovia (Spain) was provided from the mountain river Fuentefria flowing 17 km.  15 km from the settlement, its waters flowed into the reservoir, which was called "El Caseron", and from there flowed onto the <span>water tower of the</span> Casa de Aguas.  From the tower along the gutter, which is literally cut out of stone, under a slight slope, water flowed into the central part of the city and then spread through other gutters that are located along the streets of Segovia.  In such a cunning way, the water flow reached the Alcazar fortress and then went to Diaz Sanz Square, in this place the aqueduct turned to Azoguejo Square.  There was also an arcade and a two-tier bridge. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="roman aqueduct in segovia" class="if" height="359" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/380621.jpg?1398351980065" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Aqueduct Modifications </h2><p>  In 1072, after the Moors attacked the city, several arches of the aqueduct were destroyed.  After the arrival of Catholic kings, the building was reconstructed for the first time.  Later in the 15th century, under the leadership of Pedro Mass, the destroyed parts were restored according to the preserved sketches, and some elements were replaced by new pointed-shaped buildings. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  During the Roman Empire, the aqueduct in Segovia on the upper tiers was decorated with bronze letters, which meant the date, as well as the name of the builder, but over time they disappeared.  It is known that on the upper two niches on both sides of the water supply there were previously bronze statues.  One of the sculptures depicted Hercules the Egyptian, according to legend, it is he who is considered the founder of the city.  On two other niches there were statues of St. Esteban and the Virgin of Fuensisle (patroness of the city). </p><p>  The Roman aqueduct in Segovia was subjected to another restoration in the 16th century.  This time, only two statues were recreated - the Virgin of Fuensisle and St. Esteban. </p><h2>  National monument </h2><p>  Since 1884, the aqueduct has been declared a national architectural monument.  Until recently, he acted and safely supplied the city with water.  Since 1997, a major reconstruction of the ancient structure took place, during which the object almost completely acquired its original appearance.  These works were led by an associate professor of the architectural school of Madrid, Francis Jurado.  These events lasted for 8 years. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the aqueduct" class="if" height="354" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/380623.jpg?1398352014716" width="529"></div>

    <h2>  Value </h2><p>  The aqueduct in Segovia (Spain) is the most important monument not only of the city, but of the whole country.  For many centuries it functioned smoothly and provided the village with water.  Apparently, this contributed to the fact that this hydraulic facility is perfectly preserved to this day. </p><p>  The aqueduct has two rows of arches that are located on pillars.  In total, the building has 166 arches.  75 of them are directed towards the Diaz Sanz square, then the simple ones go, and after them another 47 doubles stretch. </p><p>  Recently, the state of the aqueduct has worsened, erosion of granite stones has been observed.  This is due generally to environmental pollution.  Until 1992, cars could still pass under the arches of an ancient building.  Oddly enough, but the vibrations caused by the movement of transport did not affect the majestic aqueduct due to the huge mass of stones, as well as the inertia of the structure.  During the restoration since 1997, the area where the aqueduct is located has become a pedestrian zone. </p><h2>  In the spotlight </h2><p>  For several years, this ancient architectural monument has been the venue for various celebrations.  On December 4, every year the city celebrates St. Barbara's Day, which is considered the patroness of artillery.  On this holiday, representatives of the church and students near the aqueduct carry a platform with the face of the Virgin.  Arches on its two floors are decorated in a special style, standing out against the sky. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="aqueduct spain" class="if" height="354" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/380624.jpg?1398352048759" width="529"></div>

    <h2>  Legend </h2><p>  Since time immemorial, about an aqueduct in Segovia there is one amazing legend.  A very beautiful girl lived in the city, but she was very poor.  In order to somehow feed herself, she carried water from a mountain river every day to a wealthy aristocrat.  Once the beautiful maiden woke up and realized that she no longer had the strength to carry heavy buckets, and, sitting on a stone, she began to pray to the devil himself that he would facilitate her fate.  At night, he came to her and said that before morning he would create such a structure that would provide the whole city with water, and the poor girl would never have to tear and carry heavy buckets of water again, but in return she had to give her soul.  She, of course, did not know what the aqueduct was, and at first she did not believe such promises, but she had no choice but to accept the conditions of the devil.  After the conclusion of such a trace, the beauty regretted the deed and began to ask the Virgin Mary to save her soul.  The Mother of God took pity on the girl and even before evil forces laid the last stone on the aqueduct, she forgave her, thereby breaking the deal.  By morning, the girl‚Äôs soul was saved. </p><p>  Now, at an ancient hydraulic facility near the statue of the Virgin of Fuensisle, one stone is really missing.  But as you know, an ancient legend is, of course, just a beautiful myth. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is an aqueduct" class="if" height="292" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/380627.jpg?1398352074519" width="390"></div><strong> </strong>

    <h2>  How to get to the aqueduct? </h2><p>  You can get to this magnificent structure in different ways.  By car, take route 6 through the Sierra de Guadarrama tunnels.  By bus from Madrid to the city of Segovia, you can arrive at the station of Principe Pio.  It is also possible to get by <span>high-speed train</span> from Madrid, which stops at Guiomar station (it is 4 km from the center of Segovia). </p><p>  If in Italy you should definitely see the Colosseum, then the aqueduct can be called the business card of its western neighbor.  Spain can show you a lot of surprises, but this magnificent hydraulic structure, which is already over 2000 years old, is especially striking.  It lasted so long thanks to the amazing competent calculation of Roman architects and builders.  Let's hope that it can stand for at least another 1000 years. </p>
