Pattaya has many options, and one of the best, judging by the reviews, is the Sunshine Garden Resort.  And now it should be told in detail. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The hotel was very well located.  Sunshine Garden Resort is 5 minutes' walk from central Pattaya, a place where countless entertainment venues are concentrated. </p><p>  This is the most populous, fun and noisy area of ​​the city, where life is in full swing around the clock.  You should know about this when choosing a hotel and a place of rest, since not all people seek entertainment - some, on the contrary, lack silence and relaxation. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="12.9514101" data-lng="100.88734640000007" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="14"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/1/8/9/8/11898.png"></div><p>  The Sunshine Garden Resort itself is immersed in tropical greenery, and looking at it, it is difficult to imagine that the hotel is somewhere in the center.  What is important: in 7-10 minutes you can walk to a gorgeous beach with golden sand.  It is called Wong Amat Beach and is the best in town.  Despite the fact that tourists in Pattaya have a rest all year round, the water here is pretty clean.  And on this beach you can watch the most beautiful sunsets in the city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is also worth noting that from the hotel you can quickly get to various attractions (some can even be reached on foot), and the nearest airport is about 35 kilometers away. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  At the Sunshine Garden Resort (Pattaya), guests are provided with all the services necessary for a comfortable stay.  The list includes: </p><ul><li>  Free high speed wifi. </li><li>  Parking. </li><li>  Luggage office. </li><li>  Reception open 24 hours a day. </li><li>  Office with photocopy and fax. </li><li>  Currency exchange. </li><li>  Room service (room service). </li><li>  Laundry. </li><li>  Hall for banquets, conferences and other events. </li></ul><p>  The staff speaks English and Thai. </p><h2>  Leisure </h2><p>  Immediately you need to make a reservation that the Sunshine Garden Resort 3 * located in Pattaya is a good option only for those people who are looking for a comfortable hotel just for living.  Leisure in it is not very developed, since tourists staying here have fun in the city center (which is within walking distance) or on the beach. </p><p>  However, the territory has: </p><ul><li>  Sun terrace </li><li>  Garden with relaxation areas. </li><li>  Swimming pool. </li><li>  Bar. </li></ul><p>  So if there is no desire to go to the beach, you can have a good time at the hotel, without limiting yourself in sunbathing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.katja-tour.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sunshine garden resort pattaya" class="if uuid-2970361" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2970361.jpg"></div><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  On the territory of the Sunshine Garden Resort 3 * has its own restaurant and bar, where guests are served. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  People who have already rested in this place leave positive reviews about the organization of food.

Basically, guests have a pleasant experience of staying in this place.  They note the following points: </p><ul><li>  The hotel is located in a great location.  It has everything: convenient transportation, necessary services within walking distance, shopping centers and salons, cafes, clubs, bars, restaurants. </li><li>  The territory of the hotel is good.  It is not so large that you can get lost, but not small - there is where to walk.  The atmosphere itself is very cozy and comfortable. </li><li>  The staff is very nice and always helps.  They can even change the number if necessary. </li><li>  All apartments are comfortable, neat and stylish.  And the beds are simply huge - even bigger than they look in the photographs. </li><li>  Breakfast is great.  It is difficult to single out something outstanding, but in Thai hotels of category 4 and 5 stars the level is similar.  The main thing is that everything is always fresh and moderately diverse. </li><li>  The pool is clean, well-groomed, with cool, odorless chlorine water.  And by the way, near it is almost always empty - all guests relax either on the beach or in the center. </li><li>  Rooms are cleaned daily.  Maids also bring guests water, coffee, cream, sugar and tea.  Also replenish supplies of hygiene products - shampoo, gel, soap. </li><li>  Right at the entrance to the hotel there is an exchange office with a favorable rate, fruit tents with low prices and an excellent cafe. </li></ul><p>  By the way, if guests come with a child under two years of age, they will be provided with a cradle for free.  Older children (under 12 years old) are offered an extra bed.  And for this, too, no need to pay extra. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtours.cz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sunshine Garden Resort 3 *" class="if uuid-2970372" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2970372.jpg"></div><h2>  General impressions </h2><p>  After studying the reviews left about Sunshine Garden Resort 3 * in Pattaya in details, you can see that many people talk not only about the hotel, but also about their vacation in this resort as a whole. </p><p>  All travelers warn: spending time in Pattaya is radically different from Phuket, Egypt, Turkey, Krabi, Tunisia, etc. Here, a completely different atmosphere reigns.  Some call it fervent, youthful, while others call it extravagant, even a little reckless. </p><p>  People who want to visit as many excursions, entertainment venues, zoos, clubs, etc. as well are worth going here. Yes, there are beaches, but rest in Pattaya is more focused on all kinds of activities, rather than on lazy pastime on the Cote d'Azur. </p><p>  Therefore, before you go here, you must familiarize yourself with all the nuances of the resort.  Since some tourists, without understanding this topic, return with negative impressions and leave negative reviews both about Pattaya and the hotel.  But he really does not deserve it.  Many people, having once been here, often return again. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.2look4beds.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sunshine garden resort 3 pattaya" class="if uuid-2970362" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2970362.jpg"></div><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  The holiday season in Pattaya never ends.  But judging by the reviews, the best time to spend your vacation here is winter.  In February, January and December, comfortable weather reigns here.  The temperature indicators of air and water are at the level of +30 ° C and +26 ... + 28 ° C, respectively. </p><p>  Also in winter there is little rain, and this is important.  In the summer, for example, due to frequent rainfall, many excursion routes are not carried out.  But in Thailand there is something to see - it will be a shame to leave home without impressions. </p><h2>  Accommodations </h2><p>  There are nuances that you need to know for people who decide to plan their trip on their own, rather than buying a tour.  Namely: </p><ul><li>  Check-in at the hotel starts at 14:00 and continues until 23:30.  But the reception is open around the clock, and therefore individual registration is possible, but you must first contact the property. </li><li>  Departure starts at 6:00 and continues until 12:00. </li><li>  No pets allowed at the hotel. </li><li>  When booking, be sure to include your personal credit card details.  The hotel accepts Visa and Master Card.  Part of the funds may be blocked until the arrival of guests as a guarantee. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.schauinsland-reisen.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sunshine Garden Resort 3 *" class="if uuid-2970369" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2970369.jpg"></div><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  The average price of a ticket to the Sunshine Garden Resort for two people is 100 000 rubles.  This amount includes: </p><ul><li>  Accommodation in Superior apartments for 8 days (7 nights). </li><li>  Return flights. </li><li>  Fuel surcharge. </li><li>  Breakfasts throughout the stay. </li><li>  Medical insurance. </li><li>  Transfer. </li></ul><p>  Of course, the indicated price is approximate.  There are tours both cheaper and more expensive.  And sometimes tour operators offer last minute packages that can be purchased at a very competitive price. </p>
