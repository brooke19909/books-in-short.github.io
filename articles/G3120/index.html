The fact is that it is the budget class that is overflowing with technology, which, along with huge functionality, has a number of shortcomings that affect usability.  Naturally, we are talking about products of Chinese manufacturers whose names are difficult to pronounce the first time.  However, in this niche there are many interesting options from world famous brands.  The focus of this article is the representative of Korea - LG Spirit H422.  Owners' reviews, descriptions, specifications and expert recommendations will allow potential buyers to get to know the new product better. </p>

    <h2>  First meeting </h2><p>  The manufacturers of mobile phones have apparently become fashionable to provide their products with the minimum equipment: smartphone, battery, charger, interface cable and documentation.  Neither a cover, nor a protective film for the screen in the box can be found.  At least the smartphone <span>LG h422 Spirit Y70</span> Titan, reviews of which are more often found in the media, has such a poor bundle. </p><p>  Buyers have no complaints about the build quality: all the elements are perfectly matched to each other, there are no bevels, and the interfaces are perfectly centered.  Confuses only a small deflection of the battery cover.  Many buyers had the impression that the phone should have another battery installed, thicker.  You can eliminate the backlash of the cover yourself - just put a piece of paper folded four times. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Horseback Riding </h2><p>  The concave display is what the LG Spirit H422 White mobile phone attracts the attention of buyers.  Responses of owners assure that the bend is almost imperceptible, however, thanks to him, the Korean representative got fans.  The display is good: a modern 4.7-inch IPS-matrix with HD resolution (1280x720 dots per inch) is a key element in this smartphone. </p>

    <p>  The concave screen fits perfectly to the temple during conversations, eliminating ghostly taps, and it is much easier to deal with the keyboard when entering messages.  True, you need to get used to the fact that due to the bulge of the battery cover, the smartphone has a low grip with smooth surfaces.  Writing SMS with one hand is inconvenient - the phone sways from side to side. </p><h2>  Note to photographers </h2><p>  The built-in 8-megapixel camera in the mobile phone is capable of creating great pictures.  It may not reach the compact camera in quality, but still progress is evident when comparing with similar products in the budget class, in which the smartphone LG Spirit H422 White is located.  Owner reviews claim that the camera really has a resolution of 8 megapixels, and does not draw out a large resolution programmatically due to interpolation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  True, quality can be satisfied only in daylight.  In a dark room, even a flash cannot save the photographer.  The front camera is equipped with a 1 megapixel sensor.  As practice shows, it works well.  Its sensitivity is enough for video conferencing and for taking selfies. </p><h2>  Platform performance </h2><p>  Regarding the smartphone LG Spirit Y70 H422 Titan reviews leave and lovers of dynamic games.  The fact is that a mobile phone demonstrates high performance in demanding applications.  The processor with four cores, built on a <span>MediaTek MT6582</span> chip <span>,</span> operates at a frequency of 1300 MHz.  The smartphone is equipped with 1 GB of RAM.  As practice shows, this figure is the minimum for many toys. </p>

    <p>  The owners will appreciate the amount of internal memory, which is 8 GB.  True, the Android operating system takes 2 gigabytes for itself, but six GB is enough to install applications and games.  The phone supports micro-SD memory cards of 32 gigabytes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Smartphone Telecommunication Features </h2><p>  Support for two SIM cards is good, but there is one negative that spoils the overall impression.  The fact is that the manufacturer installed two micro-SIM modules in the smartphone LG Spirit H422 white.  You can understand the feedback of the owners, because many users have the old format of the cards of the mobile operator - you need to "SIM" or cut, or issue an updated card in the cabin. </p>

    <p>  The smartphone supports 3G and GSM networks.  Naturally, it has support for the standard GPRS and EDGE.  Judging by the reviews of the owners, there are no complaints about working on the Internet.  To send text messages, the phone supports SMS, MMS and Email.  To communicate on social networks, the manufacturer has sewn several popular applications into the device‚Äôs firmware. </p><p>  Wireless technology is also standard: Wi-Fi 802.11 a / b / g / n / ac, Bluetooth version 4.1 and <span>a GPS module.</span>  With navigation, the Korean giant a little disappointed fans - instead of the standard SirfStar III chip working directly with satellites, the manufacturer installed an A-GPS module that subtracts the position between the operator‚Äôs cells. </p><h2>  Work autonomy </h2><p>  The built-in 2040 mAh lithium-ion battery initially promises the owner almost five days of standby time.  It is not entirely clear how the Koreans made measurements at the factory, but not one owner of the LG Spirit H422 smartphone managed to reach this indicator.  A review of the autonomy of work will suit many buyers: </p><ul><li>  36 hours standby time of two SIM cards; </li><li>  3 hours of continuous operation in game mode (wireless interfaces are disabled); </li><li>  6 hours of continuous talking at a screen brightness of 80%. </li></ul>

    <p>  The usual results for many smartphones are nothing unusual.  As tests show, a decrease in screen brightness (by the way, it does not have automatic adjustment), disabling Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and also refusing to use <span>global positioning</span> can extend the battery <span>life.</span>  It is clear that all the necessary functionality cannot be removed, but you can always achieve a ‚Äúmiddle ground‚Äù.  For example, if you need Wi-Fi, you can reduce the brightness of the display, and during games, turn off both GSM-modules. </p><h2>  Work with multimedia </h2><p>  It is clear that the manufacturer tried to please all customers, but with multimedia, he still overdid it.  All the functionality in a smartphone is a huge entertainment center.  Yes, there are useful little things, but they are in the minority.  In general, it is not clear what the manufacturer was thinking about, clogging up the memory of the LG H422 Spirit White Gold phone with unnecessary programs.  User reviews point out the availability of programs for testing performance and cleaning the device of debris, as well as the automatic shutter function of the camera at the click of a finger or the word "chees". </p>

    <p>  But the "zoo" of video and music players in one device is not pleasant to most owners.  After all, all installed players are not multi-format.  There is only one solution - to download a worthy player from the Google store that understands all formats of music and video, there are plenty of such applications.  By the way, it will not work to remove the manufacturer‚Äôs standard applications - they are in the firmware, they can only be stopped.  Alternatively, you can get Root rights on a smartphone and do anything with the firmware. </p><h2>  Feedback </h2><p>  There is not a single negative to the budget representative regarding the work of the speakers during a conversation, and this is really pleasing, because initially the device is purchased for making calls.  Moreover, both speakers (for talking and speakerphone) have excellent sound quality.  Listening to FM radio is a pleasure on the LG Spirit H422 mobile phone.  Feedback on the usability of the device with a concave screen also refers to the advantages.  Owners like the high-quality liquid crystal display, the performance in toys, and telecommunication capabilities. </p><p>  But to the negatives, many users in their reviews attributed the low autonomy of the smartphone on a single charge.  In fact, the phone needs to be charged daily.  And you can‚Äôt count on recharging outside the house, because the charger takes a very long time to charge the smartphone‚Äôs battery.  The inability to place installed applications on the memory card is also described in negative reviews, but this is a problem of the Android operating system, and not a mobile phone. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  An interesting smartphone from a famous Korean manufacturer will certainly attract the attention of many buyers.  There is no doubt about it, because, in addition to external beauty, the device has excellent functionality, which uses all modern technologies.  As for the shortcomings, <span>a</span> negative <span>review</span> is quite expected on the <span>LG Spirit H422</span> phone, because it doesn‚Äôt happen that the novelty <span>enters the</span> mobile market and becomes ideal for all customers.  There are shortcomings, but they practically do not interfere with the user, so this smartphone can be safely recommended for purchase. </p>
