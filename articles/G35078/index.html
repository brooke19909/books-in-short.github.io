  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cisco 800 Series Routers: Options, Features, and Purpose</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The <span>Cisco</span> 800 Series of <span>routers is</span> designed to create compact computing networks with enhanced security.  In this review, the communicator model 857-K9.  This network device is included in this line of routers, and it is on his example that this series of routers will be considered. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cisco.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Configure Cisco 800" class="if uuid-3187115" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/3187115.jpg"></div><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The delivery list of the device in question consists of the following main elements: </p><ol><li>  A router with one removable antenna installed on it. </li><li>  Console cable for configuring the router. </li><li>  Power cable for the implementation of power supply of this network system. </li><li>  A set of documentation. </li><li>  Digital media with software and user manual. </li></ol><p>  This is a typical configuration of the communicator of this series.  It is sufficient and allows you to configure and start using such equipment without any problems. </p><h2>  Network device settings and connection </h2><p>  The maximum information transfer rate in the wireless segment that such a switch can provide is 54 Mbps.  Moreover, the coverage radius can reach 100 meters.  The wired part of the LAN can include a maximum of three computers, and in this case, the exchange speed can increase up to 100 Mbit / s.  Also, one port is used to exchange data with the equipment of the provider. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Therefore, connecting a Cisco 800 consists of two main steps.  The first of these is the switching of the power cable with the power supply system.  And the second one is the twisted pair supply from the provider and its installation in the corresponding port of the device.  The amount of RAM for this router is 64 MB.  The built-in drive has a similar size. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Connecting <mixchars> C </mixchars> isco 800" class="if uuid-3187116" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/3187116.jpg"></div><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  Any router of the Cisco 800 lineup is a very expensive device. Currently, the 857-K9 router costs 23,000 - 24,000 rubles.  If it were a budget router, then its price would be sky-high.  But in this case we are dealing with a specialized network solution.  Its key feature is a high level of protection of transmitted information.  Accordingly, its cost is much higher than that of an ordinary household router. </p><h2>  When is it better to use?  Customization </h2><p>  It is most optimum to use 851-K9 in office conditions.  At the same time, increased requirements are put forward to protect the transmitted information.  This router runs an operating system called Cisco IOS and has specialized software.  With the help of the latter, the maximum level of protection of the transmitted information is provided.  Also, the number of computing devices connected to such a network node should not be more than 10 pieces. </p><p>  Configuring the Cisco 800 is a rather complicated operation.  To implement it, you need to know the Cisco IOS command system.  Therefore, entrusting its implementation is best to a professional.  Poorly trained specialist to deal with it is very problematic. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Network technicians are very positive about the Cisco 800 Series routers. The router considered in this review is no exception.  It has a high level of reliability and stability.  Also, the security of the LAN when using it does not cause any complaints.  The only negative of any such router is its high cost.  But such advanced switches by default cannot have a low price.  And the Cisco brand speaks for itself. </p><div class="photo" data-original="picclick.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cisco 800" class="if uuid-3187117" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/3187117.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The Cisco 800 Series Switches is an office specialty.  Moreover, it makes sense to buy such a router only if the transmitted information needs a higher level of protection.  It also requires a qualified specialist who can configure and maintain such equipment.  In all other cases, the use of such a router is impractical. </p>
