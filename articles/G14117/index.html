    <h2>  Accommodation options: standard rooms </h2><p>  This hotel is medium in size and spaciousness.  Her fund is 165 rooms.  And the most budgetary, of course, are 2-seater standards.  They are the most popular in Arkutino Family Resort 4 * (Bulgaria). </p><p>  Their area is 27 square meters.  m. Inside there are two single beds.  The interior is simple but cozy (the photo above is provided).  There is a balcony with garden views, a flat-screen TV with cable channels, a powerful climate system (cooling + heating), a work desk, a seating area, as well as a dressing room and refrigerator.  The bathroom, of course, is also available.  Towels, hair dryers, toiletries and linen are provided. </p><p>  And a week's worth of living in such apartments is only 22 thousand rubles.  For two people, and even with the all-inclusive service, this is very modest.  True, prices may vary.  The final cost depends on the season.  At the height of summer (in July, for example), the price will be higher.  In May and September - below.  Therefore, if you want to save money, you need to take into account this fact. </p><h2>  Deluxe </h2><p>  Apartments of this category in Arkutino Family Resort 4 * (Sozopol) are also available.  They are more spacious than standards, their area is 35 square meters.  m. The interior is also more refined - in the photograph below, this is clearly visible.  Also in deluxe rooms, in addition to the bed (you can choose either one 2-bedroom or two standard), there is a futon.  The third berth is for a child under 12 years old. </p><p>  Of the amenities worth noting, the presence of an LCD TV.  Otherwise, everything is the same as in standard apartments.  But the price, of course, is different.  The cost of a weekly stay in deluxe room for three people (one of which is a child) is 25,000 rubles.  If two adults want to stay in this apartment, then the price will still be the same.  But it is not too different from the cost of standards, so the difference is not very noticeable. </p>

    <h2>  Family Suite </h2><p>  Apartments of the highest category, the hotel Arkutino Family Resort also offers its guests.  The suite is good in that it can accommodate four adults.  Fortunately, the area allows everyone to feel comfortable (50 sq. M.).  And the space, by the way, is divided into two separate rooms - a bedroom with 2 beds and a living room with a folding wide sofa. </p><p>  Each room has an LCD TV and air conditioning.  It is also worth noting that for suites there is a separate entrance.  The dressing room is larger, as is the number of toiletries and towels.  By design, by the way, these apartments are similar to deluxe, only there is more space. </p><p>  For four people the price of a week stay in such a room will be about 37-40 thousand rubles.  This is only 10 thousand each for a vacation on an all-inclusive basis.  No wonder the hotel is so popular. </p><h2>  Deluxe Suite </h2><p>  This is the last category of apartments that should be noted for attention.  In Arkutino Family Resort 4 * (Bulgaria, Sozopol) they are very popular.  However, you can understand why, because these apartments are no longer similar to a hotel room, but to a separate apartment.  The total area is 72 square meters.  m. All space is divided into two bedrooms and one living room.  This deluxe suite can accommodate 6 people - 4 adults and 2 children.  Enough space for everyone.  After all, the rooms have one huge 2 king-size bed, and in the living room you can spread a futon and a sofa bed. </p><p>  All the amenities that were listed earlier in the deluxe suite are naturally available.  And the price of a weekly stay in it is only 50-55 thousand rubles.  Only if you want to settle in a deluxe suite, is it better to use early booking.  Many go on vacation with a large company - accordingly, all apartments in this category are picked up at the speed of light, especially before the start of the season. </p>

    <h2>  What do the guests say? </h2><p>  Arkutino Family Resort reviews are extremely positive.  Which does not surprise at all, because the hotel really pleases with decent service and reasonable prices. </p><p>  People claim that every lover of relaxation must at least once relax here.  The hotel is located on a small hill, and the view is simply amazing.  You can admire nature, the sea and endless mountains.  And the territory, which every vacationer notes with attention, resembles a nature reserve.  It‚Äôs simply impossible not to feel rapprochement with nature.  However, amusement lovers will be satisfied, as the nearest ‚Äúparty‚Äù town is only 20 minutes away. </p><p>  The service is excellent, the staff is friendly and helpful.  If guests do not arrive by 14:00 (when check-in begins), but earlier, then they will try to accommodate them immediately, if there is such an opportunity. </p><p>  In general, you can talk about the advantages of the hotel for a long time.  But it‚Äôs better to go here on vacation and see for yourself the truth of all of the above.  You will not have to feel sorry, and numerous reviews are the best confirmation of this. </p>
