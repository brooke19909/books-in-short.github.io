    <h2>  Briefly about the topic </h2><p>  First of all, I would like to note that modern Germany is divided into 16 separate federal lands.  Many mistakenly believe that each of them is a separate state.  But no, it‚Äôs just federal land - like ours in Russia. </p><p>  The <span>lands</span> do not include Berlin, Bremen and Hamburg.  These are separate cities.  Similarities with Russia are also perceived: after all, Moscow, St. Petersburg and Sevastopol are equally separated by their status.  Although the above German cities are equal in importance to the lands. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Before listing the list of cities in Germany, it is worth delving a bit into history.  Until the middle of the year before last, the 19th century, small separate states existed and flourished on the territory of this country.  They often changed their own boundaries.  Initially, there were 11, but then, when the three states (Baden, W√ºrttemberg-Baden and W√ºrttemberg-Hohenzollern) united, it became nine.  Then there were counties, of which there were 14. But in 1990 there were changes.  The eastern and western parts of the German capital merged, and in the eastern part of the country decided to restore everything as it was.  So there are 16 lands. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Free lands and cities </h2><p>  Before voicing the list of cities in Germany, I would like to talk about lands.  So, the first is Baden-W√ºrttemberg.  It was formed in 1952, when the three lands united (this was mentioned above).  Considered one of the most prosperous and developed, the capital is Stuttgart. </p><p>  Bavaria is the largest land in Germany.  Its capital is the famous Munich, the birthplace of BMW and Bavarian traditions.  Berlin is the main city of the whole country, until 1920 it was part of the Brandenburg land.  And she, by the way, is located in the north-east of the state.  The capital is Potsdam, a small but cozy town. </p><p>  Bremen - a free Hanseatic city, is the smallest land in the country.  It consists of only two cities.  This is, in fact, Bremen and Bremerhaven.  Just like Bavaria, this is the oldest formation in the country.  Hamburg, by the way, is also a free Hanseatic city.  In addition, the largest port megalopolis in Europe!  It is located where the Elbe flows into the North Sea. </p>

    <h2>  Small settlements </h2><p>  In principle, people are more or less aware of the list of cities in Germany.  But the names of only large capitals come to mind when mentioning this topic.  But there are many such settlements as small cities in Germany, the list of which is also voluminous. </p><p>  For example, Rothenburg od der Tauber.  Cozy, small, with a population of 11 thousand people, with bright houses and narrow streets.  Minden is also a small town.  Few people know that this is where the second longest water bridge in Europe is located.  Villingen-Schwenningen, Velbert, Flensburg (by the way, the northernmost settlement in the country), T√ºbingen, Marl, Dessau (there used to be Junkers airplanes), L√ºnen, Ratingen (green and picturesque), Ludwigsburg with the famous baroque palace , Esslingen am Neckar (founded in the eighth century), Hanau, D√ºren ... </p><p>  This is a list of the smallest but most notable cities in Germany.  Their population is less than 100 thousand people.  By the way, such tourists are very popular among tourists. </p>

    <h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  Studying the list, one cannot fail to note the attention due to which these settlements have gained fame.  For example, Recklinghausen is famous for having a museum of icons - the largest museum focused on religious values. </p><p>  In Bergisch Gladbach, for example, iron ore was mined for a long time.  In the last century there was just a huge supply of it.  G√∂ttingen is well known to Russians, since it is there that a large number of our compatriots live.  Pforzheim is the city that suffered the most from the wartime bombing.  Heilbronn is famous for winemaking and salt mines.  By the way, in those places where this city was founded, traces of man were first noticed during the Paleolithic!  Fuerth is a city known as the most dense in the number of monuments.  Neuss is known for a rather unusual fact - the fact that here in the XVII century a local witch named Esther Jonas was executed.  Although she was just dealing with medicinal herbs. </p><p>  Here, in principle, the most interesting cities in Germany (a list in alphabetical order in Russian is provided above).  As one could understand, small settlements, whose names are far from being widely known, can boast of something. </p>
