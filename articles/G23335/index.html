  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Monthly child support, tips and tricks.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In Russia, all citizens with children are entitled to monthly benefits from the state.  The state continues to take care of a new generation.  In this regard, a new law on the payment of benefits for the birth of a child has been adopted.  One of the parents can receive it for each of the children living with him.  The eligibility for benefits depends on the amount of income for each member of the family. <br><br>  Monthly <span>child allowance:</span> documents and deadlines. <br><br>  Benefits are financed from budget funds of various levels.  The allowance is paid to all citizens of Russia, as well as foreign citizens residing in Russia if they have a registration or <span>residence permit.</span>  It is appointed from the moment of appeal to the social protection authorities.  The application must be submitted no later than six months from the date of birth. </p><p>  If you submitted the documents more than six months later, then the allowance will be paid only for the previous six months.  The monthly child allowance is paid until the age of sixteen, but the payment period may be extended.  Currently, the right to receive a monthly child benefit directly depends on the material condition of the family. <br><br>  Monthly child allowance.  2012 - changes in connection with the indexation of payments for maintenance and childcare. <br><br>  Starting January 1, 2012, indexation of state child benefits is provided.  Indexation concerned only one-time payments for the birth of a child.  These benefits are paid by the employer.  If mom and dad did not work at the time of the birth of the child, then social security authorities pay the allowance. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To assign benefits, a statement is submitted stating that the parents are not working and a certificate from the registry office about the birth of a child.  A new procedure for calculating a <span>one-time allowance has been</span> adopted <span>.</span>  This allowed to increase the amount of benefits.  Now a woman herself can choose which calculation method suits her more and choose a more acceptable one for her. </p><p>  Every month, the allowance assigned to care for a child must be accrued in the amount of at least 40% of earnings.  The allowance may be assigned to the mother or father of the newborn.  The monthly child allowance should be paid to the place of work, which is the main one for any parent during the period of wage payment.  The list of documents required for accrual and payment of benefits can be found in the accounting department of the enterprise.  If the child‚Äôs parents did not work at the time of the birth of the baby, then the necessary documents are provided to the social protection authorities of the population.  If the father of the family at the time of the birth of the child is in military service on conscription, then the monthly allowance is assigned to the child of this soldier.  For this, a certificate from the <span>military commissariat is</span> provided <span>.</span> <br><br>  When accepting documents, social protection authorities check the accuracy of filling out all documents and advise parents on issues that arose to them.  <span>The allowance</span> for single mothers is increased by 100%.  Social protection authorities are required to make a decision related to the appointment and payment of benefits within ten days from the date of submission of all documents and an application from one of the parents.  Due to the fact that the payment of benefits depends on family income, it is necessary to submit annual income statements to social protection authorities. </p><p>  The allowance is prescribed regardless of other <span>social benefits</span> per child.  If you are denied a monthly child allowance, you should be sent a notice within five days from the date of the decision and send all the documentation that was attached to the application.  The notice shall indicate the reasons for the refusal.  This decision of the commission may be appealed against within thirty days. </p>
