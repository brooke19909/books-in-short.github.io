    <h2>  general description </h2><p>  The complex is located in a unique climatic zone, on the seashore.  Here nature itself heals, calms and gives an excellent mood.  The Resort Village (Vityazevo) is spread over 9 hectares of landscape territory.  Moreover, the presence of its own infrastructure makes the complex look like a whole city.  You only need to buy a ticket and get to the place.  Inside the resort area there is everything that you might need. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  ‚ÄúResort Village‚Äù (Vityazevo) surprises its guests at first sight.  The territory is well-groomed, clean and fully equipped for a comfortable stay and relaxation.  In the center are two five-story residential buildings, which are interconnected by warm passages.  Moreover, without going outside, you can get into the dining room, medical building and the pool, which is very convenient, especially in the winter season.  It offers shops and beauty salons, several indoor and outdoor pools.  Lovers of the steam room can attend saunas, and if you want to be alone in the evening, then welcome to the reading room of the library.

Spacious, modern rooms meet the highest standards of quality and comfort.  At the same time, each guest has the opportunity to choose: settle in one of the hotel buildings or in separate bungalows.  The second option is ideal for a person who prefers privacy.  ‚ÄúResort Village‚Äù (Vityazevo) is an ideal option for families with children.  A closed and protected area with an abundance of entertainment facilities will allow all family members to spend time the way they want. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vityazevo resort village prices" class="if" height="358" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1509358.jpg" width="480"></div>

    <h2>  Catering for tourists </h2><p>  LOC ‚ÄúVityaz‚Äù suggests not only an excellent rest, but also recovery, as the name implies.  At the same time, a lot of attention is paid to the nutrition of guests.  Most of the chronic diseases we develop precisely because of errors in the diet.  On the basis of the Vityaz LOK, you can manage to revise your views on a healthy diet.  Guests are offered three meals a day on the buffet system.  All dishes are made from organic and fresh local produce.  Judging by the reviews, the cuisine of this dining room is superior to some restaurants. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But the most important thing is an individual selection of menus.  For everyone who needs nutrition correction, the doctor will create an individual diet.  Her goals may be different: losing weight and improving, cleansing the intestines and correcting chronic diseases. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="resort village of anapa" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1509357.jpg" width="600"></div>

Large and beautiful territory, landscaped area, shops and swings everywhere.  There is a free cinema on the territory where good pictures are constantly played.  The hotel does not pour alcohol at all, only in one of the shops you can buy beer.  The only negative - the beach is about 700 meters from the hotel.  But the beach is individual, sandy, and the sea is shallow, for families with children - ideal. </p>
