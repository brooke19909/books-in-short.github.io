    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Every citizen has the right to deduction.  This includes: own education (any);  study of native children (full-time, until they reach the age of 24 years);  training for children in care (full-time, up to 18 years old) or previously in care (full-time, up to 24 years);  education of siblings (full-time, up to 24 years).  There is no deduction for husband or wife training.  They themselves should apply for it.  The right to deduction is canceled if maternity capital was used or the employer paid for training (except for the situation when the employee then returns the amount paid from the salary, for example). <br><br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it possible to get a tax deduction for training at a driving school" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14555/239830.jpg" width="534"></div>  How to get a tax deduction for tuition?  Payment is made only for the period in which the tuition fee was paid.  If it was paid at one time for all years and 13% of the fee exceeds the allowable threshold, the residue of the deduction burns out, it cannot be received in another year.  Therefore, think over the question in advance.  It might be worthwhile to pay tuition fees and write a tax return annually.  If the contract is concluded between the educational institution and the parent, and the <span>receipt of payment is</span> issued in the same name, there will be no problems.  If all documents are written in the name of the child, the father or mother will have to prove the right to deduction in court.  Therefore, immediately draw up an agreement for one of the parents so that later there are no unnecessary questions from the tax inspectorate.
