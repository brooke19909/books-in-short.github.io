    <h2>  Briefly about the hotel </h2><p>  This complex was built exactly 35 years ago.  Despite this age, everything inside looks modern and new.  Which is not surprising.  After all, a complete reconstruction was carried out 7 years ago, and cosmetic repairs are carried out regularly. </p><p>  This hotel is ideal for people who want to both get acquainted with the local culture and enjoy a beach holiday.  After all, Dubai is located on the Arabian Peninsula, washed by the Persian Gulf.  And Hotel Ja Jebel Ali Beach Hotel is located at all on its own private beach, the length of which is about one kilometer.  So there is enough space for everyone. </p><p>  And the airport is pretty close - about 40 minutes from the hotel.  Also nearby is the golf resort and SPA Jebel Ali.  Other interesting sights to drive.  They are within 10-20 kilometers of the hotel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About Services </h2><p>  Hotel Ja Jebel Ali Beach Hotel has everything you need for a comfortable stay.  In the lobby guests are welcomed with a 24-hour reception.  There is also a point where you can exchange currency, a tour desk, an ATM and a concierge offering their services.  Wi-Fi, by the way, is distributed not only in the lobby, but throughout the complex (and to the rooms too), and it‚Äôs absolutely free. </p><p>  The hotel has a laundry with dry cleaning, where they can iron clothes and clean guests shoes.  The hotel has a business center, conference room, office with photocopy and fax. </p><p>  Naturally, there is a car rental, a hairdresser with a beauty salon and services for delivering newspapers, drinks and food directly to the guests' apartments.  Shops are also available on site. </p><p>  Special attention should be paid to the level of staff training.  This hotel employs people who are native speakers of 17 different languages!  So no one will have communication problems.  There are employees who know English, German, Spanish, French, Swedish, Dutch and Portuguese.  There are employees who speak Chinese, Vietnamese, Filipino, Indonesian and Italian.  And some employees speak Russian, Ukrainian, Lithuanian and Hindi.  Of course, everyone here speaks Arabic.  Such a decent level of training pleasantly surprises all visitors. </p>

    <h2>  Transfer </h2><p>  I would also like to dwell on this service.  Hotel Ja Jebel Ali Beach Hotel provides its guests with a free shuttle service to the shopping centers of the capital.  But that is not all.  They are also welcomed at the airport - right after the guests receive their luggage, they should start looking for representatives of the hotel with a sign that says its name. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If the transfer is ordered not from the Dubai airport, but from the one located in Abu Dhabi, then tourists need to go to the sixth exit from the lobby and look for a driver there.  Because there are no hotel representatives at Abu Dhabi International Airport.  A transfer from <span>Sharjah Airport</span> is also possible <span>.</span> </p><p>  They take guests to the hotel not for free.  The price depends on which airport they arrive at.  The minimum amount is 200 dirhams (3,400 rubles), and the maximum is 475 (about 8,070 rubles).  The cheapest transfer costs from the first terminal of Dubai Airport.  The most expensive option is from Abu Dhabi, in a 7-seater luxury minibus. </p><h2>  Free entertainment </h2><p>  At Ja Jebel Ali Beach Hotel, there are many ways to brighten up your leisure time.  There are paid and free entertainment.  First, talk about those that are available to anyone. </p><p>  Naturally, this is a visit to a private beach, where there are sun loungers, umbrellas and fresh towels for everyone.  You can swim in the pool (there are two of them), go to the gym with different simulators, play volleyball.  Still there are camels - everyone has the opportunity to ride them. </p><p>  The hotel has squash and badminton courts - everywhere there is lighting and air conditioning.  There are also four tennis courts.  You can also enjoy the sauna or jacuzzi.  These are two free services at the SPA-center, which is located in the hotel. </p><p>  And yet there are two clubs - one for kids, the other for teens.  Children can spend time there while their parents are resting. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Paid services </h2><p>  Ja Jebel Ali Beach Hotel has plenty of other ways to have fun.  There is a golf course that meets international standards.  There is also a shooting club.  It also corresponds to the international level. </p><p>  Guests can also go horse riding here.  The hotel has its own air-conditioned stables.  For children, by the way, there are ponies here - you can ride them. </p><p>  Ja Jebel Ali Beach Hotel is a 5-star hotel, respectively, with it (as mentioned above) has its own SPA center.  More than forty procedures are available for guests there.  There is a hammam, jacuzzi, sauna, steam room, massage rooms, aroma and stone therapy, reflexology, body wraps, aqua aerobics, flower and herbal baths - this is just a small list of what you can try here. </p><p>  Lovers of an active lifestyle will love water sports.  There is everything.  These are kayaking, boats and catamarans, windsurfing, water skiing, diving, banana riding, wakeboarding, water polo and sailing.  Even an inflatable water park is available. </p><p>  The rating of Ja Jebel Ali Beach Hotel 5 * is high, which is not surprising.  After all, they even organize seaplane flights and deep sea fishing!  Needless to say, about such usual ways to brighten up leisure time like billiards, cycling, etc. </p><h2>  Types of food </h2><p>  In Ja Jebel Ali Beach Hotel 5 * (United Arab Emirates), guests can book a room with breakfast, half board or with an all-inclusive system.  But that is not all.  There is also an ‚Äúultra all inclusive‚Äù service.  And this package includes not only food. </p><p>  Breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks - all this is available to guests.  Non-alcoholic and strong drinks (both local and imported), as well as cocktails are available in unlimited quantities, and in all 12 establishments available at the hotel.  But still guests can engage in non-motorized sports for free, go to the water park and take their children (if any) to nurseries or clubs.  In general, 80% of the services for guests who have ordered the ultra all-inclusive package are provided without any limits. </p><p>  By the way, in many respects it was thanks to UltraAll Inclusive that the hotel in 2012 became the best family hotel by international recognition and received a corresponding award.  This event naturally raised her rating. </p>

    <h2>  Family rooms </h2><p>  Apartments of this category are rather quickly booked at Ja Jebel Ali Beach Hotel 5 *.  UAE, Dubai (Jebel Ali) - many come here with children.  And for them there are apartments with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã60 square meters.  m. They can accommodate two adults and 3 children (up to 18 years). </p><p>  The family apartments consist of two connecting rooms with bathrooms and balconies.

Tea, sugar, coffee, cream are also reported every day. </p><p>  Also, with regular frequency, maids replenish stocks of shampoos, rinses, gels, lotions, soaps and other cosmetics in hygiene kits.

    <h2>  Guest Comments </h2><p>  All guests of this hotel leave positive feedback about their stay here on vacation.  Everyone notes with attention a huge green area with palm trees, which looks like a picturesque park.  Here, by the way, peacocks and many other birds walk around - almost tame. </p><p>  Many more like the huge beach, which is enough space for everyone.  The approach is shallow, comfortable, with small pebbles. </p><p>  As guests say, if you come here out of season, when there are few guests, and politely ask for apartments with a view of the sea, not the garden, they can be given even without extra charge.  In general, there are very kind and friendly workers, which cannot but rejoice. </p><p>  The hotel positions itself as a complex for families with children.  Which is true, because it will be fun for both adults and kids - the conditions are created for everyone.  But, however, everyone can have a good rest here.  After all, this is a real 5-star hotel, which has absolutely all the conditions for an ideal vacation. </p>
