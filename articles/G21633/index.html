That is why it is worth highlighting some of the most interesting facts about this program, as well as talk about which issues are most interesting among many others. </p><h2>  History and interesting facts </h2>

    <p>  In principle, the questions “What?  Where?  When? ”, Like the show itself, practically do not change throughout the entire existence of this program, but in fact, in the first issue, experts were completely absent.  Simple families initially took part in the program, and at the same time they answered not in architectural mansions, but in standard apartments owned by them.  Each family averted 11 questions, after which it was decided to combine both captured scenes in one program.  The current format of the show began to be respected only in 1977, but it remains so to this day. </p><p>  For a long time, the audience was completely unaware of who was conducting this program, as a result of which for several years Vladimir Voroshilov was called the nickname "Incognito from Ostankino."  Only in 1980, the personality of the host of the program was publicly announced, and this was done by inserting the phrase after the end of the broadcast: “The program was conducted by Vladimir Voroshilov”. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Questions “What?”  Where?  When?"  are given to experts in the Hunter's Lodge, located in the Neskuchny Garden, while it is worth noting that this building is a monument of architecture, built back in the XVIII century.  All games of this club are held here since 1990. </p><p>  An eagle owl named Fomka was chosen as a symbol, and in 1977 it was shown on one of the broadcasts.  The so-called “Crystal Owl” is awarded only after 1984, and in 2002 it was decided to also add a diamond <span>owl</span> to the <span>crystal owl</span> , providing it to the best player according to the results of the past year.  A diamond owl is made of crystal and silver by professional jewelers by hand, while it is worth noting that this prize is decorated with more than 70 rubies.  The weight of an owl is more than 8 kg. </p><p>  Among other things, it is worth noting the fact that initially the base of questions “What?  Where?  When?"  compiled directly by Vladimir Voroshilov himself, as well as a team of professional editors.  Over time, it was decided that it would be possible to use letters from viewers coming to the editorial office, because the answers to questions sometimes turned out to be the most unexpected. </p><p>  Probably every person who at least once looked at the questions “What?  Where?  When? ”, Knows what a spinning top is inside a spinning circle.  This spinning top is launched before each round and represents a dream, a slightly improved children's toy produced by the Krasny Proletary plant in Moscow.  Vladimir Voroshilov himself said that once he was going to buy a gift for a child of three years old at the Toy House and noticed this spinning top.  But later he could not resist, so he decided to buy two toys at once, one of which he kept for himself and then played with her for ten days. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Next we look at “What?  Where?  When?"  the issues that are most interesting to solve for most people. </p><h2>  Deeds of people </h2><p>  Once a shah in Persia wanted to know what determines the behavior of a person and directs his actions in this life.  Initially, the assistants of the shah compiled a rather large volume, but then they were able to reduce it to one page.  In the end, they managed to find only one single word. </p><p>  Accordingly, connoisseurs of “What?  Where?  When?"  questions were asked about this word.  Connoisseurs decided that this was love, but in fact the correct answer was that the actions and behavior of a person are led by a desire for survival. </p><h2>  Best Selling Prospects </h2>

    <p>  A group of sociologists from America determined the equation, using which they were able to calculate the rate of increase in the number of purchased copies of various bestsellers.  In other words, if the number of books purchased during the first week was known, then in this case it will be possible to understand later how many, for example, they will buy during the month.  However, as it turned out, such an equation has long been used, but in a different area of ​​human activity. </p><p>  Base of questions “What?  Where?  When?"  includes the following question: what exactly was calculated by exactly the same equation as the distribution of best-selling books? </p><p>  Experts said that in accordance with this equation the growth of epidemics is determined, and they did not fail - this is indeed so. </p><h2>  Looseness </h2><p>  <span>An American newspaper</span> called Weekly World News conducted a survey in the five largest cities of its country in order to determine who would agree to go to work naked for $ 1 million.  Among men, 84% of the total number of people surveyed agreed, while among the women surveyed, only 20% agreed, which made them more bashful.  It is likely that the explanation is contained in the response from one of the participants in the survey, which would agree to be exposed if it was warned in advance for several weeks. </p><p>  In what?  Where?  When?"  They decided to send a question: why did a woman need these few weeks?  The answer is quite simple: in order to lose weight. </p><h2>  Acapulco </h2>

    <p>  Almost all over the world they know what the Mexican resort of Acapulco is.  The popularity of this resort is primarily due to the local climate, which is ideal for relaxation.  If you guess what exactly the word “Acapulco” means from the Aztec language, can you name the famous traveler who also visited the city with the same name? </p><p>  Although the questions for the game are “What?”  Where?  When?"  quite tricky were sent, experts were able to answer that this traveler is Dunno. </p><h2>  Technical growth </h2><p>  The device appeared in the United States in the twentieth century in the 20s, and for the first time it was released by a company that before that was exclusively engaged in the manufacture of <span>cocktail mixers.</span>  This device quickly became common among a large number of people, and already in the 30s and 40s devices began to become popular, in which there was the ability to adjust the speed and degree of heating.  Why, then, in the 60s, so much increased demand for such equipment? </p><p>  Very often this question is included in the “What?  Where?  When?".  Questions and answers for students are especially interesting, since such tasks are often found in similar games held between institutions.  The answer is that in the 60s of the last century men began to wear long hair, as a result of which hair dryers were also quite widespread among them. </p><h2>  Psychology </h2>

    <p>  An English scientist and part-time psychologist named David Lewis said that it is safe exclusively for women, while in men it can cause a source of quite serious illnesses.  In the course of the research, it was determined that only a quarter of all women had some slight deviations in the likeness of an increased heartbeat, while men reacted extremely negatively to this: they had a greatly increased heart rate, arrhythmia appeared, and also significantly increased blood pressure.  The answer is the English word, which has recently become common in Russian. </p><p>  Many peer into all kinds of collections of tasks “What?  Where?  When?"  questions and answers, although in fact the answer is extremely simple - this is shopping. </p><h2>  Similarity </h2><p>  This is rather strange, but these two have much in common.  Both have Italian roots, and even their middle names would be the same if they were at all.  At the same time, relations with Russia developed differently for them, since the first visit to this country suffered a lot of trouble, although at first he conducted his business quite successfully, while the second not only became incredibly popular, but in principle it was here that he appeared to the light.  Who is it? </p><p>  Quite often you can find in the collections such questions “What?  Where?  When?"  for schoolchildren, since the answer is quite interesting - this is Pinocchio and Napoleon. </p><h2>  Similarity number 2 </h2>

    <p>  Each of them has inhuman abilities, while the first is quite friendly to everyone around him, although one woman has seriously suffered from him.  At the same time, the second is very unfriendly, but a certain woman ultimately escaped the threat from him, while both made absolutely identical promises.  Who is it? </p><p>  Again, a very interesting question to the younger generation was provided by the game “What?”  Where?  When?".  Questions and answers of this type require increased attention.  The correct answer is “Terminator and Carlson”, and they made one promise - to return. </p><h2>  Hazardous substance </h2><p>  This substance is the main component of acid rain.  If it is in a gaseous form, there is a risk of injuring a person with severe burns, and if this substance enters the stomach, excessive sweating may occur, as well as vomiting if a large dose is taken.  If a person accidentally inhales a substance, then in this case there is a risk of death.  What is this substance? </p><p>  In what?  Where?  When?"  the question about this substance is one of the most interesting, since this tricky task has a very interesting answer - water. </p><h2>  Chess </h2>

    <p>  The famous chess player <span>Bobby Fisher</span> said that if these two had ever crossed over one <span>chessboard,</span> then in the end the game would simply have ended in a draw.  Who was he talking about? </p><p>  Those people who know the biography of Bobby Fisher and understand his behavior approximately will most likely guess this answer, because he spoke about the situation when he would bother to meet God himself at the chessboard.  Many people see the answer in the collections of tasks “What?  Where?  When?"  questions and correct answers. </p><h2>  Cars </h2><p>  Today, only 7% of the total number of cars sold in America in 2010 are equipped with this device, while the press often says that this is an extremely effective protection against theft, which was originally developed for completely different purposes.  What it is?  Answer: manual gearbox. </p><h2>  Strange dog </h2><p>  Once in the practice of the famous English veterinarian Gillian Maxwell, he happened to encounter a situation where the labrador brought to him was very depressed and almost lost his appetite.  However, after the tests, it was found that the dog was completely healthy, and with each subsequent visit, the tests were getting better and better.  After a conversation with the owners, it turned out that at the same time all family members, shortly before the disease, the dogs made a joint decision and adhere to it to this day.  What did they decide? </p><p>  This question can be included in the most appropriate questions on “What?”  Where?  When?"  with answers for students.  The answer is quite interesting - all family members decided to quit smoking, as a result of which the dog was experiencing withdrawal symptoms. </p><h2>  Hostages </h2>

    <p>  After the capture of a certain embassy in London as a result of lengthy negotiations, the terrorists decided to release two hostages, while the captives themselves chose who they need to release.  Initially, a pregnant woman was chosen, after which, together with her, the hostages, who lived together for several days, decided to also release the man.  Connoisseurs needed to determine why the man was released with her. </p><p>  The decision is quite interesting and memorable, because they decided to let this man go, because he snored too much. </p><h2>  Patriotism </h2><p>  One episode of the animated series The Simpsons shows how Bart, next to Chinese spies, wonders if he could betray his own country because he daily swore allegiance to the flag of the United States.  In response, an objection was received that it was not pronounced to the country, but to the flag, but to the flag ... Connoisseurs needed to complete the idea of ​​spies with just three words. </p><p>  The question, again, is interesting enough for children, but at the same time not so easy for adults.  Again, an interesting answer was received: the oath is not pronounced to the country, but to the flag, and the flag is made in China. </p><h2>  Peter I </h2><p>  What, in accordance with one joke, did Peter I order when he and his army got lost in the swamps?  He did not want to pretend that they had lost their way in such a place, so he gave the order in order to be able to hide such a shameful fact. </p><p>  Finally, a rather simple and interesting question, the answer of which is the foundation of St. Petersburg.
