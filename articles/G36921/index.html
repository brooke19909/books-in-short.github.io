Useful little things for home</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  An interesting and inspiring crochet for home is very exciting for many needlewomen.  Having connected one beautiful little thing, then it‚Äôs difficult to stop, I want to create something else: having made a plaid, we knit a pillow for it, for knitted flowers you need a vase or napkin, etc. Some people think that knitted things are impractical, but this is not so .  Nowadays there are a lot of materials that perfectly adapt to the conditions of the interior.  For example, bright blankets of motifs, lace rugs made from a special cord, slippers and much more.  If you want to make your home unique and unusual, try your hand at crocheting for home.  It is very exciting. </p><h2>  Crochet for home - useful little things and not only </h2><p>  Leaders, of course, are plaids.  Even those who have a simple and modest appearance, will perfectly cope with their direct purpose - they will warm their owner on a cold winter evening. </p><p>  Knit products and one large fabric, and from individual elements.  In this case, separate small parts are connected.  For them, it is recommended to select several shades of yarn.  Do not worry, this will not look sloppy. </p><p>  As a complement to the blanket, pillowcases can be made.  Knitting them is simple and quick.  Such products will add coziness to the interior.  Any form can be selected - round, square, cylindrical or several in one product. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.nz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crocheted multi-colored pillows" class="if uuid-2673790" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2673790.jpg"></div><p>  Do not forget about rugs.  Yes, not about simple, but about openwork.  Such a wonderful thing will be appropriate everywhere: in the office, nursery, hallway, bathroom, etc. If we take into account that they fit in from a thick cord, then it will take a little time to make. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What about small crocheted napkins made from finer yarn?  They can be used to preserve countertops or as a stand for hot dishes. </p><p>  For the kitchen you will need oven mitts.  They are in almost every home.  Knitwear is not only useful in the household, but also creates a cozy and warm atmosphere. </p><h2>  Delicate home furnishings </h2><p>  The most beloved theme for many craftswomen is knitted flowers.  With the help of this decoration it is possible to transform almost every thing - from the wardrobe to the interior.  You can knit any flowers - from the simplest daisies and violets to complex orchids.  But the rose remains the favorite flower for many. </p><p>  There are several manufacturing methods, but the most popular of them is knitting a strip of lace, subsequently twisted into a flower.  And although creating a flower from a whole strip is easier than comparing it from individual petals, the result is a crocheted flower of extraordinary beauty. </p><p>  To make such a rose, prepare the following materials and tools: </p><ul><li>  Viscose yarn of 2 similar shades - dark and light. </li><li>  Thread with a needle. </li><li>  We will crochet No. 1,5 according to the attached scheme. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="semeynaya-kuchka.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lace strip pattern for roses" class="if uuid-2673200" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2673200.jpg"></div><p>  After the knitting of the strip is completed, it will need to be rolled up with a spiral and fix the flower with a hook or thread with a needle.  Rose is ready. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Crocheted knitted napkins can decorate absolutely any interior: dining room, living room or office.  They turn out unusually thin and delicate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="orgubahcem.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="assembly of roses from a lace strip" class="if uuid-2673800" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2673800.jpg"></div><p>  They are knitted according to the schemes of thin cotton yarn with a thin hook.  Starch and dry on a flat surface, gently stretching each arch. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.livemaster.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="small napkin" class="if uuid-2673217" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2673217.jpg"></div><h2>  Decorate the sofa </h2><p>  Thousands of small elements that are easy to do with your own hands create our comfortable existence.  One of these little things - soft pillows on the sofa. </p><p>  With their help it is very simple to decorate the interior, creating various styles.  A huge number of manufacturing options, limited only by the imagination of the craftswoman. </p><p>  Consider how to knit an original roller-shaped pillow.  At first glance it seems that it is necessary to make a lot of effort for its manufacture, but this is not so at all.  According to the scheme located further in the article, connect the rectangle with the dimensions of the sides 40 by 60 cm and 2 circles with a radius of 10 cm. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="kruchcom.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cylindrical pillow knitting pattern" class="if uuid-2673139" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2673139.jpg"></div><p>  If you knit from a thick thread, then worry about the inner cover is not necessary.  Just put the filler inside and connect all the parts, sewing on the side with a zipper to facilitate further care of the pillowcase. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kruchcom.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="side part of the pillow" class="if uuid-2673149" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2673149.jpg"></div><h2>  Knit slippers </h2><p>  And you can crochet bright warm and soft slippers.  The description given in the article is suitable for size 37, buttons are used for decoration. </p><p>  The sole begins with a chain of twenty air loops and goes in a circle.  We knit 9 rows with single crochet, making 5 - 6 loops on the ends of the increase. </p><p>  In the tenth and eleventh rows we also knit single crochet without adding. </p><p>  From the 12th to the 16th row, we knit the main fabric with single crochet, reducing four loops in the middle of the sock. </p><p>  For the jumper, we will make a chain of fifteen air loops, on it we knit several rows with columns without a crochet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="faalconn.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="slippers" class="if uuid-2673803" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2673803.jpg"></div><p>  It remains to sew it to the slipper and decorate it with buttons.  Well, comfortable crocheted slippers. </p><h2>  Household items - oven mitts </h2><p>  These are the most common gizmos that even a beginner can tie.  There are many different ways, but the cutest and most charming are crocheted tacks. </p><p>  Shape and color are completely different.  Many people like such an elegant and bright accessory in the form of a watermelon slice.  He will bring fun and joy to the home interior, will please the owner with ease of use. </p><p>  Stock up on dark green, light green, white and red yarn.  In total, about 50 g will be needed. </p><p>  Tie a semicircle, alternating the shades as they are in a real watermelon - 7 rows with double crochet with red thread, 1 row with double crochet with white thread, 1 row with single crochet with light green thread and a number of double crochet with dark green thread.  And with it we knit a loop. </p><p>  The bulk of the work is completed, it remains to embroider the seeds. </p><h2>  Hook Owl Mats </h2><p>  Soft round rugs are quite popular today.  Moreover, it is quite easy to make them.  And if you connect several circles of different sizes together, it will turn out quite interesting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="delatsami.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rug &quot;owl&quot;, a scheme of circles" class="if uuid-2673100" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2673100.jpg"></div><p>  Try to make an ‚ÄúOwl‚Äù in this way for a child‚Äôs room or try your hand at more complex knitting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="delatsami.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="More sophisticated pineapple owl rug" class="if uuid-2673110" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2673110.jpg"></div><h2>  Crocheting a washcloth </h2><p>  Let's try to make another accessory useful in everyday life.  Crocheting for the home includes not only the manufacture of interior items, but also such an important trifle as bath and shower accessories - washcloths. </p><p>  It will take quite a bit of sisal twine.  It is perfect for making washcloths for peeling.  These are used by professionals in beauty salons, but they are not cheap.  A hook for making such a washcloth will need a thick one, about 11 to 12. </p><p>  To get started, dial 65 air loops and close the ring with a half-column.  Next, knit to the desired length with columns without crochets in a circle.  If you need a more ribbed and roughened washcloth, then alternate single crochet with double crochet.  To make handles on both sides, tie chains of seventy air loops and tie them with one row of double crochets.  Your hard peeling washcloth is ready. </p>
