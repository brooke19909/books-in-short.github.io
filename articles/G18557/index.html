  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Trust payment" on MTS: how to disable and activate the service</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sometimes the funds on the phone account run out at the most inopportune moment.  And it is not always possible to put on the balance instantly.  MTS takes care of its subscribers and provides them with the ‚ÄúPromised Payment‚Äù service, which helps in such situations.  In the article, we will analyze the connection of the service in more detail, and also learn how to disable the trust payment on MTS. </p><h2>  What is the essence </h2><div class="photo" data-original="bizfluent.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="service connection" class="if uuid-2810777" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/105510/2810777.jpg"></div><p>  In fact, this is the replenishment of the balance on the phone by the communication company itself, in this case MTS.  We can say that this is a kind of debt collection from the operator of a certain amount of money, which can be used for a certain period.  Of course, MTS takes a small commission for providing the ‚ÄúTrust payment‚Äù service, but in some cases the service is very useful and worth its money. </p><p>  The amount that the company is ready to provide within the framework of the "Promised Payment" service may differ for each subscriber.  It all depends on how much money a person spends per month and how much time MTS uses.  The minimum amount is thirty rubles, no commission is charged for it.  Up to 800 rubles can be borrowed per week using a trust payment. </p><h2>  Who is available </h2><p>  The service is not provided: </p><ul><li>  for users of the tariffs "Guest", "MTS iPad", "Your country", "Basic"; </li><li>  for subscribers connected to a mobile operator for less than two months; </li><li>  This service is already activated on the room, or the previous one is not canceled; </li><li>  deferred payment method is used on the room. </li></ul><h2>  Commission </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitaltrends.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="in the hands of the phone" class="if uuid-2810781" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/105510/2810781.jpg"></div><p>  With the promised payment of more than 30 rubles, the cost of the service is: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  from 31 to 99 rubles - seven rubles; </li><li>  from 100 to 199 rubles - ten rubles; </li><li>  from 200 to 499 rubles - twenty-five rubles; </li><li>  more than five hundred rubles - fifty rubles. </li></ul><h2>  How to get a "Trust payment" on MTS </h2><p>  There are several ways to connect the service: </p><ul><li>  USSD-request - * 111 * 123 # and the key to send a call, then follow the tooltips; </li><li>  a call to the MTS client center; </li><li>  go to the "My Account" on the website of MTS. </li></ul><p>  The debt must be repaid within three days by replenishing the balance in any way convenient for the subscriber.  If this is not done, then the operator will debit the money from the phone account and block the number until the person pays the debt. </p><h2>  Is it possible with a minus </h2><p>  How to get "Trust payment" on MTS, if the balance is minus?  Many subscribers ask this question.  The company provides the service even in this case.  But the balance should be no more than minus 30 rubles.  If the negative balance is greater than the specified amount, "Trust payment" is not provided. </p><h2>  How to disable "Trust payment" on MTS </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.popsci.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable the service" class="if uuid-2810784" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/105510/2810784.jpg"></div><p>  If there is no desire to remain in debt with the company, and the subscriber rarely uses this service, you can disable it using your personal account.  To do this, you must have Internet access. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  So, the algorithm of actions: </p><ul><li>  the first thing to do is go to the site and select "My MTS, mobile communications"; </li><li>  in the form that opens, you need to specify your phone number and password; </li><li>  Next, open the "My Services" tab; </li><li>  to find the necessary service, you need to check the box next to the item "All"; </li><li>  after that, the services will be shown in alphabetical order, it is necessary to note those that are not needed, in this case, "Promised payment" or "In full confidence"; </li><li>  after that, click on the cross and confirm the refusal. </li></ul><p>  This method is suitable only in case of a positive balance on the phone.  If the balance is negative, you need to replenish the account. </p><h2>  More ways </h2><div class="photo" data-original="jakpodrywacnatinderze.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="good news" class="if uuid-2810787" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/105510/2810787.jpg"></div><p>  How to disable "Trust payment" on MTS is the easiest way: </p><ul><li>  dial a combination of the following numbers on the phone - * 111 * 32 # and the send call key; </li><li>  then you need to follow the prompts that come to the phone. </li></ul><p>  Another simple way is to call MTS customer service.
