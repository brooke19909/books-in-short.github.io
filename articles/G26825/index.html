Many say that having lived all their lives in Russia, only after a tour of the ancient cities did they begin to understand its essence and feel part of a great power.  Today we will consider the sights of Zvenigorod. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.7313524" data-lng="36.85520339999994" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/2/9/3/8/2938.png"></div><h2>  general description </h2><p>  This is one of the oldest <span>cities in the Moscow region.</span>  Archaeologists confirm that the fortified settlements on the site of Zvenigorod were founded in the XII century.  But in the annals of information about him appeared only in 1382.  Then this city experienced a period of unprecedented prosperity.  During the reign of Yuri Dolgoruky, the Kremlin was built, a system of earthen ramparts, a high wooden wall with towers was created.  Until now, they, together with the Savvino-Storozhevsky monastery, as well as magnificent cathedrals, are considered the most attractive sights of Zvenigorod. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Several types of public transport regularly go to Zvenigorod and back.  Residents and guests of the capital will not have any problems visiting the ancient city.  Bus No. 452 leaves from Kuntsevskaya metro station, No. 455 leaves from Tushinskaya metro station, No. 881 from Strogino metro station. If you want to see Zvenigorod sights in one day, it will be very convenient to use them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition, there are trains that depart from Belorussky and Savelovsky stations every hour.  The most important thing for a traveler is to draw up a plan in advance to move on.  Otherwise, you risk spending a lot of time on useless wandering around the city and get tired more than getting to know the story.  We start our journey together from the railway station.  In itself, it does not represent any historical value.  But from here you can pretty quickly get to the main attraction of Zvenigorod. </p><h2>  Savvino-Storozhevsky monastery </h2><p>  It is located outside the city, but getting to it is not difficult.  Buses number 23 and 51 depart directly from the station to the monastery. The monastery was founded on Mount Storozhe in 1398.  Surprisingly, it seems that time is not dominant over him.  It was founded by the students of Sergius of Radonezh.  Then it was a tiny wooden church with a cell.  Already much later, in the XVI century, the monastery acquired walls, a stone temple and chambers. </p><p>  By the way, do not miss your stop.  It is called the ‚ÄúMinistry of Defense Holiday Home‚Äù.  The bus goes on, and you can now follow the signs.  It is convenient to inspect the sights of Zvenigorod also because they took care of you, hanging special signs everywhere.  Today, with navigators, everything has become much easier, but still such a concern for tourists pleases. </p><div class="photo" data-original="margaritka.tourister.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ancient monastery" class="if uuid-2449538" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2449538.jpg"></div><h2>  We are in place </h2><p>  When the monastery building appears before the guests, they refuse to believe in the date of its construction.  Of course, good care and regular repairs played a role.  But all the same, it is impossible to get rid of the thought of some mysterious force that keeps it out of time.  This unique structure is striking in its grace of forms, harmony and beauty.  A unique landscape plays a role, which complements the appearance of the monastery and makes it even more beautiful. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Today, there are several historical museums and a museum of icons.  Each tourist considers it his duty to visit the main attraction of the city of Zvenigorod.  On site you can buy souvenirs and give them to your relatives.  In addition, there is a beautiful bakery with a large selection of own-made breads.  A variety of varieties of bread and pastries will not leave anyone indifferent. </p><p>  But of course, tourists do not come for bread alone.  The territory of the monastery is ready to surprise even the traveler who has seen the light.  It is surrounded by 760-meter stone walls.  Their height is 9 meters, width - 3 meters.  They are equipped with loopholes so that you can defend yourself from enemies.  The central Red Tower was decorated with the faces of the saints, which have survived to this day.  There are other towers, each with its own history and features.  It‚Äôs best to watch everything in place. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.msmap.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Zvenigorod sights what to see" class="if uuid-2446832" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2446832.jpg"></div><h2>  Local Kremlin </h2><p>  Residents call it Gorodok.  From the monastery you need to return one stop along the Ratekhinsky highway.  All the sights of Zvenigorod and its environs are very difficult to describe in a small article.  But we will stop at the most interesting objects.  So, right from the road you can see a crowd of people.  They collect water from a spring.  Here the territory of the ancient Kremlin begins. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  This is a unique monument of the 12th century.  It was here that the first settlement with wooden fortifications appeared, which is called the Town.  It is necessary to inspect it, as well as other attractions of Zvenigorod and its environs.  In the center of it stands the wooden palace-tower erected in 1395.  Around this time, a stone cathedral of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary was erected nearby.  Until now, it has been preserved in its original form.  I would like to stop here in more detail, but there is still a lot of interesting things ahead.  Indeed, today we decided to make a selection of Mast Sea objects and tell us what to see in one day.  Sights of Zvenigorod in this mode have to inspect very quickly. </p><h2>  Museum of A.P. Chekhov </h2><p>  As soon as you leave Gorodok, you immediately come across a former house, and now the Chekhov Museum.  Not many people know that it was in this city that he worked as a doctor.  Here he began his writing career.  Around the former writer‚Äôs house there are several cozy houses with carved platbands.  These are residential buildings, which are simultaneously ancient monuments.  The entire Krasnaya Gora street is the pages of our history, it shows the beauty of Russian architecture.  To visit the museum itself or to confine itself to its inspection from the outside is everyone decides for himself. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pmvd.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Zvenigorod sights in winter" class="if uuid-2446839" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2446839.jpg"></div><h2>  Museum of Russian dessert </h2><p>  And we continue the conversation about <span>what to see in Zvenigorod.</span>  The sights of this cozy town allow you to plunge into the past era, to imbue with its spirit.  But sooner or later all tourists get tired of going to local history museums.  Then we recommend visiting this amazing house. </p><p>  Sweets appeared a very long time ago.  In Russia, not only bread was baked, but also various sweet treats.  Have you tried the famous Belevsky pastille or the Vyazemsky gingerbread?  They can not be found in the store, but they were forgotten completely undeservedly.  Now Russian sweets have their own museum, where it is very cozy and sincere.  It is especially good here in winter. </p><p>  <span>The sights of Zvenigorod are</span> quick to get around.  And after a walking tour, having frozen and tired, you can drink tea with sweets and listen to stories about what gingerbread cookies were prepared in Russia and on what occasions they were served.  And of course, here you can buy luxury pastries and other goodies: straws, candy and candy.  The cost of excursions is 200 rubles. </p><h2>  Temple of the ascension </h2><p>  Directly from the museum you go to the city park.  This place is a little like those sights of Zvenigorod that you should definitely see in winter.  At this time of year, you can only take a walk along the avenue with benches.  In the summer, when a playground is open here, the park looks much more interesting. </p><p>  But passing through the park, you get straight to the Church of the Ascension of the Lord.  He stands proudly on a hill.  The first description of it dates back to 1624.  He was ravaged and destroyed several times.  Today it is a very beautiful five-domed brick building. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.russkoekino.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Zvenigorod sights what to see" class="if uuid-2446834" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2446834.jpg"></div><h2>  House-Museum of M.M. Prishvin in Dunino </h2><p>  If you are tired of walking around the city, you can return to exploring the surroundings again.  The sights of Zvenigorod and the <span>Moscow region are</span> so versatile that every traveler has the opportunity to choose what he likes.  Just 5 km from Zvenigorod, in a picturesque place is a house museum and a manor.  The building is of interest as a historical and cultural monument and nature reserve. </p><p>  The house was built at the beginning of the XX century, at the same time there was a manor with alleys and a meadow.  Guests can enjoy a study with views of the forest glade and spruce alley.  But the real decoration of the house is a seven-sided veranda.  It is surrounded by thickets of jasmine, and it offers wonderful views of the garden, alley, flower beds and fir. </p><div class="photo" data-original="archtour.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Zvenigorod city attractions" class="if uuid-2446847" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2446847.jpg"></div><h2>  Museum of A. S. Pushkin </h2><p>  The <span>estates of Zakharovo</span> and Vyazemy near Moscow are the place where the great Russian writer spent his childhood.  Here his views were formed and the first poems were born.  Now on the territory of two estates is located the State Historical and Literary Museum-Reserve.  Here you can wander along the paths of ancient parks, breathe the air of these places, look at the magnificent monuments of architecture.  These are not just park figurines, but a whole palace and park ensemble.  This is the Church of the Transfiguration, the belfry of the late 16th century, the palace, parks and ponds. </p><h2>  Museum of S. I. Taneev in Dyutkovo </h2><p>  In the vicinity of Zvenigorod there is another interesting museum that will appeal to fans of a talented musician.  Art and thematic exhibitions open here annually.  And of course, the traditional music festival, where talented students of music universities of the country perform. </p><p>  The museum exposition is located in an old village house.  Here are personal items, books, furniture that the musician used.  The content of the excursions includes a story about the history of the village, the life and work of Taneyev, his last days of life. </p><div class="photo" data-original="autotravel.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Zvenigorod sights what to see in the winter" class="if uuid-2446840" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2446840.jpg"></div><h2>  Interesting places </h2><p>  The surroundings of the ancient city are interesting not only for monasteries and temples.  There are many noteworthy places that have nothing to do with religion and history. </p><ul><li>  The Pyramid of Hunger.  It is made of fiberglass and looks very impressive.  It was created in 1999 as a symbol of the complex 90s. </li><li>  High voltage research facility with Marx and Tesla generators.  This is a purely industrial design, but the unusual appearance attracts curious tourists. </li><li>  Deep Lake.  An ideal place for a summer walk if you want to visit the quietest place.  This is a unique natural site.  A huge and very clean reservoir, which is surrounded on all sides by a forest.  The depth in it reaches 40 meters, and the water is so clear that stones are visible at the bottom.  But getting to the lake is not easy, it is located far from automobile roads. </li><li>  Workshop Kupriyanov.  It was founded back in 1995.  Here you can see unique pieces of art made of ceramics.  Some of them can be bought. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.otzyv.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Zvenigorod attractions in one day" class="if uuid-2446844" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2446844.jpg"></div><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  Ancient Zvenigorod and its environs attract hundreds of tourists every year.  Dozens of museums and ancient churches, monasteries and temples await you.  Each of them is a page in the history of our country.  In Zvenigorod, you can spend a winter or summer vacation.  Of course, they will have to be planned in different ways.  In summer, you can pay more attention to walks in the fresh air.  In the winter, you will find all kinds of exhibitions and theme nights, which will become not only entertainment, but also a way to learn a lot about the history and culture of the native land.  After such a trip, many say that they began to perceive the theme of the homeland and patriotism in a completely different way.  Such educational trips are especially useful for children and adolescents. </p>
