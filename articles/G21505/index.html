And Cyprus is a delicious and satisfying cuisine of the Greek islands, sea cruises and world-famous health resorts. </p><p>  Tourists appear in these places in May.  The local beaches empty in October.  In summer, the Germans, British, French and Russians traditionally come to Greece. </p><h2>  Key points </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.lawyer-monthly.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Resort town" class="if uuid-2356242" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45514/2356242.jpg"></div><p>  As a rule, our compatriots choose inexpensive but comfortable 4 * Cyprus hotels.

This is an ancient settlement that arose in the 7th century BC.  Today it belongs to two states at once.  One part of Nicosia is subordinate to Greece, the other belongs to Turkey.  For this reason, the island capital is not popular with tourists.  Most of Cyprus 4 * hotels, premium villas and guest houses are concentrated in Limassol. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In this city you do not have to be bored.  Children enjoy spending time in water parks and pools, ride rides, visit zoos.  For youth work bars and discos.  The lion's share of vacationers in these parts are Russians.  For them, hotels in Cyprus 4 * and 5 * provide service in Russian.
