And if the bathhouse is serviced at the level of world standards, it is simply a sin not to visit it.  Many positive reviews about the Pavlovsk baths of Barnaul.  Visitors to the bath complex celebrate the chic atmosphere and collective spirit of the old Russian bathhouse, but presented to visitors in the cool cover of a modern SPA center. </p><h2>  History of Pavlovsk baths </h2><p>  The historical roots of the Pavlovsk baths of Barnaul originate in the distant times, when <span>Akinfiy Demidov</span> laid his mining business in the steppe region of Altai.  Only as such there were no saunas, and people from factories and quarries, trying to wash themselves, went into small soapboxes.  They were built along the Pavlovsky tract, which became the main artery for moving goods.  Not only the breeder‚Äôs workers looked into the baths, but also merchants, travelers, who became more and more.  The city was expanding, new enterprises were opening up, and more and more soap dishes and natural baths appeared along the highway. </p>

    <p>  In the historical documents in the archives of the city, there is information that 290 baths were registered in private houses in 1777.  A century later (by 1865), there were already 1,149 bathhouses in Barnaul, and there was one public bathhouse, which at that time was called "trading," since it was located on a trade route.  She became the founder of the Pavlovsk baths of Barnaul. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The first public baths </h2><p>  By the end of the XIX century, the number of baths increased.  So-called saunas appeared in the city in white, there were 1252 of them, and in black, there were 262. In the saunas, sterility was equated to the operating room in the hospital, as the then adherents of bath procedures said. </p><p>  At the beginning of the 20th century, local merchants began to open their bath houses, appreciating the great need of Barnaul residents and visitors in bath procedures.  The merchants of Kuratov, the philistines of the Kirganovs and Pilichi succeeded in this.  Public steam rooms were opened at the distillery and at the workshops of the Altai Railway. </p><p>  In 1908, the city council of Barnaul decided to pay attention to the baths, drawing up the rules for the maintenance of these institutions.  The authorities created a separate instruction for the smoker.  It said that a person should be healthy and sober.  A mandatory requirement was the maintenance in the baths of female and male servants. </p><h2>  Pavlovsk baths </h2><p>  Years passed, the Barnaul baths were further developed, the hallmark of which was the comfort and luxury of true royal baths, and the time spent in the bath was useful and pleasant for visitors. </p>
