Nevertheless, this type of inexpensive and more or less comfortable housing is popular among many visitors today, especially in large cities, where housing rental prices are very, very decent.  However, the <span>hostel is hostel</span> hostility.  In this article we will introduce you to their main types, revealing the features of each. </p><h2>  What is a hostel? </h2><p>  Dormitory (running slang name - "hostel") is a place of temporary residence: </p><ul><li>  students </li><li>  seasonal workers; </li><li>  employees of organizations with families; </li><li>  private individuals. </li></ul><p>  In a hostel of both apartment type and other types, according to the standards, 6 (previously - 4.5) m¬≤ of personal space per tenant  This allows the sharing of sometimes strangers in the same room.  Why can we assume that the level of comfort here is quite low. </p><p>  All issues related to accommodation, provision, maintenance of hostels (apartment type <strong>,</strong> including) in our country are decided by the Housing Code. </p><p>  Dormitories (in Russia they were called then Bursa) appeared in the Middle Ages.  They were intended for poor students living at universities, seminaries and theological schools. </p><h2>  Types of hostels </h2><p>  The main gradation of these places of residence depends on the layout of the living space.  They are divided: </p><ul><li>  to dormitories of apartment type; </li><li>  corridors; </li><li>  block; </li><li>  hotel view. </li></ul><p>  Depending on the contingent living in the hostel, it happens: </p><ul><li>  for pupils and students; </li><li>  for workers. </li></ul><p>  There is a separation by owner: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  State, municipal, universities and enterprises.  Only persons who are students or employees of a certain organization are entitled to live here. </li><li>  Commercial - their owner is IP, LLC, etc. Anyone can rent a bed here. </li></ol><p>  And the last gradation: </p><ul><li>  "bachelor" hostels - female and male; </li><li>  family hostels. </li></ul><p>  We will analyze the most popular of them in more detail. </p><h2>  Hallway type dormitories </h2><p>  The cheapest and most affordable layout.  Standardly, this is a long corridor, on both sides of which are located the minimally equipped with the necessary rooms, where one to several people live.  On each floor there is a kitchen and a bathroom. </p>

    <h2>  Block type dormitories </h2><p>  Sometimes these dormitories are called sectional - here 2-4 rooms are combined in a separate block.  Each such section has its own bathroom.  The kitchen, in most cases, is one on the floor, but there are options where it is placed in the block. </p><h2>  Hotel-style dormitories </h2><p>  The most comfortable, but the price for accommodation here will come out as in an inexpensive hotel.  In the room there are 2-4 people, there is a separate bathroom, shower, refrigerator, TV.  The kitchen can be either one per floor, or in each room. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Apartment type dormitories </h2><p>  "Small families" is a special kind of hostel.  They are ordinary <span>houses</span> with isolated apartments, each of which has everything you need - a kitchen, a toilet, a bathroom.  Their minus is a small living space. </p><p>  Why is this a hostel?  In Soviet times, apartments here were given out to the families of young workers, visiting specialists.  Today, in residential dormitories, permanent residents live in their privatized property.  It is possible to rent housing here only with its owner. </p>

    <h2>  Family hostels </h2><p>  The allocation of housing here was a tradition in Soviet times.  So, an individual family received a warrant from the union for a settlement in a separate room in a family dormitory.  Sometimes this was a reward for a long experience, and sometimes - a consequence of the long wait for their turn. </p><p>  The provided room was eventually officially assigned to the family.  However, they did not have the right to privatize it in the post-Soviet era.  Why there were frequent high-profile sales of dormitory buildings to new owners, despite the presence of tenants who were legally resident in general. </p><p>  Living conditions in such places are distinguished only by the presence of their own room.  The restroom, showers and kitchen are also shared here. </p>

    <h2>  Work hostels </h2><p>  They can be arranged both according to the layout of the apartment-type hostel and less comfortable varieties.  They belong either to a specific organization or to an intermediary collaborating with this employer.  They have one goal - the placement of seasonal workers (the so-called guest workers), less often - permanent workers.  The latter is more inherent in budget organizations.  An important condition is that the resident receives temporary registration at the hostel address. </p><p>  Since there is no clear definition of the conditions for hostels in Russian law, they can be like a bed-house, and a good two-star economy class hotel.  Mostly from 4 to 20 people live in the room.  Amenities - in the sanitary unit on the floor.  The furnishings of the rooms are Spartan - single or bunk beds, wear-resistant bedding, a table, several chairs, bedside tables, a common wardrobe.  The advantage of such a hostel is that cleaning is done not by residents, but by special staff. </p><p>  That's all we wanted to tell you about a variety of hostels in Russia.  The most comfortable of them are apartment ones.  But today they have lost the status of a hostel and become privatized property. </p>
