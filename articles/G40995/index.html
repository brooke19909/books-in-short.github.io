    <p>  Another advantage of this resort is that it is much faster to get to historical sights from it than from other tourist areas in Egypt located on the Red Sea.  Good quality roads leading to Luxor, Cairo and other famous places contribute to this. </p><h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  Hurghada hotels, of which there are about two hundred, are located mainly along the coastline.  These are five-star deluxe apartments, economy hotels of four- or three-star categories, for example, Giftun Azur Beach Resort, and even guest houses designed for a simple holiday.  Hurghada hotel infrastructure is growing from year to year.  At the same time, most new buildings are already being carried out in remote areas, and therefore the noise does not annoy tourists.  Not only the level of services provided in hotels is constantly improving, but also new offers are appearing. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The cost of tours to the resort of Hurghada and in general to Egypt varies throughout the year.  It depends on the season.  The largest in terms of the number of sales of vouchers for the resort, according to tour operators, fall at the end of autumn, as well as on New Year's holidays or spring months.  And therefore, prices for holidays in hotels, respectively, are lowest in summer, when the hottest weather is set on the coast of the magnificent Red Sea. </p><p>  Hurghada is often called the hotel capital.  The reason is that their number per capita of this resort is one of the largest in the world.  At the same time, prices in Hurghada hotels, although they have a fairly wide range, are generally quite affordable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Giftun Azur Beach Resort 4 Hurghada" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/978575.jpg" width="600"></div>
