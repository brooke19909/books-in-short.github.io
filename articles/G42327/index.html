Not every hotel offers a safe.  A hotel of only a high level, from 3 * + and above, guarantees the safety of valuables in personal cells. </li><li>  You should not take expensive clothes.  Everything you need to relax is best purchased on site.  This will save money and leave new things in mind. </li><li>  Take small souvenirs with you - this will be the best form of appreciation for the quality services in Thailand. </li><li>  This country has very high humidity.  In the case of abscesses on the skin, or infection of the wounds, on-site healing will be prolonged.  You should take antiseptics with you in this case. </li></ul>
