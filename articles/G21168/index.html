It consists of six large and several medium-sized islands and individual rocks.  Most of the small islands are completely covered with eternal ice, which form their relief. </p><p>  The group of islands Severnaya Zemlya is located at the junction of two northern seas - the cold Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãKara and the Laptev Sea and is the northernmost archipelago in Asia.  The most extreme point is considered to be Cape Arctic on the island of Komsomolets. </p><h2>  Last major discovery </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="79.71067162482375" data-lng="94.74670756249998" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="5"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/6/1/6/3/6163.png"></div><p>  Despite the fact that the names of most of the islands of the Northern Land evoke nostalgia for the Soviet Union, the archipelago was opened before the revolution, in early September 1913.  This discovery was made by a research expedition led by Boris Vilkitsky and was the last major discovery of uncharted lands on our planet. At the time of the discovery, scientists from the expedition considered the archipelago to be a single island, and this erroneous opinion lasted quite a long time. </p><p>  Initially, the discoverers of the archipelago named it Taiwan (the name was derived from the first syllables in the names of the icebreakers of the Taimyr and Vaigach expeditions. However, this name did not last long. After the announcement of the discovery of new lands of the Russian Empire, it was decided to rename the archipelago to "Land of Emperor Nicholas II" , in honor of the emperor in power. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For a long time after the discovery of the islands of the archipelago, no one visited the Northern Land.  Only once in 1919 did scientists from the Norwegian expedition of Roald Amundsen visit the island of Bolshevik, and possibly Small Taimyr.  Russia was in a fever during these years: the First World War, then the October Revolution, the Civil War ... </p><p>  Research on these cold inhospitable lands was continued only in the early 30s of the last century.  It was then that members of the expedition led by George Ushakov and Nikolai Urvantsev discovered and described most of the islands of the archipelago.  They gave most of the names to the islands of the Northern Land. </p><h2>  Climatic conditions </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.nat-geo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Glacier on the Bolshevik Island" class="if uuid-2655149" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2655149.jpg"></div><p>  Most of the territory of the islands of Northern Earth is covered with large glaciers.  Huge masses of ice approach the steep banks and hang over the waters of the cold ocean.  The impression of natural beauty and power is simply stunning! </p><p>  In places where glaciers come close to the ocean, icebergs form.  Their sizes rarely exceed 1.5-2 km in length, but there are exceptions.  In 1953, the formation of an iceberg of record sizes for these places was recorded ‚Äî more than 12 km in length! </p><p>  Large islands unexpectedly have many rivers and lakes, but most of the year they are hidden under ice and snow.  The murmur of flowing water can be heard only in July and August. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The climate on the islands is arctic severe.  In the long polar winter, the temperature drops to ‚àí47 ¬∞ C, and an icy heavy wind almost constantly blows. </p><p>  In summer, the maximum temperature does not exceed +6 ¬∞ C, and it is not so warm every year. </p><h2>  Northland Plants </h2><div class="photo" data-original="goarctic.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Flowers in July" class="if uuid-2655160" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2655160.jpg"></div><p>  Due to the severity of the northern climate and the fact that most of the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe islands of the archipelago is occupied by glaciers, the flora of the islands of the Northern Land is very poor.  In those areas where the earth is free of ice cover, the soil is very boggy.  Yes, and permafrost begins at a depth of 15 cm from the surface, which also does not contribute to the lush growth of plants. </p><p>  Basically, the flora of the islands is represented by various mosses and lichens; occasionally perennial flowering plants are found.  On some islands closer to the pole there is no vegetation at all.  For example, the island of Bolshevik in the Severnaya Zemlya archipelago is completely devoid of vegetation. </p><p>  In July, when the waters of rivers and a few lakes are freed from ice, the plant world is transformed.  Plants that bloom on ice-free soil are surprising in their small size.  Often their stems rise above creeping mosses by only 3-15 cm. Scientists studying the flora of these islands are sure that such sizes are due to the harsh climate and low solar activity.  It was noted that the richest vegetation cover is closer to the places of constant bird nesting, where the soil is fertilized from year to year. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  On the other hand, multi-colored lilac, pink, white flowering oases amidst snow and ice look somewhat surprising.  It seems to be a completely new land on the northern islands! </p><h2>  Animals and birds </h2><div class="photo" data-original="sfw.so" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Polar bears" class="if uuid-2656466" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2656466.jpg"></div><p>  Surprisingly, the wildlife of the islands is quite diverse.  Polar bears, wolves, and many arctic foxes that prey on representatives of a large number of lemmings are often found here.  In winter, wild reindeer often wander onto the islands on ice, binding the sea. </p><p>  Life is boiling in the cold waters off the coast of the islands of Northern Land.  Huge walruses thrive here.  One species of walrus lives only in the water area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Laptev Sea - it is the Laptev walrus (Odobenus rosmarus laptevi).  Greenland <span>seals, seals,</span> polar beluga dolphins live here.  There is always enough fish in these northern waters, so there is enough for everyone. </p><p>  Many of these inhospitable lands and birds, both marine and nesting on the ground.  Since the beginning of the polar summer, the cliffs of the southern and southeastern islands of the archipelago have numerous bird markets and individual colonies of nesting birds. </p><h2>  The only ice base </h2><div class="photo" data-original="sfw.so" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ice base on the island of Bolshevik" class="if uuid-2656542" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2656542.jpg"></div><p>  Despite the vast territory of the archipelago, the total area of ‚Äã‚Äãits islands exceeds the territory of Belgium or Albania, there is no population at all. </p><p>  Due to the cold climate and the almost constant ice storms, the local population has never been here. </p><p>  Currently, on the <span>Bolshevik Island of the</span> Northern Land, the only ice base ‚ÄúCape Baranova‚Äù is located on the archipelago, which operates thanks to the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute.  Back in 1986, this base was founded as the Prima polar station, created to study the flora and fauna of the polar regions.  Then it was mothballed and reopened only in June 2013. </p><p>  Today, it is used mainly as a recreation center for expeditions setting off to conquer the North Pole. </p><h2>  Archipelago within the archipelago </h2><div class="photo" data-original="topwar.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Arctic Island Medium" class="if uuid-2656548" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2656548.jpg"></div><p>  Opened in 1913 by an expedition led by Boris Vilkitsky, a group of small islands was named the Sedov Archipelago in honor of the famous polar explorer Georgy Sedov. </p><p>  The archipelago consists of six relatively large islands and several small, not even having names.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe islands included in its composition does not exceed 90 km <sup>2</sup> . </p><p>  In 1930-1932, when the Urvantsev-Ushakov research expedition compiled a complete map of these lands, the Sedov archipelago was territorially included in the Severnaya Zemlya archipelago. </p><p>  On the second largest island in the Sedov archipelago, the island of Sredny Severnaya Zemlya, there is a border outpost, warehouses with fuel and food supplies. </p><p>  During the Soviet Union, from 1959 to 1997, an active polar station and a border outpost were built here.  The number of their personnel has never exceeded 30 people.  Equipment, products and other necessary things were delivered by plane, and an airstrip was still built next to the border guard barracks. </p><h2>  Museum in the Far North </h2><div class="photo" data-original="maxpark.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Landscape on the islands of Severnaya Zemlya" class="if uuid-2656555" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2656555.jpg"></div><p>  The small rocky island of Sredny is also notable for the fact that it houses the only Museum of the discovery and development of Severnaya Zemlya.  It was created by enthusiasts from among the staff of the Arctic Institute. </p><p>  The museum is located in a small house in which George Ushakov used to live.  The exposition has many photographs, some depicting members of the expedition Urvantsev-Ushakov. </p><p>  Other exhibits are devoted to the study of the wildlife of the islands of the Northern Land and local sparse vegetation. </p><h2>  Tourism beyond the Arctic Circle </h2><div class="photo" data-original="goarctic.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Landing on the island of Severnaya Zemlya" class="if uuid-2656599" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2656599.jpg"></div><p>  Recently, these once uninhabited islands are increasingly visited by people.  This is partly due to the fact that almost no human foot has stepped on these vast, undeveloped territories; here you can feel like a pioneer.  Of course, such sensations attract people who love adventure. </p><p>  In addition, in the spring and short summer it is really beautiful here.  This is a harsh northern beauty, when rare primroses sprout directly from the ice, and in the vast expanses you can see hunting polar bears. </p>
