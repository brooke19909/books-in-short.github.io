Of course, when you dream of visiting Italy, the first thing that comes to mind is Rome and Venice, Florence and Milan.  But what about Bologna?  Today it lies away from popular tourist routes from Russia.  Tours in Bologna (Italy) are not particularly popular with vacationers.  The fact is that this city has one of the largest exhibition centers in Europe.  That is why the Russians, if they come here, are mainly only on a business trip.

It is not worth discounting this route, because the charm of the medieval city and transport accessibility make it a pretty attractive destination.  At the same time, tourists can easily see the main attractions of Bologna (Italy) in one day. </p><h2>  Location on the map </h2><p>  G.

This is one of the most prosperous cities in the country, its culinary capital, as well as the birthplace of the oldest university in Europe. </p><p>  The historical center in Bologna in Italy (see photo below) is full of quarters, temples and palaces built during the early Middle Ages.  At the same time, all the objects of the city are quite well preserved thanks to the work on their reconstruction. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.freegreatpicture.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="top view of the city of Bologna" class="if uuid-2958199" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2958199.jpg"></div><p>  Judging by the reviews, Bologna should definitely be visited in Italy, because this is a city where the great Dante and Copernicus roamed the streets, its diligent chefs invented new types of sauce and pasta for the wedding of Lucretia Borgia, and the grateful flock listened to the sermons of the founder of the ancient Order of the Dominicans.  The history of Italy was born in Bologna.  And the city has been keeping its pages for many centuries. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  According to scientists, Bologna was founded by the Etruscans.  It happened in about 510 BC.  e.  In those days, the city had a different name - Felsina.  Moreover, all of its buildings surrounded the ancient sanctuary.  In the 4th century  BC  e.  this area was captured by the Celts.  They renamed the city.  Thus, Felsina became Bonnonia. </p><p>  In the second century, this settlement fell under the power of the Roman Empire, the heyday of which allowed the city to become one of the largest and richest in the state.  Beautiful monuments and buildings appeared in Bologna, which, unfortunately, have not survived to date. </p><p>  After the collapse of the Roman Empire, the city came under the rule of the Greek Exarchate of Ravenna, and after it was ruled by the Lombard king Luitprand.  The right of a free city was bestowed by Bologna by Charles the Great. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the 12th century  these territories became part of the Lombard League.  In 1512, Bologna was again in Roman possessions.  Since the 17th century.  the city began to be regarded as the intellectual center of Europe.  Famous scientists gathered in it, and graduates of the open one back in the 11th century.  University pleased the world with its discoveries. </p><p>  In 1860, the city of Bologna was annexed to the Italian kingdom. </p><h2>  When is the best time to go? </h2><p>  Italians themselves believe that the climate in Bologna is rainy.  However, judging by the reviews of Russian tourists, exhausted in their homeland by temperature extremes and tired of the seemingly eternal winter, the weather in this city is quite normal.  In the coldest months, the thermometer seldom drops below zero.  However, there is no snow at all, and 35 kilometers of covered city galleries save from rain. </p><p>  Nevertheless, experienced tourists advise those who decide to go to Bologna in the winter, still stock up on a down jacket.  The fact is that the weather at this time in the city can be described as dank due to high humidity.  But already at the end of February it becomes so warm that you can wear a raincoat and shoes. </p><p>  In April and May, the air in Bologna warms up to 25 degrees.  June and July are even hotter.  Definitely experienced travelers are not advised to visit this place in August.  This month, the city is literally hot.  There are no rivers or seas in Bologna (Italy).  The vegetation in the city center is rather sparse.  That is why staying in the heat becomes simply unbearable. </p><h2>  Gastronomic capital </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews of tourists, it is worth going to Bologna (Italy) in order to get acquainted with the local cuisine, because the city is considered the country's gastronomic center.  The basis of dishes served at food establishments is homemade pasta, which is made with meat sauce or with a variety of fillings.

The city has 35 kilometers of covered galleries, allowing you to stroll in rainy weather without an umbrella.  After walking along the longest of them you can get to the temple towering on a hill. </p><p>  Bologna began to build their own covered galleries (arcades) in the 13th century.  A similar idea came to them due to the fact that the streets of the city were too narrow and limited the size of the houses.  It was then that a compromise was found.  The sidewalk remained pedestrian.  However, a house was erected above it, resting on a portico with columns.  Thus formed the arcade.  Residents of the city really liked the invented element, and similar construction continued afterwards.  So there were these 35 km of covered galleries. </p><div class="photo" data-original="holeinthedonut.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="indoor galleries in Bologna" class="if uuid-2958217" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2958217.jpg"></div><p>  Let's take a closer look at the photos and descriptions of the sights of Bologna (Italy), which deserve special attention of the city guests. </p><h2>  University </h2><p>  As mentioned above, during the Middle Ages, Bologna was able to obtain the status of the intellectual center of Europe.

In addition, preliminary engineering calculations were made by experts incorrectly.  As a result, the towers began to lean towards each other during construction.
