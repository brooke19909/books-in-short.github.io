    <p>  When tourists get tired of idle rest, the time begins to get acquainted with the cultural traditions and history of the country.  Sharjah is located quite close to the Royal Beach Resort, and therefore it would be a terrible mistake not to go and see the old and unique Arab city, especially since it has something to pay attention to: </p><ul><li>  The Blue Bazaar is a spacious market built according to all Islamic canons and having more than six hundred shops selling goods for every taste: clothes, jewelry, modern electronics, but the carpets sold here are the most popular and famous. </li><li>  A gold market with a huge selection of precious metal products, many of which are exclusive, and sellers are willing to bargain for their goods. </li><li>  Al-Nur Mosque, built in 2005, is one of the prominent examples of Islamic architecture.  She accepts tourists with oriental hospitality as part of sightseeing tours, but there are certain requirements for the appearance, and photo and video shooting is prohibited. </li><li>  The Ferris Wheel "Eye of the Emirates" soars 60 meters above the ground and allows you to enjoy magnificent panoramic views.  The cabins are glass and equipped with air conditioning, capacity - more than 300 people. </li><li>  Aquarium - a huge underwater world, which offers visitors to observe the various marine life (there are more than 250 of them).  There is also a cafeteria and museum on site. </li><li>  Museums (maritime, Islamic culture, historical and cultural heritage, visual arts). </li><li>  Musical fountains and much more. </li></ul><h2>  Royal Beach Resort &amp; Spa 5 *: reviews </h2><p>  Experienced tourists and beginners in matters of foreign holidays about the hotel respond ambiguously.  There is a lot of criticism about the central air conditioning in the rooms, which, according to tourists, is simply blowing you out of bed.  It cools and heats the room slowly and often brings odors into it.  Former guests note that the owners of the hotel are cunning when they talk about the magnificent view of the sea, at best - a small piece of the bay, at worst - the courtyard.  Among the positive aspects noted well-trained polite staff who are always ready to help and speaks Russian, new furniture. </p><h2>  About the beach and the sea </h2>

    <p>  On one of the popular tourist sites, the hotel has a rating of 7.4 - very small for the 5 * category.  Royal Beach Resort &amp; Spa is much like the resorts of the former Soviet Union.  The similarity, as many believe, is observed in the pretentiousness of the interior and its flashy ‚Äúwealth‚Äù, as well as in the organization of the work of a private beach.  As tourists who have already rested, note that it is far from closed, and therefore by noon there are quite a lot of people from neighboring hotels, there is no equipped dressing room and toilet, a shower, in addition, the declared beach cafe is implemented as a small booth with drinks and light snacks. </p><p>  Of the unconditional advantages - a calm, clean sea and beach. </p><h2>  Food Reviews </h2><p>  These reviews of tourists who have already visited <span>the Royal Beach Resort</span> &amp; Spa 5 * <span>hotel</span> (UAE) deserve special attention.  The breakfast food is quite monotonous and, according to many, for 7 days has not undergone any changes in essence, moreover, the prices in the restaurants are not very affordable, and the quality is average.  Experienced travelers recommend taking a closer look at neighboring establishments. </p><p>  Not everyone was satisfied with the exceptional emphasis on Russian, Ukrainian, Armenian cuisine, because in every country I would like to try something purely national and unique, including fruits that were sorely missed, and the famous Arabian sweets.  There is no alcohol in the hotel, plus or minus, decide for yourself, but it is useless to look for it.  According to many guests, tea and coffee are of poor quality, and the juices offered at the hotel are from packages, not freshly squeezed, which does not quite correspond to the 5 * level.  Royal Beach Resort &amp; Spa in terms of gastronomy unpleasantly upset many, and on average its cuisine and restaurants were rated three.  Summing up, we can say that the hotel is good, but does not reach the declared level. </p>
