This Orthodox monastery was founded by <span>Patriarch Nikon</span> himself in the image of the Iveron monastery on Mount Athos.  For many years, it has been a center of spiritual attraction and typography.  On the territory of the monastery were workshops of various artisans.  The district town of the Novgorod province of Valdai was famous for their talents. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="valdai attractions" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/279334.jpg" width="499"></div>  But Iversky Monastery is located on an island in the center of the lake, at some distance from the city.

The directors loved this city for its beautiful views. </p>
