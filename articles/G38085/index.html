    <h2>  A bit about the village </h2><p>  In the Krasnogorsk district of the Moscow region, at a distance of about 32 km from the center of Moscow and 16 km from the Moscow Ring Road, the country's largest village is Nakhabino.  Its population exceeds 40 thousand people, constantly increasing.  This is due not only to natural population growth, but also to active construction underway in the village.  Already several <span>residential complexes</span> complemented the architecture of the village and increased its population.  Among them is LCD Ecopark Nakhabino. </p>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  As mentioned above, just over 15 km separate the new residential complex from the Moscow Ring Road, and, accordingly, from the capital of the state.  Volokolamsk and Novorizhskoye highways are considered the most prestigious destinations in the Moscow region.  Ecopark Nakhabino is located near the famous Moscow Country Club golf courses and occupies approximately 10 hectares of land. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The territory on which the complex is being built is very picturesque.  The noise and bustle of the capital are not heard here.  Not far from the new buildings are local attractions - the New Jerusalem Monastery and the Arkhangelskoye Museum-Estate, enveloping in their beauty and enchanting atmosphere. </p>

    <h2>  Description and specifications </h2><p>  Ecopark Nakhabino, Best Newbuilding is due to pass in the 4th quarter of 2017.  By that time, all 33 3- and 5-story gallery-type houses should be built on the indicated territory. </p><p>  Also, all apartments are equipped with an individual entrance.  Residents of the first floors can enter the apartments directly from the street, and the second and third floors through a glazed gallery.  In addition, each apartment on the ground floor has its own small front garden, the territory of which is quite enough for planting, for example, flowers or installing sun loungers. </p><p>  The buildings form 7 quarters, inside of which landscaped courtyards are located.  The well-known principle of ‚Äúa yard without cars‚Äù is also used here, that is, houses are built in such a way that cars cannot enter a yard.  The construction of residential buildings is carried out from reinforced concrete structures according to the frame-wall scheme.  All used building materials are environmentally friendly. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  What else will please Ecopark Nakhabino residential complex?  Its residential buildings are in perfect harmony with the surrounding natural landscape.  The developer, as an example, took the houses of the Mediterranean type, its architectural style and natural colors.  All together in combination gives a unique cosiness. </p><h2>  Housing Fund </h2><p>  Apartments (Nakhabino) Ecopark will provide various: studios, one-room, 2- and 3-room.  The developer so rationally designed the gallery houses that he included two-level multi-room apartments in them.  Not every <span>residential complex</span> can boast such a luxury, so this offer is very limited in the real estate market. </p>

    <p>  Two-level apartments are good in that you can implement the most useful zoning of the room, to fulfill the desired internal layouts with maximum benefit and comfort.  Air circulation is good in them, which provides the best microclimate in the room.  In addition, in such apartments it is most convenient to arrange sleeping rooms, isolating them from the gallery on the second floor. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The cost of square meters </h2><p>  Studios in Ecopark Nakhabino, the meter of which starts at 35 <span>m¬≤</span> , are almost the most expensive in the complex.  Their cost is more than 66 thousand rubles per 1 m¬≤ of housing.  One-room apartments, the size of which starts from 44 m¬≤, are slightly cheaper - at 64-65 thousand rubles per 1 m¬≤.  Traditionally, the cheapest are three-room apartments - 57-60 thousand rubles per 1 m¬≤. </p><h2>  Developer </h2><p>  The developer of Ecopark Nakhabino is Granel Group of Companies.  The company was founded in 1992.  She specializes in the construction of residential and commercial real estate in some regions of the country.  The most striking and large-scale projects are being implemented in Moscow and the Moscow region.  The project portfolio is more than 4.5 million m¬≤, providing for both low-rise and multi-story residential complexes.  In addition to residential buildings, the fully developed infrastructure necessary for the comfortable life of future residents is mandatory included in the projects of complexes. </p><p>  The specialists of the Granel company clearly control all stages of the developer: from design to implementation of the facility.  Thanks to this, all construction projects are of the highest quality and are available to customers at affordable prices. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  What about opinions about Ecopark Nakhabino?  Customer reviews are different, but negative prevail.  This is mainly due to a violation of the deadlines.  The facility was originally supposed to be completed in 2015, but the deadline was postponed to the last quarter of 2017.  Accordingly, this did not add optimism to both potential investors and those already invested in construction. </p><p>  Positive reviews relate to the relatively affordable cost of apartments and studios, as well as a successful and thoughtful layout.  People like two-level housing projects and gallery-type houses.  Buyers also pay attention to the quality of building materials.  The great advantage is that they are completely safe and environmentally friendly. </p><h2>  Complex infrastructure </h2><p>  Ecopark Nakhabino, reviews of which, as mentioned above, are negative and positive, remains a very attractive development project.  Given the many residential buildings, a kindergarten for 95 children was included in the project.  In addition, it is planned to build a store and covered parking. </p><p>  Yard areas are subject to refinement and improvement.  They will be equipped with children's and sports grounds, walking alleys.  By the way, the Nakhabinka River flows nearby. </p><p>  The infrastructure of the village provides almost all the necessary social facilities for a comfortable life.  There is even a golf club, a fitness center, horse riding clubs, a ski resort. </p>

    <h2>  Ecological situation </h2><p>  The environmental situation in the village of Nakhabino is quite prosperous.  Nearby there are no huge industrial enterprises that poison the environment.  Around a lot of forest green massif, ponds.  The residential complex is located a bit far from the <span>Volokolamsk highway,</span> which means that neither the noise of passing vehicles, nor the exhaust fumes can spoil a pleasant stay here. </p><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages of the complex </h2><p>  The most indisputable advantage of the complex is the original layout of its apartments - their construction in the form of two levels.  This allows you to realize not only the most daring ideas about the layout, but also competently zoning the living space.  Also an advantage should be recognized the construction of gallery-type houses and the fact that the apartments have individual entrances.  And the inhabitants of the first floors were even luckier.  They even have small areas that are quite suitable for placing rest areas or a flower garden on them. </p>

    <p>  The disadvantage is the very long construction period.  This process has been going on for almost 2 years.  Of course, this does not add optimism to buyers, and the prospects of the complex become doubtful.  But at present, construction is underway at an active pace, and buyers again have hope that it will be completed at the promised time, that is, at the end of this year.  Judging by the photo, the construction is really proceeding at an accelerated pace. </p><p>  Among the shortcomings, the delivery of apartments without decoration is also noted.  But there is a positive side to this: you will be free in your desires and do not have to remove the finish of the developer. </p><p>  To summarize.  This residential complex is a good place to live.  Here, all conditions are created for a comfortable and carefree life away from the noisy city.  You just have to be patient a bit. </p>
