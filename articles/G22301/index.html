    <p>  The food is also quite satisfactory.  Of course, for people who spend weeks at the hotel, the menu seems a little monotonous over time, but no one will be hungry.  Particularly interesting for tourists are colorful desert tents. </p><p>  The undoubted advantage is the proximity to the beach.  It is calm and not crowded, coral reefs are incredibly beautiful - many divers come here, wanting to enjoy the bright colors of the underwater world. </p><p>  The only disadvantages are remoteness from the city, since there are only other hotels and the desert around.  On the other hand, you can have a good time in the desert, riding ATVs, spending the night in tents, etc. According to reviews, the Laguna Beach Resort Marsa Alam 4 * hotel is a place that is intended for lovers of a relaxing beach holiday. </p>
