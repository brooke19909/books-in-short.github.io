In our article we want to talk about one of the Djerba hotels - Palace Royal Garden 5 *. </p><h2>  A bit about the hotel ... </h2><p>  The island of Djerba is washed by the waters of the <span>Bay of Gabes.</span>  Locals grow dates, olives, figs, and drinking water is taken from artesian wells.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  What is the nutritional situation at Royal Garden Palace 5 * (Djerba)?  Reviews of tourists regarding food are only positive.  Each vacationer can choose a dish to their liking, the choice of food is simply amazing.  Men are not allowed to wear shorts for dinner, so you should take appropriate clothing with you on vacation. </p><p>  The hotel has great food and quality drinks.  Fresh juice is always present on the tables (at least 4 types).  Breakfast includes: delicious fresh croissants, milk porridges, cereals, dried fruits, yogurts, mashed potatoes, sliced.  For lunch and dinner on the tables there is always a delicious fish (fillet), cooked in various ways. </p><p>  The work of the restaurant is always watched by the administrator, from whose eyes flaws do not escape.  On the day of arrival, each tourist is assigned to a certain table.  During dinner, meals are served in two shifts, so you must immediately decide when you want to come to the restaurant - at 18.00 or 20.00. </p><p>  The hotel also has √† la carte restaurants.  All Inclusive allows you to go to each of them once, but only by appointment at the reception of the main institution.  Italian and Tunisian restaurants are small spaces where you can enjoy a great dinner in a relaxed atmosphere.  There is no usual noise and fuss, as in the main institution. </p><p>  The restaurant has a microwave, which can be useful for tourists with small children.  There is no separate menu for kids, but among the dishes you can always choose the right food for the kids.  For example, on the tables there is always: fish, fillet, rice, chicken, mashed potatoes.  Sometimes even semolina is served for breakfast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="royal garden palace 5 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1528286.jpg"></div>

    <p>  I would like to pay special attention to drinks.  The All Inclusive program allows you to take them in any quantity.  From nine in the morning, all alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks are provided completely free of charge.  The hotel serves delicious coffee and tea with an unusual taste for us.  Cappuccino and coffee can be taken not only in the main restaurant, but also in the pool bar. </p><h2>  Room Reviews </h2><p>  The hotel boasts beautiful rooms in a modern style.  They have a TV with Russian channels, a bed with bedside tables, a table, an armchair, a wardrobe with hangers.  The apartments are spacious and bright.  In the mini-fridge there are four bottles of water (with gas and without), a sprite and a fantasy.  All this is included in the price.  The contents of the refrigerator are replenished daily. </p><p>  In the rooms of tourists awaiting excellent new bathrobes and two towels per person.  The bathroom has a hairdryer, soap in the dispenser and shower caps. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="royal garden palace 5 djerba" class="if" height="306" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1528287.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Not all apartments have sea views.  In order to guarantee an apartment with a sea view, you must purchase the appropriate ticket.  The rooms have a free safe with simple and convenient instructions. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  In the Royal Garden Palace 5 *, the reviews of which are given in the article, you can exchange money if you have a passport directly at the reception, but you can‚Äôt transfer dinars into dollars.  But this is not a problem, a similar operation can be performed in the airport exchangers with a receipt.  Also at the reception you can withdraw money from an ATM. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="royal garden palace 5 djerba reviews" class="if" height="306" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1528276.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel has a very beautiful, well-groomed and at the same time very extensive territory, which you can always walk around.  There are also tennis courts.  The pools of the complex are open from early morning until 19.00.  They are simply huge in size.  The main body of water is equipped with three gentle entrances from different sides.  Around the pool there are sun loungers with umbrellas and a bar where you can take any drinks, as well as a snack.  The hotel also has indoor pools, the temperature of which is +25 degrees.  They are in great demand in rainy weather. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="royal garden palace 5 tunisia reviews" class="if" height="343" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15160/222644.jpg" width="516"></div>

    <p>  Beach towels can be obtained for free near the reception, they can be changed at any time and in any quantity.  Sun loungers by the pools and on the beach are free. </p><p>  The hotel has three shops where you can buy: mattresses, souvenirs, swimwear, creams.  There is everything that tourists may need, and the prices of goods are quite acceptable, and sometimes even lower than in neighboring markets. </p><p>  Experienced tourists are advised to shop at the nearest Aljazira store.  In it you can buy dates, spices, alcohol, olive oil, sweets, figs, souvenirs and gifts.  All products here are much cheaper than in the markets. </p><p>  The hotel has an animation team.  In the afternoon, they conduct water aerobics sessions, learn to play darts and petanque.  In the evenings, entertainment shows and a children's disco await guests.  A detailed entertainment schedule can be seen at the reception. </p><p>  Children's animation is not very interesting, because the kids are provided with foreign cartoons without translation, and there is absolutely no modern Russian music in the disco.  According to vacationers, excellent entertainment events are held in season (from May to August). </p><p>  Tourists are very pleased with the service and attitude of the staff.  All the hotel staff are incredibly positive and sociable people who are always happy to help you. </p><p>  The sea in the season is very warm and beautiful, but in the autumn period the weather can bring surprises in the form of algae driven by the winds.  But the water always remains warm.  The hotel's beach is just a 7-minute walk from the complex in the park.  He is incredibly beautiful and clean.  Kids can be carried in wheelchairs.  There are many umbrellas on the coast, each of them is equipped with an urn. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Based on the wonderful positive reviews of tourists, you can safely recommend Royal Garden Palace 5 * <span>(Tunisia, Djerba), the</span> reviews of which are given in the article, for a comfortable family holiday on the coast.  A five-star hotel with excellent service and stunning interiors can become the best place to spend a vacation. <strong></strong></p>
