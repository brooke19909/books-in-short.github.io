And this is a country with a great history, culture, attractions.  It is about the sights of the country of Italy that will be discussed in this article. </p><h2>  Coliseum </h2><p>  One of the main attractions not only in Italy, but throughout the world.  A great and powerful architectural creation located in Rome. </p><p>  The construction of one of the majestic structures of the world lasted about 8 years and was completed in the 80th year.  e.  After the opening of the main metropolitan amphitheater, performances in it did not stop for as long as 100 days: gladiator fights, battles with wild animals, public executions. </p><p>  The Coliseum impressed with its grandeur, the perfection of technical facilities.  Each <span>inhabitant of the Roman</span> Empire considered it his duty to visit Rome and get to the Colosseum, to see performances. </p><p>  With the advent of Christianity, executions and gladiatorial battles were abolished.  The construction began to decline, and in the 14th century one of the walls was destroyed during an earthquake.  After that, the popes paid attention to the construction and installed a huge cross in the center of the arena, and in 1750 the Colosseum even received the status of a temple.  However, in 1803, a major earthquake again occurred and the Coliseum building was mothballed. </p><p>  Nowadays, only about 30% of the once magnificent structure remains.  Thousands of tourists coming to Italy are trying to visit the Colosseum.  At present, it is a museum, an unrecognized "Wonder of the World". </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.visionpubl.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Colosseum in Rome" class="if uuid-2290448" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61221/2290448.jpg"></div><h2>  Roman forum </h2><p>  The construction of the first Forum began during the reign of Tarquin.  Initially, part of the territory was intended for trading shops, and the second for holding public meetings, elections, holidays. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the 6th century BC, the construction of temples, monuments, and monuments began on the territory of the forum.  The construction of new roads has begun. </p><p>  At the beginning of our era, the Forum became so huge that it became not only the religious and political center of not only the city of Rome, but the whole Roman Empire. </p><p>  In the middle of the first millennium, the Forum lost its former significance, mainly due to attacks from outside.  With the advent of Christianity in the Roman Empire, most of the churches were given over to the church.  Life in the Forum again began to sparkle with new colors.  But in the 8th century its significance was lost, now forever. </p><p>  In the 19th century, on the site of the ancient Forum, excavations were made and some structures were discovered, after which the excavations began to be systematic. </p><p>  The Roman Forum is another attraction in Italy that can be viewed today.  It is located very close to the Coliseum. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nationalgeographic.com.es" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Roman forum" class="if uuid-2288248" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61221/2288248.jpg"></div><h2>  Leaning Tower of Pisa </h2><p>  Another famous landmark of Italy.  The construction is a <span>‚Äúfalling‚Äù tower</span> and is located in the city of Pisa.  It was the slope that brought the tower worldwide popularity. </p><p>  The tower - the bell tower is included in the architectural ensemble "Field of Miracles".  In addition to the tower - the bell tower, it also includes the Cathedral of St. Mary, the cemetery of Santa Campo and the Baptistery. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The construction of the bell tower began in the 12th century, in 1172 several pieces of marble were laid in the foundation.  Over two centuries, work on the tower lasted and were completed only in 1360. </p><p>  The leaning of the Leaning Tower of Pisa is also not accidental.  The fact is that due to an error in the calculations and a small foundation back in 1178, after the construction of the third floor, the tower began to tilt.  The slope was 1 mm annually.  And no matter how hard the architects tried to stop the ‚Äúfall,‚Äù all efforts were in vain.  And only restoration work in the 20th century reduced the level of slope and stopped its growth. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cp24.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Leaning Tower of Pisa" class="if uuid-2288250" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61221/2288250.jpg"></div><h2>  Duomo Milan or Milan Cathedral </h2><p>  The name of the sights of Italy indicates its location.  It is in Milan that the famous Gothic Milan Cathedral is located.  The construction of the white marble cathedral began in 1386, but the facade design was approved by Napoleon in 1802. </p><p>  The height of the building is 157 meters, and its total area is 11,700 square meters.  The cathedral building is so graceful and magnificent that it cannot be described in words: numerous spiers, turrets, carved figures, a statue of St. Mary is installed on the highest spire. </p><p>  The Duomo Cathedral is one of the main attractions of Milan and Italy as a whole. </p><p>  Interesting facts about the Cathedral: </p><ul><li>  there is a nail in front of the altar, legend goes that this nail was taken from the crucifixion of Christ; </li><li>  the cathedral has a huge calendar, which is a metal strip with the zodiac signs on it.  The sun's rays falling on the strip indicate the constellation that acts during this period of time; </li><li>  there are about 3400 statues in the cathedral; </li><li>  the roof of the Duomo is open to the public, with a beautiful view of Milan. </li></ul><p>  A detailed description of the sights of Italy can be found in the article, but it is better to see this splendor with your own eyes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flawlessmilano.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gothic Milan Cathedral" class="if uuid-2288251" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61221/2288251.jpg"></div><h2>  Park "Italy in miniature" </h2><p>  One of the main attractions of Rimini - "Italy in Miniature" - was created relatively recently, in 1970, on the initiative of businessman I. Rimbaldi.  The park features about three hundred architectural structures of Italy, made on a scale of 1:50 or 1:20.  The park itself looks like the Apennine Peninsula, and the attractions there coincide with their real location on the map of Italy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mimaclubhotel.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Park Italy in Miniature" class="if uuid-2288253" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61221/2288253.jpg"></div><p>  A visit to the park will be interesting for both adults and children. </p><p>  In Rimini there are other famous sights of Italy: Arch of Augustus, Tempio Malatestiano, Tiberius Bridge, Castel Sismondo and many, many others. </p><h2>  Arena di Verona </h2><p>  A huge open theater was erected in the 1st century AD, which was originally located outside the walls of Verona and only 256 became part of it.  For ten centuries, the grandiose structure remained in its original state.  Later, after several earthquakes and looting, it began to decline.  In the 15th century, the building was restored and theatrical performances began again on its stage. </p><p>  Arena di Verona in Italy is a tourist attraction that is interesting not only for its architecture and duration of existence, but also for the fact that the amphitheater still functions.  On the stage of the historical monument you can see performances of opera and ballet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.geticket.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Arena di Verona" class="if uuid-2288255" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61221/2288255.jpg"></div><h2>  Piazza Vecchia and other sights of Bergamo </h2><p>  Located just 50 km from Milan, the city of Bergamo is little known among tourists.  Although interesting architectural structures are available in this city of Italy.  The sights of Bergamo are varied, but some of them are worth seeing without fail, for example, the magnificent Piazza Vecchia, the church of Santa Maria Maggiore and the Chapelle Colleone, the Cathedral of St. Alexander of Bergamo, the ramparts of Bergamo, the church of Santa Maria Immacolata delle Grazie. </p><p>  Beautiful architectural structures, not inferior in beauty to other sights of Italy, in Bergamo will not leave indifferent any tourist. </p><div class="photo" data-original="emilialiveslife.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Piazza Vecchia" class="if uuid-2290449" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61221/2290449.jpg"></div><h2>  La scala </h2><p>  La Scala - the name of the sights of Italy, known throughout the world.  La Scala is an opera house founded in 1778 in the very center of Milan.  The theater got its name from the church of Santa Maria della Scala, which was previously in its place.  During the Second World War, the building was destroyed, but it was later restored and opera performances take place on its stage to this day. </p><p>  The theater building has excellent acoustics and seats more than two thousand spectators.  The opera season begins in December and lasts until June.  The rest of the time there are symphony orchestras and a museum functioning, which exhibits exhibits with portraits of opera divas, outstanding events from the life of the theater, and busts of composers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.incomingpartners.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="La Scala Italy" class="if uuid-2290450" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61221/2290450.jpg"></div><h2>  The Sistine Chapel </h2><p>  One of the main attractions of Italy, the pride of the Vatican is, of course, the Sistine Chapel, known throughout the world.  Externally, the building seems quite simple and almost unremarkable, but the splendor that is inside does not lend itself to any verbal descriptions. </p><p>  The Sistine Chapel was built in the 15th century by the architect Baccio Pontelli, but the construction took place under the leadership of George de Dolce.  Inside, the chapel is completely painted by the works of outstanding painters, but the loudest name on this list is the name of Michelangelo Buonarroti.  The ceiling of the building of more than 1000 square meters is painted by him. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.constructionweekonline.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The Sistine Chapel" class="if uuid-2290451" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61221/2290451.jpg"></div><h2>  Trevi Fountain </h2><p>  The Trevi Fountain is one of the majestic sights of Rome, crowds of tourists and locals gather near it to see with your own eyes all the majesty and beauty of the building. </p><p>  The construction of the fountain lasted almost thirty years, and in 1762 it was opened.  However, the whole story precedes its appearance.  In the 1920s  e.  during the reign of Octavian Augustus in Rome, the need for reorganization, reform.  One of the proposals to improve the living conditions of the residents was to provide access to clean drinking water.  An Aqua Virgo aqueduct was built: water covered a distance of 12 km to quench the thirst of the Roman inhabitants.  That was until the decision to build the fountain. </p><div class="photo" data-original="millionmilesecrets.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Trevi Fountain" class="if uuid-2290452" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61221/2290452.jpg"></div><p>  In 2014, the fountain was reconstructed, since the previous restoration was carried out more than a hundred years ago, some sculptures began to crumble. </p><p>  Now the fountain is operating as before, and any tourist can admire this unique creation of the architect Nicola Salvi. </p>
