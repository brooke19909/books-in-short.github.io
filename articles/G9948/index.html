And what a shame, when the long-awaited cargo on the way to you ‚Äúgets stuck‚Äù at various sorting points of the Russian Post! </p><p>  Unfortunately, many users of postal services do not understand the rules at all, because of which often unpleasant situations arise in which a person does not know how to figure it out correctly.  Let's analyze the information together. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ravinternet.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="whether the package arrived" class="if uuid-3139879" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/133947/3139879.jpg"></div><h2>  You are the sender </h2><p>  When sending a parcel in any post office (not only in Russia), a unique track code is assigned to the parcel, according to which it is further processed and registered.  With this code, the dispatch is tracked. </p><p>  This code is always indicated on the receipt of payment for the parcel.  Therefore, if you want to be sure that nothing will happen to the shipment, always save the receipt, or better take a picture of it. </p><p>  So, you sent the parcel, received the check and saw the track code.  What next?  How do I know if a package has arrived in the mail? </p><p>  There are such options: </p><ol><li>  Then you go to the official website of the Russian Post russianpost.ru, find the "Track" field and enter the track code from the check there (if the track code contains letters, enter them too, be sure to enter no spaces).  Here you can track the package.  As soon as you see the status ‚ÄúArrived at the place of delivery‚Äù, you can inform the addressee that his parcel has arrived at the post office. </li><li>  Also, the addressee learns that the parcel has arrived and is awaiting it, with the help of a notice that the postman must put in his mailbox the day after the parcel arrives.  Or, if you tracked the shipment and informed the addressee of your arrival before the postman brought the notice, you would need to provide the department‚Äôs tracking code for the package and let him know if he wanted to know if the package had arrived. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.lsa-conso.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out if the package arrived in the mail" class="if uuid-3139861" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/133947/3139861.jpg"></div><h2>  Solving problems if you are a sender </h2><p>  If you suddenly notice that the parcel has started to ‚Äúwalk‚Äù around the sorting points and does not want to go to its destination in any way, it is advisable for you to go to any branch of the Russian Post with a check and ask for a form to fill out a search application.  After filling in, you give it to the employee of the post office, he is obliged to take a copy from the check and certify the application with a seal and signature, then tear off the back of the application and give it to you. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  According to the regulations, the time for considering such applications is 2 months, but, as a rule, the investigation starts earlier, and the parcels are quickly enough redirected to the correct address.  Such errors with moving items to different sorting points are associated with an incomplete automation system: in some sorting points, parcels and other items are processed by machines that read the track code from the cargo shell and select the direction for it.  The next sorting point, in turn, recognizes that the package has arrived at them erroneously and redirect it back.  After drawing up the application for the search, the inspectors of the Russian Post issue an order to remove the shipment from automatic processing and redirect it manually. </p><h2>  You are the recipient </h2><p>  Foreign sites of online stores attract buyers with attractive prices and an unusual assortment.  Imagine that you are the recipient.  How to be  How do I know if a package has arrived in the mail? </p><p>  First of all, ask to send the same track code.  Russian track codes consist of 14 digits, international ones of four letters and nine digits (two latin letters at the beginning of the track code, 9 digits, two latin letters at the end, indicating the postal code of the sender's country). </p><p>  Now, just in the same way, go to the official website of the Russian Post and track your departure.  Always check with the sender in advance whether the parcel will be tracked outside its country, as there are several types of shipments: simple and custom.  Parcels come a priori with a track code that can be tracked around the world, but the small packages in which sellers from Aliexpress and similar online stores pack goods are simple and custom-made.  You won‚Äôt be able to track the simple ones on the territory of the Russian Federation, and if the shipment didn‚Äôt reach you, you won‚Äôt be able to track it down. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Problem solving if you are a recipient </h2><p>  Imagine that you are waiting for a parcel from the USA.  You see that she stopped at customs, and for a week now she has not moved anywhere.  In this case, there are two options: </p><ol><li>  Contact the sender with a request to write a search application at his post office (if the parcel is ‚Äústuck‚Äù in his country). </li><li>  Ask the sender to forward the photo of the check to the parcel in order to independently go and write a search application.  If it is not possible to get a photo of the check or there is no connection with the sender, they will definitely refuse to write a search application. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.catfordcouriers.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="to track the package" class="if uuid-3139888" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/133947/3139888.jpg"></div><h2>  How do I know if a package has arrived in the mail? </h2><p>  There are several ways to find out the location of a parcel in a post office.  Let's look at them: </p><ol><li>  Use the tracking service on the official website of the Russian Post, which was mentioned above. </li><li>  Go to your post office with a track code and ask employees to find out if the package has arrived.  They can also see the location of the shipment in the same manner as specified in paragraph 1. </li><li>  The sender may, when sending, request to issue an additional service - SMS notification.  This service costs 10 rubles, it applies only to shipments in Russia.  Indicate the recipient's phone number, and when the shipment arrives at the department, an SMS notification will be sent to the indicated number with a message about the track number and department number where the parcel arrived. </li><li>  Wait for the notice that the postman will lower in the mailbox. </li></ol><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  There is nothing complicated in sending and receiving parcels using the Russian Post, it is always important to keep a check, as it is the main evidence that you have the right to know the "fate" of your shipment.  If you know these simple rules, receiving and sending packages will be only a joy. </p>
