    <p>  The name of the Atlantic Ocean alone already reflects its enormous scale.  It is part of the oceans and contains significant reserves of water resources.  In terms of size, it takes the second (after the Quiet) place.  It contains a quarter of all the water on the planet, and this is a lot - 25%.  Its huge area is impressive, amounting to about 91 million square meters.  km  No less significant amount of water, which according to recent data amounted to 329.7 million km³.  An indicator such as the average depth of the ocean is considered equal to 3,600 meters.  The salinity of the Atlantic Ocean is approximately 35%.  Today it is known that scientists made measurements and as a result established more accurate data, according to which the average ocean depth is 4022 meters. </p><p>  It was no coincidence that the Atlantic Ocean got its name; there are several versions of its origin.  The first says that it was so named after the legendary continent of Atlantis, the second is based on the fact that it received the name from the name of the hero of ancient myths - Atlanta, who supported the entire firmament on his shoulders.  Even the geographical location of the mythical hero is known - at the very extreme point of the western part of the Mediterranean. </p><p>  Of great scientific interest are the seas of the <span>Atlantic Ocean, whose area</span> is about 14.69 million km², which is approximately 16% of the total ocean area.  The seas and bays include the following: <span>Bristol Bay, the</span> Irish, Baltic, North Sea, as well as the Gulf of Finland, Bothnia and <span>Riga.</span>  If we list the seas of the Atlantic Ocean, then this is the Mediterranean and the <span>Bay of Biscay,</span> and such seas as the Balearic, Alboran, Ligurian, Adriatic, Tyrrhenian, Ionian, Aegean, Marmara, Black, Azov and <span>Guinean.</span>  This list can be continued, since the Riser-Larsen, Lazarev, Sargassovo, Weddell, Caribbean, Maine, Mexican, St. Lawrence and Labrador bays, and the Sea of ​​Skosh also belong to this sea. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The seas of the Atlantic Ocean have an indirect connection with its main source, it is carried out through adjacent bays and seas, therefore, various climatic conditions characteristic of only these regions are observed here, as well as a difference in the diverse species of flora and fauna. </p><p>  The Mediterranean Sea lies between Asia, Europe and Africa.  <span>In the Dardanelles,</span> it is connected to the Sea of ​​Marmara in the northeast, and the Bosphorus with the Black Sea.  From the southeast, it connects via the <span>Suez Canal</span> with the unique Red Sea.  2,500 thousand km is the area of ​​the Mediterranean Sea, while its volume is 3,839 thousand km³. </p><p>  <span>The Baltic Sea</span> communicates with the ocean thanks to the North, and the Black Sea due to the waters of the neighboring Marmara and Mediterranean Seas.  The Baltic Sea is inland, its area is 385 thousand km, the average depth is 86 meters.  It received modern outlines about 2.5 thousand years ago.  The volume of water in it is 21,700 km3. </p><p>  The Black Intracontinental Sea also enters the seas of the Atlantic Ocean.  In the southwest, it connects through the Bosphorus Strait to a sea such as Marmara.  Its area is almost 413.5 thousand km, and the average depth is 1000 m (with a maximum depth of 2245 m), the volume of water in this sea is 537 thousand km.  cubic. </p><p>  Over the course of many centuries, a very important life-supporting phenomenon has been formed, such as the Gulf Stream.  It originates in the southeast of North America.  The width of the current of the Atlantic Ocean is 75 km, and its speed is 6-30 km / h.  It is characterized by a warm upper layer of water with a temperature of 26 degrees and a speed that lies in such limits - 6-30 km / h.  The warm <span>currents of the Atlantic Ocean</span> provide the European states located on its shores with a mild and favorable climate, very comfortable for living.  The heat generated by the Gulf Stream is equivalent to the amount of heat that 1 million nuclear power plants can generate. </p>
