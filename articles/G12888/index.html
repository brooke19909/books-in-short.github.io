    <p>  At present, one of the main roads on the right bank of the Neva, a six-lane transport highway, passes on the two-story embankment. </p><h2>  The history of the Sverdlovsk embankment </h2><p>  Since the beginning of the XVIII century.  on the right bank <span>of the Neva River</span> began to develop land.  Here wealthy citizens built cottages and country houses.  At that time, the territory of the embankment was called Polyustrovskaya. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In 1773-1777  on this territory a two-tier front terrace-pier was erected.  Its mainsail and side staircases had granite lining.  The majestic terrace was decorated with vases and decorated with four sculptures of sphinxes.  On both sides of the pier, guns for salutes and signals were installed. </p><p>  The pier of the current Sverdlovsk embankment was destroyed during the Great Patriotic War.  In the years 1959-1960.  it was restored.  It got its name familiar to our ear in 1938 - in honor of party worker Y. M. Sverdlov. </p><p>  In 1967, a large-scale reconstruction began.  It lasted more than twenty years.  During this time, a high granite wall was erected, on the site from Piskarevsky Avenue to Okhta, opposite the <span>Smolny Cathedral, a</span> wide descent into the water was built from granite. </p><p>  In 2007, the boundaries of the embankment were finally determined: its small part of the territory from <span>Krasnogvardeiskaya Square</span> to Okhta was transferred to the Maloohtinskaya Embankment. </p><h2>  Famous buildings </h2><p>  Almost every old house on Sverdlovskaya Embankment in St. Petersburg is unique. </p><p>  For example, here is a monument of classicism and architecture - the cottage Durnovo.  This country villa was built in 1780.  Its owner was P.P. Bakunin.  After a series of sales in 1813, its owner was a prominent official D.N. Durnovo.  He did a complete reconstruction of the site, as a result of which a park with nightingales was added to the mansion. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  We can say with confidence that Sverdlovskaya embankment (St. Petersburg) played an important role in the life of the Northern capital.  Before the October Revolution, the headquarters of the anarchists was located in the country, and later the Bolsheviks kept their weapons here. </p><p>  In Soviet times, the Durnovo cottage housed the museum and club of the Leningrad Metal Plant. </p>

    <p>  After the collapse of the USSR, this architectural monument almost died, as it fell into complete decline.  And only in 1996, a fence was dismantled at the dacha, but here, fate decreed otherwise.  During a fire in 1998, not only completely burned out the second floor of the building, but the famous pediment was destroyed. </p><p>  Until recently, the estate was completely devastated, but restoration work began in March 2014: an architectural monument on Sverdlovskaya Embankment began, as they say, to transform before our eyes. </p><p>  On the embankment, in addition to Durnovo cottage, there are several more well-known structures not only in the country, but also beyond its borders.  For example, here are located the production warehouses of the New Bavaria company, Kusheleva Dacha (a manor with the famous "lion" fence), a barracks and a building of a spinning mill. </p><h2>  Uppsala Circus and Park </h2><p>  Uppsala circus is the only attraction in the world for real hooligans.  Now, according to a new social project, it is called a park. </p><p>  In this territory, adults and children have the opportunity to communicate together, have fun, engage in joint creativity and just fool around. </p><p>  There are many green lawns with ducks and squirrels.  The best artists and musicians are ready to please visitors, the public circus school is open to guests.  For adults and children, various interesting workshops are regularly held on cooking a long table, juggling, etc. </p>

    <p>  For the convenience of visitors in Uppsala Park there are special free buses that take tourists to the park from the metro station ‚ÄúPloshchad Lenina‚Äù.  In addition, in the open air there are unusual washbasins and comfortable booths for feeding babies.  All this was carefully designed by the famous designers of the city. </p><p>  Note that it is forbidden to smoke in the park and it is categorically not recommended to drink alcohol.  Otherwise, violators face a considerable fine. </p><p>  Here you can enjoy delicious food, ice cream, lemonade, dairy products and other goodies. </p><p>  Working days: every Saturday and some Sundays from mid-May to mid-September. </p><h2>  Positive walk reviews </h2><p>  Walking along the Sverdlovsk embankment along the Neva, people involuntarily recall the history of the buildings of St. Petersburg.  As a rule, they are delighted with how much work it took to curb and conquer this mighty river, to ‚Äúshackle‚Äù its channel into strong granite stone, to build magnificent bridges. </p><p>  Residents of the northern capital note the constantly evolving infrastructure of the city.  For example, today the maternity hospital on Sverdlovskaya embankment is considered one of the best. </p>

    <p>  Many photographers and artists are delighted with this place.  Dressed in granite, the hard and harsh embankments under the morning and evening sun turn into amazing objects for photo shoots.  Here you can actually immerse yourself in the world of the past and the beautiful.  Canals, streams, streams, lace-like bridges, impressive lions and sphinxes watching the unhurried flow of the river only contribute to this. </p><p>  Amazing landscapes open from the embankment, and thanks to the steps located at some intervals, you can go down and pat your hand along the Neva. </p><h2>  What should be fixed </h2><p>  In general, tourists believe that a bit of picturesqueness should still be added to the embankment, after which it could very well have received the status of one of the most comfortable corners of Russia.  This will require very little: to plant flowers, trees and shrubs, as well as, of course, organize their watering in the hot season.  The construction of additional sports fields and bicycle paths would not hurt. </p>
