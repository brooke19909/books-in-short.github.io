Such elements in the interior, if properly selected, are able to set the mood of the room, maintain a certain style, make the room more interesting, comfortable and attractive.  One of the decor elements can be bottles.  From cognac, wine, champagne, plastic and glass, household jars, complex or simple shapes - it does not matter: for each you can find an interesting design. </p><p>  Bottle decoupage is one of the most popular types in DIY direction.  Creating simple creations, very soon you can learn to make real masterpieces that are suitable not only for decorating your own home and creating an incredible atmosphere, but also as a gift to friends and family or goods for sale.  Moreover, this is a very interesting activity and a way to spend time with benefit. </p><h2>  The art of decorating bottles or what is decoupage </h2><p>  It may seem that this hobby is something new when compared to embroidery or weaving.  But in reality this is not so.  Decoupage is one of the oldest art forms that originated in Germany in the 15th century and was originally used only to decorate furniture.  Decoupage translated from French means cutting.  Technique involves the transfer of images to objects from various materials, such as glass, wood, fabric, and so on. </p><p>  Decoupage of bottles today is the most common.  That is, along with other objects and interior elements, most often bottles are decorated.  In fact, it only seems that decoupage is complicated.  You just need to have patience, perseverance, and also have the necessary material for creativity - and everything will work out.  In return, you can get the original thing, which certainly no one else will have. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What tools and accessories may be required </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.hometalk.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bottle Decoupage Materials" class="if uuid-2331789" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61052/2331789.jpg"></div><p>  Most likely, the necessary materials are already at home.  If you need to buy something, then this will not require large financial investments.  The list of tools and accessories may vary depending on what the end result will be.  The main thing you need is, of course, a porcelain or glass bottle, the decoupage of which will be carried out.  It is also necessary to prepare: </p><ul><li>  PVA glue; </li><li>  acrylic paint; </li><li>  solvent for degreasing the surface; </li><li>  carved drawing; </li><li>  acrylic varnish or craquelure; </li><li>  various decorations (beads, sequins, lace, dried plants, feathers, etc.); </li><li>  consumables (brushes, containers, sponges, sponges and so on). </li></ul><h2>  Step-by-step instruction for beginners </h2><p>  Before you start work, you should be patient and have a good mood that will help you create.  So, we consider the decoupage of bottles with napkins for beginners.  Step-by-step instruction: </p><ol><li>  Bottle preparation.  To make it easier to work, it is advisable to take a simple-shaped container that does not have a relief.  First, remove all stickers, holding the container in warm soapy water, and then using a metal mesh to wash the dishes. </li><li>  Degreasing.  Saturate the cotton pad with solvent, and then treat the surface (work should be done with gloves). </li><li>  Padding.  The surface of the bottle is treated with acrylic paint.  To apply it, it is recommended to use a sponge.  Paint is selected in the color that is needed for the background.  But it should be a tone lighter or darker than the image so that the picture does not merge.  In order to achieve a rich color and beautiful relief, the paint is applied in several layers.  You can skip this step if the bottle is beautiful, and the picture will look interesting even without a background. </li><li>  Preparation of the picture.  The next step in the step-by-step decoupage of a bottle with napkins is cutting out the image.  You need to take the pattern that you want to apply to glass containers.  Table napkins with an image consist of two layers.  The bottom layer, i.e. clean paper, is separated from the cut out pattern.  This is done carefully so as not to tear the napkin. </li><li>  Drawing the image.  A prepared drawing is superimposed on the dried surface of the bottle.  On top (on a napkin) PVA glue is applied.  The picture must be leveled and expelled from under it.  This must be done very carefully so as not to damage the paper. </li><li>  Varnishing.  This is the last step in the step-by-step decoupage of the bottle.  Varnish is necessary to protect the image from the negative effects of the environment, so that it remains for a long time.  It is recommended to apply in several layers, allowing each of them to dry well.  It is most convenient to distribute the varnish with a thick brush in a top-down direction. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.rowland98.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Decoupage a bottle with a napkin: step by step" class="if uuid-2331798" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61052/2331798.jpg"></div><p>  To protect the picture, acrylic varnish is used, but if you want to give the bottle an aged look, you need to take a craquelure - it artificially ‚Äúcrackes‚Äù the paint. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  So simply you can decorate a bottle by applying a beautiful pattern from a napkin to it.  You can also decorate it with other elements, depending on what is shown in the picture.  In general, dream up and diversify the decor on the bottle for a more interesting result. </p><h2>  Do-it-yourself decoupage of bottles with napkins: transferring the picture to the surface </h2><p>  There is another way, which may seem simpler, or like more than the option described above.  Using a napkin and simple manipulations, it will be possible to transfer the drawing from paper to a bottle.  Make it easier than it might seem.  A piece of napkin with a pattern is glued to the paper, after which it must be covered with several layers of varnish.  When the latter is completely dry, put in water.  Wait until the paper softens well, and then rub it with your hands to remove.  All that remains is a pattern on a varnished surface that can be glued onto a transparent jar or bottle. </p><h2>  Egg shell decoration method </h2><div class="photo" data-original="livediyideas.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Decoupage eggshell bottles" class="if uuid-2331854" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61052/2331854.jpg"></div><p>  This decoupage of bottles is very unusual.  The method can be applied even by beginners, since there will also be no difficulties in decorating with this material.  Need a dry egg shell, chopped into several pieces of irregular shape, about 2-5 cm in size. Its surface is lubricated with PVA glue, then applied to a glass bottle and pressed so that the shell breaks.  You need to hold it a little to fix it on the container.  Other pieces stick in the same way.  You can give the shell a certain shape, or place it randomly.  As a result, it looks like an old clay pot.  The bottle can then be painted and varnished.  Together with eggshell, other objects are used as decorative elements: ribbons, threads, beads, stones, sparkles, various small details that will complement the image and continue the idea. </p><h2>  Decoupage with various materials at hand: grains, cereals, beads </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Decoupage of coffee bean bottles" class="if uuid-2331828" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61052/2331828.jpg"></div><p>  Glass containers can be decorated with anything.  And this option for decoupage bottles for beginners will fit no worse than the previous ones.  You can take beads and beads, buttons, wheat, rice, buckwheat, millet, oats, as well as watermelon, pumpkin and melon seeds.  Even sand, which is usually used in nail design, will do - it will beautifully shimmer and sparkle. </p><p>  In this matter, it is very important to choose a quality glue.  A sticky base is applied to the surface of the bottle or its part, which depends on the idea.  Then beads, cereals or other product are sprinkled on top.  After drying, it remains only to remove the excess, paint and varnish.  The decoration with coffee beans looks interesting, as shown in the photo. </p><h2>  Paint decoration </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.thespruce.com" data-author=": Rita Shehan, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Drawing patterns on bottles" class="if uuid-2331832" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61052/2331832.jpg"></div><p>  Paint may be required in any of the listed options, no matter which base is used.  Sometimes you want to finish the image, or make a contour, to correct something.  But, if you can beautifully draw or write, why not take advantage of such skills?  Painted in decoupage style, a bottle can be an unusual gift. </p><p>  Glass containers are painted inside and out.  The first option requires a clear bottle.  You can take a color of one or more colors.  Paint is injected into the bottle with a syringe without a needle.  In order to achieve uniform staining, the container must be rotated.  After that, you can decorate the neck of the bottle with tape, apply sparkles or decorate in some other way. </p><h2>  Decoupage using leather and shells </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Decoupage bottles with shells" class="if uuid-2331836" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61052/2331836.jpg"></div><p>  If there is a small glass bottle, for example, into which cognac is often bottled, you can cover it with skin.  It will turn out something similar to a flask.  A perfect gift for a man.  But for girls, decorating a bottle with shells will be the most attractive idea.  In this way, you can recall any pleasant events associated with the sea.  The best option is to attach the shells to a bottle pre-wound with a thick thread. </p><h2>  Decoration of bottles with ribbons, threads and ropes </h2><p>  Another simple way to decorate.  After watching the master class of decoupage of a bottle of champagne, it will be easy to repeat these simple manipulations.  The material is attached to the glass on a transparent adhesive.  Tapes can wrap the bottle all the way to the neck, or only half.  Also, several shades are often used.  On top of the ribbon you can attach a decor appropriate to the occasion.  For example, for the New Year - miniature bells with shiny balls, bows and fir branches, for the wedding - delicate flowers, and so on. </p><p>  Various threads or even ropes are also used, but not very thick.  Depending on the chosen thread, it is possible to style the bottle.  For example, if you take the braid and completely wrap it with a glass surface, you get decor in an oriental style. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="-rnQBLZ4Tus" data-url="https://youtu.be/-rnQBLZ4Tus" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/5/2/9/1529.jpg"></div><h2>  Decoration using ready-made pictures </h2><p>  The process of decoupage on a bottle for beginners was described in detail step by step using a table napkin.  But you can attach a picture printed on cardboard or on plain paper.  For example, I liked the picture on the box left over from sweets or cookies.  You need to cut it and make a beautiful motif on the bottle.  The process of preparation of containers does not differ from that described above: cleaning of stickers, degreasing, priming, applying paint.  But the image will have to tinker.  If it is printed on cardboard, you need to remove the excess layer of paper.  When it is carefully torn off, clean off the leftovers.  This is most conveniently done with a fingertip dipped in water - just roll up into tiny rolls.  Then put the image on the front side of the paper, moisten it with plenty of water and continue to remove excess paper until it is completely removed.  You must do this very carefully so as not to tear the picture.  Then you need to wait until the picture has completely dried, and only then remove it from the paper.  The following steps do not differ from decorating with a napkin. </p><h2>  New Year bottles decoupage workshop </h2><p>  Decoration of glass containers for the most magical holiday of the year - this is where you can give free rein to imagination.  Even simple patterns applied to the bottle with acrylic paints (snowflakes, garlands, spruce branches and so on) will look very interesting and attractive.  At the end, you can decorate the container with ribbons and other decorative elements.  DIY ideas for decoupage bottles for the New Year can be seen in the master class. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="fCtV3Iad_iM" data-url="https://youtu.be/fCtV3Iad_iM" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/5/3/0/1530.jpg"></div><h2>  Decoupage Wedding Bottles </h2><p>  One of the most important events in life should be approached with great responsibility, thinking through everything to the smallest detail.  To make the festive table decorated not with green "monsters", but with unique creations, it is recommended to decorate champagne bottles on your own.  Ribbons, beads, rhinestones and fabric flowers are best suited for this. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.weddingguideus.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wedding decoupage of bottles" class="if uuid-2331849" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61052/2331849.jpg"></div><p>  Decoupage of wedding bottles is also not very complicated, as can be seen in the photo.  But, in any case, before embarking on decorating, it is better to be patient and stock up with interesting ideas, some of which have already been discussed in the article. </p>
