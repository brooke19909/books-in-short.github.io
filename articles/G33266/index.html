    <p>  Guests note neat rooms with modern, functional furniture.  The technique, they said, is on par.  The location of the hotel, according to the reviewers, is very convenient - not far from the center (within walking distance), but in a quiet corner of Vladivostok.  The staff pleases guests with their courtesy and attentiveness.  Breakfast (buffet), guests consider it delicious and varied.  The on-site restaurant also serves lunch and dinner quite tasty. </p><p>  Some residents were a little annoyed by the noisy and numerous guests from China.  The authors of the reviews suggest improving the sound insulation in the hotel. </p><p>  The rooms seemed crowded and old-fashioned to some guests.  But then everyone notes their cleanliness, a recent pleasant repair, the presence of perfect linen.  The rooms, guests note, with beautiful views.  It is advised to better take housing on the upper floors with sea views, otherwise the view from the window will be "not very".  And also be sure to read the booklet with a list of partners and discounts, as at the reception at check-in, guests may not be informed about discounts. </p><p>  Amur Bay, in the opinion of many, is a good hotel, but the ratio ‚Äúprice - quality‚Äù in it, according to some guests, is still not appropriate. </p><h2>  Grades </h2><p>  According to independent expert opinions, residents rated the level of comfort at the hotel as follows (according to a 10-point system): </p><ul><li>  Cleanliness: 6 points. </li><li>  Comfort: 5.7 points. </li><li>  Location: 7.7 points. </li><li>  Facilities: 6.2 points. </li><li>  Staff: 7.2 points. </li><li>  Value for money: 6.3 points. </li><li>  Free Wi-Fi: 7.2 points. </li></ul>
