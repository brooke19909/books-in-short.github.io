    <h2>  Reef Oasis Beach Resort 5 *: reviews of Russian travelers </h2><p>  Most experienced tourists do not need to prove the importance of carefully planning a trip abroad.  This is especially true of the choice of a hotel in which it is planned to spend several days, or even weeks of vacation.  After all, even not very demanding people want to be in a comfortable environment, surrounded by quality service.  According to many travelers, acquaintance with the reviews of tourists who have already stayed in a particular hotel provides invaluable assistance in this matter.  So, former guests try to share not only information about the advantages of the hotel, which are often already obvious, but also talk about its shortcomings.  Therefore, long before the trip, you can draw up an idea close to the real state of affairs that will await you in the chosen hotel.  As a rule, it takes a lot of effort to search for reviews.  We decided to make it easier for you by offering to familiarize yourself with the already generalized comments of our compatriots regarding their stay at <span>the Sharm El Sheikh Hotel</span> (Reef Oasis Beach Resort 5 *), tours to which are offered by many operators in Russia and other CIS countries.  Immediately, we note that the vast majority of reviews are positive.  Apparently, travelers were satisfied with their choice and are ready to recommend this hotel to everyone who wants to have a great time on the Red Sea coast.  But we learn about everything in more detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reef oasis beach resort 5 prices" class="if" height="229" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1055405.jpg" width="600"></div>

So, according to them, the rooms here are cozy, quite spacious, clean and bright.  They are furnished with comfortable furniture and high-quality appliances.  Almost no one complained about breakdowns.  But even if something failed, then, according to our compatriots, after reporting this to the reception, the problem was fixed as soon as possible.  In their reviews, some travelers praise the comfortable large beds in the rooms.  Also, many of our compatriots were pleased with the fact that on TV you can watch four channels in Russian, one of which is children's.  So you can always follow the news at home, and your children will have the opportunity to watch a cartoon in their native language at night. </p><h2>  Cleaning </h2><p>  In general, none of the guests particularly complained about the work of the maids at the Reef Oasis Beach Resort 5 * (Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt).  According to them, cleaning is standard for Egyptian hotels.  That is, counting on perfect cleanliness in the rooms is not necessary, however, order is still monitored here.  So, maids clean and change towels every day.  Bed linen is updated once every three days.  Personal hygiene supplies in the bathroom are replenished as needed.  Also, every day, maids add a few bottles of drinking water to the minibar.  If for some reason you find that you forgot to change towels, did not add shampoos and gels, etc., then you can always contact the administrator at the reception or directly to the cleaner.  The problem will be solved very quickly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Check in, departure </h2><p>  As our compatriots note, despite the fact that the Reef Oasis Beach Resort &amp; Spa 5 * hotel has a checkout time, in some cases tourists arriving early in the morning manage to get their room keys without waiting for 14:00.  So, if you want to check in immediately after arrival, you can offer the administrator at the reception a small fee (about 10-20 dollars).  If the hotel has free apartments of the category you booked, then you will most likely be offered to enter the room almost immediately.  However, according to most travelers, even if you arrive at the hotel very early, you can do without check-in for several hours.  After all, you can leave your things in the locker room and go to a restaurant for breakfast or lunch, to a bar, swim in the pool, take a walk around the territory or swim in the sea.  Then you just need to find out the number of your apartments at the reception and take the key from them.  Baggage will already be delivered to the place. </p><p>  As for the day of departure, the occupied room should be vacated before noon.  If you plan to leave the hotel in the evening, you can extend your stay at the apartments for an additional fee.  However, it is advisable to notify the administrator in advance of their plans. </p><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Many guests of the Reef Oasis Beach Resort 5 *, the photo of which can be seen in this article, very positively respond to the territory of the hotel.  So, according to them, it is very large and well equipped.  In addition, there are a lot of greenery, beautiful flowers, pretty bridges, picturesque paths, etc. On the territory of the hotel you will find a lot of places where you can make an excellent photo shoot in memory of your vacation.  In addition, open motor cars ply here that transport everyone from the water park or reception to the beach.  So if you wish, you don‚Äôt have to walk a lot, it will be enough to take advantage of the provided transfer. </p>

So, in their opinion, meals at Reef Oasis Beach Resort are organized at a very decent level.  For example, for breakfast, the main restaurant offers several types of cereals, soups, side dishes, cereals, pastries, sausages and cheeses, jams, fruits and vegetables.

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Many travelers in their reviews of Reef Oasis Beach Resort 5 * (Egypt, Sharm El Sheikh) argue that a beach holiday with the guests of this hotel will surely succeed one hundred percent.  After all, near the coast here is one of the most beautiful <span>coral reefs of</span> Sharm El Sheikh.  Even tourists who are accommodated in other hotels are brought here on an excursion.  According to our compatriots, the reef here is inhabited by many interesting, vibrant and unique marine inhabitants.  So, many with their own eyes saw here not only unique corals, but also funny nemo fish, stingrays, lionfish, <span>barracudas, surgeon fish</span> and other unique representatives of the fauna of the Red Sea.  Therefore, when going on a trip, be sure to bring a mask for snorkeling and fins.  After all, as tourists say, you can swim and enjoy the underwater world here for several hours in a row.  By the way, another big advantage of this hotel is the fact that it is located in a natural lagoon.  So there are practically no winds here, and guests have the opportunity to swim from morning to evening. </p><p>  As for the beach itself, then, according to tourists, it is quite large, clean, fine sand.  There are many sun loungers and parasols, there is a bar and a restaurant where you can order a soft or alcoholic drink, as well as a snack or even dine fully during the day.  You can enter the sea right from the shore.  The bottom here is sandy for several tens of meters, without stones and corals, which is very convenient for children.  In addition, those who wish can go down to the sea from the pontoon, using the stairs or diving directly into the water.  Here you will immediately find yourself next to the reef. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Hotel Reef Oasis Beach Resort 5 *, according to tourists who have been here, offers its guests a lot of opportunities for leisure.  So, on the territory of the hotel complex there are several pools of different sizes and depths.  The water everywhere is very clean, a little chlorine.  Several pools are heated in the winter. </p><p>  In addition, many travelers as the indisputable advantages of the hotel note the presence of their own water park.  Entertainment in it is both for the smallest guests, and for adults.  Access to the water park is free.  On site there is a bar with drinks and a snack bar with snacks.  Tourists who have visited the ‚ÄúReef Oasis‚Äù recommend that those who are going here for a vacation should definitely visit the water park at least once, because you have a lot of impressions. </p><p>  Our compatriots and animation at the hotel were satisfied.  So, during the day, guests are invited to play <span>beach volleyball,</span> water polo, do aerobics, gymnastics, participate in fun contests, dance, etc. In the evenings, an entertainment program and a disco are held. </p>

    <h2>  For children </h2><p>  Since Reef Oasis Beach is positioning itself as a family hotel, all conditions have been created for a comfortable stay and accommodation not only for adult guests, but also their children.  So, if you come to rest with a child, then, depending on age, either an playpen or an extra bed will be provided.  The restaurant has high chairs and a children's table.  The complex has shallow pools where it will be safe even for the youngest tourists.  There is also a playground for children, and the water park has slides for children.  During the day, parents can send their children to the miniclub, where they will be offered a variety of entertaining and developing activities.  At 8 o‚Äôclock in the evening, a mini-disco begins, after which children can watch cartoons with the animator. </p><h2>  the Internet </h2><p>  Since the World Wide Web has a very important place in the life of a modern person, the fact that Wi-Fi is available in the hotel is very important for many tourists.  As for the "Reef Oasis", the rooms do not have Internet access.  You can connect to Wi-Fi in the lobby near the reception.  However, if you want to always be able to be online, then experienced travelers recommend buying a SIM card from a local mobile operator with a prepaid mobile Internet package at the airport.  This pleasure, according to our compatriots, is quite inexpensive (about $ 15), and traffic, as a rule, is enough for the entire vacation.  Of course, such an Internet will not be enough, for example, to work.  But in order to send friends photos and chat with family, it will be quite enough. </p>
