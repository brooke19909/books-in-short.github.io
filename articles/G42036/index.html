Prices at this resort, despite everything, remained at the same level.  And the Northern Black Sea coast - Koblevo, Zatoka, Lazurnoe, Bolshevik and Ochakov - have always been considered the cheapest vacation spots in Ukraine.  Hot, dry summers, rapidly warming water, wide sandy beaches - all this makes the resorts seductive for a trip with the whole family.  Of course, there are no mountains and Mediterranean vegetation.  But the Black Sea, a cheap alternative to the Crimea, has something to offer its guests.  The tourist infrastructure of the local resorts is developing rapidly.  Small villages, former state farms, quickly overgrown with seaside boulevards, mini-hotels, neat cottages on the shore.  Let's look at one of the resorts here - the Iron Port. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kherson iron port" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/466203.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  History </h2><p>  These places thundered during the time of the Zaporizhzhya Sich.  At the beginning of the eighteenth century, the Cossacks founded the Naked Revisation (the modern city of Naked Quay).  This point controlled the path through which the Chumaks transported salt through the Prognoevskaya Palanca and Kherson.  Iron Port - a new village.  It was founded only in 1922 by immigrants from the village of Keleghei.  Former residents of the mainland, who were on the very shore, joked that their village "crawled into the sea."  Later, the name Zalizny Port was literally translated into Russian.  According to another version, earlier there was a long iron pier, to which ships with salt moored.  The approaching sea and storms destroyed it, but the name remained.  The third version says that already at the beginning of the XX century there was a barn on the shore, covered with a badge.  She shone in the sun and served the sailors as a definite guide. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest in Kherson iron port" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/466204.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  It is best to arrive by train or plane to Kherson.  The Iron Port, the distance to which is more than 70 kilometers, lies in the south of the region.  Regular buses run from the bus station, which is located near the central market of the regional center, several times a day.  But if you come by train, you do not need to go to the city.  Directly from the station square there are minibuses "Kherson - Iron Port".  The bus leaves as passengers fill their seats.  The fare in the minibus does not differ from the bus - 40 hryvnias (at the rate it is about 110 Russian rubles).  Travel time is an hour and a half, depending on the busy streets in Kherson.  In the summer, a small comfortable minibus from Kiev runs to the Iron Port.  Using your own vehicles, you need to move along the Kherson ‚Äì Tsyurupinsk highway, then turn onto Golaya Pristan and navigate along the railway signs to the Iron Port. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kherson iron port bus" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/466207.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where to live? </h2><p>  The tourist base in the village was formed in the 70s of the last century.  On the first line there are pensions, rest houses and children's camps.  The estates of residents, including modern mini-hotels, are located a little distance from the sea.  But the private sector, the price for a bed in which starts from 40 hryvnia per day, can satisfy the discerning client, however, for a much higher price.  It is for the variety of services that Kherson is appreciated.  The Iron Port, whose boarding houses offer three meals a day, is also cheaper than similar ones in the Crimea or in the Odessa region.  Organized vacations in the rest houses "Anchor", "Suzirya", "Victoria," Vivat ", at the tourist camps" Three whales "," Breeze "," Slavutich "and others are good because the buildings and houses are located in the park area.  And in the steppes, the greenery of trees is an extra luxury.  Yes, and the beach will be within easy reach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kherson iron port distance" class="if" height="235" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/466206.jpg" width="314"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Entertainment infrastructure </h2><p>  But not always living near the beach is comfortable.  All the entertainment infrastructure in the village is concentrated near the so-called "promenade".  Locals themselves call the Iron Port "Kherson Las Vegas."  Life here does not stop even after midnight.  Discos, strip bars, restaurants and cafes colorize southern velvet evenings with color music.  Children who enjoy the season amusement park.  But some rides freeze the blood even for adults.  Sand and shell beaches have long been cultivated, but still remain free.  And this is also one more advantage from which resort Kherson, the Iron Port benefits.  Many of the beaches are equipped with sunshades or sunken umbrellas.  Entertainment on the water is represented by "bananas", catamarans, scooters and other motorized boats.  In the center of the village on the beach there is a rental of sunbeds and umbrellas. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kherson iron port boarding houses" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/466205.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Kherson, Iron Port, prices </h2><p>  For many Ukrainians, the Northern Black Sea Coast is a place of more than a budget holiday.  And this applies to both housing and food, and entertainment.  The price depends on the status of the institution and its proximity to the beach.  The season also plays an important role - in July everything rises in price.  In any case, in stores, products are sold at the same prices as in the regional center.  The rural market pleases with an abundance of fruits, vegetables, dairy products, fish and seafood. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  The short history of the village does not mean at all that there are no attractions there.  Directly to the village, on the western side, adjacent to the territory of the Black Sea Biosphere Reserve, one of the largest in Ukraine.  It extends far, includes the lands of the Kinburn and <span>Tendrov braids, the</span> tract Yagorlytsky Kut.  In it, the only desert in Europe stretches - Oleshkovsky Sands.  Since 2005, a geyser has been open for those wishing to improve health 15 km from the Iron Port.  The water pouring from it has a temperature of +70 ¬∞ C. Brown liquid, saturated with iodine and salts, enters two bathhouses.  Another one has healing mud.  On the boardwalk of the Iron Port and in the boarding houses, you can sign up for longer excursions: to the Askania-Nova nature reserve, to the salt lake in Golaya Pristan, to the <span>Dzharylgach island</span> or to the Dnieper plavni. </p>
