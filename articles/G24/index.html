    <p>  Social networks have tightly entered the life of modern youth.  There is a certain secret separation of users by age.  So, for example, the VKontakte social network collects mostly very young Internet users, where they together comment on each other‚Äôs photos and draw <span>graffiti on the wall of a</span> personal page.  By registering at Odnoklassniki, people who have already graduated from school have the opportunity to find their friends at the educational institution, colleagues and just acquaintances whom they could not see for many years. </p><p>  In fact, there are no restrictions when registering on a social network, and any user who has access to the Internet can create a personal page regardless of age, country of residence or mother tongue. </p><p>  One of the most visited and rapidly developing is another social network - Facebook, which allows you to chat with many friends who live in other countries, however, few people thought about who created Facebook. </p><p>  Perhaps it‚Äôs worth talking about the young and talented <span>Mark Zuckerberg,</span> who, despite his age, and he is now 28 years old, is already considered the owner of a multi-billion dollar fortune.  In the published list of 400 most affluent people on Earth, Mark takes an honorable 14th place, and his fortune is estimated at 17.5 billion US dollars. </p><p>  Zuckerberg's life began quite banally, he was born in a Jewish family, where there were 4 children.  Mark's mother was a psychiatrist, and his father worked as a dentist.  At the age of 10, the future founder of Facebook received his first computer as a gift, and a year later his whole family used the home network created by little Mark, where they could exchange messages between themselves. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As a student of the 9th grade, Zuckerberg created a unique musical program ‚ÄúSynapse‚Äù, for which he will subsequently be offered a considerable sum of money from the already famous computer genius Bill Gates.  However, Mark decides to distribute his program absolutely free. </p><p>  Immediately after leaving school, the future <span>founder of Facebook</span> receives a favorable job offer from Microsoft, but refuses it and goes to study at the Department of Psychology at Harvard. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the history of the creation of the popular social network Facebook is somewhat confusing, there are several versions that are put forward by all participants in those events. </p><p>  The Tyler and Cameron Winklovoss brothers, as well as their friend Divia Narendra, began work on a student site called ConnectU in 2003.  In the fall of that year, they invited Zuckerberg to work together on this project.  Mark agreed, but at the beginning of 2004, unexpectedly for everyone, he registered his domain, which he initially gave the name ‚ÄúTheFacebook.com‚Äù.  <span>On February 4,</span> having abandoned the article, the <span>creator of Facebook</span> has already launched his new project.  His friends helped Mark in this - Dustin Moskowitz, Christopher Hughes, Andrew McCollum and Eduardo Saverin. </p><p>  It is not surprising that after the <span>new social network appeared,</span> Narenda and the Winklovoss brothers began to argue that this was completely their idea and development.  This led to the fact that in 2007 long litigation began, as a result of which in 2009, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg still paid them $ 65 million, but for him it was already a very small amount. </p><p>  In order for Mark's project to work in full force, significant financial investments were required, such an investor was found.  The founder <span>of the PayPal payment system,</span> with whom Mark brought Sean Parker, saw the prospects of the young geniuses in the project and invested 500 thousand dollars in it. </p><p>  After a short period of time, Facebook founder Mark and his like-minded people put together a strong team of programmers, which allowed the project to expand and reach a whole new level with a multi-million audience. </p>
