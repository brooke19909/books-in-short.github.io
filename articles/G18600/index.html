    <p>  The Russians praised the compactness and well-groomed hotel grounds.  Thanks to the location in the center, they were able to save on public transport and taxis.  Room decoration matches the interiors of premium-class hotels.  In the living rooms everything is new and whole. </p><p>  The lack of a restaurant more than compensates for the abundance of eateries that are concentrated within walking distance.  The food in Sanya is very tasty and satisfying.  The portions are large.  The public beach has everything you need for a comfortable stay.  At the same time, the water is clean and clear. </p><p>  The hotel owner is personally interested in the opinion of his guests about the hotel and service.  This moment impresses customers of the hotel.  In parting, many were given souvenirs.  In the area in which the complex is located, mainly Chinese live.  And the hotel had many visitors from Russia. </p><p>  This is a great option for young and energetic travelers who cannot sit at home.  The rooms are cleaned daily, linen is changed regularly.  They listen to requests and fulfill all wishes. </p><h2>  Negative </h2><p>  There were no complaints about the hotel.  Especially picky did not like the view from the window.  The sea is not visible.  The balcony overlooks a noisy street.  Since many Chinese are <span>resting in Hainan</span> , the prices at the resort are high.  This moment afflicted thrifty tourists.  It is said that there were temporary interruptions in the supply of hot water. </p><p>  Beyond the hotel fence were garbage bins that exuded an unpleasant odor.  Locals smoke, and therefore the rooms smelled of tobacco.  The rooms do not have a refrigerator, guests use the shared.  It is installed on the ground floor of the building.  Internet speed was very slow.  She was not enough to view the pages of social networks and send emails. </p><h2>  Recommendations </h2><p>  Experienced travelers are advised to stay at this hotel for those who need an overnight stay.  For a measured beach holiday, it is better to choose a different place.  When planning to have fun in other areas of the resort, keep in mind that traffic jams often occur on the roads.  You can stand for hours in traffic jams. </p><p>  It is problematic to find the hotel building yourself.  Better to order a transfer.  At night, a modest sign serves as a guide, which is sometimes forgotten to include.  When choosing a room, check the rigidity of the mattress and the quality of the drain in the shower. </p><p>  There are no Russian-language programs in the cable channel package.  Linen will have to be dried right in the room.  No laundry.  If you have questions, you should ask the owner.  General information about the resort is located on the wall near the entrance to the elevator. </p><p>  Those who don‚Äôt like Asian cuisine will enjoy the Our Rush eatery menu.  The bistro is aimed at Russians and immigrants from the USSR. </p>
