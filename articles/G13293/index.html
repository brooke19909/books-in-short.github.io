    <p>  At the same time, as experts say, many companies pay insufficient attention to such an aspect as the autonomy of the devices, believing that the owners of gadgets will always have the opportunity to recharge the battery.  Philips has been recognized by many experts as a brand that believes this is not the case.  Therefore, the Dutch pay such a direction as increasing the battery life of devices, and increased attention. </p><p>  Very many smartphones released by this brand, experts believe, can be considered samples where the optimal combination of performance and battery resources is implemented.  Among these gadgets is a <span>Philips Xenium W6610 phone.</span>  The characteristics of the device, experts believe, make this solution one of the most competitive on the market, if we take into account the ratio of price, functionality and speed compared to peers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The hardware that the device is equipped with fully corresponds to the "global" trend: this is a processor with four cores, and a 5-inch, high-tech display, a powerful video subsystem.  However, the phone also has a battery with a capacity exceeding 5 thousand mAh.  Moreover, despite the fact that the phone case, due to the large size of the battery, is slightly larger than that of competing models, visually the gadget does not seem massive at all.  How do experts evaluate the quality of the smartphone?  What do users say who left reviews of the capabilities of the <span>Philips Xenium W6610</span> ? </p><h2>  What's in the box? </h2><p>  In the factory box, the owner of the phone will find the device itself, the battery, USB-cable, power adapter, very simple in design headphones, a protective film for the display, as well as a user manual.  Additional accessories, such as, for example, a cover (as noted by users who left reviews on the fact of studying <span>Philips Xenium W6610</span> ), you can always buy in any communication salon.  The "factory" headphones, which many experts and users call too simple and not very high quality (although quite functional), can also be easily "updated". </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  An original design solution was applied to the front side of the case in the form of an unusually looking (against the background of other gadgets of the Xenium line) smooth, black edging in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe voice speaker.  This element, in turn, contrasts somewhat with the back panel made of a material that does not have such a pronounced smoothness of the surface.  And it looks, according to many experts, very impressive.  Applied in the design of the phone and metal elements (in particular, this is a plate that covers the connectors).  The corners of the phone are elegantly smooth.  Features of the housing design allow the owners of the device to use a variety of additional accessories.  Good for Philips Xenium W6610 book cover. </p>

    <p>  We have already said above that the smartphone has impressive dimensions (here are the numbers: 145.4 x 74.1 x 11.4 mm), however, experts admit, the device sits in the hand so comfortably that the body size is much higher than the figures most similar models do not seem excessive at all.  There are, of course, opinions that contrast with this point of view in the expert community.  In particular, many note that the phone is not quite suitable in terms of design for ladies, especially at a young age (when the honor is sophistication and miniature in all details of the image, including mobile devices).  However, their opponents believe that the problem can be easily solved by equipping the gadget with additional accessories.  For example, if you buy a stylish case for Philips Xenium W6610, as well as complement the device with a more sophisticated headset, any modern lady will be happy with this combination in comparison with the standard kit. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Some believe that the gadget does not seem so massive due to the simplicity of the design.  There are no extra lines and buttons.  Many experts and users consider the selection of the color scheme of the case to be successful - its parts are made of plastic and metal components of dark and blue shades (in the catalogs of the manufacturer, a smartphone with such a range is referred to as Philips Xenium W6610 Navy).  There are, of course, names on the market that sound a little different.  For example, like this: Philips Xenium W6610 Navy Blue, that is, it directly states that we are talking about blue elements. </p><p>  Experts note the high build quality of the case.  There are no backlashes and gaps.  Conveniently, the phone is, in fact, monolithic: removable elements can be considered, except that some plugs for the connectors, as well as the back plate.  A large number of users who left after studying the smartphone Philips Xenium W6610, reviews, acknowledge that in many ways they chose the gadget for the excellent quality of the materials of the case. </p><p>  The screen of the device is covered with a protective layer of oleophobic glass, almost not susceptible to fingerprints.  The sensitivity of the display is noted by experts as good.  Just above the screen is the voice speaker.  To the left of it is an additional camera, to the right are standard sensors for smartphones of this type (motion and light).  Nearby is a small indicator light that indicates missed SMS and calls, as well as a discharged battery (in this case it lights up in red).  Below the screen are the standard buttons "Menu", "Return" and "Home".  There is a backlight, which, according to experts, goes well with the style of the device and the color scheme in which the Philips Xenium W6610 "Navy" smartphone is made. </p><p>  At the bottom end of the case there is a microphone hole, as well as a microUSB slot, closed with a small plug.  Upstairs is the audio jack.  Having removed the back plate, the user will see various slots: for a SIM card, as well as for flash memory (microSD format). </p><p>  On the left side of the case is a button that adjusts the sound level.  On the right is the power key.  Just above it is a button that activates a mode of low energy consumption.  Experts note that each of the keys located on the gadget's body is very thoughtful, many praise Philips engineers for the work done (to equip the device with a comfortable control system).  At the back of the case is the main camera, equipped with a flash, as well as a speaker.  Next to it is a small tubercle mounted in a building.  It allows you to keep the speaker in the open position if you put the smartphone face up on a hard surface. </p>

    <p>  Users who decide to leave, after studying the Philips Xenium W6610, feedback on their purchase, in general, agree with the opinions of experts on the stylish design of the device, the convenient location of the controls and the high quality assembly of the case.  In the device, experts and owners who have studied its appearance believe that all components are selected in a balanced manner - both in terms of design and in terms of functionality. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The screen size of the smartphone is 5 inches.  The actual screen size is 62 by 110 mm.  Experts call these parameters typical for gadgets of this class.  To many users, a 5-inch display seemed quite large.  Elegant frames surround the screen on all sides.  The surface of the display is coated with anti-reflective material, which ensures comfortable viewing of the picture from any angle. </p><p>  <span>The screen resolution is</span> relatively low (540 by 960 pixels), but the <span>color depth</span> (220 dpi) gives the image a minimal graininess, almost invisible visually.  Some experts, as well as users, were able to identify that the display of the smartphone responds well to touch with gloves. </p><p>  The display is equipped with high-tech IPS-matrix.  The picture is visible, as experts say, from almost any viewing angle very well (and in many respects the anti-reflective coating contributes to this - we already said about this).  The screen supports the multitouch function (up to five touches).  The sensitivity of the touchscreen is characterized by experts as excellent (including the "gloves on" mode).  Users who have left reviews regarding the operation of the Philips Xenium W6610, in general, agree with the opinions of experts about the quality of the display. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The smartphone is equipped with a non-removable battery with a very large (for devices of its class) capacity - 5.3 thousand mAh.  According to official documentation from the manufacturer, the stand-alone operation of the phone in standby mode can reach 1.6 thousand hours, with active use and talking - about 33. </p><p>  Tests conducted by experts showed: batteries with an average intensity of using a smartphone lasts about 40 hours.  This may include, for example, about 120 minutes of conversation, as well as about 7-8 hours of using the Internet.  If you use your smartphone only for continuous listening to music, then the battery lasts about 65 hours.  If you play only videos with the maximum settings for display brightness and a high volume level, the device will be able to work autonomously for about 10 hours. </p>

    <p>  Some experts testing the smartphone in video playback mode, managed to reach the figure of 14 hours.  When running modern 3D games, the battery lasts about 240 minutes.  The battery is not charged very quickly, but not too long - 3-4 hours from the outlet, about 10 - via a USB cable.  The battery is recognized by most experts as the most competitive part of the phone. </p><p>  To many users who left, having studied the Philips Xenium W6610 phone, reviews, they managed to achieve higher indicators reflecting battery power than those that we cited above.  Many, in particular, were able to play the video for more than 70 hours in a row.  Others managed to use the Internet for the same 7-8 hours for 3-4 days.  Those owners of the gadget who made a lot of voice calls note that with an average intensity of operation of the device, battery resources last for three to four days.  To many smartphone users, the speed of recharging the battery, by the way, seems to be quite optimal. </p><p>  According to experts, the actual battery life of the device depends, firstly, on the level of calibration of the battery, and secondly, on the number of simultaneously running applications.  For users, these options can vary greatly. </p><p>  Some experts find it not quite convenient that the phone‚Äôs battery cannot be replaced.  But, according to their opponents, the typical battery life of this type is 3-4 years.  It is highly likely that during this time the owner of the phone will have time to update his ‚Äúmobile‚Äù arsenal more than once. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  The Philips Xenium W6610 smartphone can work in 2G and 3G standards.  It is interesting that both SIM-cards can simultaneously work in 3G mode (very many smartphones do not provide such an opportunity).  There is a Bluetooth module in the 4th version.  Wi-Fi is supported (including in router or modem mode).  There is a GPS function. </p><p>  The quality of the satellite navigation module has caused conflicting ratings in the user and expert environments.  Very many specialists and owners of the gadget failed, in particular, to "catch the satellite" without an Internet connection.  However, according to some experts, this state of affairs is far from unique to this gadget.  Many devices of other brands in the same way can not work with GPS simply because of the fact that it‚Äôs very difficult to place a navigation module that can fully replace a separate device in a smartphone.  If you do this, the dimensions of the gadget will change.  In addition, energy efficiency will decrease dramatically.  Therefore, experts believe, the fact that the Xenium W6610 GPS module can fully work only in combination with the Internet does not in any way indicate that the gadget is technologically backward from competitors.  This is rather the norm for devices of this class. </p><h2>  Memory resources </h2><p>  The phone is equipped with a 1 GB RAM module, about 650 are actually available. The built-in flash memory is 4 GB, the user can use about 2.7.  There is support for additional microSD modules.  Most experts who decided to compile a review of the capabilities of Philips Xenium W6610 consider that the memory resources laid down by the manufacturer in the device are generally sufficient to solve basic user problems. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The main camera has a resolution of 8 megapixels, an additional - 2. The first is also equipped with a single-section type LED flash.  The smartphone can record videos in FullHD format, speed - 15 frames / sec.  when using the main camera, 18 - when using the additional one.  The video file is recorded in 3GP format, the audio codec bitrate is 128 Kbps, single-channel sound, 48 kHz.  Experts note the high quality of photographs taken by the main camera, acceptable - when using an additional one.  Images, as experts say, are sufficiently clear and saturated in terms of color. </p><p>  Some experts attribute the minus of the camera to the fact that the recording speed of video frames is relatively low.  This remark, in general, is true: a lot of similar solutions from other brands can write videos at 30 frames / sec.  However, according to the Philips Xenium W6610 ‚Äúlawyers,‚Äù the characteristics of this type of smartphone camera are not the most important parameter in terms of the device‚Äôs competitiveness. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The smartphone has the MT6582 chipset installed, the most popular, according to experts, among low-end models.  The device is equipped with a quad-core Cortex A7 processor with a frequency of 1.3 GHz, made using 28 nm technology. </p>

    <p>  The phone‚Äôs graphics subsystem is controlled by a 400 MP2 (400 MHz) chip.  Expert tests showed that these components provide the device with a high level of performance.  There is no problem launching applications and most modern games. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  The smartphone is equipped with Android OS in version 4.2.2.  The firmware installed on the Philips Xenium W6610 is not equipped with a proprietary software shell from the brand.  However, this fact does not seem to be a minus for experts and users who left reviews after reviewing their smartphone Philips Xenium W6610.
