And by the 70s, when the bridge was built on Paradise Island and landscaped Cable Beach, the city began to receive up to 2.5 million visitors a year. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Bahamas Attractions </h2><p>  At the beginning of our trip, we will get acquainted with some islands that are of interest to tourists. </p><p>  <em>Grand Bahama</em> is located in the north of the archipelago.  It is the second most visited tourist island in the country.  Despite its name, it is not the largest island.  He attracts tourists with snow-white shores, vast forests and rich wildlife.  Its most popular area is Freeport. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bahamas photo" class="if" height="176" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1140133.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Andros </h2><p>  <span>The largest island of the</span> archipelago.  It is covered with vast palm thickets.  In addition, mahogany and pine grow here.  The forest here, according to the islanders, is populated by aggressive little red-eyed elves.  They call them chikcharniz. </p><p>  The island is poorly populated, only on its eastern shore can you find shabby shacks, surrounded by old cars and abandoned refrigerators.  Therefore, Andros is most often visited only by extreme divers, who are attracted here by the third longest barrier reef in the world.  He stretched along all the shores of the island.  The city of Andros Town also belongs to the sights of this island, along with an old lighthouse and the beautiful Somerset Beach.  In the town of Red Bay, located in the north-west of Andros, the descendants of the Seminole Indians live, who are famous for their skill in weaving various products from straws. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bahamas Attractions" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1140132.jpg" width="502"></div>

    <h2>  Long Island </h2><p>  Tourists visit far from all the Bahamas.  The map shows that Long Island is an elongated island (one hundred kilometers long and five kilometers wide).  It is practically not visited by tourists.  And completely in vain.  This is the most picturesque island of the archipelago, with many corners untouched by human civilization. </p><p>  The landscape of Long Island is formed by a combination of hilly terrain, washed out by the surf of the coast, which are washed by the richest sea life, sandy beaches.  In the north of the island there is a long snow-white beach - one of the most beautiful in the western hemisphere. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bahamas tours" class="if" height="325" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1140131.jpg" width="520"></div>

    <h2>  Nassau Cathedral </h2><p>  But not only the interesting nature of the Bahamas is famous.  The capital of the state is famous for its architectural structures.  One of them is the Cathedral.  This is the largest religious building in the country.  The construction of the cathedral dates back to the end of the 17th century.  Next to it, you can see many commemorative tablets with the names of people who died here during the time of epidemics. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bahamas photo" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1140125.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Queen Victoria Staircase </h2><p>  In Nassau (Bahamas) there is an unusual staircase.  It was cut down in a limestone rock by slaves in the 18th century.  It has sixty five steps.  The current name was received much later.  This happened during the celebration of the 65th anniversary of Queen Victoria‚Äôs throne. </p><p>  A staircase runs along the wall of the fort.  On the opposite side a small waterfall carries its waters.  At the very bottom, at the steps there is a recreation area.  And from the upper steps a bewitching view of Nassau opens. </p><h2>  Parliament building </h2><p>  This small two-story building is located in the very center of Nassau, in its main square.  It was built at the beginning of the 19th century, for the meetings of the colonial government.  The first British officials appeared here in the middle of the XVII century.  And today, direct influence from London is felt in the state, since formally the Queen of Great Britain is still the head of the country's Parliament. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nassau bahamas" class="if" height="220" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1140134.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The Parliament building has an antique portico, which is decorated with four columns.  Like all buildings in the square, it is painted in a saturated pink color.  It looks especially beautiful in the evening hours. </p><h2>  Bimini road </h2><p>  These are two almost parallel ruts paved with stone slabs that are under water.  Some slabs reach a length of six meters.  The road is located at a depth of nine meters, through perfectly clear water it is perfectly visible from the sea surface.  Its length is five hundred meters, its width is ninety meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bahamas Attractions" class="if" height="364" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1140129.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  This is not the only unusual find.  Not far from the Bimini road, a sleeve has a J-shape.  It is also lined with such plates.  Here, under the water, other strange structures were also discovered - platforms and concentric circles. </p><h2>  Alice Town </h2><p>  Today, many are attracted to the Bahamas, photos of which you can see in our article.  They have many different clubs on their territory.  Alice Town has the most famous of them.  In it, E. Hemingway began to write his novel ‚ÄúTo Have and Not To Have‚Äù.  This historical monument is shown to tourists, which presents unique photographs of the famous writer, his personal belongings. </p><h2>  Royal Victoria Gardens Gardens </h2><p>  Unusual vegetation is famous for the Bahamas.
