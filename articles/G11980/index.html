    <p>  One of the main features of the educational process is bilateral activity, which is manifested both by the teacher and by the students.  The development of this process in many aspects is influenced by <strong>receptions and teaching methods</strong> . </p><p>  Such methods of interaction between the student and the students, which are aimed at the joint solution of educational problems, are called teaching methods.  Reception is one of the individual sides of the method or one of its components.  Therefore, the <strong>techniques and teaching methods</strong> are in constant interaction, influencing one another.  As an example, we can consider the method of work of students with educational literature.  It provides for the use of such techniques as taking notes, drawing up abstracts, a plan and a thematic dictionary, citing, writing reviews. </p><p>  The fact that <strong>methods and training methods</strong> can have a mutual influence is also evidenced by the fact that the methods include individual techniques.  For example, the construction of a schematic model is an element of the method of working with educational literature and at the same time an integral part of the teacher‚Äôs presentation of material, when students are tasked with creating a supporting abstract based on the new material being studied. </p><p>  In some cases, the applied method of training can act either as a separate method, or as a method.  So, the explanation of the material is a learning method, but if in the process of analyzing errors or practical work, the teacher resorts to explanation, then this is the method of practical work. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, <strong>tricks and teaching methods</strong> can sometimes be used interchangeably.  So, if during the lesson the teacher uses the method of presenting new material and refers to the drawings, graphs, drawings in the textbook for greater clarity and better assimilation of the subject, this will be a technique.  If during the lesson the method of working with educational literature is used, and the teacher needs to give an explanation of a particular concept or term, then this method will already act as an additional technique. </p><p>  Thus, the methods used during training consist of two types of methods - teaching and learning. </p>

    <p>  <strong>Types of teaching methods in training</strong> </p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>  All modern <span>forms of education as</span> their goal see an increase in interest in <span>cognitive activity</span> and learning, and this will contribute to a more effective and efficient educational process.  Therefore, the main <strong>teaching methods of teaching</strong> include: </p><p>  - freedom of choice (in any teaching action of a student there is a right to choose); </p><p>  - openness (not just to teach, but to pose in front of pupils problems whose solution goes beyond the scope of the material being studied); </p><p>  - activity (provides for the application of knowledge in practice); </p><p>  - high productivity (should use the knowledge and capabilities of the trainees to the maximum, taking into account their interests); </p><p>  - feedback (it is necessary to constantly monitor <span>the learning process</span> using feedback techniques). </p>

    <p>  <strong>Methods and techniques used in teaching preschoolers</strong> </p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>  The development of the child is due to his active work.  The basic principles of the educational program of <span>preschool children</span> are implemented during classes through the <strong>methods and techniques of teaching preschoolers</strong> . </p><p>  Under the method in this case, we should consider the methods of influence or transfer of knowledge.  Receptions are realized thanks to the options for using a particular method.  Therefore, the <strong>methods and techniques of teaching preschoolers</strong> can be practical, visual, verbal and game. </p><p>  The practical ones include, for example, the execution of assignments, various exercises, the joint work of the educator and children. </p><p>  Visual methods include observing living objects, natural phenomena, adult labor, viewing training programs, showing samples, using the theater of shadows and puppets and under.  Among the receptions within the framework of this method can be used an explanation of what they saw (heard), tasks for children and their active actions for their implementation, questions, <span>literary reading,</span> performance of game actions, etc. </p><p>  Verbal include reading, storytelling, conversation, dramatization, description of the picture. </p><p>  <span>Game methods</span> provide for outdoor, <span>didactic games,</span> fun, and dramatization. </p><p>  Using these methods and techniques allows you to have a pedagogical effect on the formation of preschool children skills of various <span>activities.</span> </p>
