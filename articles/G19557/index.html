    <h2>  Rimini, Rivabella </h2><p>  This wonderful <span>Italian city is</span> divided into several zones, each of which has its own characteristics.  Rivabella is one of the most advantageous areas of the city.  Here is Hotel Anna Mare 3 * (Italy, Rimini).  Rivabella has many sandy beaches, and they are considered the best in the city.  Along the sea lies a picturesque promenade, where cafes, restaurants, parks, playgrounds and attractions are at every step.  Tourists anywhere can find themselves something interesting and entertaining.  And the historical center of Rimini is not far away.  There is a lot of interesting architecture - from the time of antiquity, as well as the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.  This is the Arc de Triomphe of Emperor Augustus, and the bridge of Tiberius, Cavour Square, and the fortress of Malatesta, and the castle of Sismondo.  In Rivabella itself there is a healing spring “Panther”.  Various celebrations and festivals are also often organized in these places.

From the airport named after Federico Fellini - some 9 km.  There is a bus stop near the hotel.  So for independent travelers, getting from the airport and back is very convenient.  The hotel is small, urban.  This building has several floors with an elevator.  It actually has no territory of its own, only a small parking for tourists.  But it is located perfectly both in relation to public transport, and to shops and supermarkets.  Some tourists come here to go to the famous Rimini Fair.  For such business travelers, the hotel is more than good.  Indeed, a special bus runs from here to this fair, as it is located very close to it.  Nearby is a theme park where it will be interesting to walk with children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Anna Mare 3 * Rimini" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2128099.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel Anna Mare 3 * (Rimini): reviews </h2><p>  The hotel is not very popular with tourists who have never been to the European three stars and are used to a service like Turkish and Egyptian.  But for those who come not only to lie on the beach, but also to travel around the country or the surrounding area, the hotel seems suitable.  It is inexpensive (by Italian standards), the staff is friendly, the area is clean, the location is convenient.  The rooms are small but very neat.  It is convenient to get to the train station and travel to different cities of Italy, especially if you buy cheap tickets online beforehand.  From Rimini you can go in one day to the capital of the country, and to Florence, and to Bologna, and to the north - to Venice or to the lakes.  For shopping go to Milan, and for exotic - in San Marino.  Rivabella - the area is quiet, close to the sea, which is important for family tourists.  And in love, tourists in reviews are advised to go to the Tiberius bridge.  They say that if they walk along it, holding hands, they will live happily and never part. </p>
