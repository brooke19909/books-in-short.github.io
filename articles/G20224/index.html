How to create an interesting knitted art object</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Crocheting rugs is a very popular type of needlework.  For a long time they have been created from all kinds of improvised materials - old stockings, knitted T-shirts or worn woolen things, fabrics cut into thin strips.  Nowadays, plastic bags have been added to these simple base materials, of which very original rugs and bags are also knitted.  In the hands of the craftswomen, old knitwear, leaky stockings or <span>plastic bags</span> turn into original rugs, rugs, which are laid near the front door, in the hallway, in the hallways or in the bathrooms.  The manufacturing technology of such rugs is very simple.  Old things are cut in a circle into thin strips, which, if slightly stretched, are twisted into a tube convenient for knitting.  Then, with a thick <span>crochet, without crochet, a</span> round or square cloth is knitted, or individual motifs are knitted, which are then sewn together to create a mosaic pattern. </p><p>  Crocheting rugs is completely different.  Using bright yarn and a hook, you can create very beautiful and original author's works, which will be a bright design element, a unique art object, and interior decoration.  Having shown imagination and skill, any craftswoman who knows how to crochet can create a real designer work, and there can be many ways. </p><p>  Original knitting rugs </p><p>  Mat made of knitted snake.  The principle of creating the rug is as follows: a long (at least 17 m) stocking is knitted from yarns of various colors with columns with a crochet or without a crochet, which is knitted with a synthetic winterizer as it is knitted, and then twisted into a circle or oval and sewn from the wrong side.  For knitting, yarn of not only different colors, but also of various textures (smooth twisted, mohair, ‚Äúgrass‚Äù, boucle) is quite suitable, only, preferably, about the same thickness. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  They begin to knit a snake with 14 air loops, which close in a ring and knit rows of columns, starting each row with 3 air loops (for lifting) and closing with a connecting loop.  At various intervals, the color and texture of the yarn change.  As the stocking is knitted, it is stuffed with a synthetic winterizer.  At the end of the work, the top of the stocking is sutured. </p><p>  Such a rug will look good not only on the floor, but also on the wall.  It can be knitted from the yarn of the same color as the basis for further decor.  It is not necessary to lay the snake in a spiral and make a <span>round carpet</span> .  It can be laid in a zigzag pattern vertically, horizontally or obliquely, from one corner to another.  In a word, the scope for imagination and creative experiment is limitless. </p><p>  Crocheting rugs can be another way, for example, from thick cotton rope or <span>paper twine.</span>  Knitting from these materials is difficult enough, they are tough and do not bend well, but the work is very beautiful.  Collect such rugs from separate square or round motifs connected by openwork, which are sewn into a single fabric.  Knitting rugs from a rope is better obtained with a thick hook, and the rope should not be pulled tight during operation.  The simplest motive for knitting is a circle connected by combining a dense row of <span>double crochet</span> and a <span>crochet</span> row of double crochet and two intermediate stitches.  Such a panel mat will decorate the interior of a room or kitchen. </p><p>  Knitting Japanese Rugs </p><p>  Very beautiful Japanese rugs, which resemble a colored mosaic of small multi-colored rhombuses laid in patterns, are knitted from fluffy twisted yarn of medium thickness in saturated bright or pastel delicate colors.  Each individual motif consists of a round flower made of magnificent columns: a chain of three air loops is closed in a circle, three loops are made for lifting and twelve magnificent columns are knitted, introducing a hook into the center of the ring.  A lush column is performed as follows: the hook is inserted into the center of the circle, the loop is pulled, then 16-18 yarn over the hook are inserted again into the center of the circle, grab the thread from the ball and pull it through all the crochets on the hook.  The difficulty lies in the fact that it is quite difficult to stretch the thread through all the crochets and get an even lush column.  It is better to get a special hook, which is formed by a triangular recess, and not just a bent ‚Äúhead‚Äù. </p><p>  Separate multi-colored motifs are combined into a round, square or diamond-shaped canvas, bright, cheerful and fluffy.  Crocheting rugs in Japanese technique will allow you to perform not only flooring, but also bright covers on a stool, chair, make a wrap on a chair or sofa. </p>
