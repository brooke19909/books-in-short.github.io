Everyone took such a device with a bang, and active sales began.  Many wondered why the word Air was added.  But after they tried the tablet in work, they immediately realized that it was really ‚Äúairy‚Äù.  The company was able to surprise the then fans of this product.  But when another year passed, it was necessary to come up with something new or bring the parameters of the old to unimaginable limits.  It is for this purpose that the iPad Air 2 tablet has appeared, the characteristics of which are more than progressive. </p><p>  Among the products of competitors there are models that almost step on the heels of Apple.  But the company's management does not even think of competing with them.  Because they have a more interesting development path.  This is the direction of aesthetic perfection and minimalism in design.  This is what attracts the majority of users who choose the "apple" model of tablets. </p><h2>  IPad Air Tablet Features </h2><p>  This is one of the thinnest devices in its class.  The company's engineers were able to accommodate such characteristics of the iPad 5 Air in a small case that we can say about it with confidence: it is productive and multifunctional.  The case is made of aluminum, and this distinguishes this model from other plastic competitors.  The software is also up to par, every element is well developed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ipad air specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22199/531971.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  I would also like to say about touch control.  It is so light and sensitive that after it it is simply impossible to use other tablets.  You have to get used to all sorts of restrictions. </p><p>  The word ‚ÄúAir‚Äù in the name fully characterizes this device as light air.  They really worked on this purposefully, and the result exceeded all expectations.  iPad Air, whose characteristics in terms of weight and dimensions surpassed all competitors, will long hold the leading position. </p><h2>  Tablet performance </h2><p>  For computing processes, a dual-core A7 processor with a frequency of 1.4 GHz is used.  RAM there are 1 GB.  In addition, an accelerometer, a compass and a gyroscope are working in the assembly on a separate M7 coprocessor.  The operating system is presented in the form of iOS 7.0.  For user files, there is a space in the size of 16 to 128 GB.  Accordingly, the price of models with different memory is significantly different.  You need to determine the memory before buying an Apple iPad Air, whose characteristics do not allow expanding the memory via SD cards.  Such a limitation is by no means new to this company, as is the impossibility of the user replacing the battery independently. </p><h2>  IPad Air Screen </h2><p>  One of the advantages over competitors is the Retina screen.  The iPad Air screen, the technical characteristics of which are always pleasing, has long become a measure of quality to some extent.  Its resolution is 2048 √ó 1536 pixels with a display diagonal of 9.7 inches.  Detailing the picture is very good.  Screen technology - IPS matrix with LED backlight. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ipad air specifications" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22199/531972.jpg" width="333"></div>

There is practically no braking, and the controls are convenient. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  What are the features of the iPad Air tablet camera?  It is a 5 megapixel sensor.  With it, you can shoot high-quality video and photos.  On the side of the screen, a <span>front camera of</span> 1.2 megapixels is installed, which is designed to carry out video communication. </p><h2>  Communications and other features </h2><p>  To connect to the Internet in the iPad Air (specifications indicate the presence of Wi-Fi) there is a wireless connection.  To connect with other devices, Bluetooth 4.0 will help.  There is also a built-in A-GPS, which can very quickly determine the location. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ipad air 2 specifications" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22199/531973.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The device is powered by a 32.4 W / h lithium polymer battery.  It lasts for 5 hours of continuous operation.  If you play games, then this time will be significantly reduced. </p><p>  The dimensions of the tablet are 240 √ó 170 √ó 7.5 mm and weighs 480 grams.  Such indicators are very impressive for someone who first picks up a product of this brand.  It seems to be empty inside.  The iPad Air, whose features are simply excellent, is one of those models that set the momentum for other companies. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="apple ipad air specifications" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22199/531974.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In general, the <span>tablet is well in</span> demand even a year after it was introduced.  This suggests that the manufacturer is able to create really high-quality devices that can be relevant for a long time. </p><p>  It is worth noting that there is also a model with a reduced screen.  This is the iPad Air mini, the characteristics of which, in comparison with a tablet with a large diagonal, look more modest.  But the price of this option is significantly different. </p><h2>  Features iPad Air 2 </h2><p>  The new model of a successful tablet is designed to impress Apple lovers.  After the phenomenal success of the old model, the second version replaced it.  Engineers tried to develop a tablet with extreme technical parameters, which would serve as a significant margin from competitors.  Judging by the iPad Air 2, whose specifications have changed, the update was more than successful. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ipad air tablet specifications" class="if" height="265" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22199/531984.jpg" width="230"></div>

    <p>  Among the innovations of the tablet, one of the most interesting is Touch ID technology and the possibility of acquiring a device in golden color.  The first feature allows you to scan a fingerprint to identify the user.  This function is integrated into the operating system and is requested when performing critical operations. </p><p>  The color scheme really revived the appearance, which was gray from year to year.  Most users reacted very well to this update. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  A processor with three cores at 1.5 GHz each is responsible for the computing part.  He is helped by RAM in the amount of 2 GB.  Everything is controlled by the updated iOS 8.1 OS.  Compared with last year‚Äôs model, the result is more than substantial.  And given that the body has become even thinner, such an update is simply exceptional. </p><p>  In the new version, there is no longer an option with 32GB memory.  Available only on 16, 64 and 128GB.  This decision was ambiguously perceived at the presentation of the device. </p><p>  The screen of the new tablet was completely borrowed from the old model.  It also has an effective <span>oleophobic coating</span> that counteracts the appearance of fingerprints.  There is also an anti-reflective coating that effectively counteracts the reflection of rays from the screen.  It is worth noting the large viewing angles that the display shows us.  Even with large slopes, the image looks quite natural. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ipad 5 air specifications" class="if" height="265" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22199/531985.jpg" width="230"></div>

    <p>  The main camera still did better.  She is now at 8 megapixels.  When comparing images, the improvement is felt in the increase in detail. </p><p>  But what is completely unexpected is the weight loss compared to the old model.  Characteristics increased, and mass decreased.  The developers clearly worked hard. </p><h2>  Placement of controls </h2><p>  The iPad Air tablet, which remains the same in terms of layout, demonstrates the company's commitment to set standards.  On the front side, the Home button is traditionally located in which a <span>fingerprint scanner is</span> now installed <span>.</span>  In the upper part above the screen, a front camera is installed.  It is a black dot on a white background. </p><p>  On the back in the upper left corner is the main camera.  On the upper edge you can see the power button.  Symmetrically relative to it is a headphone jack.  Near the start button on the right edge there are <span>volume controls.</span>  They are a double key. </p><p>  There are Apple iPad Air models, the technical characteristics of which allow the installation of a SIM card.  The connector is installed on the right edge and is a slot that opens with a special clip. </p><p>  In the lower rib in the center is a jack for connecting a cable.  Holes for speakers are visible on either side of it.  There are also two of them in this model. </p><h2>  Finger scan </h2><p>  A new feature allows you to personalize the device.  Almost every important action, such as changing settings and buying in online stores, can be configured with confirmation via a fingerprint.  This innovation allows you to significantly protect user data, even if other people take control of the device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="apple ipad air specifications" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22199/531989.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The function is clear and works correctly.  Sometimes there are errors, and you have to repeat the scan again, but this rarely happens. </p><h2>  Interesting features </h2><p>  Now all Apple devices have full synchronization via the ‚ÄúHandoff‚Äù and ‚ÄúContinuity‚Äù functions.  They allow you to receive calls on the tablet when it is in your hands, and the phone is in another room on the table.  Also, when working with documents or mail, you can at any time switch from using the tablet to the iMac.  Of course, this is possible only with the use of devices of this brand, as well as their proprietary software. </p><h2>  Generalized characteristics </h2><p>  The company is constantly improving its tablets.  They have exceptional user features, making them the most ergonomic.  Some users can not resist and <span>compare the iPad</span> Air 2 with competitors in the market for such devices.  However, it should be borne in mind that the main desire of Apple is, first of all, usability and aesthetics of the device.  In addition, not all manufacturers use aluminum for the manufacture of enclosures. </p><p>  From this we can conclude that tablets of this brand should be assigned to a separate class of devices that need to be evaluated using completely different criteria than the others. </p>
