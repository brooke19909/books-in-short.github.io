  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sparks outlet: causes and solutions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  How often do you hear a crack or a spark when plugging in the plug?  It can be assumed that a couple of times you still witnessed this phenomenon.  Sparkling outlets are perhaps the most common electrical problem in the home.  Why is this happening and how dangerous?  Let's figure it out. </p><h2>  Why is this happening </h2><p>  Why does the outlet sparkle?  It is impossible to name the only reason why this happens.  But what factors would not affect the operation of the outlet, it always sparks due to the passage of current between the contacts through the air (you can compare this with lightning).  The farther the contacts are from each other or the more obstacles arise between them, the greater the likelihood of sparking and damage due to overheating or fire. </p><p>  Next, we will consider some of the most popular reasons why the outlet sparks and try to deal with them.  Remember that failure must not be ignored!  If you notice problems with the outlet, immediately take care of fixing them.  Timely eliminated damage will save the device, electrical appliances and, of course, nerves and health! </p><h2>  Inconsistency </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.caravanim.co.il" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="why sparks outlet" class="if uuid-2776821" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45880/2776821.jpg"></div><p>  Sometimes when you turn on the plug, the outlet sparks due to differences in standards - Soviet and European.  They consist in a different section of the electrodes.  The run between them causes a large distance between the contacts, which provokes a flash. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Usually, problems arise when connecting Soviet devices to a European standard device.  Check: Does the socket spark when working with more modern devices?  If the answer is no - no doubt remains, the whole point is the difference between the electrodes of the plug and the socket.  To avoid problems, replace the device or purchase a special adapter. </p><h2>  Poor build </h2><p>  The second, and no less popular reason why the plug sparks in the outlet is the low quality of the fittings.  Remember where you purchased the device, how much it cost and could it not be a cheap Chinese fake? </p><p>  Cheap sockets are usually assembled from soft plastic, which does not allow tightening all the parts tightly.  Saving on metal leads to the fact that the parts are too thin or short, because of which the distance between the parts of the contacts often exceeds the permissible.  The solution in this case is only one: to change the outlet to products from a well-known and reputable manufacturer. </p><h2>  It's not about the outlet </h2><p>  Sometimes the outlet sparks not at all through its fault.  The reason for this may be the deterioration of the wiring in the house.  Old wiring just can not cope with the supply of energy for powerful electrical appliances.  Increased current loads, which the wiring can not cope with, lead to the fact that when you turn on the microwave or washing machine, the socket begins to sparkle.  Think about how long you changed your wiring? </p><p>  If the wires in the house are worn out, the sparking of the outlet is an important signal to the one to which you need to listen. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.sokanu.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="spark plug in socket" class="if uuid-2776822" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45880/2776822.jpg"></div><p>  If the wiring is new, and the socket still sparkles - then there may be a mistake in the assembly and connection.  Invite a wizard to check your wiring and be able to give troubleshooting instructions. </p><p>  Another reason why a working outlet sparks is inattention when buying new devices.  Each appliance has a letter marking showing the maximum current load in amperes.  Sometimes the equipment overheats and sparks due to a mismatch between the maximum allowable load and the capabilities of the outlet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yesterdaysthimble.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://yesterdaysthimble.com/articles/sewing-room-safety-14-tips/"><img itemprop="image" alt="spark plugs when turned on" class="if uuid-2776819" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45880/2776819.jpg"></div><p>  Network congestion can occur due to the many devices connected to the network.  The point here is not in the wires and not in the socket.  Keep track of the amount of equipment working at the same time and avoid overloading. </p><h2>  Weak clamps </h2><p>  Sometimes sockets sparkle when plugged into a network of electrical appliances for a completely harmless reason - for example, the screws holding the case loosen or loosen.  The result is poor contact between the electrodes, and, as a result, sparking. </p><p>  To avoid problems, tighten outlets several times a year and check if the threads are broken. </p><h2>  Cleanliness is the key to health </h2><p>  Dust has not benefited anyone else.  Dust breaks the contacts in the outlet and leads to sparking and even shorting of wires.  The same goes for moisture and getting foreign objects into the outlet.  In damp rooms it is recommended to use special moisture-proof devices.  If you have a small child - make sure that he never plays with the outlet and does not put other objects inside it.  Explain to your child how the current works and what can be dangerous playing with it.  If the child is very small, it is recommended to install special protective mechanisms on the socket body. </p><p>  Keep a clean outlet and do not allow objects to enter it. </p><h2>  <span>How to avoid problems?</span> </h2><div class="photo" data-original="home.howstuffworks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rosette sparks causes" class="if uuid-2776839" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45880/2776839.jpg"></div><p>  If you immediately notice the sparking of the outlet and eliminate the cause of this behavior, you can avoid many problems.  Often sparking outlets are an important symptom that signals much greater wiring problems.  But it is much easier to carry out preventive measures than to repair when the problems have already begun. </p><p>  To prevent problems with the outlet, follow a few simple rules: </p><ul><li>  At least once a year, inspect the wiring and sockets; </li><li>  Before removing the plug from the outlet - disconnect the appliance with the button provided on its body; </li><li>  Install a circuit breaker.  It will prevent current overloads and save power and equipment; </li><li>  Use only compatible outlets and electrical appliances; </li><li>  Do not place outlets in dusty or damp areas.  In the case where this is unavoidable, monitor the condition of the wiring and install special protective devices. </li></ul><p>  As you can see, the prevention of problems with the outlet is not difficult and accessible even to a person who is not versed in electronics. </p><h2>  What is dangerous </h2><div class="photo" data-original="home.howstuffworks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sparks when plug is turned on" class="if uuid-2776836" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45880/2776836.jpg"></div><p>  There are many reasons why the outlet sparkles.  Therefore, such problems with wiring are a frequent occurrence in everyday life.  But this is not a reason to think that this is the norm.  If wiring problems are found, they should be fixed as soon as possible.  Do not jeopardize electrical appliances and your health! </p><p>  Sparking outlets can result in damage to appliances, burning out of outlets, and even fire.  Is it worth mentioning that a person using faulty sockets exposes himself to the danger of electric shock every time! </p>
