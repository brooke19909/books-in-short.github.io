Antenna Tuner</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Nowadays, radio waves have ceased to be something unknown.  Hams began to appear everywhere.  A device such as an antenna analyzer is directly involved in their work or passion.  What it is, what types of it exist and how it works, will be discussed in this article below. </p><h2>  RigExpert Analyzer </h2><p>  There are many different models, however, only some of them will be considered in the article.  One of the multifunctional devices is the RigExpert AA 600. The purpose of this device is to configure, check and repair antennas, as well as antenna-feeder paths.  The key indicators of this device are the SWR - standing wave coefficient - and impedance.  Both of these features are graphically displayed on this unit. </p><p>  In addition, there are additional features such as graph memory, a computer connection, and measurement modes that are convenient in terms of use.  All this makes the RigExpert AA 600 model quite acceptable for use by both professionals and amateurs.  Also, this device has two more distinctive measurement modes that distinguish it from the total mass, these are MultiKSV ‚Ñ¢ and SWR2Air ‚Ñ¢.  In order to make it much easier to find any faults on cable lines, this antenna analyzer has a built-in mode for analyzing heterogeneities along the transmission line. </p>

    <h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The <span data-mce-mark="1">RigExpert</span> antenna <span data-mce-mark="1">tuner</span> has the following technical parameters: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  The frequency range of the device is from 0.1 to 600 MHz. </li><li>  The resolution or frequency input frequency for this device is 1 kHz. </li><li>  This device can be measured in systems with a resistance of 25, 50, 75, 100 Ohms. </li><li>  The range of measurement of the standing wave coefficient (SWR) in numerical values ‚Äã‚Äãis from 1 to 100, and in graphic mode from 1 to 10. </li><li>  The VSWR is displayed as a filled bar or as a digital display. </li><li>  There is the possibility of optional calibration in the graphic mode of the SWR, as well as on the R, X and Smith pie chart. </li></ul><p>  Power for this model can be carried out from the following sources: </p><ol><li>  Alkaline batteries in the amount of 3 pieces with a voltage of each 1.5 V. The standard size for these batteries is AA. </li><li>  There are also 3 pieces of nickel-metal hydride batteries, each of which has a voltage of 1.2V, and a capacity of 1800 to 3000 mAh. </li></ol><p>  The operating time of this model is a maximum of 3 hours in continuous measurement mode or two days if the device is in "standby" mode.  These time periods are suitable for freshly charged batteries. </p><h2>  Precautionary measures </h2><p>  There are several rules that must be followed when using this antenna analyzer. </p><ol><li>  It is strictly forbidden to take any measurements or simply connect the device to the antenna during a thunderstorm.  Lightning strikes, as well as the static voltage that accumulates in the antenna, are deadly to humans. </li><li>  Do not leave the device connected to the antenna after the work has been completed.  A thunderstorm shock or another nearby transmitter may damage it. </li><li>  It is forbidden to send signals with a high frequency to the input of the device, as well as turn on the transmitter if there is already another working radio wave transmitter nearby. </li><li>  Before connecting, ground the cable.  This is divided in order to avoid electric shock from the statistical discharge of electricity present in the cable. </li><li>  It is not recommended to leave the device for tuning the antennas turned on if all the necessary measurements are made.  This will interfere with nearby transmitters. </li></ol>

The device is portable, and it is located in a case that is made of shockproof plastic.  The model has wide capabilities that will suit both professionals and amateurs.  The AA-330M antenna analyzer is equipped with an interface that allows you to communicate with a computer, and also has software, which further expands the possibilities for studying the characteristics of various antennas.  This model can work in automatic mode, in which it will scan the selected frequency range.  It can also work in manual mode, in which it has a convenient step-by-step encoder, which, in turn, has a button function, so that it is possible to select parameters faster and more convenient. </p>

    <h2>  Device features </h2><p>  The model has a wide range of diverse features.  During measurements, the device‚Äôs screen displays parameters such as SWR, frequency, active and reactive component of resistance, as well as the sign of reactivity.  At the same time, all graphs that can be saved at the moment will be displayed on the computer screen.  This function is very convenient, since these graphs can be called up in the future to analyze simultaneously with new measurements from other antennas.  Thus, it is possible to compare the performance of new antennas with old ones that were long ago dismantled.  Another very convenient feature is the automatic detection of the resonant frequency by the device during scanning of the selected range.  This saves a lot of time and also reduces the effort required to tune the antenna.  When rotating the handle of the encoder, it is possible to scan all frequencies in increments of 1, 10, 100, 250 KHz. </p><h2>  AA-330M model functions </h2><p>  The AA-330M model has the ability to work as a sinusoidal current generator, which generates a signal level at the output of 1.4 V. There is also the possibility of tuning the step at 1, 10, 100, 250 KHz.  Another function of the device is the ability to work with two different feeder lines - 50 and 75 Ohms.  For this, the device has two different measuring bridges.  The device is equipped with a function to turn off the backlight on the screen.  This action is used when using the device in "field" conditions and makes it possible to increase the analyzer runtime by about 30%.  There is also another function that allows you to record all the data obtained after scanning to the volatile memory of the device.  There is the possibility of subsequent output of the recorded data to the monitor screen, and the graphs are saved when the device is turned off.  The accuracy and reliability of this device have been tested on numerous experiences with R-SQUAD antennas. </p>

    <p>  It is also important to note that the antenna-feeder system consists of two components - this is the antenna system, as well as the feeder path.  In turn, the first of these two elements will include eight different emitters, as well as one power divider, which distributes it in eight different directions.  And the feeder system includes such components as four directional couplers, as well as two coaxial connecting cables that absorb loads. </p><h2>  SWR value </h2><p>  At present, SWR meters are quite common and widely used.  The value of these devices is great, in addition, the measurement of SWR, that is, the standing wave coefficient, is widely used in antenna analyzers.  However, despite the significant role of this equipment, few people know for sure what all the same measures such an SWR meter separately or built into the analyzer.  It is well known that the standing wave coefficient in the feeder is determined by two parameters.  These include the input impedance of the antenna and the impedance of the feeder.  It is also important to note that in the practical part most often the measurement of these indicators must be carried out at a small distance from the antenna itself.  Most often, such a place is a transceiver. </p><h2>  How to set up TV </h2><p>  In order to set up MTS TV, there are two ways.  One of them is pretty simple.  It consists in purchasing the recommended kit with a multimedia console.  The advantage of this method is that in this set all channels will already be configured.  However, when using the MTS TV CAM module, Verimatrix will have to configure all channels on its own.  In order to do this, one can use the lists of transponders distributed on the Internet, as well as the frequency ranges that accompany them.  To search for the required frequencies and their settings, you can also use the antenna analyzers described above. </p>
