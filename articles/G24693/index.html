    <p>  Appearance Micromax X352 is quite ordinary.  The design, even by the standards of cell phones, is outdated and not the most attractive.  However, the mediocre appearance is fully compensated by the presence of two card slots. </p><p>  The Micromax X352 is pretty easy to use.  This is facilitated by the small size of the device, only 125 by 56 millimeters.  The thickness of the mobile is also small and is only 16 mm.  A little confused by the weight of the device.  The device with its small dimensions has as much as 136 grams.  Of course, tangible weight does not affect work, but with prolonged use it is still noticeable. </p><p>  The device is made of plastic of fairly decent quality.  Naturally, this did not save the device from the appearance of small scratches.  Although the choice of material is not the most successful, this did not affect the quality of the assembly.  The device has almost no gaps and, accordingly, creaks, too. </p><p>  External elements are quite familiar and not surprising.  The small screen, numeric keypad, company logo, as well as the earpiece are located on the front side.  The headset jack, the USB socket and the microphone are ‚Äúsheltered‚Äù at the bottom.  The back side was taken under the speaker, the main camera and, of course, the company logo. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The device is made in several color variations.  This definitely improves the impression of an inconspicuous design.  The gray color gives the device greater solidity.  However, for the most part, the device is found in white. </p><p>  Design is definitely not the strongest side, but you don‚Äôt have to wait for anything more from a cellular budget employee.  All advantages are hidden inside the device. </p><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  The Micromax X352 mobile phone received a 0.3 megapixel sensor.  For the device released in 2014, this is a very bad feature.  A similar camera was relevant back in 2004, but certainly not on a modern device. </p><p>  The matrix has a resolution of 640 by 480 pixels, which is standard for such an ‚Äúeye‚Äù.  There is no talk about the quality of the images.  The image is grainy, with a lot of noise and low detail.  Perhaps the manufacturer should have completely abandoned the camera. </p><p>  The device lacks additional features and settings.  Also there is no possibility of recording videos.  This is not at all surprising with such a camera. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  Got a Micromax X352 2.8-inch screen.  Against the background of advanced smartphones, this parameter looks wretched, but for a push-button device, the diagonal is the most suitable. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Not surprising and 320 by 240 pixels of resolution.  Even with a glance, the cubes are detected on the Micromax X352's display.  The screen quality is enough for normal work with calls and SMS, but the pictures do not look the best way. </p><p>  As with most button devices, a TFT matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãused here.  The old technology provides the phone with acceptable brightness, but it doesn‚Äôt work well in the sun.  Also lame and viewing angles.  With a slight tilt of the phone, the image is noticeably distorted. </p><p>  The number of colors is only 65 thousand.  It is strange to see such a low figure on a modern device.  <span>Older phones</span> had even more colors. </p><p>  In general, the screen was not the most successful, even for a simple cellular.  Surprisingly, the manufacturer did not bother to improve this feature.  Unfortunately, the user will have to put up with the old matrix and low pixel count. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2>

    <p>  The Micromax X352 cell phone also has strengths.  One of them is an excellent battery.  Many companies produce push-button devices with a powerful battery, this trend is not spared Micromax. </p><p>  The phone received as much as 3000 maH capacity.  For a low-functional and frankly weak device, this is an impressive indicator.  Duration of use for calls is 11 hours.  Most of the charge is spent on communication and screen operation.  The manufacturer said that in passive mode the device is able to survive 700 hours.  Given the battery capacity, this is entirely possible. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  An interesting point is the ability of the phone to charge other devices.  Thus, you can use the device not only as an additional means of communication, but also as a battery.  Unfortunately, the user needs to buy an adapter for connection, because it is not provided in the package. </p><h2>  Communication </h2>

    <p>  The Micromax X352 works in a standard GSM network with a frequency of 1800 and 900. A nice feature was the ability to install two SIM cards.  The brainchild of the company is an excellent "dialer" with all the necessary functions. </p><p>  Naturally, you can‚Äôt count on the simultaneous operation of two cards.  The phone has only one radio module, so when you call, the second SIM goes into standby mode. </p><p>  In addition to standard communication, it is possible to transfer data via USB and Bluetooth.  There is also a GPRS connection.  Functions such as Wi-Fi or navigation are not provided in the device. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  The manufacturer was not stingy with installing as many as 8 gigabytes of native memory in the X352.  This solution allows you to use the phone as a player.  There is also the possibility of expanding the volume due to the flash drive up to 8 GB. </p><p>  The phone book is designed for only 500 numbers.  Naturally, this should be enough for any user.  Messages are also limited, only 200 SMS can be stored in the device at a time. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  All specs hint at the budget of the Micromax X352.  A price review will delight customers with its affordability and democracy.  The cost ranges from 1500 to 2400 rubles.  For a good "dialer" a very attractive price. </p><h2>  games and applications </h2><p>  There is a pretty significant problem with the Micromax X352.  Games and applications are completely missing for the phone.  The reason for this was the use of the manufacturer‚Äôs own system.  Perhaps a similar flaw will be fixed, but for now, users will be forced to dispense with standard applications. </p><h2>  Functionality </h2><p>  The device has all the most necessary features.  The owner will be able to play music through the player or start the FM player without any problems.  There is also a voice recorder with excellent recording quality. </p><p>  The phone is also capable of processing some text files.  Most documents will need to be converted to TXT format, but these are minor inconveniences. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2>

    <p>  The kit with the X352 comes with an instruction manual, headset, adapter, USB cable and battery.  Most likely, you need a cover to protect the device from scratches.

    <p>  Duration of work is one of the most noticeable qualities of the Micromax X352.  Reviews report a high autonomy of the device, which is important for ordinary ‚Äúdialers‚Äù.  Large battery capacity stands out even among competitors. </p><p>  Users did not ignore the amount of memory.  As many as 8 gigabytes look impressive even against the backdrop of modern devices.  Adds attractiveness and the ability to install flash drives.  Although the phone can only work with a card of 8 GB, this is absolutely enough for all the needs of the user. </p><p>  The device attracted most of the owners with two connectors for SIM cards.  Together with high autonomy, this feature makes the device an excellent choice. </p><p>  Low cost also did not go unnoticed.  It is difficult to find a similar Micromax X352 in terms of features and price of the device. </p><p>  An interesting feature was the ability to use the phone as an additional battery.  Given the 3000 mAH battery, the device will be a good replacement for Power Bank. </p><p>  A good addition was the ability to use Micromax as a player.  Of course, the headset needs to be replaced, but these are trifles, the main thing is a large amount of memory. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  There are also noticeable shortcomings in the Micromax X352.  Reviews report problems with the microphone.  Perhaps this is a factory defect, but in some devices a very weak microphone.  You can solve the problem by replacing the microphone or removing part of the plastic near it. </p><p>  A noticeable drawback was the weak software support.  Only standard applications are available to users. </p><p>  Causes confusion and the presence of a weak camera.  For cellular, this function is not the most important, but why install 0.3 megapixels is absolutely not clear. </p><p>  Users also complain about system flaws.  In some cases, the phone lives its own life, and the problem is solved only by replacing the firmware. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  Without a doubt, X352 is a good choice as a device for calls.  There are drawbacks, but compared with the positive qualities, they are insignificant. </p>
