Refinancing rate of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation - the interest rate in the calculation of one calendar year, which is subject to reimbursement by credit organizations for the loan.  This value is subject to constant adjustment depending on the situation on the country's money market, as well as on inflation and gross domestic product.  This is the main instrument of macroeconomic regulation in the state. </p><h2>  Central Bank Tasks for Inflation </h2><p>  The task of the Central Bank of the country is to maintain a constant balance with the help of this indicator.  Too high a value will undoubtedly stop the jump in prices, but at the same time slow down financial growth.  Conversely, too low indicators will help saturate the economy with a lot of cheap money, but at the same time inflation becomes dangerously uncontrolled, which will inevitably lead to a change in the strategic planning model. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Central Bank of the Russian Federation Moscow" class="if" height="262" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38669/960204.jpg" width="600"></div>

Data can both attract and push off a potentially interested company.  It is one thing when you can always count on the help of the country's banking system.  And quite another - when for investment you need to use only your own funds.  Risks grow accordingly. </p><h2>  Discount rates in the world </h2><p>  Currently, the refinancing discount rate set by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation is eleven percent per annum. </p><p>  This is not the lowest rate in the world.  So, the discount rate up to two percent is fixed by financial institutions of Denmark, Norway, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Japan, Great Britain, the Eurozone and the USA. </p><p>  In banks in Switzerland and Sweden, the key indicator is generally negative.  These innovations are associated with almost zero inflation in countries.  Export volumes have been catastrophically reduced for a long time, which created a serious risk of cheaper national currencies - the Swiss franc and the Swedish krona.  Also, this often led to a decrease in the interests of potential investors. </p><p>  A negative discount rate implies that the country's institutions pay the Central Bank for storage services in its depositories.  Developed countries are seriously considering the introduction of this innovation for the contributions of individuals. </p><h2>  The discount rate of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation during the activity </h2><p>  The refinancing rate of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation seriously fluctuated depending on the processes taking place in the country. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Since the formation of the new state, this indicator has changed significantly, sometimes several times a week. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Central Bank of the Russian Federation Moscow" class="if" height="291" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38669/960202.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Until 2003, it exceeded the value of twenty percent.  The refinancing rate of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation in different periods reached two hundred and ten percent (in 1994, the value lasted until the end of April next year).  In general, from June 1993 to July 1996, the value exceeded one hundred percent per annum.  The coordinated efforts of the government and bankers allowed to gradually calm down the financial storm.  And in June 1997, the value reached quite acceptable twenty-one percent.  But a crisis erupted, and the default following these events repeatedly repeatedly strongly pushed the value up to one hundred and fifty percent.  This indicator was recorded on May 27, 1998.  But a week later he dropped to sixty. </p><p>  From January 2004 to this day, the country's main indicator has not exceeded fifteen percent. </p><p>  On June 1, 2010, a record was set, which was set by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation - the rate was only seven point seventy-five hundredths of a percent. </p><h2>  Issue of money </h2><p>  One of the most important functions that the Central Bank of the Russian Federation implements is the issue of money - the release of funds into circulation, which increase their total mass. </p><p>  The main institution‚Äôs tasks in this area are control over the amount of money in circulation, the exchange of unusable (dilapidated) banknotes, as well as the timely change in the design of banknotes to effectively counter counterfeiters. </p><p>  It is difficult to overestimate this function of the Central Bank, because the ruble is the only possible means of payment in the country. </p><p>  Money is issued in cash and non-cash. </p><p>  The Russian currency is not backed by valuable metals, and also does not have other equivalence ratios. </p><h2>  Issue of cash ruble </h2><p>  Cash paper money represents denominations of five to five thousand rubles.  They have all the necessary modern protective equipment - watermarks, protective thread, patterns of thin lines, microtext, fibers glowing in ultraviolet radiation, denomination with metallic paint, relief elements, color shades that change depending on the viewing angle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="activities of the central bank of the russian federation" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38669/960193.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The minimum denomination of a coin issued by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation is one penny.  The maximum is ten rubles. </p><p>  They are minted at the Moscow and St. Petersburg mints from metals and alloys such as cupronickel, steel, copper, zinc, nickel, and brass. </p><h2>  Issue of non-cash money </h2><p>  This form of issue is the basis of non-cash accounts.  The aim is to satisfy the necessary needs of market participants in working capital.  Often the capital of the organization is not enough to perform a certain function.  In some circumstances, additional money may be issued to complete the financial task.  The process operates on the basis of a bank (deposit) multiplier. </p><p>  This is a unique method, since the issue of electronic money, along with the Central Bank, can be carried out by banking institutions and even credit organizations.  Of course, under the strict supervision of the supervisor. </p><p>  It is extremely difficult to abuse the process, because such an issue is made solely for the purpose of lending to a market economy. </p><h2>  Bank of banks </h2><p>  The Central Bank of the Russian Federation performs a supervisory function over the entire banking system. </p><p>  First of all, it is the issue of licenses.  And subsequently - constant control over the activities of a business entity, its liquidity.  If necessary, recovery is practiced by introducing a curator.  The deprivation of the right to conduct foreign exchange activities or the complete cancellation of a banking license is carried out in case of impossibility to work in the financial market. </p><p>  The Central Bank creates a favorable environment for the functioning of credit institutions, regulates <span>cash flows</span> and provides loans. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  <span>The activities of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation</span> is an important component of the domestic economy.  It is designed to maintain the financial stability of the country, using a wide range of opportunities for this. </p>
