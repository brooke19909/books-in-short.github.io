They offer traders the opportunity to conduct exchange transactions in the financial markets: Forex, stock and commodity markets, binary options.  The latter, due to a simpler algorithm for making and maintaining transactions, have become especially popular.  Olympus Trade, Binomo, IQ-option, Binex and others are widely known today, and their services are the reason for the persistent dialogue about the possibility of such earnings.  And how to make money on Olympus Trade and other options without risk, you need to understand in detail. </p><h2>  The basis of earning options </h2><p>  A binary option is a stock exchange investment product that allows you to increase your capital.  In countries with well-developed financial markets, options have become auxiliary tools for large companies to function.  They hedge risks and implement a more competent and reliable financial policy.  An option is a product that reflects the direction of analytics.  Wanting to capitalize on the growth of quotes, the trader buys the call option, and waiting for it to fall, he buys put. </p>

    <p>  Such a transaction is limited in time, that is, it has its own expiration period.  Then the position will be closed and profit will be paid if the forecast was correct.  An error in forecasting will lead to the loss of the amount by which the option was purchased.  Knowing this principle, it becomes clear how to make money on Olympus Trade.  To do this, you need to take an option on any financial instrument and analyze its behavior.  Expecting a price increase, you should buy a call option, predicting a decline in quotes - buy put (that is, sell). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By the way, the Olympus Trade interface does not have a hint of established terminology, which is probably a way to be closer to the client, who does not know anything about the functioning of the options market.  Probably, the company simply did not want to destroy the patterns in the minds of their customers, and therefore they did not want to explain to their novice traders that any option transaction is always a purchase.  It lasts for some time, and after expiration the broker will accrue profit or record a loss. </p><h2>  Conclusions from Olimp Trade customer reviews </h2><p>  Before registering a trading account, you should correctly understand whether it is realistic to make money on Olymp Trade.  Since binary options are time-tested financial instruments that rely on a significant part of the economies of countries with developed financial markets, there is no doubt in their reliability.  The same should be said about the Olympus Trade broker, and reviews cannot and should not refute this, since the positive ones were written by the marketing department team, and the negative ones were ejected by offended incompetent customers. </p>

    <p>  Perhaps many loser traders have a different opinion, but, as published on the website of the independent regulator The Financial Commission, the broker is distinguished by high transparency of accounting and excellent transaction execution speed.  Olymp Trade is also regulated by the nonprofit private organization CRFIN, which, of course, does not guarantee reliability, but it has its own weight.  So, if everything is transparent from the legal side of the broker, but technically excellent, then the service itself should be considered very good.  In broker reviews, this is usually not emphasized, which again indicates the illiteracy of the customer audience. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What is good about Olymp Trade? </h2><p>  A broker really helps to earn a disciplined trader who understands his rules of money management.  Trading operations of such a user will give profit without the risk of losing the initial deposit.  However, this means that you need to come to the broker with a solid store of knowledge and a refined strategy, supported by reinforced concrete rules for managing your account.  A trader should clearly understand the current market situation and rely only on his analytical system, concluding transactions of a fixed volume. </p>

    <p>  This tactic has a mathematical advantage, but is practiced by units of successful option traders.  And the vast majority of beginners cannot synthesize their <span>trading strategy,</span> since they come to a broker without knowledge.  At such a moment, a customer acquisition strategy and marketing are included.  But this Olymp Trade strongly sins: the client is imposed on trading strategies with an unfixed transaction volume that does not have a formal substantiation of entry points.  Moreover, it is presented in the most destructive form, and legal tricks become the protection of the broker. </p><h2>  One of the dark sides of Olymp Trade </h2><p>  As part of the advertising campaign, the broker publishes videos of supposedly real trading sessions, where, thanks to the use of any of the described tactics, a significant amount is earned quickly and without mental stress.  The idea is imposed on this new client that you don‚Äôt have to learn the trading profession, as it‚Äôs enough to look at the chart and use the doubling system for losing trades. </p><p>  With these examples, the broker dispels the beginner's doubts and shows whether it is possible to make money on Olympus Trade.  However, the client is given a hint in advance that there is a certain simple trading tactic, which is often described by bribery bloggers.  In fact, at the stage of familiarization, it gives fruit, since at the first trading sessions, newcomers are not particularly aggressive in buying options.  And at first they can earn, gaining confidence in the effectiveness of the strategy. </p><p>  However, one should understand the motives of a broker who provides a certain strategy.  And for this you need to figure out how Olymp Trade itself makes money.  This company is a typical representative of the so-called "kitchen".  Of course, there is nothing wrong with such a positioning of services with a clean track record, but the trader‚Äôs profit is a loss to Olymp Trade, and the loss of a client is the company's profit. </p><p>  This means that it is beneficial for a broker to keep many unprofitable customers, for which a system that has been tried and tested by roulette services is best suited.  This is a martingale - a strategy for doubling bets after losing.  To understand whether it is possible to make money on Olympus Trade using such a strategy, it is important to highlight its negative side.  It is inefficient at a distance, because due to non-compliance with simple rules of money management and the lack of control over losses in the wake of excitement, a significant part or all of the deposit is lost. </p>

    <p>  It is to the gambling of trade that Olymp Trade itself is pushing, moreover, directly and indirectly.  Directly - when a newcomer goes through training, and indirectly - working with bloggers and creating online images of financially successful people who trade with Olympus.  Of course, these persons do not earn as much as indicated.  They demonstrate through video demonstration the effectiveness of the strategy of doubling bets.  But the beginner should understand that such videos can not be recorded the first time. </p><p>  The client may be lucky, but a competent person will not build a system of earnings only on luck and using <span>a betting system that</span> does not have a mathematical advantage.  So is it possible to make money on Olympus Trade as shown on the video?  Yes, it is possible, but only a couple of times, because a loss takes a significant part of the deposit, returning which after the loss of already 50% becomes an almost unrealistic task. </p><h2>  The second sin of Olympus Trade </h2><p>  The second sin of the company is hiding information about successful tactics.  Of course, the broker does not need to publish balanced strategies, as anyone will be able to make money on Olympus Trade.  But in order to really teach a client to trade, one should explain simple things about quotes and their dynamics, as well as about financial markets.  This is not done at the company, and this vulnerability is closed by a legal ploy.  As a result, the broker earns more out of ignorance, and the trader would not open most of the transactions and would not lose up to half of his funds, knowing such a trick of the company.  Indeed, half of the trader‚Äôs losses happen in the first days of his real trading. </p><h2>  Conclusions and recommendations to traders </h2><p>  As a conclusion, it should be said that this broker is quite capable of providing high-quality dealing services, because it is really possible to make money on Olymp Trade in unlimited quantities.  But this is available only to a competent trader, who is well in control of his risks and works on large time frames.  By building your system and examining its statistical indicators, you can get significant profit. </p>

    <p>  It should be understood that Olymp Trade makes huge money on the illiterate majority.  And the company will not interfere with a successful trader, even if he takes her profits, because he only earns her miserable crumbs.  And he certainly will not generate technical interference for successful trading.  Otherwise, the formidable regulator will cease membership in the Central Federal Financial Fund, which for a broker with offshore jurisdiction will be the beginning of bankruptcy or a change in legal entity.  Become a reliable disciplined trader with your system of trading and risk management and make a profit, because making money on Olymp Trade is more than realistic.  But not excitement and recklessness, but discipline, cold calculation and strict adherence to strategy points should be your main tools. </p>
