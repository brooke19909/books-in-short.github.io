In 2003, received the Nobel Prize.  And in 1950, in collaboration with the famous scientist Landau, he created a semi-phenomenological theory of superconductivity. </p><h2>  Childhood </h2><p>  Vitaly Ginzburg was born in 1916 in the Moscow family of an engineer Lazar Ginzburg and a doctor Augusta Ginzburg.  At four, she was left without a mother, since she died of typhoid fever.  After such a terrible loss, the younger sister of Augusta, Rose, took up the upbringing of the baby. </p>

    <p>  He spent his early childhood at home, receiving a home education.  All processes and successes were controlled by Father Vitaly.  In 1927 he moved to the fourth grade of a seven-year secondary school.  After graduating in 1931, he entered the factory school. </p><h2>  Further scientific life </h2><p>  In 1938 he graduated from Moscow University, where a young student carefully studied physical and mathematical sciences, after which he entered the <span>graduate school of Moscow State University,</span> where he began to study theoretical physics. </p>

    <p>  Ginzburg Vitaly Lazarevich (whose biography is described in detail in this article) in his <span>scientific work</span> paid great attention to the theory of superfluidity and superconductivity.  And in 1950, together with the famous physicist, Landau put forward the theory of superconductivity. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  He was also able to solve very important issues of quantum electrodynamics.  During the war he made every effort to solve the problems of defense of his state.  In 1940 he advanced the theory of superlight radiation in crystals.  Incredibly smart and inventive person was Vitaly Lazarevich Ginzburg. </p><h2>  Nobel Prize </h2><p>  In 2003, the famous scientist received the Nobel Prize in Physics, together with A. Abrikosov and E. Leggett.  The Ginzburg-Landau theory allowed us to determine some thermodynamic relations and gave an explanation of the behavior of a superconductor in a magnetic field.  Vitaly Ginzburg was the first to determine the crucial role of gamma and X-ray astronomy. </p>

    <p>  He knew in advance about the existence of radio emission, which appears in the outer regions of the solar halo.  He was offered a way to study the near-solar space using special radio sources. </p><p>  According to the Ginzburg-Landau theory, an electron gas in a superconductor is a superfluid liquid flowing through a crystal lattice without signs of resistance at very low temperatures. </p><p>  In addition, he received many <span>awards, prizes</span> and medals not only of Soviet and Russian scale, but also worldwide. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Relation to religion </h2><p>  Vitaly Ginzburg was an atheist, therefore, denied the existence of God.

    <p>  Religious faith implies miracles that do not require a scientific explanation.  The scientist considered astrology a pseudoscience, and horoscopes are just fun and entertainment.  Having read the astrological forecast in the journal, a person can take advantage of the advice presented in it and ruin his life.  The physicist believed that an educated person would not believe in God, since evidence of his existence was not proved.  The same applies to the sanctity of books, which are a historical memo. </p><p>  Vitaliy was an opponent of teaching religious subjects in children's educational institutions.  He considered it a terrible phenomenon when priests came to schools and read Bible passages to children.  Children's education should contribute to the development of logic and the formation of critical thinking. </p><h2>  Main works </h2><p>  Ginzburg Vitaliy, whose contribution to science was invaluable to all mankind, is the author of four hundred articles and ten monographs on theoretical physics, as well as radio astronomy.  In 1940 he advanced the theory of radiation in crystals.  And six years later, together with I. Frank, he invented the theory of transition radiation, which occurs when the boundary of two different media of one particle crosses. </p>

    <p>  In 1950, together with Landau, he became the author of the theory of semi-phenomenological superconductivity.  And in 1958 he created the theory of superfluidity together with L. Pitaevsky. </p><h2>  Social work </h2><p>  Ginzburg Vitaly, whose biography fascinates readers even after the death of a physicist, indicates that the scientist led an active social life.  In 1955, he signed the ‚ÄúLetter of Three Hundred,‚Äù and a year later, a petition directed against articles in the legislation pursuing ‚Äúanti-Soviet propaganda and agitation.‚Äù  He was a member of the commission against the bureaucracy, and was the editor of several scientific journals.  He considered an educated person to be one who had a good grasp of the entire school curriculum taught in secondary schools.  It was for such people that articles were written under the guidance of a physicist. </p><h2>  Several events </h2><p>  Ginzburg Vitaliy (interesting facts describe the personal life of the scientist) was twice married.  The first time was at the graduate of Moscow University, Olga Zamsh, and the second time at the experimental physicist Nina Ermakova.  Had a daughter from her first marriage and two granddaughters. </p><p>  He died on October 8, 2009, at the age of ninety-three years, from heart failure.  He left behind an invaluable contribution to all of humanity.  Vitaly Ginzburg was not only an outstanding theoretical physicist, but also a wonderful person.  He was buried in Moscow at the Novodevichy cemetery. </p>
