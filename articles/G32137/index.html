  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to choose an office space?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Whether it is an individual entrepreneur or the head of an enterprise of a particular business, the first thing to do is to determine the premises or office for carrying out their activities. </p><p>  As a rule, this aspect is considered the most important in private business and the most difficult to solve.  An office for a business in Moscow can be found based on your requests and a certain financial reserve of funds.  Yes, everything is clear with this, however, to improve the workflow, we advise you to buy office chairs.  So, for example, a room or office for a business is characterized by three training options: </p><p>  -Own real estate (apartment, garage, cottage, etc.); </p><p>  rent; </p><p>  -purchase. </p><p>  Regardless of the method you have chosen, it is mandatory to enforce the case that you must obtain the permission of the local administration about the right to use this office for production purposes.  We figured it out, but for the office it‚Äôs not superfluous to buy and <noindex>  <strong><span>office chairs</span></strong> </noindex>  or bar stools depending on the business. </p><p>  To facilitate your path to starting your own business, it is best to choose an office to buy or to rent.  And after that, think about buying bar stools.  Since, permission for these premises is already on hand. </p><p>  The workspace for the business is personal real estate.  This option of registering a personal apartment for the office of your business is used very often in life practice.  But everything has its positive and negative points: </p><p>  1. A private entrepreneur will pay only for utilities. </p><p>  2. Without permission to use the apartment for production purposes, a businessman will not be able to carry out activities.  Therefore, the entrepreneur himself should register at a different address of residence.  Yes, everything is clear with this, but to improve the workflow, we recommend buying, for example, <noindex>  <strong><span>bar chairs</span></strong> </noindex>  . </p><p>  3. In most cases, starting a business in your own apartment will be associated with the redevelopment of rooms.  To do this, you need to go through many instances to obtain permission. </p><p>  If you, as an individual entrepreneur, have significant stocks of cash, then it is most reliable to buy a business premises.  We figured it out, but for such a working space it would not be superfluous to buy office chairs.  In this case, pay attention to: </p><p>  that the price of a room tends to decline.  Provided that you took a loan to purchase an office, you need to be completely sure that your business will allow you to pay it in full and on time; </p><p>  -if you are buying not a new room, but a secondary one, then analyze the expense of funds for its repair and estimate whether this option is profitable; </p><p>  -explore the taxability of this premises and the total amount of its sale; </p><p>  - draw up all documentation in close cooperation with a qualified lawyer. </p></div></article>
