With their help, payment is made for goods and services, as well as support for loved ones.  Sometimes you have to think about how you can transfer money from phone to MTS phone.  Further we will try to answer this question.  Our attention will be presented to all possible popular techniques for solving the problem.  The bulk of the methods allows you to transfer funds between MTS clients.  But we will also get acquainted with the services of other operators. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mts365.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Transfer from MTS to MTS" class="if uuid-2416521" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2416521.jpg"></div><h2>  Transaction Methods </h2><p>  Can I transfer money from an MTS phone?  Yes, but there is no unambiguous algorithm of actions for the implementation of the task.  First you have to decide on the SIM recharge method. </p><p>  At the moment, this can be done: </p><ul><li>  via the USSD command; </li><li>  via SMS request; </li><li>  using the Easy Payment program; </li><li>  by using the official page of MTS or other mobile operators. </li></ul><p>  In the case of transactions only between MTS clients, a person can enable the "Auto payment" option.  With its help, it will be possible to greatly simplify life.  After all, the need to use all other methods of conducting transactions will disappear. </p><h2>  USSD Commands </h2><p>  To transfer money from phone to MTS phone, the subscriber will have to activate the corresponding functions.  For example, by generating a USSD request. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="serfery.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Transfer through &quot;Easy payment&quot;" class="if uuid-2416517" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2416517.jpg"></div><p>  Previously it was proposed to dial * 112 * phone number * transaction_value # on the phone.  By calling this combination, a person could easily share the balance.  But at the moment, this technique does not work. </p><p>  Therefore, you will have to look for other solutions.  There is another USSD request that helps in this situation. </p><p>  In order to transfer money from phone to MTS phone, you need: </p><ol><li>  Dial * 111 * 7 # on the phone. </li><li>  Press the "Call Subscriber" button. </li><li>  Go to the "Direct Transfer" section. </li><li>  Indicate the beneficiary number and payment amount. </li><li>  Confirm transaction. </li></ol><p>  Money will be credited to the specified phone.  Write-off is carried out from the current mobile device. </p><h2>  Help messages </h2><p>  How to transfer money from your MTS phone?  The next popular and convenient method is working with SMS requests. </p><p>  The algorithm for recharging SIM from MTS to MTS will look like this: </p><ol><li>  Open the "Set new message" mode on your mobile device. </li><li>  Write the text of the format "Subscriber Number Payment_ Amount".  You do not need to put quotation marks. </li><li>  Send a message to the number 9060. </li></ol><p>  It remains only to wait.  In a few minutes, a person will share his balance with another MTS subscriber. </p><div class="photo" data-original="serfery.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Auto Payment MTS" class="if uuid-2416519" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2416519.jpg"></div><p>  Similarly, you can share the balance with other mobile operators.  Here are the numbers that accept SMS requests: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  94011 - MegaFon; </li><li>  7878 - Beeline; </li><li>  159 - Tele2. </li></ul><p>  In the case of Beeline, it is necessary to write mts in front of the recipient‚Äôs number, and for Tele2 the inscription mtst is provided. </p><h2>  Self-service menu </h2><p>  We found out how to transfer money to an MTS subscriber from the phone of any other mobile operator.  But often customers need to write off funds with MTS to other companies. </p><p>  To translate ideas into reality, it is recommended to use the self-service functional menu.  This is a fairly long but effective technique. </p><p>  Guidelines for transferring funds from MTS have the following form: </p><ol><li>  Dial * 115 # on the mobile device. </li><li>  Click on the "Call" button. </li><li>  Select the "Reply" function, and then indicate "1" (go to the "Mobile Phone" section). </li><li>  Send a team. </li><li>  Indicate the operator with whom you will have to work further.  To view companies that do not appear on the screen, you will need to send a request with the number "4" ("More"). </li><li>  Enter the number of the recipient. </li><li>  Indicate the option to write off funds.  For example, "Personal Account" or "Bank Card".  In the second case, you will have to specify the details of the plastic. </li><li>  Choose the transfer amount. </li><li>  Confirm the procedure. </li></ol><p>  That's all.  Now you need to wait for the request to be processed, and then rejoice at the result. </p><h2>  Easy Payment and Transactions </h2><p>  How to transfer money to another phone?  MTS offers many solutions to the problem.  In addition to the listed layouts, people can use the "Easy payment" option. </p><div class="photo" data-original="creditsoviets.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Top-up through 900" class="if uuid-2416520" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2416520.jpg"></div><p>  Ideally, act in this way: </p><ol><li>  Download the program for mobile device "Easy payment".  You can find it in the Play Market or APP Store. </li><li>  Go to the appropriate application. </li><li>  Open the "Payment" block. </li><li>  Select "From Mobile Phone Account". </li><li>  Fill out the request form. </li><li>  Submit a processing operation. </li></ol><p>  Similarly, you can use the service "Easy payment" on the Internet.  To do this, go to the page pay.mts.ru. </p><h2>  "Auto payment" and money transfer </h2><p>  MTS has the option "Auto payment".  It is required if a citizen wants to automatically share the balance.  For example, once a week or a month. </p><p>  Activation / deactivation of the service is carried out through special requests.  They are dialed on the device by the sender.  Here are the commands that may be required to resolve the issue: </p><ul><li>  * 114 * recipient_number * 1 * amount # - daily replenishment; </li><li>  * 114 * subscriber * 2 * money # - weekly payment; </li><li>  * 114 * recipient's telephone number * 3 * cash_means # - transaction once a month. </li></ul><p>  After a person sends a command, he will have to confirm the transaction.  A confirmation code will be sent in SMS.  Only after that will the money be debited from Simka. </p><h2>  Operator sites </h2><p>  Another popular trick is working with official websites of mobile operators.  They will help to carry out transfers from SIM to SIM or from bank plastic to a SIM card. </p><p>  Typically, the procedure for working with web portals is reduced to the following steps: </p><ol><li>  Go to the mobile operator‚Äôs page on the network. </li><li>  Selecting the menu item "Payments" or "Transfers". </li><li>  Setting the parameters of money transfers. </li><li>  Confirmation of the procedure. </li></ol><p>  Most often, people use the pages of mobile operators.  For example, beeline.ru or mts.ru. </p><div class="photo" data-original="serfery.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="USSD request for money transfer" class="if uuid-2416522" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2416522.jpg"></div><h2>  Third Party Services </h2><p>  MTS is also offered to transfer money from phone to phone by using third-party web portals.  They help manage the accounts of SIM cards and bank plastics.  At the moment, the network is full of similar resources. </p><p>  However, they do not inspire confidence.  Indeed, among the proposed portals there are many scammers.  Accordingly, this technique is best avoided.  Mobile operators already offer quite a few ways to replenish "SIM cards."  And among the described layouts, you can choose something suitable.  Even a novice client can easily activate the described functions.  A couple of minutes - and it's done! </p>
