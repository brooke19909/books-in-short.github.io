From the second half of spring to the very end of summer, tourists come to Ossetia - lovers of admiring and conquering the peaks.  Even in the capital of the republic is the beautiful Table Mountain, which is also clearly visible in Ingushetia.  Tourists love this peak for many laid and fairly simple routes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="donyfars.livejournal.com" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Table Mountain" class="if uuid-2345479" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2345479.jpg"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The height of the mountain is 3003 meters.  It is located on the border between two republics: Ingushetia and North Ossetia, and is visible from both capitals - Vladikavkaz and Magas.  The emblem of both republics captures this peak.  In good cloudless weather, the mountain can be seen from anywhere in Vladikavkaz. </p><p>  She got the name for her bizarre shape, reminiscent of a huge flat table.  In the Ossetian language there is a different name - Madhokh, which translates as "mother mountain". </p><p>  There are many beautiful grottoes and caves on the mountain, several ancient sanctuaries. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pressa.tv" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mountain view" class="if uuid-2345499" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2345499.jpg"></div><h2>  Legend </h2><p>  There is more than one legend about Table Mountain.  But there is one most popular story that is told to all visitors.  Once upon a time, dragons lived in these places.  On the mountain itself there was a certain principality, which was conquered by one of the dragons.  As a tribute to the animal, the principality annually undertook to give one 16-year-old girl each.  The locals prayed and asked the dragon not to do this again, but he did not hear.  However, it was believed that if there was a brave young girl and voluntarily surrendered to be eaten, the principality would immediately get rid of the dragon. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Naturally, such a brave girl was found.  She was the daughter of a prince and had a magnificent appearance.  Father protected the young princess as best he could, but the day came when it was necessary to pay tribute.  The girl changed into a servant's outfit, hid in the crowd.  And when the dragon came, she threw herself into the mouth of the beast, breathing fire. </p><p>  At that very moment, the dragon issued a terrible roar, caught fire.  After the disappearance of smoke, people saw only the charred body of the dragon.  At this place is now Table Mountain. </p><p>  The story does not end there.  It turns out that a shepherd named Kazbek was secretly in love with the girl.  From the mountain, he watched the sacrificial act of his beloved.  Seeing the petrified body of the young princess, he prayed to the gods, asking them to turn him into a mountain.  Higher powers heard him and fulfilled the request;  thus, the shepherd is now always guarding his beloved. </p><h2>  Mountain climbing </h2><p>  Climbing Table Mountain is possible from the side of Ingushetia, where the access regime for tourists has already been canceled in the Dzheyrakhsky district.  In this case, the ascent begins in the village of Beini.  An ancient road called the Ancestral Trail leads from the settlement.  If you start from Vladikavkaz, you will also have to get to the settlement of Beini.  Today, only 89 people live in the village, and according to local legend, the name translates as “dead soldiers”.  There is a tent camp near the settlement, but it only works during the season, when there is an opportunity to climb the mountain. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fotorelax.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pagan temple" class="if uuid-2345494" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2345494.jpg"></div><h2>  Pagan temple </h2><p>  While climbing the Table Mountain of Vladikavkaz, you can see a unique attraction - the sanctuary of Mjat-Seli. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Ingushetia converted to Islam in the 19th century, but a lot of evidence of ancient beliefs remained on the territory of the republic.  As early as 1925, sacrificial ceremonies were held in this sanctuary.  In the traditions of the people, customs have been preserved to pay tribute to the Water Mother or Hin-Nan.  For example, at a wedding ceremony, you can often see the bride breaking a chicken egg by the stream, it is an old tradition to pay tribute to the Water Mother, so that there is no drought. </p><p>  To the ancient sanctuary rise about 2 hours.  Inside the pagan temple you can sometimes see overnight local shepherds.  In these places, beautiful photos of the Table Mountain of Vladikavkaz are obtained - surrounded by horses and beautiful vegetation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="russiatrek.org" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Table Mountain" class="if uuid-2345501" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2345501.jpg"></div><h2>  "Throne of the Gods" </h2><p>  The sanctuary of Myater Dala is even higher compared to Myat Seli, at an altitude of 2600 meters, so there are fewer tourists in these places.  This is a very poorly preserved building of the pagan sanctuary, the construction of which dates back to the 16th century.  In fact, one entrance has been preserved.  From the remains of the foundation, we can understand that the foundation of the sanctuary was 3.9 X 2.75 meters in size.  The height of the building is about 3 meters.  On the facade there were once deer horns and there was a small hole in front of the entrance.  Inside the sanctuary was only a niche where sacrifices were brought.  Apparently, the roof was gable with seven steps. </p><h2>  Rest for demanding tourists </h2><p>  Great photos of Table Mountain are obtained from the windows of the Armkhi health-improving complex.  It is located in the Dzheyrakh district and can simultaneously accommodate 140 people.  The sanatorium is already known far beyond the borders of Ingushetia and the Caucasus.  People come here not only to treat diseases of the respiratory tract, but also to admire the surrounding beauties. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="42.85335899999999" data-lng="44.716372800000045" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="9"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/1/7/1717.png"></div><p>  The complex has all the conditions for a comfortable stay and treatment.  There is a swimming pool, fitness center, saunas.  The complex has a children's camp, which takes up to 1,500 children in the summer.  And all these amenities are surrounded by forests and ancient monuments of architecture preserved to this day.  The property offers many excursions, including a trip to Table Mountain. </p>
