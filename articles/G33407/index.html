What to see in Cyprus</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Cyprus is one of the most popular holiday destinations.  Every year, millions of tourists from all over the world come here to get acquainted with beautiful sights, swim in the sea and enjoy the indescribable atmosphere of a sea resort. </p><p>  The sun shines here for more than three hundred days a year, and the bathing season lasts almost six months.  Almost the entire industry of the island is aimed specifically at tourists.  A large number of hotels are located here - from hostels to the best five-star hotels.  This resort is suitable for people of any age. </p><p>  By the way, young people prefer to relax closer to Ayia Napa, because here you can "light" from dawn to dusk.  For couples with children it is better to choose Larnaca or Limassol, because in many hotels of these two resorts there are often interesting programs for children and their parents.  But the elderly, as well as natures who want to be alone and calm, prefer to relax in Protaras. </p><p>  It is quite difficult to answer what is more on the island of Cyprus - ancient sights, noisy fun or romance. </p><h2>  Island history </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.independent.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beach in Cyprus" class="if uuid-2299508" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2299508.jpg"></div><p>  The history of this wonderful island began at the very beginning of the appearance of mankind.  It is difficult to answer the question of exactly when he appeared on earth. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Cyprus is considered part of Europe and belongs to several countries at once.  The northern part of the island has been part of Turkey since the 70s of the twentieth century, and the southern part of the island belongs to the Republic of Cyprus.  By the way, since 2004 the island is a member of the European Union. </p><p>  Cyprus is considered one of the largest Mediterranean islands.  The area is about nine thousand square meters, but as you know, in a day it’s quite easy to cross the entire island and see the main attractions. </p><p>  The relief of the island is quite diverse.  There are sandy beaches, rocky hills, as well as wonderful cedar forests.  All this is the very unique Cyprus that will be popular for many years to come. </p><h2>  What to see in Cyprus? </h2><p>  Cyprus is the oldest island, a large number of ruins of ancient structures have been preserved here.  We will tell you about the most interesting sights.  They should be seen by everyone who decided to relax in this sunny state. </p><h2>  Royal tombs </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.historyinanhour.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Royal catacombs" class="if uuid-2299471" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2299471.jpg"></div><p>  In the town of Paphos on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea are the royal tombs.  It is believed that this attraction is one of the most popular.  Many will think that rulers are buried here, but this is not so.  There are no kings here, but there is a local nobility.  Burials appeared here around the fourth century BC. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Until the archaeologists found these <span>royal tombs, the</span> building was destroyed and plundered by people who were looking for treasures.  Only the walls of ancient buildings have survived. </p><h2>  Kolossi Castle </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pizzatravel.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kolossi Castle" class="if uuid-2299474" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2299474.jpg"></div><p>  This building appeared during the times of the knightly orders.  The tower is an example of 12th century architecture.  The building has survived to our time, the interior decoration and thick walls are in fairly good condition.  Travelers have the opportunity to see murals depicting divine scenes. </p><p>  Previously, this building was used as a strategic and defensive. </p><h2>  Kyrenia Castle </h2><div class="photo" data-original="northcyprus.cc" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kirensky castle" class="if uuid-2299479" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2299479.jpg"></div><p>  This castle is located in the northern part of Cyprus.  It was built by the inhabitants of the Byzantine Empire in order to protect against Arab raids. </p><p>  During the reign of the Venetians, its reconstruction was carried out.  In the 15th century, when the Ottoman Empire owned the island, it also fell. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For a long time the castle was used by the Turks as a military base, it lasted until the 19th century. </p><p>  In 1974, the northern part of Cyprus was occupied by Turkish troops, and Kyrenia Castle turned into a museum. </p><h2>  The ghost town of Varosha </h2><p>  The ghost town is located in the northern part of the island of Cyprus.  This place was once considered the best place to visit.  Millions of tourists came here to enjoy the magical atmosphere of relaxation.  Famous Hollywood stars loved to be in this place, among them - Elizabeth Taylor, Bridget Bardot. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Abandoned city" class="if uuid-2299483" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2299483.jpg"></div><p>  In an instant, everything changed.  After the Turkish invasion in 1974, local residents were urgently evacuated.  Everything that was under construction was surrounded by a fence and armed guard was put up. </p><p>  Tourists are still resting here, but all these gloomy-looking houses look completely out of place against the background of the sunny beaches of a magical island. </p><h2>  Paphos Fortress </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.newcyprusmagazine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Castle in Paphos" class="if uuid-2299486" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2299486.jpg"></div><p>  A rather strict architectural structure, built during the reign of Alexander the Great.  Previously, this fortress was considered part of the defensive system.  But the lower floors were used as a prison.  Pretty unusual combination, isn't it? </p><p>  As for the modern appearance, only some parts of the ancient fort have reached us, since the fortress was repeatedly stormed. </p><h2>  The ancient city of Kourion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Antique town Kourion" class="if uuid-2299488" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2299488.jpg"></div><p>  In the 12th century AD, this city was considered the largest on the island of Cyprus.  Only some parts of it have survived to our times. </p><p>  Unfortunately, it happened that in the fourth century BC, Kourion was seriously affected by the earthquake.  Only its ruins have reached us.  As can be seen in the photo posted in the article, columns, Roman inscriptions and drawings with images of animals are preserved here. </p><h2>  Archbishop's Palace </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Archbishop's Palace" class="if uuid-2299492" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2299492.jpg"></div><p>  The building was built in the 20th century, but in such a short time managed to acquire the status of a landmark.  It is located in the central part of the island, in the city of Nicosia. </p><p>  Next to this building is an 18th-century building that was badly damaged during the invasion of the Turkish army in 1974. </p><p>  At the moment, this place is considered the residence of the Cypriot archbishop. </p><h2>  Amatus city </h2><p>  This city is also one of the ancient ancient cities.  It is located very close to Limassol.  Only the remnants of administrative buildings and baths have survived to this day.  According to an ancient myth, the father of Adonis is considered the founder of this amazing area.  It is believed that the spirit of the goddess Aphrodite herself was once present in this territory. </p><h2>  Selimiye Mosque in Nicosia </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.architectural-review.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mosque in Nicosia" class="if uuid-2299501" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2299501.jpg"></div><p>  This mosque is located in the northern part of the island of Cyprus.  The construction has existed for more than fifty years, at different times it had a different status - it was a church, a cathedral and a Gothic temple.  Now in this building is a mosque.  In the architectural style of the building traces of completely different eras are traced.  This does not spoil the building, on the contrary, the attraction looks in a special way. </p><h2>  Catacombs of Saint Solomonia </h2><p>  This area is considered one of the most important shrines of the island of Cyprus.  Here, a Palestinian woman named Solomonia once died.  She and her children were hiding from the persecution of King Antiochus IV.  All sons died with their mother. </p><h2>  The settlement of Hirokiti </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.visitcyprus.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The settlement of Hirokiti" class="if uuid-2299497" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2299497.jpg"></div><p>  An ancient territory that existed in the Neolithic era, that is, about seven thousand years ago.  Included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.  The territory is quite well preserved, because archaeologists managed to find many interesting facts that allow us to draw some conclusions about the life of the island of that time.  Unfortunately, it is still unknown where this settlement came from, who lived in it and where the locals disappeared. </p><h2>  Forty Column Castle </h2><p>  This building appeared here in the 12th century and was used as a defensive system against raids by Arab troops.  This name was given to the ruins due to the fact that the original structure consisted of forty columns.  The castle was completely destroyed by an earthquake.  Only a few towers, catacombs remained.  It is they who are of most interest to archaeologists. </p><h2>  Gate of Famagusta </h2><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gate of Famagusta" class="if uuid-2299504" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2299504.jpg"></div><p>  They were built in the sixteenth century and protected the city of Nicosia from Turkish raids.  They are part of the fortifications of the Venetians.  At the end of the 20th century, the gates were restored.  The area next to them began to be used as a place for lectures and conferences. </p><h2>  The best excursions in Cyprus </h2><p>  The island has a lot of ancient attractions.  But many of them are very far from each other.  If tourists are limited in time and do not know what to see in Cyprus, you should think over the route in advance and make a list of the main points of travel.  About them - later in the article. </p><h2>  Salamis - Famagusta </h2><p>  One of the most interesting excursions.  That's because you will have the opportunity to see the two most famous ancient cities.  One of which is antique, and the other is medieval.  As a bonus - the abandoned city of Varosha. </p><p>  Be sure to bring your passport with you, as you will cross the border and find yourself in another part of the island that belongs to Turkey.  It turns out that this is an excursion to Northern Cyprus. </p><h2>  Gourmet tour </h2><p>  During this excursion in Cyprus you will have the opportunity to visit the village smokehouse.  The island’s most popular delicacies are prepared here.  In addition, you will have the opportunity to see the winery of Cyprus and taste the local delicacies. </p><h2>  Donkey Tour </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.livescience.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Little donkey" class="if uuid-2299493" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2299493.jpg"></div><p>  As you know, a donkey tour in Cyprus is very popular among tourists.  Many enthusiastically speak about her, especially children.  The only thing that upsets is that a burro cannot be taken with you.  They say that the animals are very peaceful and friendly. </p><p>  If you go there with a child, this tour in Cyprus will be one of the best solutions. </p><h2>  Family picnic </h2><p>  If you have already paid off and simply can not live without mountains, you should take an individual tour in Cyprus.  You can visit the local villages, the winery, get a lot of pleasure from the entertainment program for teens and a fun picnic.  For children, a tour in Cyprus will be one of the most memorable.  Amazing nature, amazing landscapes, hospitality of local residents will be remembered for a long time.  Numerous reviews about excursions in Cyprus <span>confirm this.</span> </p><h2>  Excursion "Shrines of Cyprus" </h2><p>  For many tourists, this particular excursion is one of the most interesting.  There are travelers who come here specifically to go to these shrines. </p><p>  During this excursion in Cyprus you can visit most of the holy places of the island. </p><h2>  Cost of excursions </h2><p>  Prices for tours in Cyprus from different tour operators practically do not differ.  About 3500-4200 rubles.  (50-60 euros) per person. </p><p>  As for the cost of excursions in Cyprus of an individual nature, their prices are much higher, from 21,450 rubles.  (300 euros) per person. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Cyprus is one of the fabulous <span>islands of the Mediterranean Sea.</span>  If you can get here, be sure to come, because such a small area has a large number of attractions, and the rest is just wonderful. </p>
