The city got its name from the small river Chur. </p><p>  The first mention dates back to 1032.  Kursk received the status of the city in 1095.  Now it is one of the main cultural and religious centers of the country. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Kursk cannot be called a tourist center of Russia.  But there are many mostly spiritual <span>attractions</span> that are worth visiting. </p><p>  Among them: </p><ul><li>  Ascension Church.  It was built in 1887 at the expense of parishioners.  Later, the building was set aside for Sunday school, and before the Great Patriotic War it was closed. </li><li>  Resurrection-Elias Church.  This building was once owned by a monastery.  And in the middle of the 18th century it began to function as a church.  It is located on the main street of Kursk. </li><li>  Vvedensky temple.  It can be called the main decoration of the old part of the city, it is made in blue and white and merges with the sky. </li><li>  The Znamensky Cathedral is an architectural landmark of the city, it was there that the icon of the Mother of God ‚ÄúThe Sign‚Äù was located. </li><li>  Picture gallery.  The building has a not very attractive facade, which is unlikely to attract tourists.  But inside is a real treasure - paintings by world famous masters. </li><li>  The monument "Date" can be found on Perekalsky Square.  It depicts a young man flying in love. </li><li>  The apple monument was erected 9 years ago; it is located on Lenin Street.  Its height is 2 meters.  The sculpture conveys the outline of the famous Kursk Antonovka. </li><li>  Planetarium.  It was built long ago, so the building is old, but this does not affect the quality of lectures.  Now digital design is used for design. </li><li>  Triumphal Arch.  It was erected 17 years ago in memory of the battle of Kursk. </li></ul><p>  This is not the whole list of interesting places in the city.

    <h2>  History of Red Square.  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  This attraction is located in the city center.  Previously, there were residential buildings and a stone cathedral.  But in the second half of the 18th century there was a fire, all structures were destroyed and razed to the ground.  The buildings did not begin to be restored, and by decree of Catherine II, the main square of the city was built on this place. </p><p>  Not far from here is the park to them.  The 1 of May.  More than two centuries ago, there were ruins of the walls of the fortress and the moat.  The territory was leveled.  The moat fell asleep.  Later, trading shops were set up, where the townspeople bought fish, meat and bread.  A little at a time they sold toilet and household items, textiles and leather goods. </p><p>  In those days, other people came here to see and show themselves, and of course, to get something.  Every year, the Znamenskaya Fair was held on Red Square.  The people were visible and invisible.  A lot of things were bought and sold in the guest yard. </p>

    <h2>  Znamensky Cathedral - the main asset of Red Square </h2><p>  Near this temple, royal parades were organized during the royal birthdays and the days of the Angel.  Almost the entire population of the city gathered for the celebration.  This section of Red Square began to be called Znamensky. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The cathedral was rightly considered the main property of the square.  It was distinguished not only by its beauty, but also by its impressive size.  Neither the hotel nor the club could compare with the grandeur of this architectural monument, creating a contrast.  In the thirties of the last century they wanted to redraw the shrine and make it more Soviet, it was planned to demolish the dome.  But the temple survived, not counting the two bell towers.  It was destroyed later by the Nazis during the Great Patriotic War. </p><p>  Later, the square was supplemented by two worthy beautiful buildings - the Central Hotel and the House of Soviets, which also suffered during the German occupation. </p>

    <h2>  How Red Square Changed </h2><p>  In the second half of the 19th century, the trading part of Red Square was supplemented by bakery rows and other shops.  Before the revolution, there was an abundance of various shops, they were located in stone buildings.  In addition, there were wooden tables with groceries on the street.  There were more than 200 of them. Red Square at that time was more like a market.  Heaps of garbage, straw and manure did not paint it and did not give charm.  There were always crowds and lots of dirt.  Red, that is, a beautiful square at that time was called "bazaar". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  She began to transform in a more cultural direction after the Great October Revolution.  It was the site of rallies and military parades. </p><p>  The article presents photos of the Red Square <span>in Kursk</span> in different historical periods. </p>

    <h2>  Description of Red Square in Kursk </h2><p>  Its length is approximately 300 meters.  Here are located administrative buildings, residential buildings, monuments of V.I.  Lenin and A. Nevsky, Stele of Glory to the Heroes of the Kursk. </p><p>  The only residential building here is building No. 2/4.  It was built in the 60s of the last century on the site of a vacant lot, where circus performers often pitched tents. </p><p>  House number 8 is also quite old.  It was built in the 1960s.  He was called the "House of Communications."  Previously, shopping malls and salt depots were located here, later the Kursk circus building was built on this territory.  It lasted until the Second World War.  During the construction of the communication house, the facade was simplified as much as possible.  In 1998, a symbol of the Kursk Region Center was installed near the building. </p><p>  House 18 (1) faces both Red Square and Gorky Street.  It was built in the classical style in the late 1930s.  He suffered a little during the war, but after the end of hostilities, the restoration returned to its former beauty.  The best architects and sculptors worked on the reconstruction of the House of Soviets, and for good reason.  In the image and likeness of this building, the House of Soviets in Krasnoyarsk was also designed. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Red Square in Kursk where is it" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62859/2087106.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  If you arrived at the Kursk railway station, you should go into the city, cross the station square and find a stop.

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Most tourists rush to see the Red Square in Kursk.  You know where it is, but what you should pay special attention to, now we will tell. </p><p>  Most guides like to show views of Red Square from the bell tower of the Znamensky Cathedral.  The panorama opens, of course, beautiful, but does not cause much delight among tourists.  They note that most of the buildings are partially or completely destroyed.  It really is.  There was a tragedy during the fascist occupation.  After the war they were restored; they do not represent any special historical value. </p><p>  There are many similar structures in other cities that were built or rebuilt in Soviet times. </p><p>  Most tourists recommend paying attention to the Central Hotel.  Its facade gives the area a special charm. </p><p>  Monument V.I.  Mounted on Red Square, Lenin is considered one of the best in the country.  During the fascist occupation, he also suffered.  After the war, it was restored.  It would seem that what certainly cannot surprise a Russian person is a monument to Lenin.  They are in every city.  But according to tourists, this one is special.  But in order to find out how he is so different from others, it is better to look at him with your own eyes. </p>
