Do not rush to check into the first hotel you find, find the site of the hotel you like, make inquiries and, if possible, contact the administrator by phone and consult with him about your questions: how much will it cost to stay, what services are provided for free, how the room is equipped whether there is a bathroom, toilet and shower.

Such information will be considered the most reliable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="2gis.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel rus old oskol rooms" class="if uuid-2789381" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44269/2789381.jpg"></div><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  There are always many vacationers at the Rus Hotel.
