  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cost and income estimates in bb workspace electronic budgeting system</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Estimates are a fairly common term that occurs in various areas of human life, and therefore, even in the field of economic activity has several contexts.  In its most general <span>form, the estimate of</span> expenses and incomes is a calculation, a documented <span>financial plan,</span> on the basis of which an economic entity manages the capital of an enterprise or company.  In addition, the <span>cost</span> and income <span>estimates</span> serve as a necessary tool for controlling the expenditure of financial resources.  Estimates can be drawn up to finance both the projects as a whole and the production of some works, which are separate links or stages of the production process. </p><p>  As a rule, budgeting is the main document of the basic budget of an enterprise or company, therefore, very often in the economic literature and practice the process of budgeting is called budgeting.  In this sense, the estimate of expenses and incomes reflects in detail the entire operational economic activity of the enterprise, company or individual entrepreneur.  At the same time, it shows how rational the work is being done to cover the costs of production activities with the income that an economic entity receives after selling its products. </p><p>  When drafting this document, it is necessary to accurately determine and indicate limits for all major budget-forming areas (items) of income and expenses, correctly identify the sources of reserves and savings, taking into account these indicators, optimize budget parameters with the amount of tax deductions and carry out a rather large list of calculation procedures and analysis.  Of course, that this work is rather laborious, requires a significant expenditure of staff time and multiple checks with the ‚Äúmanual‚Äù budgeting method.  Considering that the ultimate <span>goal of</span> budgeting is to use its indicators to predict the main economic parameters of the enterprise - the cost of production, the values ‚Äã‚Äãof various types of profit, it is easy to imagine how expensive and routine this work can be.  The modern model of economic development involves the widespread introduction of information support systems in the management of enterprises and organizations.  One of such quite demanded resources is the electronic budgeting system.  At the moment, there are several developments from various companies that help to efficiently, quickly and accurately calculate the most complex budget projects and models, as well as simultaneously produce a whole range of procedures to support these projects.  Let's consider some of them. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Budgeting systems bb budget and bb workspace are electronic resources that allow you to record income and expenses of the enterprise.  This software is very easy to use and clearly displays all the directions and articles of the <span>budget plan.</span>  This resource allows you to make changes to this plan almost online, making control operational.  <span>The program interface</span> is a directory tree in which all existing items of expenses and income are displayed with real indicators at a given time.  Operating directly within the framework of all indicators of the financial plan, making any estimates using this resource is not particularly difficult, not to mention the purely technical nuances of this work.  The advantages of this system also lie in the fact that the accountant or other responsible person, using the resources of the personal account of the program, can maintain full control over orders and payments.  In these programs, administration is as close as possible to a paper form of workflow, and therefore will not cause difficulties when transferring employees to work in an electronic environment.  This is very convenient, for example, and in cases where it is necessary to record the income and expenses of the individual entrepreneur, since the system involves completely minimal actions by the administrator. </p><p>  In order to draw up such a document as an estimate of expenses and incomes, the bb workspace budgeting system includes organizational, methodological subsystems and an automated information system for planning support and budget execution control.  It allows you to present information in excel format. </p><p>  The data is then processed by the bb report generator of SQL reports, which, in fact, presents all the data on the planned and actual expenditure of funds in a ready-made form. </p>
