  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to choose a phone</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  About 20 years ago, such a thing as a mobile phone seemed incredible luxury, it was very expensive and, of course, not everyone could afford it.  Over the years, phone models have changed, become more functional, and it seems that now the cell phone has already reached the peak of its development.  On the shelves of the salons of cellular communications there are many models of phones, and at an affordable price.  It would seem - come in and choose, but nevertheless, many still have problems with this. </p><p>  But no matter how the mobile phone industry is developing, it cannot afford to replace landline phones that are not replaceable for business.  After all, you can take a multi-channel PBX to connect <noindex>  <span>landline phone number</span> </noindex>  and no need for 20 managers to buy a separate phone. <br><br>  An important criterion when buying a cell phone is to initially decide what you need to make your choice between several models, and not get lost between numerous gadgets. <br><br>  At first, it might seem that the simplest way is to choose a phone just for calls, without any bells and whistles, but the problem is that such models gradually disappear and various smartphones, iPhones and androids take their place. <br><br>  An important criterion is the presence of a powerful battery, which is well suited for those who like to talk on the phone or those who can not do without listening to music.  By the way, for those who need a phone also and as an MP3 player, the quality of song playback is important.  Especially for music lovers, phones are equipped with a slot for a memory card, which allows you to download a large number of audio recordings. <br><br>  For some people, having a good camera is a necessary feature on their cell phone.  It‚Äôs not difficult to deal with this, because in our time in many phones the quality of the camera is superior to many digital cameras. <br><br>  When choosing a body, it is important to pay attention to your lifestyle.  If you are a busy person, they constantly call you and often have to make calls yourself, then a classic candy bar or a retractable one will do. <br><br>  There are also phones with a qwerty keyboard.  They look very stylish, but to a greater extent suitable for women with long nails, because  Buttons on these phones are very small in size and are located close to each other. <br><br>  If you are a fan of fashion, then a phone with a touch screen is perfect for you.  True, you need to adapt to such a display, if previously you used only phones with buttons.  It is important that the actions of the touch phone satisfy all your requirements, so that operations on it do not occur too quickly or vice versa too slowly. <br><br>  And in conclusion, I want to add that when choosing a phone, you should think about whether synchronization with a computer is possible on it.  This is very important when transferring songs, photos or text files.  For this, many phones have Bluetooth or USB. <br><br>  Now you know how to choose the right mobile phone that really suits you.  It remains only to make a purchase. </p></div></article>
