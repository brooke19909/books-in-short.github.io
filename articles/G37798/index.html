  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Human pressure - norm and deviation options</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In recent years, doctors have been sounding the alarm, as certain diseases are rapidly becoming younger.  Earlier, representatives of the older generation traditionally bothered heart problems and pressure, but today quite young people turn to such complaints to doctors.  Moreover, often a person comes for medical help in the event that the disease has already become part of life.  In order to prevent such a critical situation, it is necessary to know the standard pressure of a person. </p><p>  Human pressure, norm and deviations are purely individual indicators, which are sometimes difficult to calculate.  During a routine examination, the doctor necessarily measures the pressure, hoping to see the cherished 120/80.  These indicators are conventionally considered the norm, but it is advisable to pay attention to the person‚Äôs age, his physical activity and associated diseases.  The fact is that with age, the pressure rises, so for individuals, the norm may be slightly larger.  In children, the indicators should be much lower than in adults, although jumps in pressure are often observed in adolescence.  Only such fluctuations usually pass by the age of eighteen.  If the pressure continues to jump, you should consult a doctor. </p><p>  The doctor will measure the pressure of a person for a certain time.  The norm is approximately 120/80, but the acceptable values ‚Äã‚Äãfor <span>middle-aged people are</span> -130/80.  If the indicators rise above 140/90, then they speak of hypertension.  After making a diagnosis, the specialist conducts additional examinations, as sometimes high blood pressure is a secondary symptom.  This symptom accompanies kidney disease, atherosclerosis, and diabetes mellitus, so a thorough examination is indispensable. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When high blood pressure turns out to be an independent disease, it is called hypertension.  In such cases, you need to control your weight, monitor blood cholesterol and lead an active lifestyle.  If physical activity due to age is not subject to man, you can limit yourself to a small complex of simple exercises and calm walks.  In addition to exercises, it is worth adding a diet in which salty, fatty and smoked foods are completely excluded.  Just in such products there is a lot of salt, which causes stagnation of fluid in the body.  As a result, the fee for frivolity and non-compliance with the regime will be increased pressure, which exceeds 140/90. </p><p>  There are times when people do not greatly monitor their well-being.  They do not know what pressure a person is the norm.  When such comrades are informed that they have hypertension, they are very surprised.  Arguments begin that there is the notorious working pressure of a person at which he feels normal.  A person works, performs his household duties, and then abruptly wakes up in a hospital surrounded by doctors.  Something like this ends most of the discussion of working pressure. </p><p>  Any deviation from the norm is considered dangerous.  If high blood pressure is somehow easier to diagnose, then lower rates are often disguised as normal fatigue.  When a person‚Äôs pressure is constantly kept at 90/60 or even lower, they speak of hypotension.  Athletes, people with hard physical labor, and people involved in intellectual activities often suffer from it.  When there is a big load on the brain, he tries to defend himself - and reduces the pressure.  To improve their performance, people with hypotension should move more in order to somehow improve their condition.  It is also worth remembering that the pressure of a person whose norm is 120/80 can be increased with the help of a full sleep. </p><p>  If you care about your own health, regularly measure blood pressure, monitor any deviations - and consult a specialist in a timely manner.  Only a healthy and attentive attitude to your condition will help you maintain health for many years. </p>
