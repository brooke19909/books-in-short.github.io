    <p>  The state refers to a certain method of organizing a particular society, as well as public political power, which applies to the entire society.  This authority is the official representative of society. </p><p>  It is customary to begin to study the origin of the state as a <span>social institution</span> with such a notion as <span>‚Äúthe form of the state‚Äù.</span>  The study of this involves the study of the structure, the main components, the main methods for exercising power, the internal structure of the entire system. </p><p>  Today there are quite a lot of theories, approaches used in determining the content and <span>concept of the form of state.</span>  There is no universally recognized doctrine that unambiguously reveals this concept.  At the same time, the rejection of all <span>scientific theories,</span> knowledge and concepts formulated earlier and recognized today as not fully reflecting all social relationships and the nature of the subjects involved in them is considered incorrect. </p><p>  In different countries, power systems have their own characteristics, features.  All these features in the process of development of society are supplemented, enriched in interaction and interconnections.  However, the forms of many modern states have common features.  These similarities make it possible to identify each element in the structure. </p><p>  <span>The origin of the state is</span> investigated in accordance with various factors.  Today, there are quite a lot of views and opinions on this issue.  Along with this, there are basic concepts of the origin of the state, developed by modern legal science. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The process of forming a <span>system of power</span> is associated with the "Neolithic revolution."  It began about ten to twelve thousand years ago.  <span>The Neolithic revolution</span> is the process of transition from the appropriating economy (fishing, hunting, gathering) to the producing one. </p><p>  The prerequisites for the emergence of the state are largely, according to experts, associated with the emergence of private property.  At a certain stage in the development of society, a large-scale division of labor occurred.  Such areas of activity as cattle breeding, agriculture, and craft were formed.  With the improvement of tools, increasing productivity, a person begins to produce (produce) more product than he needs.  This creates surplus.  In this regard, intrapartum exchange of products obtained in the course of economic activity begins.  Subsequently, this process goes beyond the boundaries of one clan; trade between clans begins. </p><p>  In connection with the change in economic conditions, inequality, both economic and social, begins to develop.  Subsequently, the classes of the poor and the rich are distinguished.  At the same time, changing the structure of power is a natural process due to the fact that primitive power is designed to regulate relations in an equal society in which there are no conflicts of interest.  As a result, a new structure of power is required for the new society. </p><p>  In domestic science, the origin of the state was considered as a consequence of class confrontation.  At the same time, it was believed that only slaveholding systems were forming. </p><p>  The provisions explaining the origin of the state are quite clearly reflected in the Marxist-Leninist doctrine. </p><p>  However, in accordance with the data of modern science, it was established that the first state formations arose not as a consequence of the disintegration of society into classes, but as a natural process of improving the primitive communal system.  Moreover, the leading factor is the procedure for combining tribal formations for joint economic activities.  As a result, a group of people endowed with managerial powers is determined.  Together with this, a layer of controlled people is formed.  Organizational and management system begins to form.  Thus, a prototype of the state arises. </p>
