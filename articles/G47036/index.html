Why is now no one inhabits them?  There are a number of reasons for this.  Among them are the horrors of revolution, civil war and the ensuing <span>red terror,</span> which </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="abandoned villages" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4353/251674.jpg" width="600"></div>  claimed many millions of lives, and, in particular, led to a sharp reduction in the number of men.  As a result, the surviving inhabitants left their deserted villages.  Part of the settlements in the Civil War were simply burned.  In addition, during the famine of the 1930s, which affected some regions of Russia, some villages became extinct.  Part of the settlements was destroyed during the Great Patriotic War.  In the years 60-70, the process of enlargement of settlements began.  Residents moved to larger villages.  Nowadays, villages continue to disappear.  Their inhabitants are gradually moving to the city, especially young people.

    <p>  Abandoned villages are wonderful places for those who would like to relax alone, in the lap of nature and away from a boring civilization.  The history of some of them dates back centuries.  View of old huts, chapels, and not far processed </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="map of abandoned villages" class="if" height="435" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4353/251673.jpg" width="348"></div>  Fields gives an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow <span>our ancestors lived.</span>  In such places you can not just stay in the lap of nature and take a break from the boring city routine, but also find something interesting.  For example, old coins.  However, if you are an avid numismatist and decide to visit abandoned villages in order to find new material for your collection, the metal detector will not be out of place.  If you're lucky, come back with a good catch.  And to this day, some lucky ones manage to find ancient treasures.  Old abandoned villages with stone houses are places where rich people once lived.  Before the revolution, merchants or wealthy peasants could dwell in them.  Ordinary people could not afford such homes.  In such places, the chance of the numismatist to replenish his collection increases.  Of course, only if before him this settlement was not thoroughly investigated, which in our time is already unlikely.  In the vicinity of large cities, many abandoned villages, if not all, have long been looted.  For example, the <span>abandoned villages of the Moscow region have</span> clearly been investigated.  If you want to find any valuable antique exhibits, be prepared for the fact that a search in such places can take a lot of time, but lead to nothing.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But if you as an amateur archaeologist or a numismatist would still like to try your luck, where to start?  Firstly, most often in Russia they hid money in wells and </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="abandoned villages of the Moscow region" class="if" height="437" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4353/251672.jpg" width="600"></div>  subfloors.  Most of the treasures were found in these places.  It must be said right away that for two reasons it is not worth looking for anything in the old graves.  Our Orthodox ancestors did not put any values ‚Äã‚Äãin the coffins with the deceased.  Secondly, desecration of graves more than once turned into great troubles for the blasphemers themselves, and this is not an empty superstition.  If you decide to visit an amateur archaeologist for some time, then know that in those places where hostilities were fought in the Great Patriotic War, to this day it is not difficult to run into a mine or a bomb, especially if the sapper‚Äôs foot didn‚Äôt step there.

    <p>  The oldest abandoned villages are interesting in that they give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãpre-revolutionary life.  You can still see there curious architectural monuments of those ancient times: <span>windmills,</span> towers, manors.  Unfortunately, many of them have not survived.  It is safe to say that most of the old towers are now ruins.  Since such objects are of interest to vacationers, some of them are being restored. </p><p>  A map of abandoned villages can be useful both to amateur archaeologists and those who want to relax away from their city. </p>
