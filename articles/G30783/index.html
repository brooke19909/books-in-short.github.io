    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  This modern hotel is located in Psakoudia.  This is the name of a small but extremely attractive resort on Cape Sithonia.  Interestingly, "Psakoudia" is translated as "little pines."  And everything is logical, because the resort is all buried in pine groves, acacias, flowers and shrubs.  Sithonia itself is located on the territory of the nome of Halkidiki. </p><p>  The distance to the nearest airport is 1.5-2 hours, as it is located in Thessaloniki.  It is about 80 kilometers from Psakoudia. </p><p>  But in the immediate vicinity of Cronwell Resort Sermilia there is a closed sandy beach where only guests staying in the complex are allowed to enter.  And just around the corner from the hotel is a bus stop.  You can take a minibus and at no cost to get anywhere - even to Thessaloniki.  So the location at the hotel is extremely good.  And the distance from the airport is compensated by the few people and comparative silence. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Service and Facilities </h2><p>  At Cronwell Resort Sermilia, the level of service is what it should be in a 5-star hotel.  There is everything you need for the comfort of guests.  There is free Wi-Fi, private car parking, a shared lounge, and dry cleaning laundry.  Also, a shuttle service is provided here.  However, to be honest, it is better to rent a car.  Traveling around Halkidiki by personal transport is much more convenient and interesting than using public transport. </p><p>  The hotel also has a 24-hour reception and postal services.  There is a conference room with a capacity of 40 people, which is often rented for various events.  And there is Bucephalus Hall.  All kinds of exhibitions and meetings are regularly held there. </p><p>  It is also important to note that Cronwell Resort Sermilia has apartments in which everything (from the bathroom to the furniture) is adapted for people with disabilities. </p><p>  But one of the most important nuances regarding services is the level of staff training.  Responsible people work here.  And they cannot but rejoice at their knowledge of five languages.  After all, the staff speaks German, Russian, Italian, English and Greek.  So no one should have communication problems. </p>

Air conditioning with heating function, dressing room, bathrobes for each guest, hairdryer, toiletries, slippers - all this inside is also available. </p><p>  What in terms of price?  For two people a week of living will cost about 60 tons.  (with full board).  If you plan a trip for two adults with a child, then you will not have to pay extra for it.

Therefore, if you want to save money, you need to track the cost of apartments in order to predict the most favorable moment for yourself. </p>

    <h2>  Options for three </h2><p>  Hotel Cronwell Resort Sermilia <span>5 * (Greece, Halkidiki,</span> Sithonia) also offers 3-bed apartments.  Judging objectively, these are absolutely the same numbers as the previously mentioned, designed for two.  The difference is only in the number of guests.  And sleeping places.  The 3-bed apartment has an additional sofa bed (in addition to the already existing inside).  And you can choose: either one 2-bed bed will be inside, or two standard.  Such apartments cost about 80-85 tons.  in Week. </p><h2>  Suites </h2><p>  Apartments of this class are also available at the hotel.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe suite, designed for 2-3 adults, is 46 square meters.  m. The main feature is the presence of two rooms.  One of them is a bedroom, and the other is a living room.  The first has a large bed for two people, the second has a folding sofa.  The price of accommodation for three people (plus 1 possible child is free) - 90 tons  (also per week and with full board). </p><p>  The most luxurious option is a family suite of 77 square meters.  m. It is characterized by increased sound insulation, as well as the presence of a microwave with a kettle.  The suite also has a separate dining area.  The space is divided into a bedroom and a living room (as in the previous case).  The average price for 7 days with full board for four adults is about 180 tons.  (that is, about 45,000 rubles per day per person).  But this is the most profitable option.  Since single occupancy in the standard, designed for 1 guest, will cost about 80 tons </p>
