Spanish resorts have long gained popularity among tourists from all over the world.  However, they are not cheap compared to budget options such as Turkey and Egypt. </p><h2>  A bit about the resort </h2><p>  Costa del Maresme stretches south of the Costa Brava near Barcelona.  The main resorts are considered: Sant Pol de Mar, Pineda de Mar, Callela, Santa Susanna, Malgrat de Mar.  These places are known for their wide sandy beaches.  Costa del Maresme is considered the most economical region on the entire Spanish coast on the Mediterranean Sea.  It should be noted that the vast majority of local hotels offer apartments at relatively inexpensive prices. </p><p>  Once in these places there were only peasant and fishing settlements.  But in the middle of the twentieth century, the rich inhabitants of Barcelona began to build up the coast with villas and hotels for themselves and visiting guests.  Since then, the infrastructure of the Spanish resort has been developing all the time.  And now it is a fully equipped and modern town for tourists.  There are modern hotel complexes of various levels, entertainment centers and much more, which may be interesting to vacationers.  Costa del Maresme is considered one of the most beautiful places on the Spanish coast. </p><h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  The hotel has a good location, fifty meters from it is the beach.  From the center of Pineda de Mar, no more than three hundred meters to Golden Taurus Park Resort 4 * (Spain).  Barcelona and its airport are 75 kilometers from the hotel.  The closest to the hotel is the airport of the town of Girona. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="golden taurus park resort" class="if" height="317" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1457582.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Barcelona is a popular tourist destination, which is certainly worth a look.  There are many museums and architectural attractions. </p><p>  No less interesting will be a trip to Girona.  In season, pleasure boats offer a boat trip between the Costa del Maresme and the famous city of Costa Brava.  One way road will cost you from 15 to 25 euros, but it's worth it, you will get a lot of impressions. </p><p>  Most of the vacationers Golden Taurus Park Resort (Spain) are families with children, they will certainly like the water amusement park called Marineland.  The water park is designed not only for adults, but also for children.  It has a special area for those who are not yet six years old.  There is also a mini zoo and an exhibition of birds of prey.  In addition, the water park is famous for performances of dolphins. </p><p>  In Barcelona there is a Park Guell, which has gained worldwide fame.  It is so unusual that it is worth seeing with your own eyes.  Eusebi Guell once bought land on the outskirts of the city, planning to create a popular garden city at that time.  But something went wrong and the project closed.  Now in the park is the house of Gaudi, in which he lived for twenty years.  Currently, there is a museum. </p><p>  In Barcelona, ​​there is an aquarium, which is one of the most important world centers for studying the marine fauna of the Mediterranean Sea.  It presents expositions in the form of whole ecosystems: a rocky coast, an underwater cave, and thickets of algae.  There is a lot of interesting things: from marine life to underwater vegetation.  The walk along the long glass tunnel is impressive, you can watch how terrible sharks swim overhead, and <span>seahorses</span> and microscopic fish scurry around. </p><p>  In the evening, in Barcelona you can admire the Agbar Tower, which has become the hallmark of the city.  This is the most recognizable building in the whole city.  At night, it glows with colorful lights. </p><p>  The attention of tourists is always attracted by the Art Nouveau building, which houses the famous Palace of Catalan music.  It is a kind of colorful mixture of a variety of architectural details, and yet it looks just amazing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="golden taurus park resort 4 spain barcelona" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1457586.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  An extraordinary sight is the world famous fountains located on <span>Mount Montjuic.</span>  This place has long been the most visited in the capital of Catalonia.  These magnificent fountains were created in 1929 for the World Exhibition by the architect K. Bugyas; later, in 1992 they were reconstructed for the Olympics.  The magical combination of light, water and classical music has fascinated viewers for more than a year.  A great show can be seen every day after sunset.  At this time, jets of water to the sounds of classics soar upward, creating bizarre and unique figures.  In total, fifty different shades are used in the show.  The spectacle so harmoniously combines light, music and water that every evening it gathers crowds of grateful spectators, including not only tourists, but also residents of Barcelona.  Every year, on the occasion of the end of the Le Merce festival, a large music show with pyrotechnic effects is organized.  Crowds of guests come to see fireworks and lasers in combination with music and fountain jets. </p><h2>  Golden Taurus Park Resort 4 *: reviews </h2><p>  Talking about the hotel, I want to refer to the reviews of people who visited it.  Is he really good?  I want to start from the location of Golden Taurus Park Resort.  Reviews of tourists in this regard are only positive.  Despite the fact that the hotel is not in the center of the town, but a little off to the side, everyone likes it, because there is a quiet and calm atmosphere, there is no music rattling at night.  But this is important for relaxation.  Nobody wants to sleep all night long to the sounds of night discos.  There is no such congestion of buildings and vacationers, as, for example, in the same Santa Susanna.  In general, the atmosphere itself is very welcoming and very comfortable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="golden taurus park resort reviews" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1457593.jpg" width="600"></div>

Bed linen is quite normal, without holes and signs of wear. </p><p>  The hotel has a Russian-speaking staff at the reception, which is very convenient.  There is no language barrier.  The employees of the complex are friendly and try to help in case of questions.  The service here is not intrusive at all, everything is very calm and comfortable.  If you plan to leave later than the estimated time, then you need to contact the reception and pay extra time.  All issues are very easily resolved. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  As for food, it is very good at the hotel.  Food is served in unlimited quantities, which is convenient.  For breakfast, for example, you can usually try: scrambled eggs, bacon, fruits, eggs, coffee, tea and even champagne.  For dinner, as a rule, grilled meat, fish, chicken legs, mussels, shrimp, squid, delicious desserts and much more are served.  There is a lot of food, and it is diverse.  On the tables there is always a huge selection of delicious ripe fruits and berries.  They are simply amazing here.  Not for nothing that all the slopes of the mountains are covered with plantations of strawberries and gardens.

    <p>  The hotel does not have its own beach, but municipal services are available for vacationers.  It is located only fifty meters from the hotel, to get to it, you just need to cross the road.  Sandy beach with pebbles.  The sea is quite clear, but in the water there is a sharp slope, plus waves, it turns out immediately deep.  Umbrellas and sunbeds are paid, but you do not need to pay for the entrance to the beach.  You can buy your own umbrella nearby in the market and thus solve the problem. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword <strong></strong></h2><p>  Golden Taurus Park Resort is a wonderful hotel that fully meets its level, which can be safely recommended for couples, even with very young children.  Spain is a wonderful country for recreation, in which there are many interesting and beautiful places that you just need to see. </p>
