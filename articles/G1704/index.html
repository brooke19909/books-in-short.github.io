    <p>  It is worth noting that the weather in Barcelona in December, January and February is approximately the same.  However, February and January are not rich in precipitation, but in December it will not be amiss to take an umbrella with you.  Light drizzle is not uncommon at this time of year.  After sunset, the air temperature drops sharply, so a warm jacket and pants should also be put in a suitcase. </p><p>  If we talk about reviews of the weather in Barcelona in December, then you should not trust them much.  After all, the concept of what a comfortable temperature is is different for everyone.  And the weather here is unpredictable.  Someone was lucky with a temperature of twenty degrees, and someone spent his entire vacation walking in the drizzling rain. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Holidays </h2><p>  December in Barcelona is rich in festive events.  In addition to the Christmas meeting, which is celebrated on the night of December 24 to 25, two other holidays are celebrated at the beginning of the month (December 6 and 8): Constitution Day and Immaculate Conception Day.  Holidays are considered weekends.  No shops are open at this time, some restaurants are closed.  But you will not have to refuse to visit various museums, since on holidays they not only work, but are also free to visit. </p><p>  Despite the fact that Barcelona belongs to Catalonia, and the Catalans are trying in every possible way to emphasize their independence and autonomy from the rest of Spain, Constitution Day is celebrated here, as in the whole country.  The Constitution itself was adopted in 1978 at a popular referendum, however, the holiday became a calendar only in 1983. </p>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="barcelona december weather reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61221/2190238.jpg"></div>  The Immaculate Conception Day is one of the main Catholic holidays.  The essence of the holiday is the Catholic dogma that the Virgin Mary was conceived by ordinary parents, but the original sin did not pass on to her.  According to tradition, on this day the Catalans bring a decorated Christmas log to the house, on which they put on a hat with a cheerful muzzle.  Until Christmas, they take care of the log, feed it, put it on, and talk to it.
