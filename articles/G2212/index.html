  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is a quadrocopter? Features and Brands</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Quadcopters are radio-controlled aircraft that are used for entertainment, professional video shooting from the air, and military missions.  Depending on the size and functionality, they can run directly in the apartment, rise to a height of more than a kilometer, deliver large packages.  However, models are especially in demand for beginners and amateurs. </p><h2>  What is a quadrocopter? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The essence of quadrocopters" class="if uuid-2385671" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80692/2385671.jpg"></div><p>  This term (from the English quadro - four, copter - helicopter) refers to an aircraft with 4 screws, also called a multicopter, a drone or a drone.  It rises into the air thanks to four propellers, the rotation speed of which can be adjusted.  It is equipped with stabilizing systems to ensure aerodynamic stability, due to which it is convenient for shooting from a height. </p><h2>  Device and principle of operation </h2><p>  The answer to the question of what a quadrocopter is would be incomplete without a detailed description of its design, equipment and flight features.  It consists of a frame, engines, propellers, an electronic system and a battery, as well as additional elements: protection of screws, landing legs, control panel and other elements. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Stable flight and controllability are possible only due to the coordinated work of functional components.  Commands from the remote control are received by the radio receiver and processed by a processor that controls the rotation of the motors.  The chip also receives information from automatic sensors.  In the presence of a gyroscope, the drone compensates for gusts of wind, and due to the GPS module, it can return to the console when the battery is low or the signal is out of range. </p><p>  It should be borne in mind that a detailed answer to the question of what a quadrocopter is also depends on the configuration.  On the packaging you can find incomprehensible abbreviations: RTF, BNF, ARF, FPV and others.  What do these terms mean? </p><h2>  ARF </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.meraevents.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Quadcopters ARF" class="if uuid-2385675" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80692/2385675.jpg"></div><p>  The abbreviation stands for Almost Ready to Fly or almost ready for flight.  This means that the quadrocopter is supplied disassembled.  The kit includes all components (the remote control is not always available) and is suitable for people who want to assemble a drone with their own hands.  Keep in mind that this is not a ready-made constructor.  For assembly and soldering, you need the appropriate tool.  Lack of tools and experience, paradoxically, gives rise to many negative reviews on quadrocopters in this configuration. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Bnf </h2><p>  The abbreviation stands for Bind and Fly or tie and fly.  In this case, the configuration does not have a control panel, and the quadrocopter needs to be connected to its own.  The set is relevant for professionals.  After all, if you have a powerful multi-channel remote, there is no need to overpay for the basic complete device. </p><h2>  RTF </h2><div class="photo" data-original="hobbyshop.lt" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Quadcopter RTF" class="if uuid-2385674" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80692/2385674.jpg"></div><p>  The abbreviation stands for Ready to Fly or Ready for Flight.  This means that the quadrocopter comes fully equipped with a control panel.  In these kits, most budget drones are sold. </p><h2>  FPV </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.menkind.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Quadcopters with FPV broadcast" class="if uuid-2385673" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80692/2385673.jpg"></div><p>  The abbreviation stands for First Person View or first-person view.  We are talking about quadrocopters with broadcast, which transmit video to the remote monitor, the screen of a smartphone or laptop in real time. </p><h2>  Popular brands </h2><ul><li>  DJI  Industry Leader  Not only collects drones from components of other factories, but produces its own microcontrollers, video equipment and other components, so the reviews on quadrocopters of this brand are almost always positive. </li><li>  Walkera.  A company with a 20-year history of creating unmanned devices.  The market offers powerful multicopter for amateurs and professionals. </li><li>  SYMA TOYS.  Popular Chinese brand.  Quadcopters Syma are in great demand, due to the affordable cost of devices with decent performance. </li><li>  Hubsan.  The young Chinese company was founded in 2010, but has already managed to gain popularity in the market and customer confidence.  It produces a wide range of quadrocopters for beginners and amateurs. </li></ul><h2>  What to look for when choosing </h2><div class="photo" data-original="blog.mivia.dk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Quadcopter selection" class="if uuid-2385672" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80692/2385672.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Engines  Motors can be collector and dem.  The former are characterized by low traction and unpredictable service life, but due to the lightweight design they are installed on compact and medium-sized quadrocopters.  Brushless motors have high efficiency and a long service life. </li><li>  Battery.  The flight duration depends on its capacity.  The norm is 8-12 minutes for budget models and at least 20 minutes.  - for professional. </li><li>  The camera is usually installed directly in the housing.  There are models without it or with mounts for GoPro.  The quadrocopter with a camera on the remote control has an FPV function and transmits the image to the built-in display via a Wi-Fi signal.  Image quality depends on the resolution of the matrix (the best option is Full HD), but the frame rate also has a value (it should be at least 30 fps). </li><li>  Remote Control.  May have a built-in display and Wi-Fi module.  Remote controls also differ in range depending on the power of the receiver: from 30 meters to 1 kilometer or more. </li><li>  Additional functions.  Quadrocopters with GPS support Follow Me options, flight by points, return to the remote control and other options.  The gyroscope eliminates gusts of wind, and the barometer allows the drone to maintain a given height. </li><li>  The cost of a quadrocopter depends on the brand and functionality.  You can conditionally divide the device into budget, mid-priced drones and expensive professional models.  As noted above, Syma quadrocopters are of low cost with decent functionality and build quality. </li></ul><h2>  Finally </h2><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="ASChUYPXT0o" data-url="https://youtu.be/ASChUYPXT0o" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/2/1/3/2/2132.jpg"></div><p>  What is a quadrocopter, will help to understand the video above.  Devices are very popular, both for entertainment and for professional tasks.  They are as simple as possible to operate, so they are suitable for both children and adults. </p>
