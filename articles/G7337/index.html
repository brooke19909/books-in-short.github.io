    <h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  The resort area where the <span>Club Hotel</span> Tropicana 3 * "(Skanes) is located is located near the ancient city of Monastir, the former historical spiritual center of Tunisia. Like many hotels in this African country, the hotel was built in the mid-80s. Recent works on repairs and renovations took place quite recently - in 2012. Today's Tropicana hotel - a snow-white building in the European style with small comfortable rooms - offers its guests not only a sea vacation using the convenient all inclusive system, but also a large selection of entertainments  cheny and SPA-procedures. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The hotel complex Club Hotel Tropicana 3 * (Tunisia) - is part of the Magic Life Hotels hotel chain, however, cooperation with Russian travel operators has been relatively recent, the last few years.

    <p>  An interesting fact about this Tunisian hotel: a hotel with the same name is in Spain.  The location of the Spanish Club Hotel Tropicana 3 * is Majorca (an island that has long been a mega-popular tourist destination for Europeans).  On travel forums there are many reviews of the Spanish hotel and from Russian guests.  Tunisian and Spanish "Tropicana" because of the similarity of names are often confused, leaving reviews about the rest.  <span>Hotel Club Hotel</span> Tropicana 3 * (Mallorca) also has a "three-star" rating.  However, prices for accommodation and services on the island of Mallorca are much higher.  Also, the Spanish hotel can be found on the websites of tour operators under the name Club Hotel Riu Tropicana 3 *. </p><p>  Of course, when booking a tour, it‚Äôs hard to make a mistake and ‚Äúmix up‚Äù Spain and Tunisia.  But in some ways the Tunisian hotel and Club Hotel Tropicana 3 * (Mallorca) are really similar.  The reviews left by our compatriots about them are quite positive and support the opinion that a ‚Äúthree-star‚Äù vacation can also be comfortable and safe. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The territory of the hotel complex is a fenced area with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 40 thousand square meters.  m, like a blooming oasis.  The infrastructure of the Tunisian hotel "Tropicana" includes: </p><ul><li>  The main building (four-story building with an elevator). </li><li>  Two three-story buildings. </li><li>  Car parking. </li><li>  Internet cafe. </li><li>  Two outdoor pools (children and adults), one indoor with heated water. </li><li>  Two restaurants, main and premium. </li><li>  Four bars. </li><li>  Banquet (conference) hall. </li><li>  Children's complex. </li><li>  SPA-Alon and sports grounds. </li><li>  Hair Salon. </li><li>  Doctor's office. </li><li>  Laundry (self-service). </li></ul><p>  The hotel has free Wi-Fi, although, according to tourists, it ‚Äúcatches‚Äù the network very weakly and only near the reception or in the bar. </p><p>  There is no special exchange office for local currency, dinar, in the hotel.  This service can be provided to the guest if he goes to the reception.  Russian tourists willingly share their observations in reviews: it is much more profitable to exchange currency in the city.  But, the same "experienced" tourists advise to treat this procedure with great accuracy: exchange for dinars only at special points and do not be shy to carefully count everything yourself, because the workers of urban "exchangers" are often "mistaken" in their favor. </p><p>  All information about the services provided to guests of the Tunisian hotel, of course, can be found on the websites of tour operators.  But you can fully make up your mind about the hotel by learning what they say about the hotel complex Club Hotel Tropicana 3 * reviews of 2016 on Russian tourist forums. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Beach, pool </h2><p>  Club Hotel Tropicana 3 * hotel is located on the first coastline.  A picturesque path leads to the hotel beach, which is just 200 meters away.  What do the <span>reviews of</span> Russian guests say about the beach area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Club Hotel Tropicana 3 * hotel <span>(Tunisia)</span> ? </p><ul><li>  The hotel beach is quite ‚Äúroomy‚Äù, it stretches along the coastline for 250 m, so there is enough space for all vacationers, even in the ‚Äúhot‚Äù tourist months. </li><li>  An excellent sandy beach is the main feature of the entire Skanes resort area.  An artificial beach with clean imported sand compares favorably with pebble-sand beaches that are usual for these places.  The entrance to the sea is gentle, very convenient even for young children. </li><li>  Lifeguards work daily on the beach. </li><li>  Beach equipment (sun loungers and umbrellas) is always in sufficient quantity, provided to hotel guests free of charge.  For an additional surcharge, you can rent a mattress. </li><li>  Algae pollution of sea water is one of the main problems of the entire Tunisian coast.  If in calm weather the water in the sea is relatively clean, then even with a slight storm, it brings a lot of ‚Äúislands‚Äù of algae to the hotel beach.  Garbage and algae on the hotel beach clean. </li><li>  Every second tourist who visited Skanes warns of the possibility of being "stung" by jellyfish.  Often there is advice to take with you in this case a remedy for skin itching, but ointment can also be obtained from hotel staff. <strong></strong></li><li>  There are a lot of local merchants on the beach, there is the opportunity to ride a camel. <strong></strong></li></ul><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  What rooms does Club Hotel Tropicana 3 * (Tunisia) provide its guests?  Photos of the rooms can be viewed a little lower in the article.  The hotel fund has: </p><ul><li>  244 rooms, designed for two guests, an area of ‚Äã‚Äã27 square meters.  m </li><li>  66 quadruple rooms for up to four guests (31 sq. M.). </li><li>  7 family two-room rooms for up to four guests (48 m2) </li><li>  1 deluxe room for up to three guests with sea view.  (70 m2). </li><li>  40 connected quadruple rooms. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  In addition to the hotel restaurant, which provides tourists with all-inclusive meals, there are 4 bars of various types in the territory of Club Hotel Tropicana 3 * (Tunisia).  There is <span>also an a la Carte restaurant</span> (premium). </p><p>  In general, about the all-inclusive restaurant in Club Hotel Tropicana 3 * (Tunisia), the reviews are not just positive, but mostly enthusiastic.  And first of all it concerns the observance of sanitary standards, which in itself is a huge plus for a hotel in an African country.  Guests of the Club Hotel Tropicana 3 * hotel especially note: </p><ul><li>  Food quality and temperature control at the buffet.  Many guests of Club Hotel Tropicana 3 * were impressed that the dishes served at the distribution were constantly monitored with the help of a special tester. </li><li>  Variety and taste of dishes.  The cuisine in the hotel restaurant is quite traditional. Meat dishes, poultry dishes, cereals, pasta, a large selection of vegetables are served daily.  There are no complaints about the "congestion" of food with spices.  An excellent selection of desserts and pastries, fruits are served daily and in sufficient quantities. </li><li>  There is an ‚Äúopen‚Äù kitchen: some dishes are prepared directly in front of the guests. </li><li>  When a dish at the buffet ends, it is replenished. </li><li>  Spacious and roomy dining room.  There is enough space for all visitors, so there is practically no need to reserve seats at tables in advance. <strong></strong></li><li>  Almost no queues. </li><li>  Friendly, polite and very tidy waiters. </li><li>  All drinks, including alcohol, are of good quality. </li></ul><p>  Comments on the organization of the hotel restaurant are extremely rare.  Most often, hotel guests do not like the following: </p><ul><li>  Hot drinks are served in the main restaurant only in the morning.  The rest of the time you can bring hot drinks from the bar yourself, which is not very convenient. </li><li>  "Weak" hood in the kitchen.  The smells of dishes, especially fish, can be felt not only in the banquet hall, but also near the restaurant. </li><li>  Seafood on the menu does not appear every day, and the choice of dishes from them is quite modest. </li><li>  The quality of tap drinking water is extremely low.  Many guests preferred to buy bottled water at city supermarkets or at the nearest gas station. </li></ul>

Reviews of tourists characterize the hotel staff as calm, somewhat slow, but rather polite, smiling people.  Someone is even a little annoyed by the leisurely and measured, but many tourists were satisfied with the friendly attitude of the staff. <strong></strong></p><p>  The holidaymakers' efforts to overcome the ‚Äúlanguage barrier‚Äù were very flattered by the vacationers.  Despite the fact that the official language is French, most of the hotel staff can quite fluently explain in English and even try to learn Russian. </p><p>  Tipping, like most Tunisians, hotel staff accept with gratitude.  However, the lack of a ‚Äúcash reward‚Äù does not affect the service. </p>

    <h2>  Leisure, animation </h2><p>  About the hotel staff providing leisure and organizing shows at Club Hotel Tropicana 3 * (Tunisia), the reviews of 2016 are extremely unanimous: the animation in the hotel complex is called ‚Äúincendiary‚Äù, ‚Äúfiery‚Äù, ‚Äúamazing‚Äù.  One of the tourists wonders how the organizers of entertainment can work in such an active rhythm almost round the clock.  In the morning, the animators' work "is boiling" near the pool: they conduct aerobics, give everyone who wants lessons in dancing, Arabic, archery, and organize fun competitions and group sports.  In the evening, guests are pleased with an evening show with music and colorful costumes in the small amphitheater of the hotel, often incendiary discos.  Animation at the hotel is conducted in English, French, Arabic and, which is especially noted by Russian guests, in Russian.

The entertainment is organized in such a way as not to disturb other guests from relaxing by the pool or at the bar. </p>
