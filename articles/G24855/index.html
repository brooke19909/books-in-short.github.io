Since its inception, the main shrine is stored there - the icon of the Mother of God.  This is the only surviving relic after the devastating fire of 1692.  Now the ensemble of the monastery looks like a cute toy town, consisting of 6 temples, a hospital, a parish school and several other buildings.  Vladimir Cathedral - the main element of the <span>Zadonsky Monastery</span> - is built in the Russian-Byzantine style.  He delights visitors with magnificent arched forms, chic decoration and colorful wall paintings.  You can see his photo on the right.

    <h2>  Manor of the Nechaevs </h2><p>  One of the most famous architectural monuments is the Nechaevs estate, located 16 km from the famous <span>Kulikov field.</span>  The palace was built in the small village of Polybino at the end of the 18th century.  The time of the construction of the estate had an important role in architecture - the building was erected in the Empire style, which was actively developing at the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries.  In addition to the main building, a picturesque park adjoined the palace with ponds, rare trees and fragrant flowers.  Unfortunately, over the course of the twentieth century, the ensemble gradually fell into disrepair, often undergoing peasant invasions that disrupted paintings, carried away exclusive pieces of furniture and expensive accessories.  Currently, leisurely restoration work is underway, which, according to experts, will not be able to return the former grandeur of the estate. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A tower is installed on the territory, which is considered the world's first hyperboloid structure.  The architect was the Russian engineer Shukhov, under whose supervision it was built.  Its height is 45 m, and at the top there is a reservoir containing more than 100,000 liters of water. </p><h2>  Borkovsky castle </h2><p>  Sights of the Lipetsk region can please another decoration - Borkovsky castle, an exceptional architectural creation of the last century.  It is built in an outlandish Gothic style, rare in this region.  The rapid construction of the palace ensemble began in the period from 1901 to 1912, when the estate was bought by Andrei Vladimirovich Romanov.  We think it‚Äôs easy to guess that with the advent of Soviet power, the castle was nationalized.  The building was never repaired, but in 2009, restoration work finally began, which gradually returned the magnificent appearance of Borkovsky Castle. </p><h2>  Nature reserve "Halych Mountain" </h2>

In a relatively "small" area of ‚Äã‚Äã230 ha, extremely rare plants grow, including lithophytes, ephedra, Don cinquefoil and others.  Of course, there was a place for more familiar herbs and trees, such as oak, birch, linden, etc. Today, the territory of the reserve is divided into 6 sections (clusters), each of which is unique in its significance and unusually beautiful.

Of great interest is the rich fauna, in which there was a place for such bird species as the dwarf eagle, saker falcon, golden eagle, black-headed mint, etc. Of course, such a variety attracts great attention of bird watchers. </p><p>  Voronov stone, Plushenko, Bykova neck and <span>Vorgolsky rocks</span> also surprise visitors with unique flora and fauna, and the amazing charm of pristine nature only fuels the nascent love for these places. </p><h2>  Ascension Cathedral </h2><p>  The Ascension Cathedral is truly grandiose.  Its height reaches 74 m, length - 94 m, and width - 34 m. The temple is richly decorated with gilded chandeliers, a Florentine mosaic and is crowned with sky-blue domes.  The cathedral is painted by famous Russian artists A. I. Korzukhin and K. V. Lebedev.  The interior of the temple impresses with its magnificent three-tiered iconostasis and monumental wall paintings.  Like many attractions of the Lipetsk region, the Ascension Cathedral felt all the hardships of the 1917 revolution.  Fortunately, now the cathedral has been completely restored, and the Sunday school, operating at the temple, invites parishioners of any age. </p><h2>  Museum-Estate "Land of Dolgorukovsky" </h2>

In general, if you want to visit some outlandish place, come to this amazing village.  Next, we will tell you about where Lipetsk is located, which is a regional center, which also boasts a considerable number of unusual places. </p><h2>  Lipetsk </h2><p>  The city of Lipetsk is the administrative center of the eponymous region located in the western part of the Russian Federation.  Its population is more than 500,000 people, the area is 320 km <sup>2</sup> .  The history of Lipetsk has more than three hundred years, during which it gradually grew to a large metallurgical center.  The first mention of it dates back to 1283, when a fortified settlement was laid here, however, it was in 1703, at the behest of Peter I, that a small town with ironworks was founded, which was later named Lipetsk.  Due to its industrial direction, the city does not particularly shine with a huge number of attractions, but there is something to see.  Below we will describe in more detail the best places in the city that attract the attention of tourists from all over the country. </p>

    <h2>  Cathedral Square </h2><p>  In the center of Lipetsk is an area laid in the last century.  She found her present look only in 1958, when the impressive House of Soviets was erected on it.  This building is still one of the most beautiful in the city.  Its facade is decorated with 24 columns, and at the entrance of the guests there is a statue of Lenin.  You can see a photo of this building in the photo below. </p><p>  The second decoration of the square is the Cathedral, reconstructed under the supervision of L. E. Rudakova.  In 1970, chimes were installed on his bell tower, which to this day announce the inhabitants of the city about the onset of a new hour.  Thousands of people visit the Cathedral Square daily, so the city authorities take care of maintaining its beauty and cleanliness. </p>

    <h2>  Monuments of Lipetsk </h2><p>  In Lipetsk, there are quite a lot of various monuments dedicated to historical figures.  One of the most famous is the obelisk of Peter I. He is considered one of the symbols of the city, because it was this emperor, as we mentioned above, who founded Lipetsk.  The same Peter the Great was erected another monument located on the square of the same name.  Its architect was S. A. Soshnikov.  The monument to tankers in Lipetsk, built in 1978, looks quite majestic.  The author of the project was V.N. Kozhukharin.  Other buildings include the famous "Guns", a monument to the 300th anniversary of Lipetsk and, finally, a monument to the founders of the city on Plekhanov Square.  The sculptor of the latter was the notorious A.E. Wagner. </p><h2>  Museums in Lipetsk </h2><p>  There are 9 museums in Lipetsk, each of which has amazing collections of exhibits that clearly reflect the entire history of the city and the region.  Among them, the House-Museum of G. V. Plekhanov, the famous revolutionary Marxist, occupies a special role.  Georgy Valentinovich lived here with his family for a while, glorifying Lipetsk. </p><p>  The Museum of Local Lore, which in 1956 received the status of a regional museum, attracts many curious tourists.  If you are a fan of fine art, then in no case do not miss a visit to the V. S.

    <h2>  Parks and squares of Lipetsk </h2><p>  What else the city of Lipetsk is famous for is the huge number of parks that make up its "green lungs."  The largest and most popular among citizens is the Lower Park, located at the foot of the Cathedral Mountain.  All city dwellers like to relax here, having forgotten about difficult everyday life. </p><p>  No less popular is <span>Bykhanov Garden,</span> which often becomes the place of mass festivities, holidays, and evenings.  Amusement rides work for children.  For the older audience, the Solaris mall operates, which has a cinema, a nightclub and a tavern.  The Victory Park, the Youth and Sokol Parks of Lipetsk stand apart.

Now it is considered one of the symbols of the city. </p><p>  No less beautiful is the Church of All Saints, built only in 2009.  The height of its bell tower reaches 49 m, and the proud domes are covered with nitrotitanium, which significantly exceeds the traditional gilding.  You can see the photo of the temple below. </p><p>  In the center of Lipetsk is the church of St. Eudokia, built in the style of classicism.  In shape, it resembles a four-petalled rotunda.
