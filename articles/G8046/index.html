    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The hotel in question is located in the northern part of Sunny Beach.  It is only one and a half kilometers from the center.  The place here is quite calm and great for families.  The nearest international airport is in the city of Burgas, from which the Strandja 4 * hotel is only thirty kilometers away.

Especially this fact will appeal to those tourists who plan to take young children with them on a trip to Bulgaria. </p><p>  Another important factor for travelers who want to relax on the seashore is the proximity of a hotel in question to the beach.  As for the four-star Strandzha hotel complex (Sunny Beach), the distance from it to the nearest beach does not exceed one hundred and fifty meters.  Along the way, you will need to cross the road and the promenade that runs along the coast.  The beach here is municipal and equipped with everything necessary for an interesting and varied vacation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
