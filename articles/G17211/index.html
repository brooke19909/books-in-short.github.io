The French province will not leave indifferent any tourist.  The historical region is located in the south-east of the country, at the foot of the Alps on the Mediterranean coast.  Visit Provence is the dream of any traveler. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Provence is currently the most attractive region in France.  The land has incorporated the most unique historical traditions, amazingly beautiful nature and ancient architectural monuments.  Where is Provence located?  Its lands are located in the south-east of France.  The region is located in several climatic zones.  From the west it is bordered <span>by the Rhone River,</span> and in the east it borders on the Alpine mountains.  Well, in the south, the coast of Provence is washed by the sea.  The coastal zone is often called the Cote d'Azur.  Enviable lands have always aroused great interest among neighbors, and therefore, over the entire history of the region, the struggle for the right to own it has been waged more than once.  It is for this reason that the region has such a rich and complex history.  For many centuries, the region has absorbed a combination of a variety of cultures.  There have been periods of prosperity and decline in the history of Provence. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="capital of provence" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2162679.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Today, it includes the departments of Var, Vaucluse, Bush-du-Rhone, as well as partially the lands of the Alps of Haute Provence and the Maritime Alps.  The center of the region is the famous city of Marseille, which can be safely called one of the oldest settlements on French lands. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  History of Provence </h2><p>  Numerous archaeological excavations carried out repeatedly in the region suggest that the first settlements in Provence appeared about half a million years BC.  According to historians, these are currently the most ancient places of residence of people on Earth, which are reliably confirmed by archaeological finds.  In the sixth century BC, Greek sailors who appeared on the shores of Provence agreed with the local Ligurian tribes and founded several large port cities on the coast - Nicaea, now called Nice, and Massalia, now Marseille. </p><p>  It was the first Greeks who brought the basics of agriculture to the region, planting vineyards and olive groves on local lands.  After some time, a Massaliotic empire was formed in the province.  And already in the second century BC, Roman colonization of the region began.  During this period, Roman troops entered the territory of Provence under the pretext of military assistance to the massaliots in the war against the Salienne tribe.  By the way, it was thanks to the Romans that the region acquired its current name, since the conquerors simply called it ‚Äúprovince‚Äù. </p><p>  The era of Roman rule had a positive impact on the history of the region.  The Romans were excellent administrators, they managed to create an excellent infrastructure.  It was they who built beautiful new fortified cities, interconnected by a network of roads.  After the fall of the Roman Empire in Provence, not the best of times came.  The territory was alternately captured and plundered by barbarian tribes.  Later, no less bloodthirsty hordes of Moors came from Spain and North Africa, which Karl Martelem managed to stop.  At the same time, Provence became acquainted with Christianity.  From the tenth to the fourteenth century, clashes between different count dynasties did not abate in the province.  Each family fought for influence on these lands.  In addition, pirates raided Provence.  In addition, the region suffered from plague epidemics. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

At home, inhaling the scent of lavender, you will always remember about your trip, about the beautiful and sweet Provence.  The most popular gifts are Provencal honey and <span>Marseille soap.</span> </p><h2>  Interesting places </h2><p>  Provence is not only fashionable resorts, but also numerous natural beauties.  Tourists recommend going to the <span>Verdon Gorge.</span>  The Grand Canyon, in which the gorge is located, is considered the largest in all of Europe.  In addition, the place is incredibly picturesque.  The stunning emerald <span>color of the water</span> of the Verdon River and the beautiful Lake Saint Croix is ‚Äã‚Äãharmoniously combined with the natural greenery of the Provencal vegetation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the provence" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2162711.jpg"></div>

    <p>  If your path through Provence runs through Marseille, then you should visit the famous If castle, which was built to protect the city from attacks, but by coincidence it became a famous prison.  The castle brought fame to Dumas novel "The Count of Monte Cristo."  Now the fortress is open to visitors, and you can see the camera of Edmond Dantes in it, although in fairness it should be noted that the main character of the novel by Dumas is fictional. </p><p>  Provence is a stunningly beautiful and interesting region, crowded with all kinds of historical places and attractions.  There are so many of them that one trip is simply not enough to see at least the most significant objects. </p>
