Phablets: Overview</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For some time now, a large-screen mobile phone has been considered a very common communication device.  The functionality of modern smartphones when implementing various kinds of tasks is amazing.  If you do not know what a phablet is, then pay attention to your own phone.  It is possible that you have a device that runs on one of the mobile OS, and its five-inch <span>touch screen</span> reminds you of a minimized tablet.  However, let's take a more versatile approach to resolving the issue raised.  Moreover, the Russian-language definition of the English word fablet cannot be called clear.  We read, wonder, look and compare! </p><h2>  What is a phablet? </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What is a phablet?" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/702943.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  A hybrid mobile device, a cross between an ordinary smartphone and a tablet computer - this is probably what this type of phones can be called, which by its technical characteristics can be attributed to a special class of mobile devices.  However, the diagonal of the screen of the phablet is still somewhat smaller than that of the Tablet PC, which, in general, is a huge plus at the time of making or receiving calls.  Let's agree: regular <span>head-end</span> communication <span>devices</span> , as well as the use of additional technical elements, do not count.  The advantage of the phablet is obvious - it can be controlled with one hand, and this is one of its main advantages! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What is he, the ideal choice of many? </h2><p>  In fact, it is impossible to single out the best phablet.  Here, as with any other comparison, the human factor remains a strong argument.  We are all different.  Some prefer sophisticated phones from a reputable manufacturer.  Another brand device can not afford, and they unwittingly become the owners of the budget model.  Third, practical representatives of mankind, opt for a device that meets their optimal needs. </p>

    <p>  As a rule, in the latter case, the desired quality still depends on the financial capabilities of the person.  Therefore (for the sake of practicality), the main emphasis in the article is made on inexpensive modifications of the specified type of devices. </p><h2>  Fablet Budget Representatives </h2><p>  Knowing what a phablet is, pay attention to the Xiaomi Redmi Note model. </p><ul><li>  The central processor is the 8-core <span>MediaTek MT6592.</span> </li><li>  Graphics - Mali-450MP4. </li><li>  IPS display - 5.5 inches. </li><li>  RAM - 2 GB. </li><li>  Built-in memory - 8 GB, expandable up to 32 GB. </li><li>  The phablet is running Android OS. </li><li>  The main optics are 13 megapixels, autofocus and flash. </li><li>  Front camera - 5 megapixels. </li><li>  Communication features: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and A-GPS. </li><li>  Gyroscope, accelerometer, electronic compass, attendance and proximity sensors. </li><li>  3200 mAh Li-ion battery. </li><li>  With a mass of 199 g, the device has dimensions of 154x78.7x9.5 mm. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chinese phablet" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/702968.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><p>  This Chinese phablet has already taken a fairly strong position in the market for such devices.  Attractive price and excellent quality of the device are the reasons for its popularity. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The next product from the Middle Kingdom - Goclever Quantum 600 </h2><p>  Slightly inferior to the above device in terms of performance characteristics, this device has a wider screen diagonal of 6 inches.  Despite the weaker processor parameters, this device is the best phablet in its class when financial capabilities somewhat limit a person on the way to a dream.  However, an incredibly pleasant ratio of price and quality will please the owner of the realism of the reproduced video and other kind of graphic content. </p>

    <p>  The Broadcom VideoCore IV quad-core processor and graphics do a good job with a variety of gaming applications.  The main camera of the phablet has 8-megapixel optics.  As you know, the photos are excellent and do not cause users any particular complaints.  The phone has <span>a</span> 2800 mAh lithium-ion <span>battery</span> and runs under the Android operating system.  The communication capabilities are the same as those of the model discussed above. </p><h2>  Well, the last representative of the budget class - phablet Zifro </h2><p>  A Russian company with Chinese roots - this is how you can designate the manufacturer of this product.  However, despite the ubiquitous "celestial stereotype", the ZIFRO 6.0 "ZT-6001 is worthy of all praise. The 6-inch touch screen and a frisky 2-core processor in tandem with the Mali 400MP2 graphics accelerator will not disappoint its new owner. </p>

    <p>  The standard 2-megapixel main camera is not capable of taking super-high-quality photographs, however, when choosing the right angle of lighting, good photographs are guaranteed.  Communication capabilities are almost identical to the parameters of previous models from our review, but the amount of RAM is inferior to the above modifications and is only 1 GB.  However, understanding what a phablet is, and taking into account the cost of the device at 4,500 rubles, perhaps someone will consider this option more than acceptable. </p><h2>  Gold "middling" </h2><p>  Those who vitally need to meet a certain status will have to fork out.  However, for especially practical ones there are also options.  Perhaps, after the reader gets acquainted with some modifications of the premium class, he will understand that the ‚Äúbells and whistles‚Äù present in them, in general, are not needed at all. </p><h2>  Today's Leader: Samsung Galaxy Note Edge </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Phablet price" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/702967.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  The 2015 novelty from the Korean manufacturer has now become available for the Russian market of mobile communication devices.  The slightly changed functionality of the fourth predecessor surprises with an elegant side addition.  <span>The clock frequency of the</span> central processor has increased its already productive run to 2.7 GHz.  All kinds of "buns" and additions, such as a heart rate sensor, excite the minds of lovers of new sensations.  There were no fundamental changes in optics, but the <span>battery</span> capacity decreased and began to correspond to a value of 3000 mAh.  A phablet, the price of which is 59,000 rubles, is really a valuable thing.  Nevertheless, it is unlikely that such stunning functionality will be fully demanded, because for left-handed people, side embellishments are useless, and the battery, when the OS is under heavy load, inexorably ‚Äúmelts‚Äù before our eyes.  Well, the last thing that will happen if a slippery device falls with an unprotected display on a hard surface?  You better not even imagine the scale of the consequences, as they are terrifying. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Of course, exclusive phablets, the review of which was somewhat superficial, cause special feelings for their owners.  In practical life, however, things are a little different.  A fairly wide selection of products is presented in the budget class of devices.  Competition forces manufacturers to fill their devices with newer and newer technological solutions.  Note that the price remains the same, and the functionality increases several times.  No need to wait, choose your phablet today, but remember: you can‚Äôt keep up with fashion.  Reasonable decisions for you! </p>
