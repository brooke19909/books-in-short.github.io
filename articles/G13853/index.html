Every day a huge number of orders are made out on the site.  People from different parts of the world on ‚ÄúAliexpress‚Äù buy clothes, shoes, cosmetics, equipment, goods for recreation, sports and entertainment.  When placing orders, some buyers encounter certain difficulties.  Some people don‚Äôt know how to fill in the delivery address on Aliexpress.  Let's pay attention to this issue. </p><h2>  Why is it important to fill in the address correctly? </h2><p>  The speed of delivery of goods depends largely on buyers.  Parcels are often delayed due to the fact that people incorrectly fill out the order card on the website of the online hypermarket.  First of all, it is worth noting that all the necessary information is indicated not in Russian, but in Latin.  The delivery address in the form of a sticker is printed by the seller.  He does this with the help of special programs.  Sometimes they incorrectly recognize the Russian language.  Inexplicable characters are printed instead of readable text. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to fill in the delivery address on aliexpress" class="if" height="433" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/1154273.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  If you are thinking about how to fill in the delivery address on Aliexpress, then remember that you do not need to write information in English.  For example, you need to indicate "High Street" when placing an order.  Translating this phrase into English, you will write street High.  When the ordered product arrives in Russia, it will fall into the hands of postal workers.  They will not be able to understand what street is indicated in the delivery address. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Filling in the address in your account </h2><p>  There are two ways to fill in the delivery address on Aliexpress.  The first of them is an indication of the necessary information in your personal account: </p><ul><li>  log in to your account first; </li><li>  in the upper right corner click on the link "My AliExpress"; </li><li>  on the page that opens, familiarize yourself with the menu on the left; </li><li>  Select "Delivery Addresses". <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="filling in the delivery address on aliexpress" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/1155123.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><p>  After completing all these steps, you will be taken to a page with an empty form on which you can begin filling out the delivery address on Aliexpress.  You will see the following fields: </p><ul><li>  receiver name; </li><li>  country / region; </li><li>  Street, house, flat; </li><li>  town; </li><li>  region / region / region; </li><li>  postcode; </li><li>  telephone; </li><li>  mobile phone. </li></ul><p>  In the first line, indicate your name, surname and middle name.  Country and region <span>(region, region)</span> select from the drop-down list.  Write the required information in the remaining fields. </p><h2>  Filling in the address at checkout </h2><p>  The essence of the second method is to indicate the delivery address when making a purchase.  Choose the item, item or item that you want to purchase.  On the product page, click Buy Now.  After that, the delivery address form will open.  Fill in all the fields. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you need to buy several products, then first add them to the "Cart".  Then go into it and click "Place an order."  On the page that opens, you can specify the delivery address.  Be sure to check the order details.
