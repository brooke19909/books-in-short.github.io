  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Economic valuation of investments as a way to control investments</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Economic <span>evaluation of investments</span> implies a competent policy of financial distribution.  Any business can, in fact, be profitable, but it always depends on consumers who rationally think and compare.  Due to this reason, a business may become uncompetitive in terms of price.  There are several criteria on which a lot depends.  For example, the presence of a brand status of a product.  What is a brand?  This is a way, a kind of advertising.  And the economic assessment of investment involves brand development.  The result is an increase in turnover and profits. </p><p>  In fact, it is believed that the economic valuation of investments is a long-term investment.  The goal is quite clear - getting huge economic (financial) benefits in the future. <br>  To make investment decisions, you need to correctly distribute accounting, company activities and, of course, management tasks.  To work with the greatest efficiency, the economic assessment of investments must be properly adjusted.  This is a description of the <span>socio-economic environment,</span> which should be as natural and objectively real as possible, this is the presence of productive forces, and <span>material resources.</span>  Evaluation of the effectiveness of real investments is usually carried out by a professional who is well versed in this area. </p><p>  Assessment of investment activity implies all points of favorable characteristics combined.  First of all, the compensation of the funds invested in the enterprise should apply.  This reimbursement is provided by income from the sale of goods or the sale of services.  Secondly, the profit should not be lower than what the company needs at the moment.  Assessment of investment activity also implies a payback within the set deadline. <br>  Simply put, if the amount of investment is greater than the profit received, then the economic efficiency of the investment is reduced to zero or even acquires a negative balance.  To correctly match capitals, it is advisable to use a system of quantitative indicators that show a real table of expenses and incomes. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In general, the whole and constructive work to identify the effectiveness of economic investments implies the following: correctly analyze and identify the entire <span>investment project.</span> <br>  The correctness of the <span>calculations of the effectiveness</span> of investment appraisal implies the full accuracy of forecasts. </p><p>  Separate operating and investment costs.  Investment costs are costs at the initial stage of a project.  That is, the organization of the costs of creating designs for the future company.  The amount of fixed capital and <span>current assets</span> determine investment costs. <br>  When the company begins to manufacture and sell its products, there comes a period of operating costs.  They are divided into constants and variables. </p><p>  <span>Fixed costs,</span> in turn, are divided into trade or administrative, as well as operational.  The costs associated with production are called operational. <br>  The remaining costs, including the costs of modernizing the market, the maintenance of workers, payment of various services are called trade and administrative costs. </p><p>  When compiling an assessment, one should take into account constant inflation in the world market. A competent assessment of investment activity is usually carried out using specially developed algorithms with the involvement of professionals in this field. In this case, you can count on an absolutely reliable picture and, as a result, an effective adjustment of the process if necessary. </p><p>  In general, we can say that the economic assessment of investments consists of many different factors and their correct assessment is crucial not only to preserve but also to increase the available working capital of both large enterprises and private investors. </p>
