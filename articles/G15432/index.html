It was here that Rhea in the cave sheltered the future Thunderer Zeus from Kronos, and Minos with the help of Daedalus built the maze in which the Minotaur lived.  Objects associated with these myths still exist.  And besides these attractions, Crete has excellent beaches, amazing sea and lots of entertainment for every taste.  You can stay in a cozy and inexpensive hotel Lefkoniko Beach 3 *.  Rethymno - the town in which it is located - also deserves attention.  There are the most comfortable beaches with clean water, and on the old streets, guests are always welcome in large and small taverns, where they will offer the most delicious dishes with a smile.  Lefkoniko Beach does everything possible so that tourists can relax after an eventful day.  Many of those who have been here once certainly want to return again. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lefkoniko beach 3" class="if" height="329" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/736024.jpg" width="439"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  In the ancient town of Rethymnon, which is located in the north-west of Crete, the doors of Lefkoniko Beach 3 * hotel are hospitably open.  78 km from the famous Heraklion, the capital of the island, it is 60 km from the original and unique Chania.  The settlement on this place existed in the Neolithic period.  Since then, to this day, a lot of different events have taken place here, the memory of which is preserved by ancient buildings, streets and squares.  The hotel is only a 5-6 minute walk from the historic city center.  There is a pedestrian zone, so you can‚Äôt access by transport.  But there is a highway next to the hotel, which is very convenient for those who are going to travel around the island by car or bus.  Across the road begins the promenade with the beach.  Turning right, you can reach the exit from the city, as well as a small port with boats and yachts.  Turning left, you can stroll to the central harbor called Venetian.  Ferries from the islands and pleasure boats arrive here. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the streets next to the Lefkoniko Beach 3 * hotel and in the whole town there are a lot of shops with all kinds of goods, vegetable stalls, confectioneries, here called ‚Äúzaharoplastio‚Äù, small cafes, taverns, restaurants.  Literally a couple of dozen steps away is a supermarket where there are often promotions and discounts.  In the center of Rethymnon there are several discos and clubs in which music is played until the morning.  This is a big plus for those hotel guests who came to Crete to have fun.  A feature of Lefkoniko Beach is that next to it, just 20 meters away, is the Lefkoniko Bay Hotel.  Guests of both hotels can use a common restaurant, attend entertainment programs. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lefkoniko beach bay 3" class="if" height="317" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/736026.jpg" width="436"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The Lefkoniko Beach 3 * hotel (Greece) has the main restaurant Othello, located in the building, the Alasia restaurant in the open air and two bars - one in the lobby, the second by the pool.  Buying a tour to this hotel, you can arrange the all-inclusive system, breakfasts and dinners, only breakfasts or no meals at all.  Each option has its own advantages, but given that many rooms have kitchens, and literally around the corner of the hotel there is an inexpensive supermarket, it is more economical to cook on your own.  For those who are not going to spend time near the stove on vacation, it also makes sense to arrange a tour only with breakfasts and dinners or only with breakfasts, because next to the hotel there are cafes and taverns for every taste and budget near the hotel.  Every day you can choose something new.  For those who don‚Äôt like the hassle, the all-inclusive system is ideal, especially since the hotel cooks well.  The only caveat - there will not be a wide variety of dishes, but the waiters will offer drinks for free. </p><p>  Breakfast here is organized according to the self-service system <span>(buffet).</span>  The menu is European.  Cereals, milk, sausages, ham, eggs, bread, rolls or muffins, butter, cheese, jam, fruits are offered.  From drinks there is milk, coffee, tea, juice.  Greek and European dishes are served for lunch and dinner, including meat, fish and seafood, vegetables, pasta, rice.  For guests of Lefkoniko Beach Bay 3 * breakfast, lunch and dinner are also served at this hotel.

    <h2>  Beach and weather in Rethymnon </h2><p>  Both hotels are located within walking distance from the coast.  The beach here is sandy, the sea is clean.  In general, in Rethymnon all the beaches are wonderful.  Therefore, they are constantly honored with the Blue Flag.  Sunset in the sea on the beach at the hotel is gentle, which is convenient for families with children.  Sun beds and umbrellas are always available.  Guests of Lefkoniko Beach 3 * reviews on beach vacations leave the most favorable.  The promenade stretches for many kilometers from the hotel.  It is nice to not only sunbathe, but also just take a walk in the morning or evening hours.  By the way, in Rethymnon there are places on the shore where turtles swim in the summer to lay eggs.  If you are lucky, you can watch this interesting action. </p><p>  The weather in Rethymnon and Crete is generally favorable.  In summer, rains are very rare.  The air temperature in July and August reaches +35, and the water temperature +25 degrees.  But from mid-July, winds begin, so the sea often has waves.  In May and June, the weather for recreation is also very good, the air temperature during the day is rarely below +25 degrees, and often reaches +30.  Rains can be found in May, and even then insignificant.  But the water in these months is still cool, up to +22.  September is the perfect month to relax.  In the afternoon, the air still warms up to +30, the water is very warm, there is no rain. </p>

    <h2>  Leisure </h2><p>  Regarding the animation, the tourists who had a rest in Lefkoniko Beach 3 * (Crete) leave mixed reviews.  Some people like Greek evenings arranged here with national music, dances and songs, some mention tables that are bursting with food these days, and some write about noise that keeps you awake.  In order not to interfere with fun, you need to book rooms away from the bar and restaurant, then the noise will not be heard.  Such evenings are held approximately once a week.  On the remaining days, everyone entertains himself.  Animations, like in Turkey or Egypt, are not here.  But the hotel is located near the city center, where you can always find a bar, restaurant or tavern with live music, as well as disco clubs with dancing until the morning. </p><p>  For relaxation, there are two spacious pools in Lefkoniko Beach 3 *.  Photos of tourists demonstrate how good they are.  One has hydromassage jets.  Around the pools there are a sufficient number of sunbeds and umbrellas.  Active recreation involves various sports games - darts, billiards, table tennis. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Arriving in Crete, it is difficult to spend the whole vacation on the beach, and even more so in a hotel.  Undoubtedly, I want to admire the beauty of the island, to see its unique monuments.  For more mobile movement, everyone can rent a car or motorcycle.  In Rethymno, there are many offices offering a wide variety of vehicles, and there is a free car park near the hotel.  Alternatively, you can travel around the island by bus.  The bus station is far from the hotel, but buses from it depart to either end of the island.  Rethymno itself is also interesting, especially its old part, where there is a Venetian fortress, a port, a beautiful old fountain, several museums.  Location Lefkoniko Beach 3 * is extremely convenient for walking along the streets of the city with a visit to all its attractions. </p><h2>  Additional Information </h2><p>  This hotel is presented in some brochures as Lefkoniko Beach 4 *, but in fact it is a classic Greek troika.  The price for the rooms is fully consistent with the services offered here and the quality of service.  This hotel is most suitable for recreation for people of any age, but without small children, since there is no playground, children's playroom, no babysitting services are available.  For kids, the hotel has only a children's pool and cribs (upon reservation). </p><p>  The main contingent of holidaymakers at Lefconico Beach is Germans, Swedes, and Dutch.  There are few Russian tourists.  For some this is a plus, but for someone a minus.  In July and August there are many senior citizens among the hotel guests. </p><p>  Guest reviews for Lefkoniko Beach are mostly favorable.  Among the shortcomings are mentioned: </p><ul><li>  issue of hygiene products only once upon arrival; </li><li>  not very varied breakfasts; </li><li>  small area; </li><li>  not enough good internet in the rooms; </li><li>  lack of Russian speaking staff. </li></ul><p>  The advantages of the hotel, noted by tourists, are as follows: </p><ul><li>  location; </li><li>  cleanliness of the rooms; </li><li>  responsiveness and friendliness of staff; </li><li>  full compliance of the price with quality. </li></ul>
