    <p>  High-ranking guests visited each of the halls of the aquarium and praised all the work carried out in it. </p><h2>  Grand construction </h2><p>  The official opening of the new unique facility took place on 08/05/2015. All previous work on its creation and bringing it to the level necessary for normal operation required the expenditure of a large amount of efforts of the city authorities.  The working name that the aquarium received is Moskvarium. </p><p>  The grandeur of the object, first of all, lies in its scale.  Throughout Europe, there is no such type of structure that could be comparable in size to the Moscow Aquarium.  Grandiose and the filling of the halls.  Located a few thousand kilometers from the waters of the oceans, Moskvarium holds 25 million liters of water, in which 700 tons of sea salt are dissolved.  The imagination and the number of attractions of the aquarium are amazing.  In addition to numerous sea and river inhabitants, here you can see belugas, killer whales and dolphins, which not all such objects can boast. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Aquarium area </h2><p>  This first exposition of the Moscow Aquarium is located on an area of ‚Äã‚Äã12 thousand square meters.  meters.  According to visitors' reviews, this territory simply fascinates everyone who gets here.  There are eighty aquariums and pools of impressive size.  Moreover, these structures were built according to special projects in such a way as to be as convenient as possible for their inhabitants.  But not only this is unique "Moskvarium."  Visitors' reviews also testify to the surprisingly convenient placement of aquariums and pools, which makes it possible to observe the underwater world in all its glory. </p><p>  Having passed a 600-meter route between tanks containing almost 3 million liters of water, adults and children can admire representatives of freshwater and marine fauna living in various bodies of water from Lake Baikal to the Galapagos Islands, from Kamchatka to Greenland, from the Great Barrier Reef to Icelandic fjords.  These are various marine animals, starting from the smallest living in corals, to three-meter sharks.  Visitors are also interested in freshwater species of fish that live in the rivers of Russia.  These are mustard and spike, stickleback, sturgeon and many others. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The fauna that lives in the White Sea is also widely represented in the Moskvarium. Among its representatives there is a whole school of peled, consisting of 400 animals.  But this is not all that Moskvarium can please us with.  Visitors' reviews tell about amazing exotic specimens: cold-water bodies and cuttlefish from the southern Indian Ocean, spawning cyprinids, shark-shovels, armored pikes, seahorses and stingrays. </p><h2>  Aquarium Tour </h2><p>  The largest aquarium in Europe is visited by a huge number of people who want to see the underwater world.  For those who do not like to stand in long lines at the ticket office, Moskvarium (VDNH) offers tickets to purchase on its official website online.  Having printed them on the printer, you can immediately approach the turnstiles. </p><p>  The first exhibition area is located on the ground floor.  Before the turnstiles, you can linger a bit, admiring the unique information board, the inscriptions on which are created with the help of falling water drops. </p><p>  What is the first thing that Moskvarium offers to watch?  Visitors' reviews indicate that at the very beginning of the exposition there are freshwater fish of Russian rivers and stingrays.  You can see them in the original ring aquarium.  Here the fish swiftly swim in a circle, and visitors can watch them not only outside, but also inside the ring.  Next come the pools.  In some of them, aquatic inhabitants can not only be observed, but also touched by hands. </p>

A magnificent view of the killer whales opens from its platform.  Of course, the prices in this establishment are not budgetary, however, refreshment and quench your thirst here is quite realistic.  It is not easy to see killer whales.  Their appearance must still wait.  However, when predators of enormous size appear behind the glass, the audience should not be delighted.  After this small show, the visitors' route lies again on the ground floor, where they are met by fish brought from all over the world.  Here you can see both the most harmless waterfowl and terrible predators.

    <p>  So, gradually moving along the six-meter route, the audience gets to the main attraction of this amazing structure, which is considered the Main Marine Aquarium with a tunnel.  Here sharks slowly swim overhead.  You can either stand next to this aquarium or sit on soft black poufs made in the form of stones.  According to visitors' reviews, I want to stay here as long as possible.  The sight is simply fascinated by gray predators swimming in large circles.  And when the sharks move closer to the glass, it becomes creepy from their sharp teeth and fixed eyes.  From time to time, divers appear in the aquarium.  And then the viewers are literally stuck in glass. </p><p>  Many people wonder if sharks will attack people or not.  However, it is worth mentioning that even in the wild, gray predators, as a rule, do not prey on humans. </p>

About once every three days, as it happens in vivo.  Divers feed the predators using special long tweezers.  The movement of this device in water imitates a fleeing victim.  Only in this case, sharks will be fed, because aristocratic predators will not pick up food from the floor.  They used to grab food only on the go.

Of course, near each reservoir there is information about its inhabitants, located on the tablet, but I would like to listen to a more detailed story of a specialist.  Unfortunately, to date, excursions are conducted only as group tours for 25-35 people.

    <p>  The employees of the Moskvarium intend to conduct various thematic tours in the future, as well as to collect schoolchildren for extracurricular activities.  Material for such visits is already available.  This, for example, is a huge octopus, which sometimes literally dances at the bottom of its aquarium. </p><p>  Enthusiastic visitor reviews deserve stingrays.  They literally fly out to the audience from the depths of their aquarium like fabulous bird animals.  If you admire this amazing sight for a long time, then each of you will certainly have the impression of merging with an unusual magical world. </p><p>  Many of the adult visitors like to look at crocodiles.  Reptiles sit in an aquarium with only their eyes above the surface of the water.  Surely they think they have carefully disguised themselves.  However, their bodies are clearly visible under water, and looking at this spectacle is very interesting.  And many visitors are attracted by piranhas. </p><p>  Who else demonstrates the recently opened Moskvarium?  Visitors' reviews enthusiastically tell about such a rare inhabitant of the aquatic fauna as the two-clawed tortoise.  She is the only member of the family of soft-bodied turtles.  The delight of the audience and the <span>shell pike.</span>  She is a direct relative of the inhabitants of the Cretaceous period. </p><p>  An unusual surprise awaits the audience at the exit from the aquarium exposition.  This is a large body of water in which <span>Baikal seals</span> swim <span>.</span>  You can watch these fidgets for quite some time.  They either fight with each other, then hide, then frolic, then swim. </p><h2>  Get to know better ... </h2><p>  There is a touch-pool zone in the Moskvarium.  Here, some underwater inhabitants such as small needle tails and starfish can be touched by anyone, without raising them to the surface.  According to visitors' reviews, not only children, but also adults love this area.  Everything is provided for the convenience of the kids.  They can stand on stools to easily put their hands in the water.  So happens their maybe first acquaintance with wildlife. </p><h2>  Work of the Center specialists </h2><p>  Each of the visitors is amazed at the volume of the water world collected in the Moskvarium.  And, of course, maintaining all this huge economy at the right level is worth a lot of effort.  Temperature and technical conditions of aquariums are strictly controlled by automation.  Forty-seven engineering systems are continuously operating in the complex.  They purify air and water.  But, despite this, the technical specialists of the oceanarium exercise additional control over all systems in manual mode.  This is necessary in order to prevent any, even the slightest malfunction. </p><p>  The state of the <span>microflora of water is</span> analyzed using a computer.  At the same time, specialists take such samples manually.  To maintain the salt state of the water each month, the aquarium uses 80 tons of salt. </p><p>  Medical examinations of its inhabitants are regularly conducted at the Moskvarium.  For this, the laboratory of the complex has all the necessary equipment.  Using modern devices, specialists conduct gastroscopic, radiological and dental examinations of fish and animals.  Bacteriological and cytological studies are conducted here. </p><h2>  Dolphin Swimming Center </h2><p>  In this area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe aquarium there are seven pools.  In each of them it will be possible to swim in a cheerful company of friendly dolphins.  Of course, all this will be accompanied by experienced coaches.  In 2016, plans to open this area Moskvarium.  Dolphins today do not live there, and there is no way to swim with them. </p><h2>  Main hall </h2><p>  All shows in the Moskvarium are held in this area.  Visitors are offered unique performances with such marine artists as: </p><p>  - walruses; <br>  - South American sea lions; <br>  - killer whales; <br>  - beluga whales. </p>

So, from Monday to Thursday for an adult you will need to pay 600 rubles., And for a child - 400 rubles.  But this is only from the beginning of the opening of the aquarium to 16.00.
