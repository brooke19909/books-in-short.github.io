    <h2>  First composition </h2><p>  The house is traditionally decorated in a special way, and baskets with attributes and symbols of the day are placed on the table.  As a rule, Easter songs are placed nearby.  A master class on creating such decorative elements is given below.  For composition you will need: </p><ul><li>  a glass vase with a width of about 10 cm, preferably rounded; </li><li>  rods of red wire and rattan or any other with flexibility; </li><li>  wool yarn in natural green colors; </li><li>  decorative corrugated paper for buds and leaves; </li><li>  green wire; </li><li>  decorative red small pebbles or soil; </li><li>  round sweets; </li><li>  <span>decorative bird</span> of feathers; </li><li>  a thread; </li><li>  glue; </li><li>  Scotch. </li></ul><h2>  Manufacture </h2><ol><li>  The Easter composition will be supplemented with willow and snowdrop branches.  This will give it a tradition.  From the branches a bird's nest will be made - a symbol typical for Easter.  If rattan is used, then for convenience, before starting work, lower its branches in boiling water for several minutes.  It is best to take a glass vase with a rounded bottom and low so that the Easter composition has a more natural shape.  At the bottom you need to pour a decorative red layer.  Bending the rods around the circumference, you should place them in the vase alternately in color.  Thus, the base of the nest is ready.  A small bouquet made of artificial lilies of the valley and a fragment of a willow branch will look good in the center.  For better fixation, the stems need to be rewound with several threads of different <span>shades of green.</span> </li><li>  Next, you need to make corrugated paper petals for flowers and willows from white, brown and any other tone that is suitable for decorating buds.  The wire will act as stems.  Each should be attached evenly leaflets.  To do this, it is enough to wrap the wire several times with paper and fix it with adhesive tape.  At this stage, you can stop, get a wonderful variety <span>of flower arrangements</span> for Easter. </li></ol><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="compositions for easter" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/807188.jpg" width="569"></div></h2><h2>  If you want with sweets </h2><ol><li>  As you remember, initially it was supposed to make a variant with sweets.  So you should complete what you started.  Namely, each candy must be wrapped with petals.  Close in color buds will look good.  For example, pink and lilac or lilac, as well as saturated red and muted orange.  From white and brown blanks, it is necessary to form the blossomed willow buds.  After all, it is she who is one of the symbols of the Easter holiday.  Home decoration in the form of a bird's nest, decorated with flowers and willow, is almost ready. </li><li>  It remains only to stick the branches into the base of the bent rods <span>tangentially to the circle.</span>  In the center of the nest decorated with flowers, you can put a bird made of feathers. </li><li>  Additionally, the vase can be decorated with beads or transparent crystals.  These elements are best fixed with liquid glue.  In the spring, upon return, the birds make nests, which has already been done, and hatch eggs.  Since the dyes will be too large for this composition, you can put small round candies.  There are confectionery factories that produce chocolate in the form of eggs, resembling quail in size.  Easter composition of sweets and flowers is ready.  It can be placed right in the center of the festive table or near it. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Product manufacturing process </h2><ol><li>  An easter composition made of sweets is laid in the form of a wicker basket.  Napkins or a towel should be laid at the bottom.  From thin ribbons of yellow and white, you can simulate a litter of hay.  In the center of the composition you need to place an animal figurine.  The chicken, around which the painted eggs will be located, will look best.  But if another animal appears in the center, this will not ruin the view. </li><li>  The handle of the wicker basket must be tied with ribbons, like a serpentine.  If desired, small flowers can be placed between the rods, which will add a sophisticated composition.  On brown rods of the basket, ribbons of red and yellow shades look good.  If the tree is lighter, then the composition should be decorated with elements of soft and <span>pastel colors.</span> </li><li>  Easter composition may consist of traditional products, such as Easter cake and painted chicken eggs.  To do this, a beautiful napkin is laid on the bottom in a wicker basket.  An Easter cake is laid on it, around which eggs are placed.  On the edge of the basket, in a circle, you need to stick in the branches of fresh flowers and thin twigs of willow.  If fancy Easter is quite tiny, then painted <span>quail eggs</span> will look more harmonious <span>.</span>  Such a composition will conveniently be carried to church or to guests. </li></ol>
