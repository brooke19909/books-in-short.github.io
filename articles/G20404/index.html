Someone creates a fundamentally new device, and someone, without bothering, just changes the color of the phone.  One way or another, sorting out such a variety is not so simple.  Today we look at Highscreen Power <span>Rage, reviews</span> about which are quite controversial. </p><h2>  What is who? </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the smartphone appeared relatively recently.  Its developer is a Russian company that has already produced more than one phone under this name.  A direct competitor to Highscreen Power Rage, popularly called "Furious", remains Highscreen Power Ice ("Icy").  Many users are sure that it is Ice that deserves more worship.  But for some reason, the presentation showed exactly Highscreen Power Rage Black.  Reviews appeared immediately after the announcement and release of the phone for sale. </p><h2>  What's in the box? </h2><p>  The first thing that raises the question among buyers is the equipment.  The fact is that the whole headset is white.  Of course, it is suitable for those who bought Highscreen Power Rage White.  Reviews of the owners of phones of a different color are negative.  Let's say the gold or black version with white headphones looks strange.  By the way, the bumper for Highscreen Power Rage became a real gift.  Reviews in most cases are positive, although many say that the transparent cover is plastic, and therefore often bursts in the corners. </p>

    <p>  The box also contains the smartphone itself, and to it, of course, a network cable, USB, warranty card, instructions, as well as, as already mentioned, a headset and a bumper.  Outwardly, the box is white and blue, on one side of which the characteristics of the phone are schematically indicated. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Fat and heavy </h2><p>  What does a Highscreen Power Rage smartphone look like?  Customer reviews regarding appearance are very different.  Someone likes the weight of the phone and its thickness, someone is used to the leading flagships, and cannot accept such a “fat man”.  In general, the gadget in itself has gathered a lot of details that can be found in the familiar Nokia, XTS or Samsung.  Despite this, the designers were able to create and preserve something individual and memorable for the model. </p><p>  The smart itself got such an appearance thanks to its capacious battery.  The thickness of the gadget is as much as 9.6 millimeters, of course, compared to its older brother Highscreen Power Four it is small (that one had a thickness of 11.2 mm), but the already familiar Ice one was able to successfully reduce its bulges to 8.5 mm. </p><p>  In addition, reviews about the Highscreen Power Rage phone touched on its weight.  Because of the metal elements, it turned out as much as 200 grams.  But you do not need to think that this is an impenetrable smart.  The metal here is only edged, while the back cover itself is made of high-quality plastic.  The front of the phone is protected by Asahi glass.  It is rounded to the edges, which repeats the design of many new products this year.  An <span>oleophobic coating has been</span> added to the display <span>,</span> which allows you to keep the phone spotless and comfortable to use. </p><p>  Thanks to its shapes, the Highscreen Power Rage smartphone is quite comfortable in the hand.  Reviews sometimes open up the other side of the coin.  It turns out that in practice it is quite slippery, and in a hurry it can easily be dropped. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Poetic colors </h2><p>  As mentioned above, the device is prepared in four colors.  The manufacturer calls them very poetic: exquisitely black, which has a classic black color;  snow white, which also turned out to be ordinary;  gloomy gray does not look very gloomy, this color more closely resembles something between blue and steel;  as well as luxurious gold, which is more similar to beige and pink. </p><h2>  Beauty in detail </h2><p>  On the back there is a camera, an LED flash, and a speaker below.  In the front are <span>proximity</span> and lighting <span>sensors</span> , a front camera, a speaker and the classic three touch buttons.  The developers promised a great sound for Highscreen Power Rage.  Owner reviews do not always confirm this promise.  Some were unhappy with the lack of low frequencies and the presence of noise.  Although, as practice shows, the crucial role is the assembly of the smartphone. </p>

    <p>  The power and volume buttons were on the right side panel.  They have no highlights and are made in a simple style.  The smartphone has got a removable back cover, under which the battery is hidden (we'll talk about it a bit later), as well as slots for two SIM cards and a memory card. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Basically, the developers made a high-quality assembly of Highscreen Power Rage.  Reviews are not always identical.  Some users get a stronger model, others complain that the device is backlash.  Everything, of course, also depends on factory automation.  So when buying, you need to carefully check all the details in order to change the phone on time. </p><h2>  What hides a beautiful picture </h2><p>  We have already figured out how the Highscreen Power Rage smartphone looks like.  Reviews of the display bring us closer to the technical component.  Therefore, we will talk more about this part of the device. </p><p>  The diagonal of the display is 5 inches.  This screen size is quite popular among other models.  Smart does not seem like a “shovel," but it’s also comfortable watching movies on it.  The screen is coated with anti-reflective coating.  In principle, it would have been worse without him.  The display is wide relative to the entire case, on the sides it has about 4 mm of frame, on top and bottom 16 and 17 mm, respectively. </p><p>  About the Highscreen Power Rage Blue smartphone, the reviews regarding the display are positive.  The owners were pleased with the HD resolution with an aspect ratio of 16: 9 and 293 pixels per inch.  The image is quite contrasting, and at maximum brightness it is clearly visible even on the beach on a sunny day.  The display is sensitive in moderation, phantom clicks are not observed, and the smart promptly responds to commands.  Viewing angles are low, and with a certain tilt, the screen begins to purple.  From the pleasant it is worth highlighting that the display can be awakened with a double “tap”. </p><h2>  "Furious" </h2><p>  Well, finally we got to the main highlight - the battery in Highscreen Power Rage Gold.  The reviews, surprisingly, were also controversial.  Some took the device specifically for a capacity of 4000 mAh, but it turned out that the smart worked on a par with devices with 2500 mAh.  Someone, on the contrary, kept the phone for several days with moderate use. </p><p>  On average, the smart indicators are as follows: with Wi-Fi turned on, the background of social networks, an hour of calls, as well as 5-6 hours of 3G, the device lasted 3 days, which, of course, is unrealistic pleasing. </p>

    <p>  If you turn off power saving and use the phone for a long time, then it will last a little more than two days.  Continuous games last only 7 hours, and watching videos in maximum resolution - 10 hours.  All these indicators are rather arbitrary.  The thing is that again, sometimes the assembly fails.  Some smartphones of this model last three days, some do not do without daily charging. </p><p>  By the way, the included network adapter turned out to be a little more powerful than in previous models, which means that the charging process will be faster. </p><h2>  For communication </h2><p>  It is worth noting that received Highscreen Power Rage Gold feedback on communication is generally positive.  Smart can contact with 2G / 3G GSM / GPRS / EDGE networks, that is, with a standard set.  But the fourth-generation connection is not worthy of this device.  By the way, this drawback remains strange enough now, considering that earlier models of the manufacturer have this advantage. </p><p>  Some owners complained about GPS inaccuracy.  They say that he makes a mistake of 20 meters. Most likely, this is due to the lack of GLONASS.  But the plus in this story is that the satellite navigation system comes into operation quickly. </p>

    <p>  The phone is available standard Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0 and USB 2.0.  By the way, the latter supports the ability to charge the phone from other devices, a laptop or portable charging. </p><h2>  What is your memory? </h2><p>  The internal memory of the Highscreen Power Rage is 16 GB.  Reviews mostly relate to RAM.  Here 2 GB, of which free - 1300 MB.  It seems that this should be enough, but there are such applications that most of them are installed on RAM.  Also, over time, “gray sectors” may appear that fill the RAM and cause braking on the smartphone.  Although the latter case is a rarity. </p><p>  Of 16 GB of internal memory, about 10-11 GB is usually available.  But if this is not enough, the phone has a slot for a memory card, the maximum amount of which reaches as much as 64 GB.  It turns out that the developers have created only one version, and customers are available smartphone Highscreen Power Rage 16 GB.  Owner reviews about the phone's memory are also positive.  Although there are assemblies of the device, for which the 64 GB memory card for some reason is not supported. </p><h2>  Take a photo of me </h2><p>  The camera in the smartphone is ordinary.  The main one is 8 megapixels, the front one is 5 megapixels.  This part of the device has not been changed since previous versions.  For the rear camera, the aperture shows 2.2, for the front - 2.8.  LED flash saves when you need to take a picture at night. </p><p>  In general, for a smartphone of this class, only 8 megapixels is a strange solution.  But it turned out that thanks to the resolution of the images, the quality is no worse than 13 megapixels.  Detailing at a high level, noise is observed only when shooting at night.  <span>White balance is</span> accurate and does not fail at the wrong time.  This is all about the main camera. </p>

    <p>  Frontal, by the way, is also not inferior to quality.  Does not distort the face and colors.  Grain in the dark, but this is not surprising.  In the light, the picture is very high quality, so selfie pictures can safely be sent to social networks.  A selection of effects, editing, modes and other manual settings is available in the camera menu. </p><p>  The camera also responds well to video shooting.  Writes clips with a resolution of FullHD and a speed of 27 frames per second.  If the street is dark, then it costs 16 frames per second.  When shooting movies, the clarity is good, noises are observed only in poor lighting.  Sometimes problems arise with focus, it is not always accurate and very slow.  The sound in the camera is slightly above average.  The front camera can also shoot video, but in HD quality. </p><h2>  Powerful and nimble </h2><p>  And what is our Highscreen Power Rage Gold smartphone?  Customer reviews agree on this issue.  This is not the most powerful and fastest phone on the market, but even cool games run at minimal or medium settings.  For many users, the chipset of the MediaTek MT6580 device says little.  This Taiwanese detail appeared relatively recently, and so far not much is known about it.  A processor with 4 cores, each with a capacity of up to 1300 MHz. </p>

    <p>  Mali-400 MP2 is responsible for the graphics and shows a fairly stable result.  "Walking" on the smartphone is smooth and comfortable, in games, as mentioned earlier, there are no lags, but this is if you choose the optimal graphics settings.  Although some users were able to notice something strange: during the game, the image on the screen does not keep up with the teams.  Is it possible to attribute a similar problem to the “lags”? </p><p>  The test in Antutu was successful.  On average, he shows a stable result.  But unlike the flagships, of course, it is noticeably behind.  For example, the performance indicator of the popular Samsung Galaxy S6 has almost 77 thousand, but Highscreen Power Rage - only 24 000. </p><h2>  Little frog in a box </h2><p>  The new model received an operating system represented by Android 5.1.  But you should prepare in advance for the fact that the smartphone is unlikely to receive the 6th version of the “Android”.  Unless the user himself will have to upgrade the phone to the new OS or wait for favors from the developers with the update. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="highscreen power rage blue reviews" class="if" height="290" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1399185.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Working with Android 5.1 is correct for Highscreen Power Rage.  Customer reviews practically do not relate to the software platform.  Although once met a disgruntled owner who acquired smart for the new OS, but instead received a phone with old Android.  Perhaps this was a demo that is often put up on store windows.  With such a problem, it is better to contact sellers. </p><p>  Highscreen Power Rage 16 GB smartphone turned out to be high-quality and affordable.  User reviews about the system are positive.  The owners are glad that they are getting almost pure smart, but at the same time there is support for Google Play.  The love of flagship developers for software, which most often interfere with users, is missing here.  Highscreen Power Rage does not promote any of its programs - maybe it spares users, or maybe it has not yet developed its own projects. </p><h2>  Music louder </h2><p>  For music lovers, the developers of Highscreen Power Rage made a proprietary player.  It is quite minimalistic and comfortable to use.  There is an equalizer and ready-made presets.  The software independently searches for all existing music in the phone and launches it.  In addition, you can create folders and albums. </p><p>  By the way, there is also a selection for a certain type of headset.  Depending on what you use, the equalizer will select a specific sound quality.  It should be noted that the headset in the kit is very high quality, the sound is clean and at maximum levels quite loud.  The radio interface in the new Highscreen Power has also changed. </p><h2>  In conclusion </h2><p>  Highscreen Power Rage, reviews of which are controversial, remains a conflict of opinion for everyone.  This smart occupies the very "middle ground" on which it may not be found.  His claimed active performance in practice is not always true, and not everyone liked the look.  A huge drawback for many was the lack of LTE, that is, support for the fourth-generation mobile communications standard.  Still, in our time, many are already lacking even 3G. </p>

    <p>  User reviews indicate that this device is more suitable as an auxiliary gadget.  Despite the fact that its battery can last 3 days, the phone has two SIM slots and operational support for standard software.  Of the pluses, you can also highlight the RAM capacity of 2 GB, a high-quality “honest” camera of 8 megapixels, a good display with 2.5 D glass and a strong assembly that will not break if the smartphone slipped out of hand. </p><p>  Perhaps this phone will forever remain an unsuccessful copy of its fellow Highscreen Power Ice.  Now it is difficult to understand the reason why Vobis Computer released this model after the rather successful Ice.  The Rage came out a little unprepared and unfinished.  The fourth generation of the network was taken from him, it became thicker and heavier.  Despite some indicators, performance also got worse. </p><p>  It is interesting that the price of these devices is the same - 10,990 rubles.  But why significant gaps between the two models are observed is not yet clear.  There is only one conclusion: if you want to have a similar smartphone, it is better to take Highscreen Power Ice.  And if for some reason you do not like it externally, then you can pay attention to Rage. </p><h2>  Competitiveness </h2><p>  In addition to the main competitor Highscreen Power Rage, in the smartphone market you can see a couple more, slightly differing.  For example, a great alternative in the face of Huawei 4C Pro.  Outwardly, he is perhaps even more old-fashioned than the "Rage", but he got a better camera, although at a price of 2 thousand rubles higher. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="highscreen power rage gold reviews" class="if" height="206" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1399187.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p> There is another competitor Xiaomi Redmi 3. Its price ranges from 10 thousand rubles, it is much better in terms of performance, but you can’t officially buy it in Russia.  Although it’s still possible to purchase it.  And here is another long-lived Philips Xenium V526 LTE and completely got a battery of 5 thousand mAh.  But, unfortunately, he has less RAM, and a higher price.  Well, the last nearest competitor is the ZTE Blade X3.  Here the process is a little weaker, and the memory is less, but the price pleases - about 9 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Of course, competitors can be found among popular manufacturers such as Samsung, Nokia, Lenovo or Sony, but the above are more real rivals.  In addition, the latter, despite their similar characteristics, the price can be inflated for the brand and promotion. </p>
