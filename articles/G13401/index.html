However, the Brest region is famous not only for the memorial complex dedicated to heroes.  There are a lot of unique nature reserves and reserves, historical, architectural and cultural monuments, many other interesting tourist sites. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The Brest region is located in the southwestern part of the state of Belarus.  In the south, it shares the border with Ukraine, and in the west - with Poland. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Brest region" class="if" height="231" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/451551.jpg" width="309"></div>  The region is considered one of the most environmentally friendly in the country.  About 36% of its territory is occupied by forests, there are also marshy lowlands, which is typical for Polesie.  Hydro resources of the Brest region are the <span>rivers Pripyat,</span> Shchara, Mukhovets, <span>Western Bug,</span> many of their tributaries, large and small lakes.

In the X century, it was part of the Old Russian Principality of Turov, ruled by the descendants of Vladimir the Baptist of Russia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Brest district Brest region" class="if" height="204" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/451548.jpg" width="378"></div>  The proximity of Poland and Lithuania, as well as its location on an important trade route, made Berestenia a welcome prey.  He was conquered by the Poles, Lithuania and Prince Galitsky, who managed to capture these lands for a short time, fought for him.  The prince built a stone church of St. Peter and a defensive fortress here.  This building opened the bill of heroic resilience of the inhabitants in the fight against the invaders, many times helping to withstand sieges and assaults.  Since the XIV century, the Berestey lands became part of Lithuania.  Subsequently, they repeatedly passed from hand to hand, belonging either to the Poles, then to the Russians, or to the Ukrainians, until finally in 1939 they became part of the Belarusian Soviet Republic.  Over 1200 historical, about 300 archaeological and as many <span>architectural monuments</span> as evidence of tragic events and the unprecedented flowering of this unique region have been preserved on its territory.
