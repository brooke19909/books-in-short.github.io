Regardless of whether you are trying to find something on Google or checking the Facebook feed on your phone, you pay for the connection and expect a certain level of speed.  When the service does not meet this level, it can be frustrating.  How to speed up the Internet on your smartphone? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.manilashaker.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to speed up internet speed" class="if uuid-2809597" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/2809597.jpg"></div><p>  In most cases, a slow connection is temporary, caused by local or network congestion.  In other cases, it can persist for several hours or even days.  Before you contact the technical support service of your mobile operator, first try a few simple steps to determine if you can fix performance problems.  So <span>how to speed up the speed of the</span> Internet? </p><h2>  Reboot phone </h2><p>  This is the easiest action, but it often works.  Especially if you did not turn off the device for a long time, rebooting it should fix the slow speed of cellular data transfer. </p><p>  How to speed up the Internet on your phone?  It‚Äôs easy to do.  On iPhone 8 (or newer), simply hold the side button (on the right side of the phone) until Power Off appears on the screen.  On iPhone X, press and hold the side button and volume until the same result.  As soon as you turn off the iPhone, hold the same key again to turn it on again. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For most Android phones, hold down the power button until the power settings appear on the screen, then click Restart. </p><h2>  Change location </h2><p>  Many factors can affect how data is connected to the phone.  These include weather, network congestion, and even solar activity.  But the main ones are geography and buildings.  If you are in a remote area or around you there are many natural barriers such as hills, mountains and valleys, they can affect your signal.  This is especially true for operators who do not work in all regions.  So, it will be more difficult to speed up the Beeline Internet in the country than the services of other providers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.android.sc" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to speed up internet on your phone" class="if uuid-2809598" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/2809598.jpg"></div><p>  The same goes for buildings.  You can find yourself in the middle of a densely populated urban area with an excellent network, and then see how your signal drops to zero when you enter certain rooms. </p><p>  If you have speed problems that seem to have started in a certain place, try moving to another one.  You may have to leave the building you are in, or drive a few kilometers.  Although this may be inconvenient, it is a good way to fix the problem and speed up the Internet.  It is likely that technical support will ask you to do this anyway. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Disconnect and update applications </h2><p>  Sometimes, some applications can cause problems by obstructing data connectivity and slowing it down.  In this case, you should deal with each of them.  If it turns out that something is wrong, you can disable the application‚Äôs access to cellular data transfer or delete it. </p><p>  On iPhone, you can visit the Settings - Cellular section and disable any service‚Äôs access to your mobile data transfer. </p><p>  How to speed up the Internet on Android in this way?  On Android you will find it in ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù - ‚ÄúNetwork and Internet‚Äù - ‚ÄúMobile network‚Äù - ‚ÄúData usage‚Äù.  Click on the application, then slide the background data slider so that the program cannot use the data in the <span>background.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="steemkr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to speed up internet on mts" class="if uuid-2809603" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/2809603.jpg"></div><p>  You should also check for updates.  Application developers regularly publish them to fix bugs, so it‚Äôs advisable to open the App Store or Google Play and download all the update files. </p><h2>  Disconnect from VPN </h2><p>  VPNs provide anonymity and privacy, but they can also slow down when using remote servers.  Thus, if your phone is connected this way, try disconnecting and try again. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Most likely, you will immediately notice an improvement as soon as you disconnect.  If this fixes the problem, you can increase the speed of your VPN when reconnecting to it. </p><h2>  Check network connections </h2><p>  Despite the fact that many network providers like to advertise their reliability, crashes occur all the time.  They most often explain the decrease in speed or even breakage of connections. </p><p>  If you have the ability to connect to Wi-Fi, you can do a little test.  Try using a specialized site or google news.  Quite often, if your problem is widespread, other people have already reported this on the Web.  You can also search for data on this in social networks.  So, Twitter is a good place to research connectivity issues.  So you can see tips on how to speed up the Internet on MTS, and is it possible at the moment. </p><h2>  Reset Network Settings </h2><p>  Resetting the network often eliminates a slow data connection.  The problem is that this action also resets your Wi-Fi access points and Bluetooth devices.  This is not very problematic, but you will have to tweak something a bit. </p><p>  To reset Network settings on iPhone, open ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù - ‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù - ‚ÄúReset‚Äù - ‚ÄúReset Network Settings‚Äù.  The phone will ask you for a password, if you have one, and it will restart. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidpit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to speed up internet on android" class="if uuid-2809600" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/2809600.jpg"></div><p>  On the Android phone you will find the option to <span>reset the Network settings</span> in the menu "Settings" - "System" - "Reset Settings" - "Reset Wi-Fi" - "Mobile and Bluetooth".  This may be located in another place, depending on the manufacturer of your phone.  Try to find it in the search bar.  Resetting Network settings on an Android phone usually does not require a reboot. </p><h2>  Rearrange the SIM card </h2><p>  Finally, you can try to get and insert the SIM card again.  Where it is located depends on the device and its configuration.  On iPhones, the card slot is always located on the right edge of the device, under the side button.  On Android devices, it can be on the side, top, or back of the back cover if there is a removable battery on your phone. </p><p>  The SIM card is usually located in a small tray that pops out when pressed.  You can pull out some trays for sim cards with your fingernail.  Others may require you to use a small tool, such as a paper clip or the back of an earring. </p><p>  When removing the SIM card, it is important to always turn off the phone to prevent any malfunction.  In addition, make sure that you get a SIM card while sitting at a table or on a flat surface, as it is very small and easily lost. </p><p>  If pulling out a SIM card does not help speed up the Internet, you can try replacing it.  This will require you to go to the office of the mobile provider, so you should first try other methods if your problem is not yet resolved. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.t3.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="accelerated Internet beeline on the phone" class="if uuid-2809602" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/2809602.jpg"></div><p>  Remember that you probably have limited bandwidth - from a few to several tens of GB.  If you exceed this value, your mobile operator will usually slow down your connection (instead of providing a more expensive connection).  Even users of so-called unlimited plans can experience inconvenience during network congestion when they reach a certain limit.  For example, Beeline‚Äôs accelerated Internet on a phone only works within certain traffic limits. </p><p>  If none of these steps fix the performance issues, it's time to contact technical support.  Remember that specialists may advise you to repeat some of the above steps.  You can refuse because you have already done this, but their task is to look at all the troubleshooting steps with you to see what works and what doesn't. </p><div class="photo" data-original="projecteniac.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to speed up internet beeline" class="if uuid-2809599" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/2809599.jpg"></div><p>  If your connection is very slow not only for mobile data, but also for Wi-Fi, the reasons may be as follows.  To understand how to speed up the <span>mobile Internet,</span> try the tips below. </p><h2>  You are connected to a slow network </h2><p>  One of the most obvious reasons why you get slow network speeds on your phone is because you are connected to a weak network. </p><p>  At home, the reason your Internet is slower is more likely to be because other applications and devices are delaying your bandwidth.  Streaming video, downloading video games or installing operating system updates will slow down the connection.  And some of these processes can happen in the background automatically, even if you do not know about it. </p><p>  When connecting to public Wi-Fi, the speed that you get can vary greatly, and you should not rely on getting ultra-fast service from what you don't pay for. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidpit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ak speed up mobile internet" class="if uuid-2809601" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/2809601.jpg"></div><p>  A good way to speed up the Internet in this case is to prioritize Wi-Fi networks on Android or iPhone.  This forces your device to always connect to one of your selected networks when you are in its coverage area, and use other free points as secondary tools. </p><h2>  You are using a slow VPN </h2><p>  If you are connecting to public Wi-Fi, it is highly recommended that you use a VPN.  It encrypts the connection between your phone and access point, preventing anyone on the network from monitoring your data. </p><p>  But did you know that your choice of VPN can significantly affect the speed of your Internet traffic?  Free applications for this are known for offering terrible performance, and also have many other dubious drawbacks.  If you already use a VPN and get slow internet, try temporarily disabling it to make sure that this improves the situation. </p><p>  Most of the best premium VPN providers have apps for iPhone and Android.  Once you have registered with them, you can use them both on your phone and laptop.  These services should guarantee you much better speed than you would get from a free alternative.  In addition, you will also improve security and privacy. </p><h2>  4G poor coverage </h2><p>  When you switch to mobile data, you expect the 4G connection to be as fast, if not faster than Wi-Fi.  But it's not always the case. </p><p>  There are many factors that can affect your telephone signal.  You will see this often in crowded places, for example at a sports event or concert, where tens of thousands of people are trying to simultaneously connect to the same cellular communication tower. </p><h2>  Your phone is slow </h2><p>  Finally, a slow Internet connection may just be a sign that your phone is out of date.  Your Wi-Fi connection can be great, mobile coverage is perfect, and you'll be on the fast Web.  But maybe your phone just does not cope with what you require from it. </p><p>  Resource requirements for applications and websites are constantly growing.  Thus, even when your actual Internet speed is good, you can still perceive it as slow.  Phone hardware can, for example, waste time opening a large page or graphics in an online game. </p><p>  You may encounter this on older phones, especially used for a long time.  Also, cheap Android phones with slow processors and small RAM can suffer from this. </p>
