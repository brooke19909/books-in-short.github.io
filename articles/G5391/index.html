Such abundance is both an advantage and a disadvantage.  In the first case, each buyer can select a smartphone according to the characteristics, parameters, design, cost, manufacturer.  But the wide assortment of the average person can also lead to confusion.  Why?  Not every buyer knows what characteristics to pay attention to.  Indeed, in order for the smartphone to be multifunctional and satisfy all the requirements of the user, it is necessary to determine the basic criteria.  Let's understand what to pay attention to first of all. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitaltrends.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone selection by characteristics and parameters" class="if uuid-2483719" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2483719.jpg"></div><h2>  Smartphone Requirements </h2><p>  Before you go to the store to make a purchase of a smartphone, you need to clearly know why it is needed.  To date, there are a wide variety of gadgets on sale.  Most of them are targeted at a specific target audience.  Manufacturers produce smartphones of different price categories, so they are available to all segments of the population.  You can also choose a device based on gender or age (see the photo for an assortment of models). </p><p>  Selecting a smartphone according to its characteristics is an important point that will make it possible to make a purchase cost-effective.  However, by and large, each device performs the same functions.  The operating system does not affect this.  What tasks should even the simplest smartphone handle? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Provide access to the global web. </li><li>  Have an audio and video player. </li><li>  Support office programs. </li><li>  Make calls and send messages. </li><li>  Have cameras for video calling and snapshots. </li><li>  Provide a long battery life. </li></ul><p>  In principle, this is the whole list of criteria that a modern user needs.  However, there are situations when a smartphone is used as an additional phone, then many of these functions are simply not needed by the owner.  They will only affect the price.  Namely, new technological developments form the cost of the device.  Therefore, before buying, think about whether they are needed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tomsguide.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone selection by characteristics" class="if uuid-2483716" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2483716.jpg"></div><h2>  Smartphone class </h2><p>  In order to facilitate the selection of a smartphone according to its characteristics, manufacturers conditionally divided all the devices into classes.  There are seven of them: </p><ol><li>  Phone for every day.  As a rule, such devices are multifunctional.  They are able to cope with all assigned tasks.  That is, the gadget has two cameras, wireless modules, a standard set of applications.  But with such equipment, the capabilities of the smartphone will be limited by average quality.  A striking example of a device for every day is the <span>Samsung Galaxy J7.</span> </li><li>  The maximum "filling".  This class combines models that have unlimited possibilities.  They are equipped with super-powerful processors with 10 cores operating at a frequency of more than 2 GHz.  In this category, the undisputed leader is Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X. </li><li>  Smartphones for audiophiles.  For those who like to listen to music, manufacturers produce special devices in which the emphasis is on additional features, such as stand-alone keys of the music player, sound settings, high-quality speakers (as a rule, there are two of them).  Among music lovers, the gadget LG G4c H522Y is appreciated. </li><li>  Camera phones.  Smartphones with excellent cameras are combined in this category.  Moreover, not only high resolution, but also additional options are taken into account, which can be decisive when choosing a smartphone.  According to the characteristics of cameras in this segment, the leading positions are held by Samsung and Sony devices.  Their optics are currently considered the best. </li><li>  Devices for players.  Devices of this class are priced more expensive than others.  They provide not only high performance, but also high-quality image on the screen.  Also, manufacturers install a large amount of system memory, a capacious battery and the latest version of the OS.  In this category, the LG Nexus 5 performed well. </li><li>  Protected Gadgets.  Devices with a strong and reliable body are in demand among people leading an active lifestyle.  In addition to the above properties, they are also waterproof.  The optimal ratio of price, quality and hardware users found in the Sony Xperia Z3 Compact. </li><li>  "Long-livers."  As a rule, smartphones with powerful batteries in the rest of the equipment are significantly inferior to other devices.  But their advantages, as they say, are obvious.  For example, the Jeep F605 has a 12,000 mAh battery. </li></ol><h2>  Smartphone selection by OS characteristics </h2><p>  Currently, three operating systems are popular: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Android.  Google development.  Installed in many smartphones.  It has advantages: a wide range of applications, a wide range of settings, synchronization with a PC and other "Android" devices, updating by air.  Not without flaws.  These include frequent crashes when starting programs. </li><li>  Windows Phone  Developed by Microsoft.  Used only in a limited number of smartphones.  Advantages: copying files from a computer, synchronization with programs, a mobile version of the Office suite.  Disadvantages: a small number of compatible applications. </li><li>  IOS  Installed only on Apple gadgets.  The system is closed, so the likelihood of contracting viruses is minimal.  Advantages: a large number of unique applications, high speed, program optimization.  Disadvantages: difficult data transfer to the PC and vice versa, it is quite difficult to get to the root folders. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.cbronline.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="selection of a smartphone according to the characteristics of the OS" class="if uuid-2483730" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2483730.jpg"></div><h2>  Smartphone selection by processor characteristics </h2><p>  If performance is an important criterion, then you need to pay attention to the characteristics of the processor: </p><ul><li>  Power.  The clock frequency of the cores should not be less than 1.5 GHz. </li><li>  Architecture.  Currently, ARM is considered the best. </li><li>  The number of computing modules (cores).  The more of them, the faster the system will work. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.itpro.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone selection by processor characteristics" class="if uuid-2483735" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2483735.jpg"></div><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  If you are selecting a smartphone according to its characteristics, then you need to pay attention to the amount of memory: </p><ul><li>  RAM (system or operational).  It is necessary for high-quality operation of the OS and applications.  For high speed data processing, its volume should be at least 2-3 GB. </li><li>  Built in.  Everything will depend on the user's preferences here.  If you plan to install many applications, then you need to choose a gadget with a memory capacity of 16 to 64 GB. </li><li>  Expandable.  You can increase the amount of internal memory using an external drive.  The main thing is to pay attention to the presence of a slot. </li></ul><h2>  SIM cards </h2><p>  With this criterion, everything is simple.  If you plan to use one SIM card, then a device with the corresponding capabilities is purchased.  However, dual SIM gadgets are currently popular.  And if necessary, you can find those that support 4 or more SIM cards. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  This element in the smartphone is considered one of the main.  Image quality will depend on its type and technologies used.  The sensor can be resistive (installed in budget models) and capacitive.  It is also important to pay attention to the type of matrix: Super LCD, Super AMOLED, IPS. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  An important criterion for those who cannot imagine life without photographs.  Today, almost all smartphones have two cameras: front (selfie) and main (back).  When choosing a phone, pay attention to: </p><ul><li>  The number of pixels (resolution). </li><li>  The presence of a flash and its power. </li><li>  Installed auto focus. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="dazeinfo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Camera in smartphone" class="if uuid-2483738" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2483738.jpg"></div><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  And the last criterion for choosing a smartphone according to its characteristics is autonomy.  Now manufacturers install batteries made using two different technologies: </p><ul><li>  lithium ion (Li-lon); </li><li>  lithium polymer (Li-Po). </li></ul><p>  Naturally, it is important to pay attention not only to the type of battery, but also to its capacity.  The larger it is, the longer the life will be.  Preference should be given to gadgets that have a battery of at least 3000 mAh. </p>
