  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Heuristic method as a way to get new ideas</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Translated from Greek, ‚Äúheuristic‚Äù literally means ‚Äúdiscover‚Äù, ‚Äúfind‚Äù.  There are several heuristic ways to solve problems and get new ideas.  Let's consider some of them. </p><p>  The most famous heuristic method <strong>is</strong> <span>the trial and error method,</span> which consists in the fact that various solutions (samples) of a problem are put forward and considered.  Each alternative is examined in detail, analyzed mentally or decided in practice.  If it is recognized that this option is unsuccessful, it is determined to be erroneous and a new idea is advanced. <strong> </strong></p><p>  Another heuristic method is the test questions method, which consists in using a list of questions, for example, such: </p><p>  - How can I simplify an object, object or process? </p><p>  - What can be regrouped or flipped? </p><p>  - What can be increased, decreased? </p><p>  There can be a lot of such questions.  But on the one hand, this list should be long so that it is more likely to find the right solution, and on the other hand, it should be short so that it can find an answer in a shorter time and not get confused in a huge number of questions. </p><p>  The next heuristic method <strong>is</strong> this <strong> </strong>  called brainstorming or brainstorming.  It consists of the following.  To solve a problem, a group of people is created from several people to several hundred.  I myself conducted ‚Äúbrainstorming‚Äù with the participation of approximately 300 people.  At the first stage, various solutions to the problem are generated, including the most unusual and even fantastic ones.  The main rule at the first stage is a ban on criticism and the creation of a favorable atmosphere for the influx of new, original ideas.  The second stage is criticism and a comprehensive analysis of the proposals made, which, of course, should be recorded at the first stage.  After a detailed analysis with clarification of the positive and negative sides of the solution of all alternatives, as a rule, there remain a few of the most optimal ones that can be <span>implemented.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another heuristic method <strong> </strong>  - synectics (literal translation from English - ‚Äúcombining dissimilar elements‚Äù).  This method is a continuation and development of the ‚Äúbrainstorming method‚Äù with the only difference being that, as a rule, there is a constant group of participants and criticism is possible already at the first stage of proposing solutions to problems.  It is believed that the constant composition of the participants brings them together, they cease to be afraid of criticism and work more fruitfully. </p><p>  Heuristic <strong> </strong>  method <strong> </strong>  learning <strong> </strong>  characterized in that <strong> </strong>  Its main task is the creation by pupils of trainees of new educational products: essays, various crafts, works of art - drawings, songs, dances, school plays, various quizzes, contests, olympiads, etc. <strong> </strong></p><p>  These types of classes include: heuristic lessons, business games, various <span>creative projects,</span> trainings, defense of <span>research works</span> and others. </p><p>  The heuristic method is applied in the economic and business sphere.  In an organization, it is often necessary to <span>develop a management solution</span> for atypical, <span>creative, creative tasks.</span>  In managerial practice, there are a lot of such tasks, and here heuristics come to the rescue. </p><p>  Heuristic <strong> </strong>  methods <strong> </strong>  the adoption of <strong> </strong>  solutions are used when it is impossible to solve the problem by the usual, standard method.  There are many tricks that are part of heuristic methods: generalization;  specification of the task;  reformulation into an inverse problem;  concentration of ideas;  criticism of traditional decisions;  movement from end to beginning;  restructuring text into a model;  the use of such tasks;  consideration from different angles;  using the analogy method, creating a new structure and others. </p>
