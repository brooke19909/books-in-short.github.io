Moreover, the situation is complicated by the fact that they are available only on the mobile phone account, and this amount is quite large.

    <p>  In this case, you can well cash out this money.  Ultimately, do not disappear to them.  And believe me, this is not a complete list of life situations when your only wallet is a mobile phone. </p><p>  Thus, the question of how to transfer money from a phone to a card is very, very relevant.  It should be noted that it is possible to cash out your "hard-earned money" - this will not be difficult. </p><h2>  Ways </h2><p>  There are several ways by which the question of how to transfer money from a phone to a card is resolved.  Let's consider them in more detail. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Services of mobile operators </h2><p>  Just a few years ago, specialized services were created that carried out money transfers from phone to card.  Naturally, a fee was charged for such a service.  Later, mobile operators realized that it was possible to make money on it, and organized similar in-system services.  The first of these were Megafon and Beeline. </p>

    <p>  The latter has access to the service in question, which is called ‚ÄúMobi Money‚Äù, through the official website.  Unistream money transfer system will also help you. </p><h2>  Unistream </h2><p>  So, how do we transfer money from phone to card using the latter method? </p><p>  We open the official website of Unistream, then we find the address of the nearest banking institution and at the next stage we send an SMS message indicating the amount of payment, the number of the banking unit where we want to receive money, and, of course, indicate your surname, name and patronymic.  After a few minutes, you will receive a confirmation that the payment has been made by the operator, and you will also receive a special code via SMS, which will need to be reported to the bank employee in order to be given the money.  You just need to take a passport and go to the office of Sberbank or VTB-24 for cash. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  A similar service was developed by Megafon.  As additional tools for withdrawing money, you can use electronic systems, such as Yandex.Money or WebMoney. </p><h2>  Cancellation of a contract with a mobile operator </h2><p>  If you no longer need the services of this mobile operator, you need to go to the office of MTS or Beeline and terminate the service contract.  10 days after that you will be refunded. </p><h2>  Exchangers </h2><p>  Not sure how to transfer money from a phone to a card?  Use exchangers online. </p><p>  Today on the Internet there are a huge number of automated services that will help you cash out the money that is in your account for telephone calls.  However, be careful, as it is highly likely to stumble upon scammers who are just waiting for how to lure your "hard-earned money". </p>

    <p>  Use proven services.  The meaning of such a transfer scheme is very simple: you send an SMS message to a short number, after which the nth amount is withdrawn from your phone, and at the next stage, the service employees transfer funds to the electronic wallet, the number of which you specified during registration.  You will also need to indicate the country, mobile operator and your contact information. </p><p>  Please note that you can receive money within 9 days.  Also be aware that in one hour you have the right to transfer no more than $ 90, and for one day - no more than $ 180. </p><p>  If you are a subscriber of the MTS company, which, among other things, has the status of a payment system, then you can cash out the money using the Easy Payment service.  You can use it on the official website of the mobile operator.  You will receive the money on a debit card of Sberbank.  Be prepared to pay a commission for the service in the amount of 3% of the payment amount plus 10 rubles, as well as an additional fee in the amount of 2.5% of the size of the money transfer.  Also remember that in a day you have the right to make no more than five operations, while for one transfer the amount should not exceed 15,000 rubles. </p><p>  <span>Sberbank</span> plastic <span>card holders</span> can transfer money from their mobile phone account to it through the Mobile Bank service.  To do this, you need to send an SMS message to number 900 indicating the size of the payment, the recipient‚Äôs number, and then you will already send a confirmation code to the address of the system.  The recipient will find the money in the account to which his mobile phone number is attached. </p>
