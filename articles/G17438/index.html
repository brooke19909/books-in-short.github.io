Brief biography of the heroine</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The history of the Great Patriotic War consists of millions of feats accomplished by fearless Soviet people.  For 4 years they forged Victory around the clock, being at the front and in the rear.  They did not have <span>self-pity</span> in moments when it was necessary to defend their homeland, ideals, home.  The list containing the names of the heroes of the Second World War also contains data on two girls from Kazakhstan - Manshuk Mametova and Aliya Moldagulova. </p><h2>  Some facts from the life of Alia Moldagulova </h2><p>  In order to fully understand how characteristic of herself was the feat of Alia Moldagulova, briefly mention her biography.  The birthplace of the girl is the village of Bulak, located in the Khobdinsky district of the Aktobe region.  It was here that on July 15, 1925, a girl was born.  When she was 8 years old, her mother died, and the father was left alone with two children in his arms.  Those times were extremely difficult, and he was forced to give his daughter up to raise his grandmother.  Thus, Alia ended up in her uncle's family, where her childhood passed along with the same age as Sapura. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-850101" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35049/850101.jpg?1548706641"></div><p>  In 1935, the Moldagulov family moved to Moscow, and somewhat later, some time before the outbreak of the war, to St. Petersburg.  In connection with family circumstances, the uncle takes the girl to the city orphanage No. 46.  During the siege of Leningrad, Alia Moldagulova went to hospitals with her friends.  The feat accomplished by her has its roots precisely in those distant years. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Alia's military career </h2><p>  October 1, 1942 the girl becomes a student of the Rybinsk Aviation Technical School.  She wanted to start flying as quickly as possible, but for this she needed to study too long.  Therefore, impatience prevailed, and Aliya filed an application with the military enlistment office.  It was a request for admission to the Red Army. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-850100" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35049/850100.jpg?1548706641"></div><p>  December 21, 1942 Aliya became a student of a sniper school, where on February 23, 1943 she took the military oath.  After graduation, it was decided to leave the girl at school so that she taught cadets.  But she still got her way and went to the front. </p><p>  On January 14, 1944, Aliya Moldagulova, whose feat remained in the memory of millions, was killed during the defense of <span>the</span> Nasva <span>railway station</span> .  A little later, she was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. </p><h2>  Beginning of the last battle of the girl </h2><p>  At that time, offensive battles were fought in a territory located slightly north of Novosokolnikov.  Alia Moldagulova, whose feat the whole world remembers, served in the 4th Special Rifle Battalion of the 54th Rifle Brigade.  It was he who was ordered to take the village of Kazachki.  Thus, the soldiers had to cut the line of the railway leading from Novosokolniki to the Bottom. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-850109" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35049/850109.jpg?1548706641"></div><p>  But, despite the enormous efforts made, the battalion was not able to completely take control of the village.  He was met by hurricane fire of the enemy, forcing the Soviet soldiers to withdraw.  When the battalion began to attack again, the girl was among the first to rush forward and drag the other allies into German trenches. </p><p>  This battle lasted two days, during which approximately 20 Nazi soldiers <span>were</span> destroyed by the <span>girl</span> . </p><h2>  Aliya in night reconnaissance </h2><p>  With the onset of night, brave Aliya expressed a desire to go into reconnaissance.  Despite the very tired appearance of the girl, the commander could not refuse her.  Perseverance and perseverance once again won, and she, along with several fighters, headed for the enemy. </p><p>  During this reconnaissance roll, Aliya spotted an enemy mortar that was firing at our battle formations.  The girl cleverly with the help of grenades eliminated the calculation.  She also brought a prisoner - a surviving German officer. </p><h2>  The last day of the brave Komsomol member </h2><p>  In the morning, after a successful reconnaissance campaign, a new battle began.  The company repelled nine enemy attacks.  Aliya continuously fired at the enemy, destroying approximately 30 Nazi soldiers.  She did not drop her weapon even at the moment when her hand was wounded by a fragment of an enemy mine.  <span>The</span> rifle's <span>optical sight</span> was destroyed, but the girl continued. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-851300" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3663/851300.jpg?1548706641"></div><p>  She independently did the dressing of the wound, replaced the rifle with a machine gun and continued to shoot at the enemies.  An order was received to assault the Germans' stronghold.  And to the loud voice of a young Kazakh woman who called the soldier forward, the soldiers entered the stronghold.  Alia was ahead of everyone and continued to advance rapidly.  Another 8 Nazis killed a machine gun in her hands. </p><h2>  Death still caught up ... </h2><p>  But suddenly a fatal surprise occurred - the enemy officer grabbed her by the sleeve of his sweatshirt.  The girl only managed to break free and point a weapon at his chest.  But the enemy bullet was faster this time.  Despite a mortal wound, she was still able to shoot at her last destroyed Nazi. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-850108" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35049/850108.jpg?1548706641"></div><p>  The wounded girl was taken out of the battlefield by her colleagues and taken to the barn, where sick soldiers were stationed.  But she did not manage to escape death this time - the bomb that hit the roof of this building killed Aliya. </p><h2>  Through eyewitnesses </h2><p>  The co-workers of the girl-soldier wrote to Kazakh workers that there was not a single soldier in their company who would not remember how and where Aliya Moldagulova performed the feat.  All of them, until the last, avenged her death.  Before their eyes constantly stood her face: a serious, gentle, fearless in battle and caring soldiers in everyday life. </p><p>  Aliya was very fond of the Kazakh people and dreamed of his great future.  Its main goal was to devote his life to the prosperity of his native and beloved land.  In their letters, the soldiers asked to tell all the people of Kazakhstan about what this wonderful girl was, the faithful daughter of her people, who gave her life for his happiness.  They wanted people to know everything: how Alia Moldagulova was born, studied, accomplished a feat, lived and died ... </p><p>  Former commander of the guard brigade, retired colonel N. Uralsky, who was an eyewitness to everything that happens, says that it is impossible to pinpoint the number of enemies destroyed by a Moldagulova fighter.  Despite the fact that in most documents the number 78 is present, their actual number is much larger.  It reaches about two hundred.  It was in the last battle that Aliya Moldagulova showed unprecedented courage.  The feat was the last step to her death. </p><h2>  The memory of Aliya Moldagulova </h2><p>  At that place in Novosokolniki, where the girl died, the construction of a <span>memorial complex</span> took place <span>.</span>  The stella in honor of the Artek heroes, located on the territory of the Artek international children's camp, also contains the carved name of Aliya. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-850088" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35049/850088.jpg?1548706641"></div><p>  A ballet with a similar name, poems and many different songs is dedicated to her.  After the girl‚Äôs death, in 1944, the poet Yakov Khelemsky published a collection of poems telling about the feat Aliya Moldagulova performed. </p><p>  Rosa Rymbaeva performed the song "Aliya", which quickly became very popular.  This very rarely happened with musical works not written in Russian.  The feat of Aliya Moldagulova in Russian was recreated in the documentary "Aliya" and the feature film "Snipers". </p><h2>  Feat of the Kazakh military in the Great Patriotic War </h2><p>  From the very beginning of the fighting, the Kazakh military showed patriotism and courage.  A significant number of them took upon themselves the first attacks of the Second World War, which fell on the Brest Fortress.  She held on for a month.  About 1,500 fascist soldiers were buried near its walls. </p><p>  The feat accomplished by the <span>316th Infantry Division of</span> General I.V. will forever be remembered.  Panfilova.  Its formation took place on the territory of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.  On November 16, 1941, 28 soldiers for 4 hours repelled the advance of 50 enemy tanks, preventing their breakthrough into Moscow.  They all died and are named posthumously Heroes of the Soviet Union. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-850091" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35049/850091.jpg?1548706641"></div><p>  But the names of two glorious representatives of the Kazakh people became the golden annals of the Great Patriotic War.  Alia Moldagulova is the first Kazakh girl to become a Hero of the Soviet Union after her death.  Manshuk Mametova accomplished her feat in twenty-one years.  Left on the battlefield alone with three machine guns, for several hours she was able to restrain the fierce attacks of German soldiers.  She also received the title of Hero posthumously.  The feat of Aliya Moldagulova and Manshuk Mametova is something that will never be erased from the memory of the people of Kazakhstan, infinitely grateful to their defenders for saving the world from fascism. </p>
