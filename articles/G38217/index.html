    <p>  Knitting is a popular type of needlework.  For those who own knitting needles or crochet, <span>there are</span> no impossible things.  Craftswomen can create both models of clothes and many useful accessories: <span>cases for glasses,</span> for cell phones, purses and wallets.  Those who are just beginning to master any of the knitting techniques, sometimes look for descriptions of how to make a thing that is quite simple to implement, but beautiful and functional.  A great example is the story of <strong>how to crochet a washcloth</strong> , which will help to create a unique author's work from a simple thing. </p><p>  <strong>Knitting washcloths: types of products and their manufacture</strong> </p><p>  The washcloth can be knitted from absolutely any thread.  But the most suitable for this purpose is kapron twine or <span>polypropylene yarn.</span>  You can knit on knitting needles, and crochet.  In the second case, the needlewoman has more opportunities to apply her imagination and make a thing of any shape. </p><p>  Before proceeding with the description of <strong>how to tie a washcloth</strong> <strong>,</strong> you must select the necessary tools.  If you use kapron twine, then hook number two is suitable for knitting.  Ready washcloth can be round, and elongated, and in the form of mittens.  To make a round washcloth, you need to tie a small chain of air loops (there may be 8), then it must be closed in a ring.  Having made three air loops for lifting, then knit crochet <span>posts</span> in a circle around the ring <span>.</span>  Start the next row with an air loop.  Knit single crochet and add five columns in a circle.  Continue knitting the rest of the rows following the example of the second row.  So get twelve to fifteen rows. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you want to know <strong>how to tie a washcloth</strong> with a fringe, then the following tip is for you.  To do this <span>,</span> put the working thread on the <span>thumb,</span> insert a hook into the loop of the row below.  In this case, the thread thrown on the thumb is under the hook.  Pull out a long thread and secure it by knitting a single crochet.  This type of knitting is called ‚Äúelongated loops‚Äù and is widely used in the manufacture of washcloths.  At the end, you need to tie the handle to the finished washcloth.  To make it from the row in front of the fringe, knit six single crochet stitches, then turn the work over and knit the stitches again.  Continue to the desired length required for the handle.  Then connect the last row of the handle to the last row of washcloths in front of the fringe, but located on the other side.  Now it‚Äôs convenient to put a washcloth on your hand. </p><p>  There is another way <strong>how to tie</strong> an elongated <strong>washcloth</strong> .  Kapron twine is also suitable for this.  First you need to dial forty loops, close them in a circle.  Knit seven rows in a circle in single crochet columns.  Next, the extended loops are tied.  Useful tip: each elongated loop must be secured with an air loop.  Otherwise, the loops will turn inside out and the washcloth will lose stiffness and become flabby.  When the item reaches the required size, return to the drawing again - single crochet.  At the end of knitting, add pens to it, which must be tied on both sides. </p><p>  <strong>Washcloth for the child</strong> </p><p>  Children love everything bright and unusual.  If you know <strong>how to knit a washcloth</strong> <strong>so</strong> that it is fun and beautiful, you can please your daughter or son.  So you can make a washcloth in the form of a mitten with an embroidered funny face of some animal or fairy-tale character: bear, pig, cat, etc. To make such a washcloth you will need acrylic threads for knitting different colors and a hook number four. </p><p>  The process begins with a set of air loops, which should be thirty-four, they are closed in a circle.  Rukavichka is knitted with crochets.  Having knitted eight rows, on both sides make additions of four loops, knit six rows in this way.  Then leave ten loops not knitted on both sides, and knit further, gradually reducing the number of loops in rows.  Until at the end there are six loops left.  They must be closed by tightening the thread.  Two non-knit sections on both sides of the mitten are holes for pens.  In the end, it remains to arrange a mitten for the selected animal: embroider the muzzle, make ears.  You can knit a washcloth using a type of knitting such as a net, when the pattern consists of air loops connected to the previous row in a certain order. </p><p>  Knitting is a fascinating activity!  There is room for imagination.  And <strong>knitting washcloths</strong> for beginners is an opportunity to test your skills. </p>
