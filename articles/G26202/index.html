    <h2>  Pages of history </h2><p>  How did the organ and chamber music hall appear in the city?  Omsk is proud of the fact that in 1906 the construction of a large architectural complex began in its center, which included a hotel, a public meeting, as well as a Crystal Palace cinema.  Since 1922 they began to call it "Artistic".  This complex was listed as the center of social and cultural life of the city.  For several decades, the Khudozhestvenny cinema was considered the best in Omsk, it featured performances by musical groups, domestic and foreign films were shown, and film festivals were organized. </p><p>  Since 1940, a "live orchestra" was playing before the sessions, then a concert bureau appeared on the basis of the cinema.  It was on its basis that an organ hall was subsequently created.  Omsk is still proud of its philharmonic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Main characteristics </h2><p>  The giant instrument, currently located in Omsk, has 3 manuel, 64 registers, 3,700 pipes.  In the fall of 1998, the first serious concerts were organized, involving the performance of organ music. </p><p>  In 2000, the organ hall of the Philharmonic was ‚Äúreanimated‚Äù.  Omsk, by order of the governor, began large-scale reconstruction work in the hall.  In 2002, its grand opening took place. </p><p>  Currently, the walls of this temple of music are the soloists of the Philharmonic, the stars of the world stage.  Philharmonic musicians are proud that every year participants of the Siberian International Organ Music Festival gather in their walls. </p><p>  Today, work is underway on the design of concert "life support" systems, premises are being created for staff, artists.  Reconstruction of the upper tiers is also underway.  There are make-up and rehearsal rooms, a hotel, a recording studio, and workshops.  The large solemn hall is simultaneously able to accommodate about 200 spectators.  Such a unique combination of a monument of architecture and history with a concert and exhibition venue has a positive effect on the cultural development of the region. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="organ hall omsk address" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41272/2116495.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Organ revival </h2><p>  Since 1997, an organ previously located in St. Nicholas Cossack Cathedral was moved to the Khudozhestvenny cinema.  This musical instrument was created in 1983 by the specialists of Rieger-Kloss. </p><p>  An organ hall did not immediately appear here.  Omsk miraculously preserved not only the organ, but also the Orthodox church itself, in which it was first located.  Given that the organ is a heavy structure, during the reconstruction of the cinema, a special foundation was created for it, a bridge was made.  About five tons of broken glass were used to give the foundation increased strength.  The hall with columns, a balcony, stucco moldings turned out to be ideal in acoustics for placing an organ in it. </p>
