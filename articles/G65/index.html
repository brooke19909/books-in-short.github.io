  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Carbonic acid: general</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Carbonic acid (H2CO3 formula) is a weak dibasic acid.  When heated, the solution decomposes into <span>carbon dioxide</span> and water.  This acid is of great importance not only for animals, but also for plants.  In humans, H2CO3, as well as its salts, are part <span>of the</span> blood <span>buffer systems</span> .  With the help of <span>buffer systems</span> , the acid-base balance in the body is maintained, which is necessary for normal life.  Dissociation of acids in an aqueous medium leads to the formation of anions and cations.  The concentration of ions is of great importance for the course of many biochemical processes in the body of animals and plants.  In some diseases, the active blood reaction shifts to the acidic (with duodenal ulcer and stomach) or alkaline (with sepsis, pneumonia) sides.  With acidosis, the concentration of hydrogen ions increases.  Such changes, in turn, provoke the development of a <span>coma,</span> which ultimately leads to the death of the animal itself.  With alkalosis in the blood, the concentration of cations increases, which leads to a tetanus state and the death of the animal. </p><p>  Carbonic acid is formed during the interaction of CO2 with H2O.  Most researchers believe that the incredible development of vegetation in the primitive world is associated with a significant concentration of carbonic acid in the atmosphere.  The most intensive growth was observed in those plants that were grown with an increased (5-10%) concentration of carbonic acid in the atmosphere. </p><p>  It should be noted that plants are half carbon.  Carbonic acid nourishes the plant, while contributing to the solubility of the mineral components of the soil.  Therefore, in this case, it is a necessary component of the soil.  Since carbonic acid inhibits nitrifying microorganisms, the soil should contain its minimum concentration. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Therefore, to obtain high yields, it is necessary to balance the concentration of this acid.  Scientists in their experiments found that with the daily introduction of carbonic acid (400 cm3) and air (1200 cm3) into the soil, it produces twice as many plants as compared to the one that did not contain these compounds. </p><p>  The village soil is characterized by an abundance of air, so the processes of nitrification and decay are very intense in it.  It was found that the leaves in the forest completely decompose during the year.  Such energetic nitrification also occurs in the steppes.  In the process of decomposition of <span>organic substances</span> , a significant amount of carbonic acid is released.  The latter is one and a half times heavier than air, so carbonic acid penetrates deeper into the soil than air, and there it has a beneficial effect on mineral components. </p><p>  With deep plowing, organic residues fall into deeper soil layers, where O2 is absent, but an abundance of carbonic acid is observed.  In this case, nitrification is extremely slow.  Under these conditions, mineral components do not decompose and nitrogen compounds are not formed.  Huge pieces of manure lie in the ground for years without rotting.  Landowners are forced to buy synthetic fertilizers (cainite, superphosphate, <span>Chilean nitrate).</span>  Innovative tillage technologies help increase plant productivity.  This is primarily due to the fact that organic residues remain in the <span>upper layers of the soil</span> during cultivation.  Optimum conditions are created for the development and propagation of nitrifying microorganisms. </p><p>  Phosphorus, which is in the soil, is not always absorbed by plants.  Tribasic calcium phosphate is a sparingly soluble compound.  Therefore, soil rich in phosphate compounds turns into infertile. </p>
