  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How do facial muscles help psychologists?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Among the ways of expressing feelings and emotions, facial expressions occupy one of the leading places.  The muscles of the face, changing the position of the eyes, lips, eyebrows, reflect the internal state of the person.  Possession of facial expressions allows not only to transfer the internal state to the interlocutor, but also to emphasize the idea expressed, to highlight the rhythm of sound.  Science considers the anatomy of the facial muscles as part of the human muscular system, which performs important physiological functions.  The section of psychology that studies facial expressions allows you to read the <span>inner world of a</span> person, the information that the muscles of a person‚Äôs face carry is almost impossible to fake.  Even in the language of facial expressions there are obscene expressions, so a modern person, forced to communicate with a huge number of people every day, should not only learn to read the secret signs of faces and gestures, but also master the culture of non-verbal communication himself. </p><p>  It is customary to start acquaintance with non-verbal means of receiving and transmitting information from a <span>person‚Äôs face.</span>  Facial muscles differ from skeletal in that they do not have double attachment to the bones, they are necessarily woven into the skin with one or two ends, and they can also connect to the mucous membrane.  Their reduction sets in motion patches of skin.  Relaxation of facial muscles will lead to the return of the skin to its previous state, due to the elasticity of the skin.  Antagonists have less effect on the functioning of facial muscles than on the functioning of <span>skeletal muscles.</span> </p><p>  At its beginning, the visceral muscles were related to internal organs.  In the process of development and a number of transformations, it degenerated into the skin muscles of the neck, and later, divided into bundles, into the muscles of the face. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A lot of muscle movements on a person‚Äôs face occur without conscious control over them.  Extraordinary skill is required in order to keep the appearance of a smile on the face in a bad mood and hide the signals of sadness, and even better simulate emotions. </p><p>  An abundance of facial muscles is easier to understand if you break them into groups.  The frontal muscle is a wide flat muscle, it is responsible for raising the eyebrow, its work leads to the formation of a number of frontal transverse folds. </p><p>  The circular muscle of the eye refers to the circular muscles, surrounding the eye, it controls the eyelids, squinting is also her merit. </p><p>  The small muscle that wrinkles the eyebrows originates at the nasal septum, with the second end attached to the skin in the middle of the brow.  He is responsible for a frown, accompanies a sad mood.  When the muscle lowers the tips of the eyebrows, a pair of vertical folds appear above the root of the nose, and the eyebrows converge to the nose. </p><p>  The quadrangular muscle that controls the upper lip, the composition has three sections, which are located on both sides of the nose.  An expression of mockery or contempt is obtained when this muscle makes the upper lip stretch. </p><p>  Around the mouth is a circular muscle.  It starts from the corners of the mouth from the small <span>muscles.</span>  <span>Contraction of the muscles of the</span> mouth leads to bending and tightening of the lips. </p><p>  The muscle, called the lower incisor, begins at the bottom of the cheek and attaches to the lower lip, it is shaded down. </p><p>  The chin muscle is located on the cheek.  Her task is to pull up her lower lip, protruding, she gives the face a displeased expression. </p><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A separate muscle is responsible for lowering the lower lip.  It begins in the region of the lower edge of the jaw, and ends at the corners of the mouth.  It turns a frowning grimace when the muscle pulls down the corners of the mouth. </p><p>  The zygomatic arch has the zygomatic muscle, it stretches to the corners of the mouth.  A pleasant smile will arise on the face when it pulls up the corners of the mouth. </p><p>  The facial muscles, constantly displaying certain emotional states of a person, leave a pattern in the form of wrinkles on his skin.  Psychologists engaged in physiognomy, in the folds of wrinkles of a person‚Äôs face, learned not only to accurately recognize his character, but even to read the history of its formation. </p><p>  If you recall which muscles draw certain feelings on the face, then you can judge by the wrinkles around the eyes and mouth, on the forehead, cheeks and chin, in their direction and depth, which emotions are most often captured by each specific person.  And then you can judge the character of the subject. </p><p>  Unknowingly giving preference to certain feelings, a person not only paints his life, memories in a certain emotional color.  Subsequently, everyone has the habit of staying in the most comfortable (habitual) state, not always this state has a ‚Äú+‚Äù sign.  Are we not familiar with people who, constantly putting on a mask of "anger" or "irritation", so grow together with it that it becomes part of their character.  The facial muscles ‚Äúremember‚Äù emotions, and if we forcefully try to restore one or another emotion on the face, then later it will more or less take possession of our mental state.  To concentrate, we wrinkle our foreheads, and we begin to restore internal balance by transforming <span>facial expressions</span> and controlling them. </p>
