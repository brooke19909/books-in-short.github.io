    <h2>  Hotel criticism </h2><p>  This is not to say that the Vile Oliva Petrovac 4 * hotel receives only positive reviews.  There are enough negative opinions.  Usually guests of the complex criticize him for the following disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  The rooms have a very low level of lighting.  Even if you turn on all the lamps, the rooms will be dark. </li><li>  The tap water runs a little warm, not hot. </li><li>  The safe in the room did not work.  At the reception they refused to solve this problem. </li><li>  Room cleaning is not always high quality.  The dust is poorly cleaned, not every day they take out the garbage. </li><li>  Lifts often break. </li><li>  Poor soundproofing in the rooms.  You can hear neighbors and passing cars, and people relaxing by the pool. </li><li>  There are not enough tables in the restaurant for dinner.  You have to stand for quite a while and wait until the place is free to eat. </li></ul><h2>  Draw conclusions </h2><p>  Having learned the basic information about the hotel Vile Oliva (Petrovac) 4 *, reviews, prices for accommodation, we can conclude that it is suitable for families with small children, the elderly, newlyweds and just couples in love.  Quiet surroundings contribute to a relaxing holiday.  Accommodation here is not cheap, but the price is consistent with the quality of the service provided.  It is worthwhile to clarify that for youth companies, relaxation here may seem boring.  They better find a hotel in Budva, which is designed for outdoor activities, and not in Petrovac. </p>
