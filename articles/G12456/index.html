    <p>  However, almost every review of the recreation center "Trickle" (Dzhubga) also contains information about the shortcomings of this place.  There are very few dishes in the shared kitchen, so experienced tourists recommend taking their own.  Also, sometimes hot water is turned off here, which causes discontent among vacationers.  For children, there is not enough of any playground where they could spend time. </p>
