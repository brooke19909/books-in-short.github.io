    <p>  Also, the absolute dignity of almost all hotel guests call excellent children's animation.  Every day for the kids at the hotel hosts various games, shows, a children's room, a pool.  Children do not sit idle, they play with both pirates and Indians, look for treasures, dance and sing. </p><p>  In the kitchen, in principle, there are no complaints.  All guests are satisfied with the quality of food, but note the narrow assortment and uniformity of dishes, especially those who compare the All Inclusive system of Turkey and Egypt.  Nobody remained hungry at Grantsovsky, but the usual abundance of resorts in other countries is not even close. </p><p>  SPA center is a highlight of relaxation in the complex.  A wide range of services is noted.  Special attention should be paid to the indoor pool with sea water and heating - everyone is delighted with it.  Almost everyone is satisfied with the quality of the staff. </p><p>  After analyzing the reviews, you can make an approximate list of positive and negative moments of the pension. </p><p>  Pros: proximity to the sea, beautiful views, new rooms, high-quality SPA center, good children's animation. </p><p>  Cons: easy staff deficiency, simplicity and monotony of the kitchen, lack of shops nearby, small parking, high prices for accommodation. </p><h2>  How to get to the boarding house? </h2><p>  Hotel address: st.  Grape, 22, village.  Livadia, Crimea, Russia.  From Simferopol you need to go to the <span>bus station of Yalta,</span> and from there - by taxi to Livadia. </p><p>  Taxi from Yalta to a boarding house is inexpensive, only 200-250 rubles. </p><p>  Pension "Grintsovsky" offers its customers a transfer service from Simferopol, the cost of a passenger car is 3500 rubles, minivans - 5000 rubles.  It is worth saying that prices are overpriced. </p><h2>  Attractions of the surroundings </h2><p>  Proximity to all the <span>attractions of the South Coast</span> is the most important advantage of Livadia and the complex ‚ÄúGrintsovsky‚Äù boarding house.  Yalta - this wonderful resort city - is located very close.  Those who wish can go to the Yalta embankment along a park beach road in just thirty to forty minutes, and on a minibus the trip will take only 10 minutes. And there is plenty of entertainment there. </p><p>  Within a radius of several kilometers is the Yalta Zoo, Glade of Fairy Tales, dolphinarium, cable car to Ai-Petri, Swallow's Nest, <span>Nikitsky Botanical Garden</span> and many other interesting places. </p>
