This is one of the most famous and attractive places for travelers if you are going to spend your vacation in the Nha Trang area.  In this case, you have a chance to relax on the beach, which seems to have come off the television picture.  Before you will be the purest turquoise sea and almost white sand.  Doklet beach among locals is known as Zoklet.  In the article we will tell you about how to get to this amazing place, hotels and vacation features here. </p><h2>  General information </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.justgola.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="vietnam doclet rest" class="if uuid-3203013" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3203013.jpg"></div><p>  In the reviews of the Doklet in Vietnam, tourists note that this is one of the few beaches in Nha Trang that even sophisticated travelers who have seen a lot have been satisfied with. </p><p>  Most other coasts do not suit either with a large number of vacationers, or with high waves, because of which it is not possible to calmly swim.  Therefore, connoisseurs of relaxation are well aware of the photo of Doklet Beach in Vietnam.  This is truly a paradise located in the north of Nha Trang.  This coast is considered one of the best in the county. </p><p>  Tourists will be met by white sand, low waves and a gentle entrance to the sea.  Due to these factors, the water is much warmer than in other places nearby, so it is an ideal place to come for a week even with young children. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Beach description </h2><div class="photo" data-original="travellingonwards.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where is Doklet Beach" class="if uuid-3203010" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3203010.jpg"></div><p>  Seeing the Doklet photo in Vietnam, you will definitely want to be in this place to experience the light sea breeze and swim in the clear sea. </p><p>  The length of the beach is about 10 kilometers, so there is never any hype.  Everyone has enough space, even despite the fact that the width of the coastal strip, where tourists can rest, is very small, about 10 meters. </p><p>  In the immediate vicinity are several hotels and fishing villages of local residents.  So on vacation at the Doklet in Vietnam, you will not be cut off from civilization.  In addition, directly on the beach there are cafes with very decent cuisine, as well as a market with local fruits and other goodies at affordable prices. </p><h2>  Rest for locals and tourists </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.viettravelmagazine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="doclet vietnam photo" class="if uuid-3203011" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3203011.jpg"></div><p>  The beach is divided into two parts.  The locals rest on one, and the visitors on the second.  Organized groups of travelers are regularly brought to the coast for tourists. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is noteworthy that from the rest of the land the beach is separated by high dunes, on which pine trees grow.  In general, the infrastructure located in the immediate vicinity can not be called developed, but for a democratic beach holiday, it is quite suitable.  There is everything you need. </p><p>  In most cases, tourists come here from Nha Trang.  Here is the best place in the area to swim and stroll around the picturesque surroundings. </p><p>  This beach is even compared to world-famous resorts.  For example, with the Maldives and Bora Bora.  But before them he has one indisputable advantage.  These are prices that are much lower in Vietnam. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Where Doklet is located in Vietnam is to be found out by everyone who comes to rest in Nha Trang or its environs.  Nha Trang itself is the largest city in the Khanh Hoa province, located in the center of the country on the shores of the South China Sea.  Among foreign tourists, this resort is considered one of the most popular. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="12.5446834" data-lng="109.22997050000004" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="15"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/6/9/5/1/16951.png"></div><p>  It began to develop back in the days of emperors.  The French loved to be here when Vietnam was considered their colony within Indochina.  Since 2013, the resort has been developing intensively.  Apartment buildings and hotels are being massively built in it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  There are several ways to come to the beach from Nha Trang.  This is a sea boat, taxi, bus or car rented by you.  In extreme cases, in this Asian country you can rent a bike. </p><p>  If you are planning to travel by sea by boat or taxi, then be prepared for the fact that there are no fixed rates, the price is exclusively negotiable.  So get to the amount that you initially agree on. </p><p>  The situation is different in public transport.  From Nha Trang to the beach runs bus number 3.  The fare in it will be about 25 thousand dongs (about 70 Russian rubles).  The road will take about an hour of your one-way time. </p><p>  Tourists who regularly use this type of transport, advise in Nha Trang to find a stop 6 Tran Phu.  Buses depart from here during the day at intervals of one and a half hours.  They begin to walk around 6 a.m.  The movement stops at about 6 p.m.  Please note that it is better to leave the beach in advance so as not to risk it.  If you are late for the last bus, you run the risk of staying at the Doklet for the whole night. </p><p>  If you rent a bike, then experienced travelers advise you to go to the beach along the QL1 highway, heading towards Hanoi.  Please note that along the way you will pass by the towers of Po Nagar, this is a good landmark.  Once at a crossroads near a large gas station, turn onto DT652B.  After that, drive past the salt fields until you reach the beach.  In exactly the same way, this place can also be reached by a rented car. </p><h2>  Outlandish nature </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="doclet vietnam reviews" class="if uuid-3203009" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3203009.jpg"></div><p>  Despite the fact that this is one of the most picturesque places in the area, there is simply nothing more remarkable here.  It remains to enjoy only the beach itself, the sea and the outlandish nature. </p><p>  If there is a desire, then without difficulty it will be possible to find a secluded place in which there will be practically no people.  The beach is very long, so there are enough secluded areas. </p><p>  Here, under your feet will be the purest white sand and almost completely transparent water.  There is often quite a strong wind, but the sea is almost always calm, the waves are very small. </p><p>  Tourists with children like to come here in large numbers, as the entrance to the water is gentle and very long.  This contributes to the fact that the water warms up very well.  As a result, many even believe that the beach is more suitable for children, and not for adults. </p><h2>  Cost of rest </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.viettravelmagazine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Docklet Beach Photo" class="if uuid-3203008" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3203008.jpg"></div><p>  In reviews of tourists about Doklet (Vietnam), travelers always emphasize that part of the beach is paid.  It is on it that foreigners rest.  On the free part you will meet only local residents.  They come here en masse from Hanoi. </p><p>  Money must be paid for landscaped areas of the beach, which relate to a particular coastal hotel.  Organized groups of tourists are brought here, who are delivered directly to the paid entrance to the beach. </p><p>  True, if you still dream of exoticism, and you got to the beach on your own, you can turn into a stretch of coast intended for locals.  No one will be against, only if you arrived by bike, you will have to pay 5000 dong for parking (this is about 15 Russian rubles). </p><p>  It is noteworthy that a paid beach from a free beach is practically no different from a free beach.  Everywhere is clean and tidy. </p><p>  If necessary, you can have lunch at one of the cafes located on the Doklet coast (Vietnam).  In the reviews, travelers note that you can save money if you wish.  Instead of paying for the service, you can go to the market.  Here for very little money you will find a huge assortment of seafood, fruits and much more to make your lunch nutritious and tasty.  For example, you can have a real feast on the beach by buying fruits, watermelons, shells, crabs.  In the same market you will find a variety of souvenirs. </p><h2>  Hotels </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.tomsheck.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Relax on the beach Doclet" class="if uuid-3203007" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3203007.jpg"></div><p>  If you liked it so much that you are ready to devote more than one day to relaxing on this beach, then you can stay at a coastal hotel.  Fortunately, there are plenty of them here. </p><p>  In the reviews of Doklet (Vietnam), tourists note that mainly mini-hotels are located in this place, cozy and small.  For example, Hoang Khang Hotel, which has three stars.  The rooms are equipped with wireless internet and air conditioning. </p><p>  It is mandatory that the guest is provided with cable TV, a minibar.  The bathroom has a shower, slippers and a signature bathrobe.  The rooms are quite spacious, they even have a seating area.  There shouldn‚Äôt be any problems with communication, as the staff are fluent in English.  Bike rental is available for exploring the area, and there is a direct airport shuttle. </p><p>  The restaurant serves buffet meals.  The menu features local dishes and European cuisine.  Room service and lunch are arranged if necessary.  The hotel is brand new, it opened only in 2014. </p><h2>  Some Days Of Silence Resort and Spa </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.eureka-reservation.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Some days of silence" class="if uuid-3203005" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3203005.jpg"></div><p>  A more presentable option is Some Days Of Silence Resort and Spa.  This is a 4 star hotel. </p><p>  Travelers in reviews of the Doklet beach in Vietnam claim that this is one of the best places to spend a full vacation here. </p><p>  This hotel is one of the best on the coast.  Its name can be translated literally as "several weeks of silence."  These are not just beautiful words, but completely true. </p><p>  Here you will be accommodated in a bungalow.  These are small one-story houses, each of which is equipped with its own terrace.  It offers scenic views of the sea, garden or pool.  Hammocks are sure to be installed on the terraces so that the rest is as comfortable as possible. </p><p>  It is convenient that the hotel is located within walking distance not only from the beach, but also from the market and the village (no more than a quarter of an hour walk to them).  Reviews and photos of Doklet (Vietnam) are able to impress anyone with their beauty.  If you want to stay here, then this is one of the most presentable options. </p><h2>  GM Doc Let Beach Resort &amp; Spa </h2><p>  This is another 4-star hotel with its own spa.  True, most travelers do not recommend staying here, as the service leaves much to be desired.  But the prices are as low as possible. </p><p>  The hotel is popular with locals who often rent rooms here to spend the weekend with their families or friends.  Many travelers from Europe are repelled by this. </p><p>  These are just a few of the location options.  There is never a shortage of places in hotels on Doklet Beach. </p>
