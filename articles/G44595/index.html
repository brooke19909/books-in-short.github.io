But you can significantly increase the number of pleasant memories if you plan your trip wisely.  At the same time, it will not be amiss to remember that the most beautiful places of Crimea are not only well-known and widely advertised resorts.  The ancient peninsula has saved dozens of unique places for those who are ready to get off the trodden paths of the crowd. </p><h2>  The southern point of the peninsula </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful places of crimea" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18960/469485.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  In particular, tourists are attracted by the natural <span>sights of Crimea.</span>  The most beautiful places for walking and camping here involves - and at least - the presence of picturesque cliffs and the boundless sea.  Cape Sarych, the southernmost point of the peninsula, meets these requirements as well as possible. </p><p>  Probably, the charm and attractiveness of this cape is given by the fact that it managed to preserve a corner of pristine beauty.  "Star" hotels, bars and discos are not stuck on the coast.  And the existing places for camping fit perfectly into the surrounding landscape, without violating the special atmosphere of peace, which washes away all the deposits of stress accumulated over months. </p><h2>  Reviews about Cape Sarych </h2><p>  The lucky ones, who happened to visit Cape Sarych, talk about the possibility of a harmonious combination of blissful doing nothing with interesting outdoor activities.  By the way, in the Soviet Union access to this territory was completely closed.  <span>They</span> tried to keep the <span>most beautiful places of</span> Crimea intact.  And it should be recognized that this helped to protect many of the rare plant species that grow here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For example, during walks you can easily stumble upon a pistachio grove or see with your own eyes a plant with the interesting name of a tree.  Its peculiarity is that it is almost impossible to get through this rather tall and strong shrub. </p><h2>  Stone garden </h2><p>  But Cape Sarych is especially attractive for diving enthusiasts.  Divers believe that the stone garden - and this is the name of the underwater natural formation of various underwater caves, grottoes, and even entire canyons and gorges from rocks - is the most beautiful place in the Crimea. </p>

    <p>  The human factor has also contributed to the attractiveness of <span>scuba diving</span> .  Over the years, more than one ship has been shipwrecked near sharp coastal reefs.  Most of them to this day lie on the seabed, keeping their secrets.  Access here is not limited, so that anyone with the necessary equipment can explore these mute historical monuments. </p><p>  The most beautiful places of Crimea were not disregarded by <span>marine inhabitants.</span>  When diving, you will have the opportunity to see literally all types of fish that are only found in the Black Sea.  Seaweed alone has seventy-four species.  And also you can meet the remains of coral colonies, several species of crabs and other small underwater animals. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Cave cities </h2><p>  However, when visiting the peninsula, you should not discount the cultural monuments erected by people.  And this category definitely includes Crimean attractions that are popular among tourists.  The most beautiful places among architectural creations are cave cities. </p><p>  At one time, cities carved directly into the rocks served as excellent protection for their inhabitants.  And if at the mention of these peculiar fortresses you only imagine a group of scattered caves and dugouts, then, having seen everything with your own eyes, you will probably agree that the most beautiful places of Crimea include these settlements. </p><h2>  Chufut-Kale </h2><p>  As expected, the city begins with a gate.  This is a very solid oak structure, bound by iron.  In the old days, they served as an insurmountable obstacle for ill-wishers.  Imagine ten-meter walls - five meters wide, fortified by towers and further protected by a moat cut down in the rock itself!  So begins the tour of the ancient city. </p>

    <p>  You will be guided through numerous outbuildings and winding galleries, shown the old cemetery and talk about the secrets of storing rainwater.  You will see the remains of ancient temples and special battle caves. </p><h2>  Visitors reviews </h2><p>  If you analyze the numerous reviews, you can see that all of them are united by one thing - a lot of positive impressions.  In the details, of course, there is some diversity.  Someone saddened by the lack of first-class service in the form of dry closets.  Others note with admiration that they did not even expect this city to be so well preserved. </p><p>  There are those who believe that Chufut-Kale is the most beautiful place in the Crimea.  And all unanimously talk about the magnificent panorama that opens from the top of the mountain.  A sense of involvement in ancient history also generates a sense of reverence.  And almost everyone who once visited Chufut-Kale expresses a desire to return there. </p><h2>  Underground treasures </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful places of Crimea to relax" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18960/469488.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Well, if you are going to explore the beautiful places of Crimea by car, do not miss the famous caves.  Marble Cave and Kizil-Koba Cave deserve special attention.  They are somewhat away from the main road, but if you travel by car, then getting to them will not be difficult. </p><p>  Experts say that the Marble Cave is one of the five most beautiful equipped caves in the world.  Here you will see miraculous sculptures created under the influence of water and minerals.  A tour of the many halls of this underground formation is accompanied by music of different styles.  Therefore, it is called ‚ÄúChater-Dag Melodies‚Äù. </p><h2>  Valley of Ghosts </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful places of Crimea by car" class="if" height="453" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18960/469489.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  The beautiful places of Crimea for recreation are by no means concentrated exclusively along the coast.  And a vivid example of this is the Valley of Ghosts - a bizarre cluster of rocks scattered throughout a beautiful valley.  Among them, you can wander the whole day, discovering more and more new features of this area. </p><p>  And for dessert, you can recommend climbing to the top <span>of Demerdzhi Mountain.</span>  True, this will require some physical stamina and dexterity.  But with comfortable shoes and suitable clothes, this climb is within the reach of any healthy person. </p><h2>  The attractiveness of the sea </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crimea interesting beautiful places" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18960/469490.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  However, no matter how rich the peninsula was with various interesting tourist sites, the trip here is primarily associated with the sea.  The gentle sun, fresh salty air and the rustle of waves on small pebbles, all this is Crimea.  Interesting, beautiful places only add a pleasant variety to this magnificent natural symphony. </p><p>  Jasper beach, which is located near Cape Fiolent, is very popular among both locals and visiting tourists.  A ‚Äúhealth path‚Äù leads here - a staircase carved in a steep rock with about 800 steps.  The beach consists of a rather large pebble, on which it is not particularly convenient to slap bare feet, but surprisingly clear water more than covers this minor flaw. </p><p>  If you prefer to relax in comfort, then Massandra Beach will be the best choice.  It is recognized as one of the best beaches in Yalta.  Here you will be provided with sun loungers, bamboo bungalows and even a VIP sector, designed to rid the surrounding unorganized crowd of vacationers. </p><p>  Whatever vacation you prefer, whether it is a careless pastime in the sun, conquering mountain peaks, descent into the depths of the sea and into the bowels of the earth or exploring the remains of ancient cities - all this you will find on the Crimean peninsula. </p>
