    <h2>  Sea vacation </h2><p>  Own sandy beach of the <span>hotel Hotel</span> Byblos 4 * (Tunisia) is an excellent option for a comfortable holiday for tourists.  The only drawback, judging by the reviews, is the range (the distance is about 550 meters).  It is easy to add color to the rest if you use the trolley that the Omar donkey drags ("transport" delivers tourists to the sea and back at will).  Coastal water is clean and clear. </p><p>  Tourists are not provided with <span>beach towels</span> , there are umbrellas and sunbeds, you need to pay separately for mattresses.  However, on any beach, trestle beds are paid and will cost 2-4 dinars, so you can not go far from the hotel, but choose any place you like near the sea.  There is a bar where you can buy water, juice and other drinks. </p>

    <h2>  Fun for kids </h2><p>  For younger visitors there is a shallow pool, a mini club, a small games room is provided.  Kids will definitely enjoy a holiday in Tunisia (Hammamet).  Hotels, however, offer too spicy dishes.  On the other hand, there are a lot of fruits and vegetables, but they need to be washed very carefully.  According to many tourists, the hotel is too noisy for those who plan to take young children on a trip or want to relax in silence. </p><h2>  Additional services </h2><p>  A good stay at the hotel provides attentive staff.  Reading reviews of hotels in Tunisia, you can stumble upon information that they practically do not speak Russian or do it very badly.  Unfortunately this is the case.  When communicating, they use Arabic and French, but the service staff is courteous, the attitude is friendly. </p><p>  The reception is open around the clock.  You can store your luggage in a room specially provided for this.  Hotel Byblos 4 * (Tunisia) has a laundry service, and if necessary, staff offers ironing services.  Vacationers have the right to use the services of private parking, and in advance you do not need to reserve a place.  The presence of parking is very convenient for those tourists who rent a car and travel to excursion places on their own.  You can also rent a car at the hotel, this type of service is provided here. </p><p>  The hotel has Wi-Fi, you do not need to pay for its use, since in public areas the network is available and free.  There is a currency exchange office.  The hotel has several shops, but prices are high there, which is not too attractive for tourists. </p>

    <h2>  Sightseeing vacation </h2><p>  "Tunisian Sahara".  The tour lasts 2 days and begins with a visit to the city of El Jem, whose main attraction is the Colosseum.  Holidays in Hammamet will be inferior if you refuse this trip.  The Tunisian Colosseum has survived better than all those that exist today.  It was here that the most impressive shots of the Gladiator were shot, and today, rock singers and opera performers become its frequent guests. </p><p>  Further along the course is the city of Matmata, in which the tribes of troglodytes live.  The uniqueness is that it consists entirely of caves dug in grottoes from chalk.  The next stop is planned in the city of Douz, where the Sahara desert symbolically begins.  Camels are prepared for a trip through the desert.  The journey through the sands lasts no more than an hour, after the tourists are returned and placed at the hotel for the night.  The last place to visit will be Kairouan - the sacred Muslim city in which there are about 85 temple complexes. </p><p>  Carthage is one of the oldest settlements on the planet, built in the 9th century BC.  Today, there is little left of the old buildings, the Roman part with the aqueducts, therms and facades of the former office buildings is best preserved.  As a rule, a trip to Carthage is combined with visits to other attractions. </p><p>  Dugga is a city built by the ancient Romans.  Today, there is an open-air museum where you can see the temple of the goddess Concord, the sanctuary of Mercury, the capitoline temple and the mausoleum. </p><p>  There is an excursion with a visit to Sidi Bou Ali - the largest reserve in the territory of which there is a center for breeding ostriches. </p>

    <h2>  Tunis Hotel Reviews </h2><p>  Hotel Melia El Mouradi 5 * (Sousse) deserves the highest praise.  The food is excellent, the rooms are spacious and always clean.  The hotel itself is comfortable, I do not even want to leave its territory.  Not every hotel has an animation thought out, but tourists have almost no free time here: they are constantly invited to take part in competitions.  Excellent facilities for families with children. </p><p>  Hotel <span>Thalassa Sousse 4 * (Sousse).</span>  A distinctive feature of the hotel is the thalassotherapy center (which, incidentally, is a lot at this resort).  Great animation will appeal to even the most capricious tourists.  The hotel is convenient for those who come with children: there is a games room, a playground for games, a pool with slides.  The food is tasty, varied and nutritious.  A wide selection of seafood. </p><p>  Hotel Garden Resort &amp; SPA 4 * (Hammamet).  Nice hotel, excellent food.  A little frustrating is that the first floor is a semi-basement, the rooms have high humidity.  It is not far from the beach, but in high season you have to get out early to occupy the free sunbeds.  On the territory there is a lot of greenery, there is a swimming pool with slides, which is very like the smallest vacationers. </p><p>  Hotel Le President 3 * (Hammamet).  On the territory there are buildings with rooms and several bungalows.  Judging by the reviews of tourists, the administration distributes holidaymakers to the bungalows, and only after some surcharge ($ 20) they agree to relocate to the room.  The food is excellent, everything is delicious and varied.  The only thing, not all vacationers are happy with the animation. </p><p>  Hotel Caribbean World Hammamet 3 *.  Clean rooms, the food is not too varied, but tasty.  Beautiful cozy area, animation works.  Couples with children are comfortable, interesting and fun here. </p><p>  <span>Hotel Imperial</span> Marhaba 5 * (El Kantaoui, Sousse) offers excellent conditions for relaxation.  The rooms are spacious, cleaning is carried out daily, household appliances are in good condition.  As for tips, here they should be left only if the maintenance staff performs their work flawlessly.  Meals here are on an all-inclusive basis, in bars you can order a drink for free. </p><p>  <span>Amir Palace</span> 5 hotel * (Monastir) is located in the first line from the sea.  The territory is cozy, well fed.  There are several restaurants and bars.  In terms of animation and visiting the beach, the opinions of vacationers differ dramatically.  Not everyone is delighted that camels and horses walk on the coast.  However, many simply do not pay attention to it.  Most vacationers are elderly tourists from Germany.  Despite the "star rating", the hotel is not suitable for Russians: the staff speaks only English or French.  In principle, the resort town itself is more suitable for a calm and measured vacation. </p><p>  Each tourist who arrives in the country will be given a decent welcome.  A full rest and pleasant experience are guaranteed! </p>
