  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ancient Chinese philosophy and its influence on architecture</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, China is one of the largest states on the planet, one sixth of the <span>world's population</span> lives on its territory <span>.</span>  The history of the state began several thousand years ago, which allowed us to accumulate vast experience in all areas of human life.  The rich cultural heritage, centuries-old traditions, industriousness and much more distinguishes China from other eastern countries. </p><p>  Chinese philosophy is especially interesting for scientists around the world.  Its development has been going on for four thousand years.  Like the philosophy of any other culture, it gave rise to many currents, each of which offered its own postulates. </p><p>  Few people know that it was from ancient Chinese mythology that two spirits came to be known today as yin and yang.  It is believed that they emerged from chaos before the formation of something ordered on the planet.  Subsequently, yin became the spirit of the earth, and yang - the sky.  Chinese philosophy developed precisely on the basis of this origin of the planet.  Along with the development of the concept of yin and yang, a doctrine of the five primitives appears, describing the origin of the world from water, fire, rafting, earth and wood. </p><p>  Over time, experiencing numerous social and economic upheavals, some philosophers have moved away from the usual teachings that cling to heaven, earth, and more.  They tried to make more reasonable conclusions based on centuries of experience, requiring the creation of certain relationships between groups of people, as well as establish clear boundaries between a person and the world.  It was during this period that Chinese philosophy was characterized by the separation of such new teachings as Taoism, Moism, Confucianism, and others.  The teachings preached by these schools had a tremendous impact on the development of culture and philosophy. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The formation of Chinese philosophy was different from the development of philosophical movements in Europe itself in that school representatives did not take into account natural-science observations.  The only teaching that encroached on the use of certain facts provided by scientists for the development of general philosophical concepts was proposed by the Moists.  But Confucianism suppressed this <span>philosophical trend</span> very quickly. </p><p>  Chinese philosophy in the vision of Confucius rejected any relationship with the natural science base, which led to the suppression of the need for the development of science and applied knowledge.  The main thing in Confucianism has always been self-improvement of the personality, its desire for morality and spiritual purity. </p><p>  Thus, the subsequent formation of <span>philosophy and science</span> takes place without common ground, which greatly complicated and narrowed the scope of possible directions for the development of various teachings. </p><p>  Undoubtedly, <span>ancient Chinese</span> philosophy has left its mark on architecture, painting and other objects of cultural heritage. </p><p>  Chinese architecture is numerous monasteries, temples and palaces.  Since ancient times, natural resources have been used as source material: stone, bamboo, reed, clay.  Also widely used were porcelain, terracotta and faience. </p><p>  The <span>Han Dynasty</span> made a huge impact on the development of the country's architecture <span>.</span>  During her reign, unique funerary complexes were erected, the decoration of which reflects the whole essence of ancient Chinese natural philosophy.  The standard desire of art to get away from the ordinary, is contrasted with the image of the surrounding reality. </p><p>  Chinese architecture has adopted some features characteristic of Indian Buddhism.  At this time, pagodas and cave temples appeared.  In addition, bamboo, widely used for construction in China, contributed to the modification of direct forms, leading to the fact that the roof became curved and the edges of the roof raised. </p><p>  With the transition to a modern reckoning, the Empire begins the construction of palaces of unique beauty.  Their distinguishing feature is the perception of the importance of nature for harmony, which led to the appearance of temple structures in the <span>form of symmetrical</span> complexes.  Of particular importance was the gardens that surrounded each such complex. </p><p>  Thus, architecture and philosophy were in direct relationship.  Cultural heritage set by Chinese architects still attracts many tourists. </p>
