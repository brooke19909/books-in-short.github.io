If you decide to arrange albums, photos, postcards or other products using <span>decorative paper</span> or cardboard, you will definitely need a hole punch for scrapbooking.  Themed cliches will help to make wonderful gifts for various holidays.  Working with a curly tool is no more complicated than with a regular office clerical, but much more interesting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="scrapbooking hole punch" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/1270378.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <h2>  What is a curly hole punch for? </h2><p>  If you had to make round holes in a stack of office paper to set a folder, then you understand the purpose of using a hole punch for scrapbooking.  Actually, this product usually has two functions: </p><ul><li>  obtaining decorative holes; </li><li>  manufacturing of small parts for application. </li></ul><p>  Thus, the possibilities of a figured hole punch are wider than that of a conventional clerical one, which allows you to punch only round holes.  Figured options are used to decorate corners, edges or the main field of the sheet with carved holes.  Felling is carried out in any place of the base, as far as the capabilities of the purchased tool allow. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="figured hole punch for scrapbooking" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/1270389.jpg" width="600"></div>

Accordingly, these tools can be easily classified.  Firstly, there are various themes of clich√©s themselves - New Year‚Äôs, dedicated to lovers, by the seasons, related to the design of <span>children's albums</span> and birthday cards, etc. Options are selected based on the topic you need and, of course, financial possibilities, since the price such a tool is usually rather big. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cheap hole punching tools for scrapbooking" class="if" height="281" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/1270445.jpg" width="300"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Secondly, hole punches differ in the size of the punched hole.  For example, the size of a snowflake can vary from a few millimeters to seven centimeters.  Large tools, of course, will cost more.  With good quality, the hole punch allows you to work with thick paper or cardboard, especially if the punched part is large.  Although in most cases a certain thickness of the material used is recommended.  Information should be in the instructions or technical specifications of the tool.  If there are no specific instructions, then in order to maintain the performance of the hole puncher for a long time, do not abuse the use of high density sheets. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The third significant difference is the manufacturing company.  It is the brand that most often determines the value of the instrument and its quality.  If you do not need a large number of holes and you are going to use a specific cliche just a few times, then a cheap tool is quite enough.  If you are going to repeatedly use a hole punch and constantly use it in your work, do not skimp and choose brands that guarantee good quality. </p><h2>  Figured hole punch for scrapbooking: how to use </h2><p>  Whatever tool option you choose, the technology will be the same: </p><ol><li>  Take a sheet designed for decoration. </li><li>  Mark out where the holes should be.  It is especially important if you want to create a pattern from individual elements of a curly cliche.  For example, a series of snowflakes or hearts. </li><li>  Insert the sheet to the desired level in the hole punch. </li><li>  Press firmly on the top of the press. </li><li>  Return the hole punch to its original position. </li><li>  Remove the clipped element from the cliche (if it remains inside).  Use it for application. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hole punch for scrapbooking photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/1270380.jpg" width="500"></div></li></ol><h2>  Hole Punch Set for Scrapbooking </h2><p>  If you decide to choose scrapbooking as your hobby or do creative work with your children, then you will often need hole punches.  You can purchase them individually or buy a set of several.  Kits are thematic and containing tools with different cliches.  Typically, a kit includes tools for making carved corners, edges, and creating single holes.  You can also buy a special hole punch with removable cassettes.  You use one tool, and the holes will be made in different shapes. </p><h2>  Where could I buy? </h2><p>  Typically, these hole punchers are sold in specialized stores for creativity and needlework, art salons and departments for artists.  You can also find them in stationery or children's stores, but the assortment is likely to be small.  Cheap scrapbooking punch holes are easy to order online.  They are sold without retail margins, so their cost is much lower.  The assortment of online stores is large both in terms of forms of sold cliches and companies of various manufacturers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="scrapbooking hole punch set" class="if" height="234" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/1270446.jpg" width="292"></div>

    <h2>  Hole punch or punch for embossing? </h2><p>  If you will order tools in an online store where there will be no description of the characteristics of a particular model, do not confuse the hole punch for scrapbooking (photo above) with the punch for embossing.  These tools are similar in appearance.  In addition, they also have curly cliches.  The difference is that the latter do not pierce the hole through, but only deform the paper structure along the contour of the corresponding shape.  In this case, a convex part is obtained on one side of the sheet, and a depressed pattern on the other. </p><p>  These tools are also very interesting in work.  They can easily create beautiful decor both along the contours of the postcard, and anywhere else.  However, if the cliche you like turns out to be possible only with the emboss function, and you expected to order a hole punch, you will be disappointed.  Therefore, carefully select the product when making a purchase.  And if possible, clarify the nuances of interest with consultants.  As you can see, the hole punch for scrapbooking is a very useful tool in the creative process.  Get at least one thematic option, and your products will acquire a new and exclusive look. </p>
