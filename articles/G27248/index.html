    <p>  One of the favorite places for tourists to rest is Jumeirah Beach, located near the <span>Burj Khalifa Tower.</span>  Everything is beautifully decorated here, lawns are spread out everywhere, palm trees grow, there are playgrounds for children and specially designated places for picnics.  It is this beach that is considered the closest to Ibis Styles Hotel Dubai Jumeirah 3 *.  You can take a taxi from the hotel to it for just 20 dirhams. </p><p>  For the same amount you can drive from the hotel to the beach <strong> </strong>  Kite Beach, known to many as a kite beach.  Here begins the expanse for fans of kitesurfing.  Despite the fact that there are no amenities on the beach, it is popular with both Arabs and foreigners.  Being in the emirate, you should definitely go to this beach at least once. </p><p>  For 30 dirhams from the hotel you can reach the second most popular beach in Dubai called Mamzar.  The park is beautiful and green, and its main "trick" is a huge pool. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Vacation with children </h2><p>  Many tourists believe that spending time with children in the UAE is not a good option: the winds are constantly blowing, there are no mini-clubs, there are many attractions that may seem uninteresting to them.  But still, some may disagree with this conclusion.  Children will never be superfluous to bask in the sun, swim in the warm sea and develop culturally.  Almost all hotels in the emirates are happy to accept children, and Ibis Styles Hotel Dubai Jumeirah 3 * in Jumeirah is no exception.  Here children of any age are allowed to stay, when placing a baby up to 6 years old (without a separate bed), accommodation is provided to him completely free of charge.  An extra bed is charged at AED 150 per night.  Children under three years old have breakfast at the hotel for free; children under 12 years old require a supplement of half the price.  For the entertainment of children, the hotel has an indoor play area.  The only thing that can create inconvenience in the hotel is a long road to the beach.  But from any situation you can find a way out and get to the sea by taxi or by a rented car. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Meals at the Ibis Styles Dubai Jumeirah are buffet style.  Every day in the Street Cafe restaurant from 6:30 to 10:00 the hotel guests will find a rich breakfast with cold and hot dishes, a huge selection of aromatic tea and fruit juices, fresh pastries, fruit slices, cereals.  Also, until 11 a.m. the institution offers its customers an extensive <strong> </strong>  √† la carte menus and signature specialties.  For fans of Indian cuisine, the Khanna Khazana restaurant is open in the hotel complex from noon until 23:30.  Pippin Hot Cafe, which specializes in preparing Asian and Italian cuisines, is open until one in the morning. </p>
