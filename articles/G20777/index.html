    <p>  In a family of ordinary peasants - Anna's milkmaids and groom Gregory, <span>on September 5,</span> 1929, a son was born, who was named Andrian.  They then lived in a small village called Shorshely (Chuvash Republic). </p><p>  Until Andrian did not say goodbye to the school bench, he bore the surname Grigoryev (on behalf of his father - Grigory, this was the case at that time). </p><p>  In addition to Andrian, the family had three more children, they lived very poorly.  The future astronaut dreamed of becoming a paramedic, but parents could not give his son a medical education.  Therefore, on the recommendation of his older brother, Andrian entered the forestry technical school and moved to Mariinsky Posad.  In 1947, he successfully graduated from college and was sent to the Yuzhkarelles trust for distribution as a foreman, where he worked on logging until 1950.  Then he went to serve in the army and forever connected his life with aviation.  In 1951 he entered the aviation school, and then since 1954 he served in military units near Moscow. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Biography: astronaut <span>Nikolaev A.</span> G. - first flight</strong> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="astronaut Nikolaev biography" class="if" height="294" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12967/251555.jpg" width="293"></div>

    <p>  In 1960, the first group of <span>cosmonauts of the USSR</span> was formed <span>,</span> where Nikolaev also got.  During the preparation for the flight, he always worked at full strength, never finished training until he realized that he had mastered this part of the program 100%.  He understood that there is no important and not very important - any omission could lead to sad consequences. </p><p>  The flight of 1962, in which Andrian Grigoryevich took part, was very productive. </p><p>  The first group flight in the history of astronautics with the participation of the Vostok-3 and Vostok-4 spacecraft made it possible to draw conclusions about the quality of radio communications outside the Earth.  During the flight, the results of many scientific, technical and medical experiments were obtained.  The first person who was in the ship without a spacesuit was the astronaut Nikolaev. </p><p>  His biography testifies to the fact that the books ‚ÄúSpace is a road without end‚Äù and ‚ÄúMeet me in orbit‚Äù, which many cosmos have read at one time, are a description of his own impressions and experiences. </p><p>  <strong>Biography: astronaut Nikolaev A.

    <p>  In 1970, the longest (at that time) space flight was completed, the commander of the ship was Andrian Grigorievich.  The trip lasted more than 17 days.  After landing, a phenomenon such as the "Nikolaev effect" was discovered.  The astronauts could not move for some time and felt very unwell as a result of the fact that during the entire flight they did not perform almost any physical exercises.  Nikolaev supplemented the flight preparation program with data that sports simulators must be installed on the ship without fail. </p><p>  <strong>Biography: astronaut Nikolaev A. G. - personal life</strong> </p><p>  In 1963, the first woman in the world to choose the <span>profession of an astronaut</span> , Valentin Tereshkov, became Andrian Grigoryevich‚Äôs wife. <strong> </strong>  After 18 years of marriage, they broke up.  Daughter (the only child in the world whose parents are astronauts) Elena chose the profession of a doctor. </p><p>  In 2004 (July 3), the great cosmonaut, twice Hero of the USSR, suffered a heart attack, as a result of which he died at the age of 74. </p>
