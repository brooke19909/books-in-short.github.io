    <p>  In this article, we will analyze exactly what advantages VHI has (children's insurance is a guarantee of their quality medical care) and how such a policy can be drawn up. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  Speaking about the benefits of voluntary medical insurance, you can list a lot of points: </p><ol><li>  VHI programs for children allow you to apply an individual approach to any child.  Your baby will be treated exactly as required by the features of his health.  Leveling will not be here. </li><li>  As part of the policy, you can get medical services for an amount many times higher than the cost of the insurance itself. </li><li>  Parents are given the opportunity to choose their own doctor or medical facility who will examine and treat their child.  With compulsory insurance, you have the right to visit only the clinic with which the insurance company has a contract. </li><li>  The work of the round-the-clock dispatch service allows you to significantly save parents time.  For example, you can easily sign up for a consultation with a specialist or call him at home at a convenient time for you.  In some cases, you will receive the necessary advice, even by phone. </li><li>  You can be sure that the ambulance will come to the child at the first call.  There is always a defibrillator and any other necessary equipment in the ambulance carriage. </li><li>  In an emergency, parents will be spared from finding the right specialist.  All efforts to organize treatment will be undertaken by representatives of the UK.  Moreover, if any equipment is suddenly not in the medical institution, then it will be brought from another center or your child will be delivered there.  The hassle of transportation will also be borne by the insurance organization. </li><li>  The VHI policy for the child guarantees you protection of interests in any contentious issues arising during the treatment process. </li><li>  You will not be affected by the increase in the cost of medical services during the validity of the insurance contract.  All risks are assumed by SK. </li><li>  An insurance contract can be drawn up so that it includes those risks that you need. </li></ol>

True, there is a slight nuance.  The UK concludes such agreements for no more than a year.  After this time, you will need to extend an existing contract or purchase a new policy.  The essence of this limitation lies in the fact that during the first year the crumbs manifest most of the possible hidden diseases.  Risks may increase, therefore, the subsequent cost of the service may change.  There are two types of VHI for a child up to a year: </p><ul><li>  "Economy".  It involves a standard set of services: visits by a pediatrician, home patronage, and the provision of services at a selected clinic. </li><li>  "Elite".  Here the list can be expanded as much as possible.  Your child will be supervised not only by a pediatrician, but by any other specialists of your choice.  The baby will be fully diagnosed, including laboratory tests. </li></ul><h2>  Insurance for foreign children </h2><p>  The VHI policy for children of foreign citizens is practically no different from the usual one.  The only caveat may be that some insurance companies introduce an additional <span>increase factor</span> for such insurance.  Therefore, the cost of the contract may be slightly higher.  Voluntary insurance for children of foreigners contains the same list of services as the policy of a child of a citizen of the Russian Federation.  A doctor can be called at the place of stay of the baby at the moment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DMS for a child up to a year" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/1417933.jpg" width="600"></div>

The registration process includes only four points: </p><ul><li>  filing an application; </li><li>  filling out the questionnaire; </li><li>  policy payment; </li><li>  signing a contract. </li></ul><p>  The questionnaire is a list of questions about you and your child.  You will be asked to indicate the gender of the baby, the data of the birth certificate, place (address) of permanent residence.  You also need to provide some information about yourself: passport details, position and place of work, address of residence and registration, contact numbers. </p><p>  In addition, you will be offered a list of questions about the state of health of the baby, the availability of vaccinations.  It will be necessary to talk about how the pregnancy proceeded, whether there were complications (when making out the policy for children under 3 years old).  Sometimes they also ask about whether you have insurance experience and which one, where you were insured up to this point. </p><p>  Answering questions is honest.  If it turns out that the child has a chronic illness that the parents knew about, but did not indicate at the time of the conclusion of the insurance contract, SK has the right through the court to demand the return of monetary compensation and invalidation of the policy.  So in some cases, the manager of the UK may ask you to provide <span>a child‚Äôs medical card.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DMS for children of foreign citizens" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/1417932.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Voluntary Insurance Cost </h2><p>  The price of VHI insurance for children can be very diverse.  It all depends on a number of points: </p><ul><li>  How old is the child; </li><li>  what is the state of his health at the time of applying for the policy; </li><li>  Is the insurance period long? </li><li>  what is the list of risks included in the program chosen by the parents; </li><li>  whether additional services are provided; </li><li>  what is the size of the insurance amount provided by the policy; </li><li>  whether other family members are insured in this insurance company; </li><li>  other points. </li></ul><p>  The average cost of voluntary child insurance can be at the level of 30-40 thousand rubles.  If the policy provides for treatment at home, the cost of the contract automatically increases by 35-40%.  The presence of chronic diseases in the child will add about 50-60% to the cost. </p><h2>  What is included in VHI? </h2><p>  Children's insurance may contain a different list of services.  It all depends on the choice and solvency of the parents. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DMS child insurance" class="if" height="343" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/1417929.jpg" width="600"></div>  VHI for children is most often divided into four groups:

    <h2>  Duration of insurance </h2><p>  Most often, a child insurance contract is valid for one year.  But this is completely optional.  By agreement with the insurance company, you can issue a policy for several months or immediately for several years.  Everything will depend on exactly what amount you are willing to spend on these goals. </p><h2>  How to get VHI insurance </h2><p>  To date, an insurance document can be issued in two ways: </p><ul><li>  visit the office of SK, personally communicate with the manager and choose for yourself the most suitable insurance option; </li><li>  use the site of the insurance organization. </li></ul><p>  Most often, a more or less large insurance organization has its own portal of services, where in a few minutes you can pick up the right product, pay for it, and after a while the courier will bring you the issued policy directly home. </p>
