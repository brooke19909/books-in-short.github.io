I would like to quickly find myself on the beaches of Varna, Golden Sands, Pomerania, Sunny Beach or (if we are not talking about beach vacations, but about sightseeing) in Sofia.  So how much fly to Bulgaria from Moscow?  We will comprehensively consider this issue in our article.  Flight time depends on several factors.  The type of flight and the brand of the liner are taken into account.  You should take into account the nuances of the airport of the city in Bulgaria to which you depart, as well as the features of the Moscow air harbor, chosen for launch.  Even a factor such as the weather affects the flight time.  And also - this is a regular flight or charter. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Flight Moscow Bulgaria" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1194934.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  <span>Bulgarian cities</span> receiving planes </h2><p>  This country is visited annually by more than six hundred thousand tourists from Russia.  There is no need to talk about the advantages of Bulgaria as a vacation spot.  These are low prices, a similar language, a hospitable population, many natural, historical and cultural attractions and, most importantly, a short flight.  Do not even compare with the Dominican Republic, Thailand and other similar countries. </p><p>  Bulgaria is closer than Egypt and Turkey.  And this must be taken into account if you are traveling with young children.  After all, a long road can tire them.  Therefore, you need to calculate in advance how much to fly to Bulgaria from Moscow, then to get to the resort you need as quickly as possible.  There are only four cities in this country whose airports accept international flights: Sofia, Burgas, Varna and Plovdiv. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How much to fly to Bulgaria from Moscow" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1194937.jpg" width="600"></div>

Accordingly, it is less to fly to Sofia - only two hours and ten minutes.  But this city is located far from the coast.  Are you interested in winter ski resorts in Bulgaria?  Then you most likely need to land in Sofia.  But if you have chosen some seaside resort for your summer vacation, then it is better to consider other options. </p><p>  You need to fly to Buras and Varna only twenty minutes longer.  Thus, the travel time will be two and a half hours.  A bit, considering that a couple of tens of kilometers are left to the selected resort.  And it is these airports that you should choose in the direction Moscow-Bulgaria.  How much to fly to Plovdiv?  You will have to spend two hours and forty minutes in the air.  Departure from the Moscow Sheremetyevo Airport means that your journey will be ten minutes longer than if you started from Domodedovo. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Time Moscow Bulgaria" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1194926.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Scheduled flights </h2><p>  But not so simple.  You have learned how much to fly to Bulgaria from Moscow, but regular flights are not carried out every day.  And this also needs to be taken into account.  So, you can fly to Sofia any day of the week.  From Moscow "Sheremetyevo" Aeroflot liners start every day in the capital of Bulgaria.  Departure - at 8.20 a.m. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You can go to Sofia with another airline - Bulgaria Air.  His planes will start from Sheremetyevo on Monday, Friday and Sunday at 19.05.  S7 company takes passengers to Burgas from Domodedovo five times a week (with the exception of Tuesday and Thursday).  At Varna Airport, aircraft from Russia land only on Mondays and Fridays.  Direct regular flights from Moscow do not fly to Plovdiv.  This city can be reached either by charter (in the summer), or with transfers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow bulgaria how much to fly" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1194933.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Other factors </h2><p>  The type of liner has a certain influence on how long it takes to fly to Bulgaria from Moscow.  If you want to reach your destination as quickly as possible, you should choose Boeings, and not domestic aircraft.  The journey from <span>Bulgaria Air</span> to Sofia on the powerful liner of this airline will last only two hours and five minutes.  The congestion of the runway, free air corridor, tailwind or headwind - all these factors also affect the time spent in the cabin. </p><h2>  Moscow-Bulgaria - travel with a change </h2><p>  Of course, a direct flight is the fastest.  But sometimes more expensive.  Airfare pricing is a tricky and confusing thing.  But it happens that two flights are cheaper than one.  In some cases, the passenger has no choice but to travel by connecting flights.  So, you can fly to Plovdiv with the S7 company.  You can get to Varna on <span>Austrian Airlines,</span> Lufthansa or Turkish Airlines liners with transfers in Vienna, Berlin or Istanbul.  It will take a long time to wait for the second plane at the connecting airport: from forty minutes to several hours.  Thus, a trip with a transplant can last from six hours to eighteen. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Plane bulgaria moscow" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1194936.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Flight Moscow-Bulgaria on charters </h2><p>  Summer is a fertile time to fly to this country and its Black Sea resorts.  Not only from Moscow, but also from other cities of Russia and regional centers, airplanes fly up to the sky to deliver ‚Äúorganized tourists‚Äù to the <span>beaches of Bulgaria.</span>  In this regard, the question arises: is it possible to buy a ticket for a charter without purchasing the entire travel package?  Of course!  After all, the charter plane ‚ÄúBulgaria-Moscow‚Äù has been paid in advance by one or several travel agencies.  They at their own risk bought all the seats in the cabin.  And, of course, they want to resell them. </p><p>  If the agents see that there are not enough people who want to go on the package, they throw the air tickets on the charter for free sale.  The price depends on the number of days remaining before departure.  If you try, you can buy a ticket for two thousand nine hundred rubles.  What are the benefits of charters?  They serve powerful and fast liners for flights, which arrive at the place ten minutes earlier than regular flights.  But charters have flaws.  Do not even count on first-class food and alcohol on board. </p>
