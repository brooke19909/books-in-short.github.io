It is the 4th <span>most populated</span> city ​​in all of Russia; 1,455,904 people live here.  The city became a millionaire back in 1967.  The climate here is temperate continental, but in winter there may be sharp daily temperature differences from 30 to 40 degrees.  As in most Russian cities, in autumn and early spring the city is not attractive and looks gloomy, with puddles and mud.  In the village is not the best environmental situation, because there are many factories and cars.  This is a factory of rubber goods, thermal power plants and others.  In Yekaterinburg there are 7 districts, which are conditionally divided into microdistricts. </p><h2>  Ordzhonikidzevsky </h2><p>  More than 280 thousand people live in this area of ​​Yekaterinburg; it is the largest of all seven.  There are three neighborhoods. </p><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Uralmash </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  It got its name because of the main enterprise located here - Uralmash.  In the 90s, crime flourished here, the district was actually the criminal center of the whole city.  Today new skyscrapers are being built, new shops, kindergartens and cafes are opening.  Many parks and Lake Shuvakish with a paid beach.  The main disadvantage is that it’s quite difficult to get to the center from here, there are constant traffic jams on the roads. </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Ellmash </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  It also got its name due to the presence of Uralelectrotyazhmash on the territory of the microdistrict.  It is very similar in its characteristics to Uralmash, has an unsuccessful transport interchange and a limited number of places for recreation. </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Fan </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  The village was so named for the reason that it has a fan-like placement of houses.  High-rise buildings and private houses are mixed here.  It is not the most attractive for living, as it is located on the outskirts of the city, there are no places for recreation and a limited amount of public transport. </p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chkalovsky district of Yekaterinburg" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2160826.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Chkalovsky </h2><p>  The Chkalovsky district of Yekaterinburg is the largest district by area of ​​all other villages, but 265 thousand people live here. </p><p>  Divided into several villages.  One of them is Khimmash, characterized by its remoteness from the central part, and it will take about an hour to get there.  But here you can find work, there is infrastructure. </p><p>  Uktus is a little closer to the center, there are still Uktus mountains.  Real estate costs a little more than on Himmash. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The villages of Vtorchermet and Ceramic in the Chkalovsky district of Yekaterinburg are often combined into a single whole.  The ceramic is very small, with a forest and a military training ground.  It has been actively developing high-rise buildings since the 2000s. </p><p>  Microdistrict 32 is actually a military town, but of an open type, with a limited amount of transport. </p><p>  Botanical was previously quite expensive, but due to improper developer policies, property prices fell.  High-rise buildings are literally at every step.  And on the outskirts of the village is located Elizabeth (Elizabethan). </p>

    <h2>  Kirovsky </h2><p>  In the Kirov district of Yekaterinburg live 225 691 people.  This area is also divided into several parts: </p><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Pioneer </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  The oldest village of all.  Well-developed infrastructure, the neighborhood is being rebuilt, but so far there is a limited number of parking spaces.  The cost of housing is high. </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Concrete goods </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  Previously called Komsomolsky.  This district of Yekaterinburg is quite difficult to reach, it is cut off by several highways. </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Shartash </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  Population with an average income.  There is Lake Shartash, hence the name of the village. </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Vtuzgorodok </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  Here is an expensive property, since the center is literally 10-15 minutes, many new buildings.  Originally built for students. </p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  October </h2><p>  The population is over 146 thousand people.  Parkovy microdistrict is famous for its developed infrastructure and proximity to the center, but usually traffic jams at the entrance to it. </p><p>  Blue stones are perhaps the smallest microdistrict in the whole city, there are several streets, and there are railway tracks around.  There are no entertainment facilities. </p><p>  The poultry farm is one of the most remote areas of Yekaterinburg.  In the center there is a bird factory.  Of course, the presence of such an enterprise indicates an unfavorable environmental situation.  The infrastructure is almost all in decline and work is hard to find. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="academic district of yekaterinburg" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2160850.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Leninist </h2><p>  The area is home to 158,840 people.  There are several villages. </p><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><p>  UC </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  In fact, it is a cottage settlement, although there are Stalinist buildings. </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Bus station </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  This is the transport hub of the city, the village is partially located in the Chkalovsky district. </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Central </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  Located at the junction of several areas of the city of Yekaterinburg.  There are many attractions, new buildings and dilapidated houses. </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Southwestern </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  There are constant traffic jams on the roads, and in order to get to the other end of the village, you will have to change trains, perhaps even more than once. </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  The academic district of Yekaterinburg is the “youngest” village.  Over an area of ​​1.3 hectares, more than 9 million square meters of housing have been erected.  It has all the infrastructure, and there are forests in the district. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kirovsky district, Yekaterinburg" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2160844.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Verkh-Isetsky </h2><p>  A little more than 213 thousand people live in this area.  There are three neighborhoods. </p><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Wide river </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  The territory is bordered by unspoilt nature and landfill. </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Visa </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  One of the oldest, but actively built up.  The city-forming plant is located here. </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Zarechny </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  Located at the transport hub, there are many people who come from the southern republics of the country. </p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  Railway </h2><p>  There are few inhabitants in the district, about 161 thousand people.  There are three neighborhoods.  Factory workers, many Chinese and other visitors live at Sorting.  The main disadvantage is dirt and poor water quality.  The New Sorting microdistrict is also characterized by a large percentage of visitors, but it is more lively, cleaner, the infrastructure is more developed. </p><p>  Station Microdistrict is perhaps the most densely populated of all.  There are many business centers, slums and industrial enterprises and a high crime rate. </p>
