The most beautiful places in Europe to visit</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Europe has a long history.  This is what attracts tourists.  Modern <span>European cities</span> stand on ancient ruins, as well as in battlefields, which left a significant mark in the history of many peoples. </p><p>  As the holiday season approaches, many people think about how to spend their holidays in the most intense and interesting way.  The choice is not easy.  However, you will not regret if you go to travel around the Old World.  Where to start?  Before drawing up a travel itinerary, it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with the list of those capitals and settlements that claim to be the ‚ÄúMost Beautiful City in Europe‚Äù.  Only after reading the reviews about their visit you can make a plan of the most unforgettable trip in your life.  So, the 10 most beautiful cities in Europe. </p><h2>  London </h2><p>  The title "The most beautiful city in Europe" claims, first of all, the <span>capital of Great Britain.</span>  In the list of visits, it is recommended to put it in first place.  And this is no coincidence.  First of all, London can safely compete with American New York for the honorary title of the world capital.  In addition, the bulk of Russians are familiar with the English language.  London will be a good choice for adapting to the style and culture of Europe. </p>

However, there are many ways to cheaply live in London.  Savings in finances are facilitated by the fact that visiting all the famous museums of the capital is absolutely free.  The same applies to many walking tours.  Westminster Abbey, Buckingham Palace and, of course, the famous Big Ben - this is not a complete list of attractions that it makes sense to visit.

Paris is even more unusual than London.

    <p>  Walking along its old streets and visiting numerous museums are also unforgettable. </p><h2>  Rome </h2><p>  The list of megacities that claim to be the ‚ÄúMost Beautiful City in Europe‚Äù also includes the capital of Italy.  Of course, after London and Paris, it may not delight everyone.  The fact is that Rome is a fairly large European city.  In connection with the crazy movement in the capital of Italy, there is a sense of disorientation, and it‚Äôs rather difficult to adapt to this.  However, no one will deny that Rome is a city that is not the last in the list of the most significant and important places from a cultural point of view.  It‚Äôs worth a visit to the capital of Italy, even in order to admire the ruins of the Colosseum, as well as the remains of other structures of the ancient empire.  It is advisable to see Rome with your own eyes at least once in your life, because this city is the scene of numerous novels and films, in addition, it attracts tourists not only with its unique historical monuments, but also with excellent cuisine and ancient narrow streets. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Venice </h2><p>  The most beautiful cities in Europe attract tourists either in any particular season, or by any of their attractions. </p>

    <p>  However, this does not apply to Venice.  This city is beautiful all and always.  Its main problem is only numerous tourists.  Even in winter, the streets of Venice are crowded with people, and in the summer a real crowd begins here.  At the same time, there is a shortage of budget places to stay. </p><h2>  Amsterdam </h2><p>  One of the most beautiful European cities is considered the capital of Holland.  Amsterdam attracts tourists with its medieval architecture.  On the ancient streets of the city you can admire the beautifully preserved ancient buildings built in the seventeenth century.  This was the period of the greatest prosperity of Holland.  In addition, Amsterdam, unlike many cities in the world, boasts its many channels.  By their number, the capital of Holland is second only to Venice. </p><p>  The people of Amsterdam are passionate lovers of cycling.  Often, this particular vehicle replaces cars.  The streets filled with cyclists are an attractive landscape for many tourists.  Amsterdam is also famous for its Red Light District. </p><h2>  Copenhagen </h2><p>  Not all tourists choose excursions to the capital of Denmark.  They are frightened off by the high cost.  However, an alternative can be an independent trip. </p>
