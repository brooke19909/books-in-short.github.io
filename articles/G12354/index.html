This resort was opened in 2014 - not surprisingly, because it was built specifically for the Olympic Games, which took place at the same time.  The Olympics ended, but the Imereti resort did not become less popular from this.  On the contrary, with the advent of the tourist season, there are much more visitors here. </p>

    <h2>  Interesting information </h2><p>  The Imereti resort is located right on the shore of the bay of the same name.  It is located on the left side of the river, whose name is Mzymta.  This resort was originally built as part of the coastal cluster of the Olympics.  Modern and beautiful - these are the two words that can characterize it.  Not surprisingly, tens of thousands of tourists come here.  The infrastructure that distinguishes the Imereti resort is impressive - after all, these are hotels from 3 to 5 stars.  Although, I must say, even three-star hotels here look at all five.  Needless to say - a decent level, Sochi really well prepared for the Olympics.  And these works were not in vain, because all the hotels continue to work and enjoy increasing popularity. </p><h2>  International level </h2><p>  If we talk about hotels, one interesting fact should be noted - many of them are managed by international hotel brands.  Among them are such popular names as "Azimuth", "Accor" and "Radisson".  Not surprisingly, those hotels that are under their control are the most popular and, of course, visited.  So if you want to come to Sochi, to the resort in the Imereti Bay, you should preoccupy yourself with booking issues - there may not be any rooms at all, especially if the tourist season is coming. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Places to visit </h2><p>  Many people, especially those who have never been to Sochi, mistakenly believe that all the most interesting places and sights are located in the central district of the city.  But this is not so.  It is advisable, in general, before going on vacation to this beautiful city to familiarize yourself with what it is geographically.  Sochi stretched along the coastline for several tens of kilometers.  <span>Imereti Bay</span> is located in the <span>Adler district,</span> which is considered the most prestigious in the city.  After all, the Olympics took place here, and most of the hotels, hotels and guest houses are located here.  Most of the visitors stop in Adler, arriving in Sochi.  Imereti resort is also part of it. </p><p>  Not far from this place are located the Olympic venues, Sochi Park, the well-known Formula 1 highway, as well as many bars, restaurants, shopping centers and other equally interesting modern sights that are worth paying attention to.  If you have free time, you can go to Krasnaya Polyana.  To her from the Imereti resort is much less to go than from the central region of Sochi. </p>

    <h2>  Tourist information </h2><p>  Imereti resort receives positive reviews from tourists.  And this is not surprising, because there is everything: the sea, <span>beautiful landscapes,</span> modern <span>high-rise buildings,</span> attractions.  Many people who decide to relax here are puzzled by the question: "Where to stay?"  It was said above that the choice of hotels is great.  It could be Kavkaz-Hotel, a new modern guest house near an amusement park.  Or the Bogatyr luxury complex, made in a very original style - this fabulous building can be seen from afar, and it is immediately clear that it will be possible to have a good rest.  There are many other options: guest houses "Svetlana", "Galina", "Cosiness", luxury hotel "Aivazovsky", villas or private sectors.  The choice is great.  The only thing to remember is to book in advance.  Otherwise, you can be late. </p>
