It is unusual for us culture, architecture of buildings, customs, and all this I want to see.  Tunisia also attracts with its warm climate, blue-turquoise sea and white-gold beaches under palm trees.  Hotel Bravo Djerba 4 * is a win-win choice for anyone who dreams of a carefree relaxing holiday away from the noise and smog of European cities, who decided to give themselves summer in the cold winter, who love to discover something new. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  The island of Djerba lies just 2 km from the continental part of Tunisia, and it is small in area.  The distance between its extreme western and eastern points is slightly more than 28 km, and from north to south it is even less.  You can go round it in just half a day.  But it is here that the best chic and respectable hotels in Tunisia are located.  We will talk about the most beautiful of them, which has recently been called Hotel Bravo Djerba 4 *.  Previously, this hotel was known as Vincci Resort Alkantara, and this is still preserved on some maps.  It was built in 2003, but in 2015 the owner changed here, and with it the name.  Now the hotel is undergoing large-scale reconstruction to receive tourists at a very high level. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bravo Djerba 4" class="if" height="317" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1560003.jpg" width="505"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Hotel Bravo Djerba 4 * is located in the Midoun region on the outskirts of the small Arab village of Agir, to the center of which is about two and a half kilometers.  Some take the name of the region for the city, but the village of Djerba Midoun is located not on the coast, but in the depths of the island, from the hotel in question it is more than 6 km.  The island of Djerba itself lies in the gulf of the Mediterranean Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãGabes, and the village of Agir and its environs are located on the banks of a quiet shallow bay, which has a beneficial effect on the local microclimate. </p><p>  There are no infrastructure facilities of any importance in the hotel area, mainly tourists will observe classic African landscapes.  But on the way to the village, which runs literally nearby, there are several shops with local goods and sweets. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Holidays in Djerba are so popular that they built a large international airport.  It is called Zarzis.  You can fly here from Russia by direct flight from May to mid-October.  In Bravo Djerba 4 * from the airport, modern transfers deliver.  The distance is 25.4 km, travel time is about an hour.  It is best to take a taxi to your hotel on your own.  Prices are strictly on the counter, so they won‚Äôt take too much.  Tourists who bought a tour to Bravo Djerba 4 * out of season will have to fly to Tunisia to the mainland, and to Djerba to get by domestic airlines.  This is the most convenient and fastest option, but it is possible only from Carthage airport, so from Russia you need to fly only to the <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãof Tunisia.</span>  From here, if desired, you can get to the island by bus.  It will take 8 hours, but tourists will take a small tour of the country and sail on a ferry.  From other <span>Tunisian airports</span> in the winter, getting to Djerba is long and troublesome. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Bravo Djerba 4" class="if" height="341" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1559410.jpg" width="509"></div>
