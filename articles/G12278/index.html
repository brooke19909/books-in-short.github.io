She, paper, would have remained the performer of the practical needs of mankind, if not for the Japanese love for perfection in all forms. </p><p>  Now it is difficult to count all those figures that origami masters create from a single sheet, and integrity is an indispensable condition in this work.  Although it is difficult to call work such a delightful transformation of the plane into volume.  This is truly a creation that brings not only pleasure and peace of mind, but also develops logic, ingenuity, imagination and intelligence in general. </p><p>  What would be done at your leisure, so that you can have a good time and please your relatives?  You can create a wonderful hare with your own hands! </p><p>  An <span>origami</span> hare is a charming gift for your loved one.  The main advantage of such a gift will not be its undeniable originality and ease of execution, but the love that the creator of this masterpiece invested in the process of its creation. </p><p>  <strong><span>Origami "Hare"</span> of triangular modules</strong> </p><p>  Office paper for notes is well suited for <span>modular origami</span> , as it is a ready-made material for work, and the color scheme is quite diverse.  But, if there is nothing at hand except A4 paper and scissors, you will first have to practice the ability to cut rectangles. </p><p>  The hare of origami modules consists of 522 triangles.  They can be performed both monophonic and multi-colored, so the <span>development of creative abilities is</span> guaranteed! </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Origami "Hare" from the modules.</strong>  <strong>Scheme</strong> </p><p><strong> </strong><strong></strong>  <em>Running triangles.</em> </p><p>  1) Fold a rectangular piece of paper in half. </p><p>  2) Determine the middle.  To do this, bend and bend the sheet folded in half. </p><p>  3) Turn the sheet with the convex side of the bend toward you. </p><p>  4) Bend the edges towards the middle. </p><p>  5) Turn the workpiece over and bend the edges up. </p><p>  6) Bring the workpiece to a triangle by bending the edges. </p><p>  7) After the edges are bent, straighten the main bend. </p><p>  8) Fold again along the existing bend line, taking into account the fact that the bent edges will remain inside. </p><p>  9) Fold the resulting figure in half </p><p>  10) The blank has two corners and two pockets. </p><p>  <strong>Hare from origami modules.</strong>  <strong>Main assembly</strong> </p><p>  1) To make the hare color, out of 522 triangles, 120 must be different from the main color.  From colored triangles we get five rows of 24 modules each.  From 48 pcs  two color rows of modular triangles of the primary color. </p><p>  2) The corners of two adjacent modules are inserted into the pocket of another module.  It turns out two rows.  By the same principle, the following modules are assembled.  Thus, all 24 triangular modules are connected, forming a ring. </p><p>  3) The following row of triangles is set in a checkerboard pattern. </p><p>  4) Now you need to turn out the resulting ring, which will look like a bowl.  The fourth row is carried out by the color modules a little higher, pushing the lower part down while fixing. </p><p>  5) Completely complete the entire fourth row. </p><p>  6) The next four rows are similar. </p><p>  7) 24 triangles of the main color are put on the previous row, turning the short side out. </p><p>  8) Collect the row to the end. </p><p>  9) For each 4th module, fasten 2 modules to increase the row by 6 modules. </p><p>  10) In the same order to collect all 8 rows.  The result is a head. </p><p>  11) In the last row, bring the triangles together. </p><p>  12) The ears are assembled from six modules, as well as the first row of the head </p><p>  13) Put on the extreme triangles at the extreme corners of the 2nd and 1st rows, moreover, in the second row there will be five modular triangles, and in the third - again six.  Run 7 rows.  By the eighth, make a narrowing: put the extreme two triangles on the 3 extreme ends of the previously constructed row.  The eighth row consists of five modules.  In the 9th row, put on 4 modules, extend the 2 middle ones above the rest. </p><p>  14) The second ear is made through one module in a similar design. </p><p>  15) The hare from the origami modules is ready!  It remains to show imagination and stick on eyes and other attributes to complete this product. </p>
