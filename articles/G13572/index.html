This suggests that a new stage has begun in international relations, characterized by a fierce clash of several powers for the division of influence in various spheres. </p><h2>  Economics in relations between France and Russia </h2><p>  French capital began to actively penetrate into Russia in the third third of the 19th century.  In 1875, a large mining society was created by the French in the southern part of Russia.  Their capital basically had 20 million francs.  In 1876, the French engaged in gas lighting in St. Petersburg.  A year later, they open steel and ironmaking concerns in Poland, which then belonged to the Russian Empire.  Also, every year on the territory of Russia, various joint-stock companies and factories were opened, which had a capital of 10 million francs or more.  They mined for export salt, ore and other minerals. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.walldevil.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian empire flag" class="if uuid-2486877" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44098/2486877.jpg"></div><p>  At the end of the 19th century, the Russian government experienced certain financial difficulties.  Then it was decided to start negotiations in 1886 with French bankers.  Two years later, dialogues with banks begin.  They develop successfully and easily.  The first loan amount was small - only 500 million francs.  But this loan was a great start in this relationship. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thus, we will consider the vibrant economic relations between Russia and France in the eighties of the 19th century, initiated by France. </p><h2>  Reasons for the development of economic relations </h2><p>  There are three good reasons.  Firstly, the Russian market was very impressed with the French.  Secondly, the richest deposits of raw materials in the Russian Empire actively attracted foreign investment.  Third, the economy is the political bridge France intended to build.  Next, we will talk about the formation of the Russian-French alliance and the consequences. </p><h2>  Allied Cultural Relations </h2><p>  This state, which we are considering, has been linked by cultural traditions for many centuries.  French culture significantly influenced the Russian, and the entire domestic intelligentsia was brought up on the latest ideas of the French enlightenment.  The names of philosophers and writers, such as Voltaire, Diderot, Cornell, were known to every educated Russian.  And in the eighties of the 19th century, a radical upheaval of these national cultures took place.  For a short period of time, publishing houses specializing in the printing of Russian literary works appear in Paris.  The novels of Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, as well as the works of Turgenev, Ostrovsky, Korolenko, Goncharov, Nekrasov and other pillars of Russian literature were actively translated.  Similar processes are observed in various forms of art.  For example, Russian composers were widely recognized in the musical circles of France. </p><p>  On the streets of the French capital, electric flashlights are lit.  The townspeople called them ‚Äúthe apple‚Äù.  They got such a name by the name of the inventor, who was a famous domestic electrical engineer and professor Yablochkov.  French humanities is actively interested in history, literature, and the Russian language.  And philology in general.  The works of professors Curiera and Louis Leger become fundamental. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.1000flags.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="flags of Russia and France" class="if uuid-2486906" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44098/2486906.jpg"></div><p>  Thus, Russian-French relations in the field of culture became multilateral and wide.  If earlier France was a "donor" of Russia in the field of culture, then in the nineteenth century their relations became mutual, that is, bilateral.  It is noteworthy that the inhabitants of France get acquainted with the cultural works of Russia, and also begin to develop various topics at a scientific level.  And we are going to study the causes of the Russian-French alliance. </p><h2>  Political relations and prerequisites for the emergence of an alliance by France </h2><p>  France during this period waged small colonial wars.  Therefore, in the eighties, her relations with Italy and England worsened.  Then purely complicated relations with Germany isolated France in Europe.  Thus, she was surrounded by enemies.  The danger for this state increased day by day, so French politicians and diplomats sought to improve relations with Russia, as well as to get closer to it in various fields.  This is one of the explanations for the conclusion of the Russian-French alliance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="visit-paris.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="alexand bridge 3" class="if uuid-2486924" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44098/2486924.jpg"></div><h2>  Political relations and prerequisites for the emergence of an alliance by the Russian Empire </h2><p>  Now consider the position of Russia in the international arena of relations.  At the end of the 19th century, a whole system of alliances took shape in Europe.  The first of them is Austro-German.  The second is Austro-German-Italian or in another way the Triple.  The third is the Union of Three Emperors (Russia, Austria-Hungary and Germany).  It was in it that Germany occupied a dominant position.  The first two alliances theoretically threatened Russia, and the presence of the Union of the Three Emperors gave rise to doubts after the crisis in Bulgaria.  The political benefits of Russia and France were not yet relevant.  In addition, the two states had a common adversary in the East - Great Britain, which was a rival for France in the Egyptian state and the Mediterranean, and for Russia in the Asian lands.  It is noteworthy that the strengthening of the Russian-French alliance became apparent when Anglo-Russian interests in Central Asia intensified, when Britain tried to draw Austria and Prussia into enmity with Russia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="ru.echo.az" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="emperor alexander 3" class="if uuid-2486880" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44098/2486880.jpg"></div><h2>  The outcome of the confrontations </h2><p>  This situation in the political arena led to the fact that signing an agreement with the French state was much easier than with Prussia.  This was evidenced by the agreement on concessions, the optimal volume of trade, as well as the absence of conflicts in this area.  In addition, Paris regarded this idea as a means of pressure on the Germans.  After all, Berlin was extremely afraid of the formation of the Russian-French alliance.  It is known that the penetration of two cultures strengthened the political ideas of the powers. </p><h2>  The conclusion of the Russian-French Union </h2><p>  This union was developing very difficultly and slowly.  This was preceded by various steps.  But the main one was the rapprochement between the two countries.  They were mutual.  However, there was a little more action from France.  In the spring of 1890, Germany refused to renew the reinsurance contract with Russia.  Then the French authorities turned the situation in their direction.  A year later, in July, the French military squadron visits Kronstadt.  This visit is nothing more than a demonstration of Russian-French friendship.  Guests were met by Emperor Alexander III himself.  After this, the next round of negotiations of diplomats took place.  The result of this meeting was the pact of Russia and France, which was sealed with signatures of the foreign ministers.  According to this document, the states were obliged in the event of a threat of attack to agree on joint activities that could be taken simultaneously and immediately.  So the Russian-French Union was formed (1891). </p><div class="photo" data-original="petersburg.berkeley.edu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="friendship monument" class="if uuid-2486919" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44098/2486919.jpg"></div><h2>  Next Steps and Actions </h2><p>  It is noteworthy that the reception of the emperor given to the French sailors in Kronstadt was an event with far-reaching consequences.  Petersburg newspaper rejoiced!  With such formidable power, the Triple Alliance will be forced to stop and fall into thought.  Then the German attorney B√ºlow wrote to the Reich Chancellor that the Kronstadt meeting is a difficult factor, which powerfully hits the renewed Triple Association.  Then, in 1892, a new positive round took place in relation to the Russian-French alliance.  The head of the General Staff of France is invited by the Russian side to military maneuvers.  In August of this year, he and General Obruchev signed a military convention, consisting of three provisions.  It was supposed to be prepared by the Minister of Foreign Affairs - Gears, who was delaying the performance.  However, the emperor did not rush him.  Germany took advantage of the situation and launched a new customs war with Russia.  In addition, the German army grew to 4 million soldiers.  Upon learning of this, Alexander III was seriously angry and defiantly took the next step towards rapprochement with an ally, sending our military squadron to Toulon.  The formation of the Russian-French alliance unnerved Germany. </p><h2>  Convention Design </h2><p>  The French state gave the Russian sailors an enthusiastic welcome.  Then Alexander III cast aside all doubts.  He ordered Minister Gears to expedite the writing of the submission of the convention, and soon on December 14 he approved it.  Then an exchange of letters took place, which was provided for by a protocol of diplomats between the capitals of the two powers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ship alexander 2" class="if uuid-2486883" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44098/2486883.jpg"></div><p>  Thus, in December 1893, the convention began to operate.  The French Union was concluded. </p><h2>  The consequences of the political game between Russia and France </h2><p>  Similarly to the Triple Alliance, an agreement between Russia and France was created in terms of defense.  In fact, the first, that the second union was fraught with a military aggressive beginning in the capture and division of spheres of influence of sales markets, as well as sources of raw materials.  The formation of the Russian-French alliance completed the regrouping of forces that seethed in Europe after the 1878 Congress in Berlin.  As it turned out, the correlation of military and political forces depended on whose interest England would support, which at that time was the most economically developed state.  However, Misty Albion preferred to maintain neutrality, continuing the position called "brilliant isolation."  However, the growing colonial claims of Germany forced the Foggy Albion to begin to lean towards the Russian-French alliance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="petersburglike.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="port of kronstadt" class="if uuid-2486899" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44098/2486899.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The Russian-French block was formed in 1891 and lasted until 1917.  This led to significant changes and alignment of forces in Europe.  The conclusion of the alliance is considered a turning point in the development of the French state in the era of World War II.  This combination of forces led France to overcome political isolation.  Russia provided for the ally and Europe not only stability, but also strength in the status of a Great Power. </p>
