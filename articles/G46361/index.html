Game Rules for Beginners</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Probably there is no such person who would never play checkers and did not know their rules.  Most people get to know them in their childhood and, as a rule, after spending one batch, they always remember simple rules.  And even more so, everyone knows what a fook is in checkers, and how it is used as part of the game. </p><p>  Well, for those who are not familiar with this term, we will talk about this in more detail, as well as about the simple rules of famous fun. </p><h2>  About Checkers </h2><p>  Acquaintance with this game should start with a listing of the items included in it.  There are few of them: </p><ul><li>  checkered board; </li><li>  12 white pieces; </li><li>  a dozen blacks. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.freeimageslive.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="who walks after a fuka in checkers" class="if uuid-3175889" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62045/3175889.jpg"></div><p>  Here are simple rules for playing checkers for beginners: </p><ol><li>  Two people participate in the party, each using figures of the same color (black or white). </li><li>  Light ones are placed on dark cells, black in the same way, 4 in a line through one.  Only three rows on each side of the board. </li><li>  Who will be the first to walk is determined by drawing lots (in childhood, "stone, scissors, paper" is usually played in the standard fun). </li><li>  The player who started walking continues the game until he takes the opponent‚Äôs checkers.  If the action is unsuccessful, then it is the opponent‚Äôs turn. </li><li>  Simple figures go on one cage, ladies (upside down) - the entire length of the board in dark squares. </li><li>  The drafts are those checkers that were able to reach the extreme line of the board from the enemy side. </li><li>  The opponent is obliged to beat the figures of another player, closely located to him (only those that are oblique, and not opposite). </li><li>  The rule of fuka in checkers means that the opponent takes the piece that they were obliged to beat (step over the chips of another player), but this was not done.  This is done simply: it turns over, and you can blow on it from the back.  This is optional, but so accepted. </li><li>  The game continues until one of the participants runs out of all the pieces. </li></ol><p>  These are standard rules, there are also other options when opponents intentionally substitute checkers under the attack of another player.  These are the so-called "giveaways." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.freeimages.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fook in checkers board game" class="if uuid-3175880" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62045/3175880.jpg"></div><h2>  Important points </h2><p>  So, we figured out the rules, now it‚Äôs worth talking about several important features of the game, about which beginners sometimes do not know. </p><p>  Since the main goal is to take away all the opponent‚Äôs checkers, a more experienced participant can build a whole strategy to achieve the task.  Often, methods such as deliberately exposing your pieces to attack are used for this.  And then the enemy is faced with a choice: either he hits, or the fuka rule in checkers will be applied to him. </p><p>  But you should not immediately think that if you are obliged to attack according to the rules of the game, then it is definitely worth doing.  It is often more profitable to give one of the twelve checkers per fuk than to beat the opponent‚Äôs piece and lose more of their sweat.  Here you need to carefully evaluate the balance of power and make the right decision. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.shutterstock.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fuka rule in checkers" class="if uuid-3175886" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62045/3175886.jpg"></div><h2>  Small clarification </h2><p>  Sometimes, beginners have a standard question: who goes after a fuka in checkers?  The answer is simple, the action goes to the player who took the piece.  This equates to an attack during a normal move. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  About the ladies.  They can beat several checkers located along the line of its movement.  In general, against the ladies it is extremely difficult to play without your own. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that when conducting a game, many experienced participants use proven patterns of moves.  That is why one fight between skilled players can last for long hours, and sometimes ends after several attacks (experienced chess players see in advance who will lose and who will win).  In such games, the fuk in checkers is often not used, since there is no need for it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.istockphoto.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fook in checkers" class="if uuid-3175896" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62045/3175896.jpg"></div><h2>  History tour </h2><p>  Many gambling has deep roots, this sport is no exception.  Checkers can even be called almost the most ancient fun, which has historical confirmation. </p><p>  It is believed that the first game arose in Ancient Egypt, it happened a half thousand years before the beginning of our era.  Of course, it was not an exact copy of the modern one, but the main features were similar (checkered board and flat plates).  What were the rules is not exactly known. </p><p>  There is another interesting theory of the origin of this game.  If you believe her, then a certain warrior Palamed, a participant in the siege of Troy, came up with fun.  According to legend, the siege of this ancient city lasted ten years, and the Greek came up with it in order to pass the time. </p><p>  Now you know exactly the rules of the game, and in what cases a fook in checkers is used, as well as a brief history of their occurrence. </p>
