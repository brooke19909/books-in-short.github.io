The course of the meeting and the features of the event.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The last congress of the CPSU took place on June 2, 1990 and lasted almost two weeks - until June 13.  This was the largest mass meeting of deputies in history, which was attended by more than 4,500 deputies from all 15 union republics from all the outskirts of the former communist country.  It was the first congress after World War II, which was preceded by a party conference.  And, indeed, the issues that should have been resolved required the most intense research.  It was necessary to understand what to do with the <span>Soviet Union?</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lavka-shop.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Badge from the 28th Congress" class="if uuid-2580287" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88942/2580287.jpg"></div><h2>  Election of delegates and renaming </h2><p>  Due to the fact that this was the most unusual congress in the entire history of the Soviet Union, the choice of deputies to go to the event was not classic.  For the first and last time, those who were elected by higher bodies were not elected from party administrative departments.  A special commission was created specifically for this, which organized special alternative elections to the council. </p><p>  To preserve its existence, the party found an extraordinary way out which, in the case of the most unpleasant scenario for the Communist Party, could retain at least some political power of its residents.  Thus, the first Russian party was created, even before the independence of Russia.  She became the Communist Party of the Russian Federation.  It became part of the CPSU and was established by the first President of the USSR Mikhail Gorbachev.  The first congress of this party took place in early September 1990. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How did the last congress of the CPSU begin? </h2><p>  Even the opening of the XXVIII General was not without incidents.  The scandal was the fact that the first speaker, a deputy of the People‚Äôs Council, instead of a welcoming speech immediately began to say that Gorbachev needed to impeach.  Nothing like this has happened in the entire short history of the USSR.  The country simply did not have such a concept. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theguardian.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gorbachev leaves the party" class="if uuid-2580310" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88942/2580310.jpg"></div><p>  For the first time in 70 years, representatives of other political parties participated in the meeting, and the secretary general first took office during the vote.  The last congress of the CPSU in the USSR was still full of interesting innovations.  But the time of their introduction into circulation was long lost. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  The last congress of the CPSU was the most scandalous meeting of the party in history.  Accordingly, the decisions at the congress were scandalous.  The Central Committee is elected without candidates, those who have been elected cannot agree.  The scandals corroding the party do not allow the development and approval of the goals and program of the Communist Party. </p><p>  This congress showed the failure of the former leadership and the crisis of the political system.  In all this confusion, new parties began to appear on the basis of the CPSU. </p><p>  The number of conservative delegates became less and less until the General Secretary of the Soviet Union Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev left the CPSU.  Perhaps this is precisely what helped the politician to be elected a second time.  After that, the political weight of this figure began to decline rapidly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sites.google.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="First president" class="if uuid-2580304" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88942/2580304.jpg"></div><p>  The country needed changes, and the new young people in politics did not want to be connected in any way with the previous line of the party.  Many have hatred of the regime and socialism in general. </p><h2>  Significance for Soviet citizens </h2><div class="photo" data-original="imrussia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="After socialism" class="if uuid-2580313" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88942/2580313.jpg"></div><p>  The last congress of the CPSU turned out to be the last psychological frontier, after which it became clear to everyone that communism would not be built.  Residents of the Union countries realized that you can no longer be silent, you can go outside and talk about your intentions, and no one will ever send anyone to the Gulag again.  The population was happy that they had the opportunity to nationally determine themselves, although this medal, as we see from future events, has a downside. </p>
