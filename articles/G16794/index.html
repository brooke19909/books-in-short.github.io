  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hotel "Moscow" (Peter): description with photos, infrastructure, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Moscow Hotel in St. Petersburg is dedicated to the Wikipedia page, and that means a lot.  The building itself cannot boast of ancient history.  But after the reconstruction, which took place in the 2000s, it became another attraction of the city on the Neva.  In this article, we will comprehensively examine the Moscow Hotel in St. Petersburg.  Photos of the building and rooms, a description of the infrastructure and location, reviews of travelers who stayed at the hotel - all this you will find in our review. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel &quot;Moscow&quot; in St. Petersburg - photo" class="if uuid-2963443" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2963443.jpg"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  If you came to the Northern capital as a tourist, then location is more convenient than the Moscow Hotel, you simply cannot be found.  All key sights of St. Petersburg are located a maximum of fifteen minutes walk from the hotel.  The building stands on the Neva Embankment.  Directly opposite the hotel are various architectural monuments of the 18th century, as well as the Museum of Urban Sculpture.  Moscow Hotel Address: St. Petersburg, Alexander Nevsky Square, 2. This is the historical center of the city. </p><p>  The building is located at the end of Nevsky Prospect, the main artery of the Northern capital.  Some rooms offer classic views of St. Petersburg over the river and the drawbridge.  Also from the balconies you can admire the domes of the Alexander Nevsky Lavra - the very first monastery in St. Petersburg (early 18th century).  It should be said that the seven-story house in which the Moscow Hotel is located was built in the 1970s.  But Soviet dull minimalism in the mid-2000s was changed.  The building has acquired beautiful modern facades and romantic attics.  A shopping center was also located inside. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="59.9244709" data-lng="30.3863159" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/1/7/1/5/11715.png"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Hotel "Moscow" (Peter) perfectly fit into the transport infrastructure of the city.  Judge for yourself: you can get to the metro station "Ploshchad Aleksandra Nevskogo" without even going outside.  It is located in the same building.  There are several public transport stops near the hotel.  This bus number 191, trams number 7, 65 and 24, as well as trolley buses number 14, 1, 16, 33 and 22. Bus route 27 is especially popular with tourists. No need to spend money on a city tour.  After all, the route of bus 27 runs through the center and attractions such as Theater Square and St. Isaac's Cathedral. </p><p>  The nearest train station (Moskovsky) can be reached on foot in just ten minutes, or take one metro stop.  During the white nights, you can see how parts of the drawbridge on the Neva are moving apart.  In the area there are a lot of restaurants, cafes, shops.  In the building there is a shopping center and a round-the-clock Prism supermarket.  All guests of the Moscow Hotel gave the hotel the highest score for location and transport accessibility. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel &quot;Moscow&quot; (St. Petersburg), photo of rooms" class="if uuid-2963460" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2963460.jpg"></div><h2>  Overview of room stock.  Offers for budget travelers </h2><p>  Moscow is a very large hotel.  It has more than seven hundred rooms.  All of them are divided into categories.  Let's see where the guests of the Moscow Hotel in St. Petersburg live.  Photos of the rooms will accompany the description of the rooms.  So, the most budgetary proposal is a family economy.  This room is for four people.  The bedroom has one wide bed and a bunk bed.  But that is not all.  Even in the economy category room there is a flat-screen TV, a coffee table with chairs, an ottoman with a mirror, a ‚Äúbag‚Äù chair, a refrigerator (drinking water in it is free), air conditioning, and a safe. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition, a special corner of the bedroom is reserved for children's leisure.  There is an easel, pencils, coloring.  For family meals, a set of dishes, an electric kettle, and bags with drinks are offered.  You will suspect that you are not in the economy room at all if you look in the bathroom.  A snow-white bathtub, a set of hygiene items, including toothbrushes, a hairdryer, slippers and bathrobes along with fluffy white towels - it seems that you are in a suite.  Such a family economy costs from 8400 rubles per day.  This price includes breakfast for guests directly in the rooms. </p><div class="photo" data-original="planetofhotels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Moscow (St. Petersburg), photo of the standard room" class="if uuid-2963475" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2963475.jpg"></div><h2>  Standards </h2><p>  If such a level of comfort is observed in the economy, then what to expect from the rooms of a higher category?  Photo of the standard room of the Moscow Hotel (St. Petersburg) shows us a room with modern amenities.  It is more spacious and bright and also has the whole range of economy services.  These standards are for two and three guests.  In addition, there is another room that is fully adapted to the needs of people with disabilities. </p><p>  As for the triple standard, there is only one gripe: stupidly placed single beds.  Because of this, the room resembles a hospital ward or a room in a pioneer camp.  But everything else in the standard guests liked.  The service is excellent, the space is thought out, they clean well.  Breakfast is included in the bill.  And there is a triple standard from 6900 rubles.  The price of a room of this category for two guests starts from 3500 rubles.  They can have both 2 single beds and a wide matrimonial bed.  The room size of this standard is more modest, only 19 square meters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  But the room for guests with disabilities has a very cozy spacious bedroom.  In addition to two separate beds, it has a desk, chairs and an ottoman.  The entrance to the room, as well as the bathroom are fully adapted for the movement of a person in a wheelchair.  Such a standard is worth 4200 rubles per day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel &quot;Moscow&quot; 4 stars, Peter" class="if uuid-2963482" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2963482.jpg"></div><h2>  Junior Suite </h2><p>  Many people know how hard it is to travel alone.  The hotel often simply does not have the appropriate rooms and you have to pay for two places.  But in the hotel "Moscow" (St. Petersburg), a lone traveler can also settle with conveniences.  What offers a room called a junior suite for 4000 rubles per day?  This is a spacious bedroom, where the bed is covered with improved linens.  Unlike standards, the room has a seating area with a sofa, soft armchair and coffee table.  The bathroom has a modern shower or bathtub, as well as a bidet. </p><p>  There are junior suite rooms for two guests.  These junior suites are two-room.  They cost from seven and a half thousand rubles a day.  What amenities await the guests of this room?  The same as in the economy, but their list includes a separate living room with upholstered furniture (armchairs, sofa) and a coffee table.  Flat-screen TVs are in both rooms.  Bed linens in these rooms are of superior quality, and the bathroom has, among other things, a bidet.  Peter is a rainy city.  Guests of the junior suites are kindly invited to a large cane umbrella. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hotel-moscow.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel &quot;Moscow&quot; in St. Petersburg: suites" class="if uuid-2963485" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2963485.jpg"></div><h2>  Suites </h2><p>  The pride of any hotel are rooms of the highest category.  The Moscow Hotel in St. Petersburg is no exception.  Photos of such rooms cause an irresistible desire to settle in them.  This category includes: deluxe, deluxe plus, comfort business, apartments and family apartments.  The cost of rooms of this category varies from 7.5 to 11 thousand rubles a day.  We will compare them with the junior suite. </p><p>  In the suite, among other amenities, there is a desk in the living room, and in the bathroom guests will find sewing and other useful sets.  In addition, the view from the suites is more impressive: the windows face the Neva.  The inhabitants of this room are entitled to pleasant bonuses, such as a bottle of wine upon check-in and free access to the pool from 8 am to noon.  The windows of the suite plus open onto the Alexander Nevsky Lavra.  Guests of this room, in addition to the above bonuses, are entitled to evening service.  In business comfort, a business person will find a desk with stationery, and to relax after work, he is offered free access to the spa and sauna. </p><h2>  Apartments </h2><p>  It is no exaggeration to say that these are the best rooms at the Moscow Hotel (St. Petersburg).  Apartments often feature kitchens.  And they themselves are luxurious chambers.  They consist of several rooms: a bedroom, a living room, a kitchen, a study and two bathrooms.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãsuch an apartment, whose windows overlook the Neva Embankment, is 57 square meters. </p><p>  Tourists leave a lot of laudatory reviews about the cuisine, because it serves as a significant help during your stay in St. Petersburg.  It is equipped with a hob, microwave, coffee maker (capsules with a drink are included), an electric kettle, a set of necessary utensils.  As a compliment, a bottle of wine is provided to guests of the apartments.  They have free access to the hotel pool in the morning. </p><p>  There are family apartments in the hotel.  They are designed for 4-6 people.  Unlike the usual version, the room has two bedrooms, and in the living room there is a folding sofa.  But tourists mention that in the kitchen of this room there is no stove, but there is only a microwave. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.getaroom.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel &quot;Moscow&quot; in St. Petersburg on Nevsky" class="if uuid-2963493" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2963493.jpg"></div><h2>  Meals at the Moscow 4 * Hotel in St. Petersburg </h2><p>  All room rates include breakfast for guests.  In the main restaurant "Balmont" (first and second floors) from seven to ten in the morning a buffet is served.  What do the guests say about breakfast?  Everyone was satisfied: meat-eaters, vegetarians, people requiring a special diet, and sweet tooth.  Guests are offered a wide selection of fresh pastries, several types of sausages and cheeses, very tasty cheese. </p><p>  Guests at the Moscow Hotel (Peter) liked the fact that you can make salads yourself.  In several containers, chopped vegetables and greens are on display, and vegetable oil, mayonnaise and sour cream are nearby.  On the hot there are always several types of cereals, six types of yogurt, pasta, fried eggs, sausages and crepes. </p><h2>  Where to eat at other times </h2><p>  In the building of the Hotel Moscow in St. Petersburg on Nevsky Prospect there are several restaurants, cafes and eateries.  So you can eat, without even going outside.  In the attic there is a panoramic Beef Bar Eight, which operates around the clock.  This establishment specializes in meat dishes.  On the ground floor there is a Russian restaurant "Pivorama".  In warmer months, an outdoor terrace opens here. </p><p>  Italian food lovers can have lunch or dinner at La Cuchina.  If you just want to have a bite, then in the hotel building there are representative offices of such chains as McDonald's and Chocolate Girl.  The last institution has a department for adherents of a healthy diet.  Delicious desserts are served at the Ontrome French Patisserie, and the 24-hour lobby bar offers an extensive wine list and great cocktails. </p><div class="photo" data-original="loopreizen.nl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Moscow (Peter) - reviews" class="if uuid-2963499" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2963499.jpg"></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The status of the Moscow Hotel in St. Petersburg is 4 stars.
