    <p>  In the event that some changes have occurred in a person‚Äôs life, for example, a change of surname, then the policy itself needs to be changed. </p><p>  Voluntary insurance policy is a document in the form of a plastic card, which allows you to use the services of medical institutions for free.  The list of services provided under such insurance is usually much wider than compulsory insurance.  For example, such services include dental treatment, in addition to prosthetics. </p><h2>  VHI policy </h2><p>  It is not worthwhile to consider in detail such a procedure as changing a <span>medical policy</span> when changing a surname, in this case, since it is issued and changed by the employer.  That is, if a woman got married and took her husband‚Äôs surname, she needs to notify her management, in particular the personnel department, of this fact by presenting a certificate of marriage. </p><p>  The personnel department takes the old policy, sends the information to the insurance company to obtain a new document on the basis of the marriage certificate, and after some time the employee can use the new document. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Such a policy is usually issued for a period of one year, from January 1 to December 31.  If the change of medical policy when changing the name took place in the middle of the year, then upon receipt of a new document the flow of time does not stop and the employee uses the policy the time remaining until the end of the year. </p><h2>  Policy Overview </h2><p>  A compulsory insurance document involves obtaining basic services - a doctor‚Äôs examination, fluorography, free medications (the most necessary minimum), the use of consumables (bandage, cotton wool, alcohol, gypsum, etc.), sampling tests and obtaining results. </p><p>  Obtaining and other manipulations with the <span>compulsory health insurance policy is</span> carried out by the insured himself.  Otherwise, free basic care at the clinic or hospital will not be possible. </p><p>  The policy is issued at special offices of the insurance company.  The most famous organizations in this regard are Alfastrakhovanie, ZhASO, ROSNO, VTB, Ingosstrakh, Renaissance and others. </p><p>  First, the applicant is given a temporary policy, which can be served at any clinic in the country.  After 30 days, the citizen is notified via sms or via e-mail (depending on what data the person left when filling out the temporary document) that the policy can be obtained.  In the same way, a change in medical policy occurs when you change your name. </p><h2>  Data in the compulsory medical insurance document </h2><p>  A medical policy is a sheet of paper on the front side of which the following information is indicated: </p><p>  - FULL NAME.; </p><p>  - gender; </p><p>  - validity; </p><p>  - signature of the owner; </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  - hologram and barcode. </p><p>  On the back of the document there are 10 points where a mark is placed on attachment to a medical insurance organization.  At the bottom of the sheet are the series and number of this policy. </p>

    <h2>  What do you need to receive? </h2><p>  Replacing a medical insurance policy when changing a surname occurs in the organization in which this document was received earlier.  You need to have the following documents with you: </p><p>  - a new passport, where new data is indicated (last name, first name and patronymic); </p><p>  - old policy (optional); </p><p>  - SNILS - pension <span>insurance certificate</span> (green plastic card). </p><h2>  Where to change the medical policy when changing the name of the child? </h2><p>  For children, if they also have other data, it is also worth changing the main document first, that is, a birth certificate.  In the passports of the parents, it is necessary to change the information about the child, since he already has a different surname (name or patronymic). </p><p>  To obtain a policy, you need to contact the local branch of the insurance company, at the place of registration in the village. </p>

    <p>  A temporary policy is issued for both a child and an adult for 30 days.  It can be used in the same way as the original until the main document is received.  Thus, if a <span>medical policy</span> has <span>changed when the name is changed</span> and the person has only a temporary use form, this does not give the right to medical institutions to refuse service. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Policy Replacement Procedure for Children </h2><p>  If a minor is not yet 14 years old, then he comes to receive a policy with one of his parents, who must have his passport with him. </p><p>  Documents for the child: </p><p>  - birth certificate with a new surname; </p><p>  - SNILS (if any). </p><p>  If the child already has a passport, he can independently contact the office of the company, where the medical policy will be replaced when the name is changed.  In this case, the following documents should be available: </p><p>  - passport with valid data (with a new surname); </p><p>  - SNILS (if available). </p><p>  The registration procedure takes place in a unified way: first a temporary policy is issued, then a permanent one. </p><h2>  Comparison </h2><p>  If you compare the policy with other documents, such as a pension insurance certificate or tax identification number, it should be noted that if SNILS and TIN are assigned once as numbers, the medical document will have other numbers when replacing. </p><p>  When a new surname has appeared, another passport is issued, therefore, in fact, another person will be served at a clinic or other similar institution.  If a person can be identified in a tax or <span>Pension fund</span> by the number that is assigned to him once and for all, then the replacement of a medical policy when changing his name must necessarily take place for further full service. </p>

    <p>  In addition, it is necessary to monitor the relevance of such data as the address of residence.  With the help of a policy, an attachment to a medical institution takes place.  Therefore, in order to start servicing in another place, if a person has moved, you need to go to a local hospital and put a stamp saying that a citizen will be treated in this institution. </p><p>  Detachment from the old clinic occurs without the participation of a citizen.  Employees must independently submit a request and notify the previous clinic that the patient has left their service area. </p><h2>  If there is no policy </h2><p>  If a person has changed his surname or other personal data, there is no need to immediately run to the insurance company for a new policy.  However, if a situation arises when you really need some kind of treatment, it will be impossible to get it without a policy. </p><p>  It should be said that emergency or urgent help will certainly be provided.  Moreover, the first type is help in conditions that threaten life, and the second - in conditions that threaten health.  As soon as the threat recedes into the background, the person will be allowed to go home, since further treatment without a policy is impossible. </p>

    <p>  The only plus of this document, unlike others, is that the change of the medical insurance policy when changing the name and receiving its temporary version occurs within 5 minutes if there is no line in the office. </p><h2>  How to issue remotely? </h2><p>  There is absolutely no time to go to the office of the insurance company?  Many agencies provide policy-free services without visiting. </p><p>  First of all, working citizens will be interested in the function of ordering a document on the Internet and the address where you can personally change a medical policy when changing a surname or pick up a finished one.  You must choose a company in which there is a desire to be insured, and fill out a questionnaire.  Based on these data, a temporary, and in the future, permanent version will be printed, so you need to be careful about entering the data. </p><p>  After ordering the policy, the manager contacts the citizen and clarifies whether a request for receipt has been implemented.  For some time, the document is brought to your home or a notification arrives that it needs to be picked up at a specific address. </p><h2>  Resources </h2><p>  The most advanced in terms of electronic assistance is the EMIAS.INFO website.  Launched in 2011, the service is a great success.  This is due to the fact that this resource contains all the possible companies that provide insurance of various types. </p><p>  That is, if you need to change the medical policy when changing your name or get it for the first time, you need to go to the site, select the ‚ÄúMHI policy‚Äù category, scroll through the organizations and leave a request on the company‚Äôs website. </p><p>  In addition, on the website you can make an appointment with a doctor by the compulsory medical insurance policy number for various needs, including for passing a medical examination at the traffic police. </p>

    <p>  However, services are available only to residents of Moscow.  There are no regional resources of such a plan yet, but it is possible to go to the website of your territorial insurance company and clarify whether they have the service of ordering a policy via the Internet with or without delivery. </p><h2>  Who is eligible for CHI? </h2><p>  The service for obtaining insurance policies is not available to all people in Russia.  If you need a change in health insurance policy when changing your name, then the following categories will be able to take advantage of this: </p><p>  - citizens of the Russian Federation - indefinitely; </p><p>  - refugees - for the duration of the stay; </p><p>  - foreign nationals and stateless persons - for the duration of the temporary permit. </p><p>  With regard to the last two categories, it should be noted that the documents that these persons must submit to the insurance company will be as follows: </p><p>  - for refugees - a special certificate; </p><p>  - for foreign citizens or without citizenship - SNILS (if any) and a document according to the type of Russian passport, that is, one that identifies you;  in this regard, Russia has an international treaty regarding documents that can be recognized as such by which a person can be identified. </p><h2>  Prospects </h2><p>  The need to <span>change the medical insurance policy</span> when changing the name in the future may coincide with the procedure for replacing policies on an all-Russian scale.  It is planned that all citizens with such a form will gradually draw up a document in the form of a plastic card, as necessary to obtain a new policy. </p>

Thus, it is believed that the degree of protection will increase many times, that is, no one, except the owner himself, will be able to use a registered insurance policy. </p><p>  If a person does not need to change anything in his life, that is, the data remains the same, an ordinary paper document will act indefinitely. </p>
