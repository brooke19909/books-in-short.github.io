What is the importance of intestinal in nature and in life</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Despite the rather simple structural features, the importance in the nature of the coelenterates is very noticeable.  And the total number of representatives of this type reaches 10 thousand species.  The ranges of their habitat are also diverse - from small freshwater reservoirs to deep-sea troughs of the oceans.  What is the importance of intestinal cavity in nature, we will briefly consider in our article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1201860" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40004/1201860.jpg?1540718805"></div><h2>  origin of name </h2><p>  It is no coincidence that these multicellular animals have the name of a taxonomic unit.  The fact is that they have an intestinal cavity in which food is digested.  She enters her through the oral opening with the help of tentacles.  Specialized <span>glandular cells</span> secrete digestive enzymes inside the body cavity, under the influence of which the digestion process takes place. </p><h2>  Specific traits </h2><p>  The value of the coelenterates in nature and human life is largely determined by the features of their structure.  First of all, these are two layers of the body: the outer and inner.  They are made up of specialized cells.  Each type of them performs certain functions.  Intermediate during division give rise to new cells, nerves unite the body into a single whole and determine its relationship with the environment.  And due to the presence of skin-muscle cells, the intestinal can contract, bend, and move. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>Intestinal cells</span> are <span>stinging cells.</span>  They are located in the outer layer of the body.  These cells consist of a capsule, inside of which there is a twisted thread with a sharp end.  Outside the cell is a sensitive hair.  When an individual touches someone, the stinging string unwinds and forces itself into the body of the victim.  In this case, a toxic substance is also introduced.  It can not only paralyze, but also lead to the death of the body. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1201853" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40004/1201853.jpg?1540718805"></div><h2>  Freshwater hydra </h2><p>  The value of the coelenterates in nature and for humans can be considered by the example of their typical representative - hydra.  This small organism is a link in the food chain.  Of course, for fish fry they are inaccessible, because they are burned by stinging cells.  But for branched crustaceans, their effect is not terrible, so they feed on the tissues of this type of intestinal.  The body surface of the hydra is ideal for the habitat of different types of ciliates. </p><p>  The discovery and study of the <span>structural</span> features of <span>hydra</span> was an important stage in the development of taxonomy.  Experiments with the participation of this organism were evidence that regeneration and inability to sexual process are not their distinguishing features.  The name of the hydra was given by the founder of taxonomy Karl Linney.  He had in mind the eponymous mythological character, whose severed heads were quickly restored.  Freshwater hydra is also striking in its ability to regenerate.  She can fully recover from 1/200 part! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Hydra purifies water from organic particles, as a natural filter. </p><h2>  Dangerous burns </h2><p>  What is the importance of gastrointestinal in nature, we examined a little.  Every person who has experienced the action of stinging cells of jellyfish should be interested in this topic.  They are located on the surface of their bell and oral cavity.  Encountering with many of these organisms may be unsafe. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1201862" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40004/1201862.jpg?1540718805"></div><p>  In the tropical seas inhabited by colonies of the <span>Portuguese boat.</span>  The venom of their stinging cells causes severe burns, pain, disturbances in the rhythm of breathing and the functioning of the heart.  If you do not provide assistance to the victim in time, the outcome can be fatal.  The inhabitants of the northern habitats are also dangerous: <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãwasp</span> and cyanoea. </p><p>  In case of severe burns, it is necessary to remove stinging cells from the skin with a tissue, treat the affected area with ammonia, alcohol or soda solution.  If the effect was strong, you should immediately consult a doctor. </p><h2>  Jellyfish </h2><p>  Translucent umbrellas of jellyfish, unlike polyps, are able to actively move.  They are typical predators, hunting invertebrate animals and fish.  Some <span>types of jellyfish</span> are capable of reactive movement.  Others, such as a sea lantern and others, slowly creep from place to place. </p><p>  What is the importance in nature of gastrointestinal, leading a mobile lifestyle?  Naturally, this is an important and indispensable component of marine ecosystems and food chains. </p><p>  In addition to poisonous species, edible are also known in nature.  In many countries of Asia, they are a favorite delicacy. </p><p>  Like hydras, jellyfish are an object of experimental zoology.  And the device, capable of predicting earthquakes, storms and storms, is designed based on the structure of these marine inhabitants. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1201861" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40004/1201861.jpg?1540718805"></div><h2>  Coral </h2><p>  It is interesting to consider the value in the intestinal cavity by the example of colonial coral polyps.  In appearance, they do not resemble animals at all, especially since they lead an attached lifestyle.  Propagating by budding, the resulting protrusions are not split off.  As a result, we get structures of a bizarre shape.  Their inner skeleton is formed by calcium carbonate or solid organic matter. </p><p>  Actinium coral polyp looks like a bright fantastic flower.  Most of them lead a predatory lifestyle, hunting small clams, crustaceans and fish.  There are also filtrators.  Such sea anemones feed on algae, bacteria, and protozoa in the water.  At the same time, they perform an additional function - they purify water. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1201864" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40004/1201864.jpg?1540718805"></div><h2>  Underwater house </h2><p>  Enterobacteria have what significance in nature, the hermit cancer knows for sure.  And this is not quite a joke.  The thing is that without this polyp, cancer simply cannot exist.  Actinium, in turn, receives the remnants of cancer food and uses it as a means of transportation.  Changing the shell, the animal transplanted on it and its polyp.  And in the literal sense of the word.  He strokes the sea anemone with a claw to creep into a new place.  Here is such an amazing mutually beneficial "cohabitation." </p><h2>  Caution: Reefs </h2><p>  Of particular importance in the nature of the coelenterates is the determination of coral reefs.  These are large colonies of polyps, the number of individuals in which reaches millions.  The largest of these is the Great Barrier Reef, which stretches along the Australian Pacific coast. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1201874" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40004/1201874.jpg?1540718805"></div><p>  This natural formation serves as the habitat for many species of algae, crustaceans, mollusks, worms and fish.  In coastal tropical island countries, people collect edible marine plants and animals on reefs.  And the limestone obtained from the skeletons of reefs is used in construction.  Since corals are formed by very solid matter, they protect the shores of the continents and islands from erosion.  Due to the aesthetic appeal, jewelry, household items, and souvenirs are made from them.  Many researchers believe that life on small tropical islands without reefs would be simply impossible.  The thing is the high biological productivity of this natural underwater ecosystem, the reasons for which scientists have yet to find out. </p><p>  Due to their unique structural features and species diversity, the importance in the nature of the intestinal cavity is quite important and determines their significant role in the natural ecosystems of the planet. </p>
