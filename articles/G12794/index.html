On its territory is <span>the Sukko Valley</span> with pistachio groves and relic junipers, a flat plateau, sea estuaries and Caucasian foothills.  This amazing place has a humid and mild Mediterranean climate.  During the year there are two hundred and eighty sunny days.  All these factors allow the swimming season to last from May to October.
