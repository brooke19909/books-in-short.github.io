  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sights of Bulgaria: photos and description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The sights of Bulgaria should be known to every person who is going to travel around this country.  Despite its small size, the country has many interesting places that cause pleasant emotions.  You can learn more about them with a description of the main details from our article. </p><h2>  Inspection of the capital </h2><p>  In Sofia, the sights of Bulgaria are presented in the best way, because the government takes care of the preservation of monuments.  Even when walking around the city, you can see the brickwork, which is several hundred years old.  It‚Äôs worth starting your journey with the amazingly beautiful Banya Bashi mosque.  This is one of the oldest church buildings in Europe, as indicated by the design and appearance.  The exact date has not been preserved, and no one can decrypt the inscription above the doors.  The building impresses not only with its beauty, but also creates an atmosphere of immersion in ancient times around itself.  Every tourist will want to spend some time here before continuing the hike. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.worldtravelguides.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bulgarian sights" class="if uuid-2338604" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2338604.jpg"></div><h2>  The main charms of Sofia </h2><p>  Among the attractions of Bulgaria, which are definitely worth a look, stands the fortress of Serdika from antiquity.  Today at this place there are only some ruins that have remained as a memory of the greatness of the era.  Once there was a Thracian fortress, which housed churches, the palace of the emperor and other buildings.  Travelers are advised to come here at least for a while. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After this, you should definitely go to St. Alexander Nevsky Square in order to see the incredible temple.  Already at first glance you can notice the complex architecture and a large number of details of almost handmade.  The cathedral is considered the main church building in the country, and by its size it will make any person feel like a not too significant figure.  Inside the building at the same time about five thousand people can be present at the service.  This fact already testifies to the uniqueness of the cathedral and its size. </p><h2>  A number of interesting places in the capital </h2><p>  If a person is in Sofia, which is located quite far from the main resorts, then you should see all its attractions.  In Bulgaria, they take care of the availability of cultural places, and therefore it is worth visiting the National Art Gallery, which is already seventy years old, in the capital.  Inside you can find a wide variety of works of art.  For lovers of ancient times, it is recommended to visit the National History Museum, which for more than forty years has collected 650 thousand items.  On the Balkan Peninsula, this number is a record. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thecrazytourist.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bulgaria photo attractions" class="if uuid-2338609" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2338609.jpg"></div><p>  If you go to the city center, you can visit the park of Boris Gradin, which differs from the standard green spaces in megacities.  Here beautiful alleys alternate with overgrown trees, among which you can see various destroyed buildings.  The last point on the journey may be the library named after Cyril and Methodius.  The building looks great from the outside and stores a huge number of a wide variety of books inside. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  History in Nessebar </h2><p>  Sightseeing in Nessebar in Bulgaria should see any tourist who came to the country.  This city is one of the oldest in all of Europe.  UNESCO is protected by all facilities located on a small peninsula.  Most interestingly, the size of travelers has never been a hindrance.  The old city closely conveys the history of past eras, but because of the narrow streets you want to walk for hours.  Even after several times, you can notice for yourself new interesting details. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sitabg.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sofia bulgaria sights" class="if uuid-2338612" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2338612.jpg"></div><p>  Particular attention should be paid to churches and museums.  Temples are far from all functioning, many of them are destroyed, in others original expositions are presented.  The historical museum can tell a lot about the past life of the city, it perfectly complements the overall picture.  Old Nessebar attracts tourists, because you want to remember historical buildings on the background of a smooth surface forever. </p><h2>  Another beautiful city </h2><p>  In Bulgaria, the sights of Burgas are also popular among travelers.  Not in the territory of this large port city there are three cult churches that are worth a visit or just take a few photos near them.  A beautiful park with benches, places for recreation and picnics was created near the coastline.  Before bathing, it‚Äôs useful to just walk in the shade of the trees. </p><p>  Seaside Park is interesting not only for nature, but also for its large sand figures in the north.  This exhibition of ten figures, about three meters high each, was made to attract more interest in the city.  The park is a favorite place not only for tourists, but also for the townspeople themselves.  The seven-kilometer zone is well-groomed; flower beds, fountains, and various institutions are located on it.  It is just nice to walk here, and in summer you can get to a certain event, which is almost daily held in the warm season. </p><div class="photo" data-original="freeyork.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nessebar bulgaria sights" class="if uuid-2338615" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2338615.jpg"></div><h2>  Travel to Pomorie </h2><p>  In Burgas, you can walk for a long time, go to the local gallery, walk through museums and temples.  When you get bored, you can go to one of the most beautiful cities near the expanses of water called Pomerania.  There are not so many Bulgarian sights in this settlement as in Sofia, but several places deserve attention.  These include St. George's Monastery, the Salt Museum, and the local Lake Seaside. </p><p>  The Thracian tomb is a controversial place and may not appeal to all visitors, but lovers of historical buildings should still visit it for the sake of diversity.  The settlement is small, but the seascapes look unique.  For romantics, a real pleasure is just to sit on the beach and look into the distance.  Natural lovers should definitely look into this town, even if the rest is planned in another region.  Allocate a day to spend time in Primorye with its friendly residents and friendly atmosphere. </p><h2>  Variety Varna </h2><p>  The sights of Varna, the largest city on the coast, can be explored for long days.  Better to start with the main decoration in the form of the Cathedral of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which even before the capture of land by the Turks was a religious building.  Varna is now the religious center of the country.  The next item on the trip can be a royal mansion called "Evsinograd."  Members of the government dynasty rested here, which was reflected in the rich design. </p><div class="photo" data-original="freeyork.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of bulgaria photo and description" class="if uuid-2338618" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2338618.jpg"></div><p>  If you come to the city with children, then you should go to the local aquarium together.  An interestingly designed building cannot be confused with anything, but inside there are various expositions related to the Black Sea.  A good choice is to visit the dolphinarium, where performances will delight children and adults.  Another famous place in Varna is the local zoo, where animals from all parts of the world are present on a vast territory.  Such a family vacation will be remembered forever. </p><h2>  Nature in Varna </h2><p>  The sights of Bulgaria in Varna are not limited to places of family relaxation or places of worship.  It is in this city and around it that natural wonders are concentrated, which tourists should definitely appreciate.  Walking around the lake, which tightly adjoins the settlement, is best done at sunset in order to enjoy the scenery.  Right near Varna there is a large "stone forest", which is famous for Bulgaria.  Natural pillars of different sizes create a mysterious atmosphere. </p><p>  Not far from Varna, or rather on the Luda-Kamchia River, you can see a natural formation in the form of sharp rocks that resemble a pyramid.  This place is called Wonder rocks and is also worth seeing.  When resting in Varna, you should go to <span>the Aladzha monastery,</span> which is located fifteen kilometers from the city.  It was carved right in the rock in the fourth century AD.  This was done by hermit Christians, and the building was a haven for believers for fourteen centuries. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kiaratravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sunny beach bulgaria sights" class="if uuid-2338622" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2338622.jpg"></div><h2>  Region Sunny Beach </h2><p>  In Bulgaria, on the Sunny Beach, sightseeing by an ancient settlement of Nessebar does not end there.  No less emotions can give a trip to Sozopol - an ancient Greek colony, which changed with the advent of different eras.  The entire territory of the settlement is considered to be one large museum, where there are various buildings of the eighteenth century, some of them are younger, others are older.  For history buffs, the journey will be unforgettable. </p><p>  People who want to experience the beauty of nature need to take a stroll through the Ropotamo Nature Reserve.  Beautiful landscapes and representatives of the local fauna in natural conditions will be the ideal material for the photo.  In Sunny Beach it is easy to join modern entertainment.  Water parks, various resorts, baths, amusement parks and much more are created for the entertainment of tourists.  Every person can have fun and interesting time here. </p><h2>  Central city </h2><p>  Photos of the sights of Bulgaria in the city of Kazynlyk must definitely replenish the collection of any tourist.  Without them, the journey can be considered incomplete.  The first magical place is the Valley of Roses, where different types of these beautiful flowers grow on a large area.  It is recommended to come here from May to mid-summer, when the flowering season is in progress.  Admiring beautiful landscapes, as well as buying branded cosmetics called ‚ÄúBulgarian Rose‚Äù for women will be a special pleasure. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travel.spisanie.to" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Burgas bulgaria sights" class="if uuid-2338625" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2338625.jpg"></div><p>  On the territory of the city there is also a mysterious structure called the Thracian tomb.  The building has been splendidly preserved since antiquity, even without restoration.  Most interestingly, he was robbed a huge number of times, but his appearance was not affected.  In the Valley of Roses, a harvest festival is often held.  If you get to this action, you can get a lot of positive emotions from observing the performance. </p><h2>  Bright places in the regions </h2><p>  Photos describing the sights of Bulgaria will not convey the full depth and beauty of the best places in the country.  For example, in the Burgas region there are many lakes, among which the eponymous with this part of the country is the largest.  All of them arose naturally in the face of certain circumstances.  A wonderful experience will be a trip to the island of St. Anastasia, which is the only inhabited territory in the Black Sea from the Bulgarian side.  Its area is only a hectare, the coast is rocky, and its height above water level is twelve meters.  People live and engage in fishing here. </p><p>  It is also worth noting on the territory of the power of the Rylsky Monastery, which is located in the mountains of the same name.  This is one of the main temples in Bulgaria, which is able to surprise the architecture of even an experienced tourist.  Fans of historical places need to visit Shipka Pass, where the main battle took place in one of the Russian-Turkish wars. </p>
