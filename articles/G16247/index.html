    <p>  This is a city that combines unconnected things.  And the sights of Odessa can easily compete with interesting places in Athens or Rome itself.  There is everything to spend an unforgettable summer vacation: the sea, the sun, beaches, wonderful excursions and fashionable hotels.  Odessa-mother is always glad to welcome her guests and give them a wonderful trip through their architectural and cultural monuments. </p><h2>  A brief history of the city </h2><p>  In the 13th century, just when the Golden Horde ruled, the settlement of Ginestra existed on the territory of modern Odessa.  At the end of the XIV century and the beginning of the next century, it was part of the <span>Grand Duchy of Lithuania.</span>  Then she was called Kachibey, Kotsyubeyev or Hajibey. </p><p>  Since 1475, Kachibey passes under the control of the Ottoman Empire and receives the name Adzhibey or Hadzhibey.  In 1764, the Yeni-Dunya fortress was built here.  But in mid-September 1789 (during this period the second Russo-Turkish war took place), it was captured by a company of major general of the Russian army Joseph de Ribas. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In May 1794, Catherine the Second issued a decree according to which a military harbor was built on the site of Hadzhibey.  Joseph de Ribas and Franz de Vollan began to draw up a plan for the creation of the city.  The first bricks of Odessa were laid on September 2 of the same year.  And the name of the city comes from the Greek village of Odyssos or Odessos. </p><p>  The main attractions of Odessa were created during the time of the most prominent city governors, who did a lot for the prosperity of the village.  Their names are Admiral de Ribas, Count Langeron and Vorontsov, Duke of Duc de Richelieu. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Description of Odessa Attractions" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/595414.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <h2>  What to see in Odessa </h2><p>  There are so many different prominent places in this coastal city that you will not immediately find out that here you can and should see.  Therefore, we have compiled a list of those monuments and institutions that should definitely be visited: </p><ul><li>  Passage; </li><li>  The Potemkin Stairs; </li><li>  Richelieu monument; </li><li>  Bringing; </li><li>  Seaside Boulevard; </li><li>  Deribasovskaya street. </li></ul><p>  These sights of Odessa (the list of which can be continued and continued) are known to many of this or that film, stories of acquaintances, newspaper jokes.  All of them have become symbols of the city, its hallmark, a highlight. </p><h2>  Up and down the steps of the Potemkin Stairs </h2><p>  Arriving in Odessa, tourists immediately go on an excursion to the Potemkin stairs.  Many of them know this city precisely thanks to the aforementioned object.  Meanwhile, the description of the sights of Odessa could be started from another place.  But if the public demands, then we are not entitled to refuse. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  So, the film ‚ÄúBattleship Potemkin‚Äù directed by <span>S. Eisenstein</span> brought world fame to the Potemkin Stairs <span>.</span>  The object was built from 1837 to 1841. The author of the project was the architect F.K. Boffo, and the famous <span>Count Vorontsov</span> initiated the creation of such an amazing architectural miracle <span>.</span>  A green-gray sandstone for the construction of steps was brought from Trieste.  In 1933, the attraction was reconstructed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of Odessa" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/595415.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  At the very beginning, there were 200 steps on the stairs.  But, when in 1866 the construction of Seaside Street began, eight steps had to be dismantled.  Therefore, today the <span>Potemkin Stairs</span> has 192 steps.  The length of the structure reaches 142 meters, and it rises to a 30-meter height.  But to overcome this path is not difficult at all, since every two dozen steps are replaced by a platform. </p><h2>  Passage </h2><p>  Anyone who saw the film "Seaside Boulevard", almost took a tour of this amazing place.  Indeed, in this movie one could consider many of the sights of the city of Odessa.  One of them is the Passage.  This is a building of a luxury hotel, which is one of the most beautiful buildings in the city.  The Passage is striking in its sophistication of sculptural compositions and architecture itself.  Inside the hotel there is a real street with rows of elite class shops.  The light inside the building is provided by a high glass roof.  It also creates a feeling of immense space.  The house was opened in 1899 and since that time has been used exclusively as a shopping center. </p><p>  The man who first crosses the threshold of the entrance and falls under the glazed vault, publishes an involuntary delight "Ah!"  And this is not surprising, because Passage is an unsurpassed masterpiece of typical Odessa architecture. </p><h2>  All to the market! </h2>

    <p>  It would be a real crime to describe the popular sights of Odessa and not to mention the world famous Privoz market.  After all, it is a center of commerce known to the whole planet.  More than one hundred thousand people come here every year.  Rumor has it that there is nothing here that could not be bought.  Here you can buy even more.  ‚ÄúPrivoz‚Äù works every day, with the exception of Monday only.  Here you can meet with colorful local beggars.  They appeal to visitors only as a "gentleman" and will always please you with Odessa jokes. </p><p>  In 1827, an unusually large market was built on Privoznaya Square.  From this moment begins the story of ‚ÄúPrivoz‚Äù.  Immediately, it became the most important <span>Odessa market.</span>  And the architectural complex complements the ‚ÄúFruit Passage‚Äù - four buildings with two floors each. </p><h2>  The famous monument to Duke </h2><p>  Sights of Odessa are not only markets and steps, but also monuments to people who have done a lot for the development of the city.  This monument was awarded Duc de Richelieu.  The sculpture was installed in 1828, and I.P. Martos became its author.  This was the first monument that was installed in Odessa. </p>

    <p>  The statue is cast in bronze and installed in honor of the French aristocrat, who in 1804-1815 was the governor general of the city.  Richelieu depicted in the toga of the Romans, he holds a scroll in his hand.  And three high reliefs made of brass embody trade, justice and agriculture.  Arman-Emmanuel de Richelieu did an incredible amount for the construction of the city, he turned it into a large trading port.  With this act, he earned love and recognition among the local population. </p><h2>  To all the boulevards </h2><p>  "Seaside Boulevard" is not only the name of a famous musical film, but also a street in Odessa, so popular that it is impossible to forget it.  Many sights of Odessa (interesting places and monuments) are located on this cheerful boulevard.  Reviews of tourists about Primorsky are always filled with emotions, positive impressions and bright mood.  The building of the old exchange was the beginning of Primorsky Boulevard.  She, by the way, also bears the title of one of the most outstanding city attractions.  And the end of the street is marked by the same unsurpassed architectural ensemble of the <span>Vorontsov Palace.</span> </p>

    <p>  The development of the boulevard began in the first years of the century before last.  Until the end of this century, it was called Nikolaev.  It was a favorite place for walks of Lesya Ukrainka, Aivazovsky, Gogol, Belinsky and Pushkin.  The Primorsky Boulevard combines the most striking sights of Odessa. </p><h2>  The weather is good at Deribasovskaya </h2><p>  Another local symbol and landmark is Deribasovskaya Street, also known for its popular Soviet comedy film.  The street was named after the outstanding architect of the city I.M. De Ribas.  Deribasovskaya is the main pedestrian street in Odessa.  Here tourists can admire unsurpassed architecture, visit numerous shops and cafeterias.  Deribasovskaya (as well as Primorsky Boulevard) is loved by local residents. </p>
