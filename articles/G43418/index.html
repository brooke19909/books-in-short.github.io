Planets Kepler-186 f, Gloria, Nibiru</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There are scientists who still do not give up hope of finding at least some confirmation that <span>intelligent creatures</span> live on Mars <span>.</span>  However, space exploration is not limited to this issue.  People are trying to penetrate deep into the Universe, and in its study they are constantly moving forward.  As a result of a long search, scientists discovered planets whose structure is very similar to Earth.  These <span>celestial bodies</span> rotate at an acceptable distance from their stars, which allows us to express an opinion on the available water reserves on them.  Consequently, the theory of the existence of life on such planets may also have a right to exist. </p><h2>  The double hiding behind the sun? </h2><p>  More recently, the Russian astronomer and physicist Kirill Butusov put forward a sensational hypothesis.  He suggested that there is a twin planet of the Earth on the other side of the Sun.  The scientist called this celestial body Gloria.  In his opinion, it has the same size and circulation period as the Earth.  Why is Gloria invisible to us?  The fact is that the Sun hides it, projecting onto the opposite side of the earth‚Äôs orbit from us.  Because of the heavenly luminary, we are not able to see significant areas corresponding to 600 diameters of our planet.  At such a distance, the twin planet of the Earth may well be. </p>

The double is a kind of patron.  It is spiritual in nature, but is invisible to human eyes. </p><p>  The ancient Egyptians were convinced that after the death of a person, his soul and twin are separated from him.  In this case, the double can rise again.  To do this, he needs support in the form of a body or his image in the form of a statue, a bas-relief or painting. </p><p>  This is precisely how the theory of immortality originated, which resulted in the erection of a huge number of tombs.  The Egyptians believed that one who outlived himself in his double has the right to continue earthly life even in the next world. </p><p>  A little later, the same view of the world was expressed by the Neo-Pythagorean Filolaus.  This sage said that the center of the universe does not exist on Earth, but in the so-called Hestna, which is a central fire.  Filolaus was the founder of the theory of cosmogony.  According to the ideas of this science, all planets revolve around a central fire.  They include even the Sun, which does not shine, but plays the role of a mirror, reflecting the brilliance of Hestna.  At the same time, Filolaus claimed that there is a twin planet of the Earth.  This celestial body moves in the same orbit, but it is located behind Hesna.  Philolaus called this planet the Anti-Earth.  Apparently, according to his ideas, the world of human doubles existed there. </p><h2>  Opinion of modern astronomy </h2><p>  The fact that there is a twin planet of the Earth, modern scientists can neither prove nor disprove.  Do not give an answer to the question and modern space stations.  After all, their field of view is very small, and besides, these devices are installed to observe specific celestial bodies. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

Their viewing angle did not give the opportunity to "look" behind the Sun.  In order to prove that behind our luminary there is a twin of the planet Earth, it was necessary to fly much further, covering a distance of 10-15 times more.

    <p>  Modern astronomy speaks of the fact that accumulations of a certain substance are possible in the orbit of our planet.  Moreover, their presence is very likely at certain points called vibrational (one of them is located behind the Sun).  But, according to scientists, the position of bodies in these places is extremely unstable. </p><h2>  Existing analogues </h2><p>  In order to understand whether there is a twin of planet Earth, it is necessary to recall the system of Saturn.  She is like the sun.  And while we observe two satellites in orbit, which corresponds to the earth.  These are Janus and Epimetheus.  Once every four years, these celestial bodies come closer to each other and "change" in their orbits.  Such "games" are due to the gravitational interaction of the planets.  So, first Epimetheus moves with greater speed in the inner orbit.  Janus is somewhat behind him.  This planet is moving in an outer orbit.  Further Epimetheus ‚Äúcatches up‚Äù Janus, but the collision does not occur.  Planets change orbits and move away from each other. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Evidence for Butusov's Theory </h2><p>  There are some considerations leading to the conclusion that there is still such a planet Gloria - the twin of the Earth.  The first of these concerns discussions about the orbit of our planet.  According to some of its characteristics, it has features.  And the reason for this may be a body hidden from our eyes, which increases the total orbital mass by about two times. </p>

In the 17th century, an unknown object was discovered by director of the Paris Observatory D. Cassini near Venus.  This celestial body had a crescent shape, that is, it was not a star.  Also at that moment Venus herself looked.  That is why Cassini suggested that he discovered a satellite of this planet.  Short observed the same object in 1740, and Mayer later 19 years later.  Montaigne saw him in 1761 and Rothkier in 1764. No one else saw this celestial body.  It disappeared somewhere.  This fact indicates that the planets located behind the Sun can be observed very rarely, and only in those cases when they leave the sun.

    <h2>  Life on Gloria </h2><p>  If we assume that the twin planet of the Earth really exists, then for mankind this fact would be very interesting.  The fact is that this celestial body is at the same distance from the Sun, that is, it receives the same amount of energy from it.  This gives reason to say that civilization is possible on Gloria.  You can go further in your reasoning.  In Gloria, the deployment of a basic civilization is quite realistic.  The earth at the same time is a kind of "settlement".  In support of this fact, one can cite numerous examples when UFOs show an increased interest in the events that occur on our planet.  For example, <span>flying saucers were</span> seen above the sites of nuclear explosions in Hiroshima, Chernobyl and Fukushima just an hour after the tragedy. </p><p>  What is the reason for such close attention?  In danger to Gloria.  After all, our two planets are located in the same orbit at unstable dibration points.  Nuclear explosions that cause powerful shocks can move the Earth and throw it towards Gloria.  And this threatens a terrible catastrophe for two planets simultaneously. </p><p>  If we assume that the civilization of Gloria is ahead of the earth in its development, then, of course, it will take all possible measures for its own security.  At the moment, one cannot talk about significant interventions in the affairs of mankind.  But this does not mean that such neutrality will last forever. </p><h2>  NASA Research </h2><p>  In 2009, the U.S. Office for <span>Space Research</span> launched an astronomical satellite called Kepler.  By the beginning of 2015, he had found more than four thousand planets, the existence of almost a quarter of which was officially confirmed.  Experts conducting research have officially announced the discovery of eight space rocky eco-planets.  According to scientists, foundlings are nothing but twins of the Earth. </p>

And there is a possibility that subsequently the list of Earth's doubles will increase.  However, a detailed study of such objects is a very difficult task.  The reason for this lies in the removal of the planets.  The fact is that their distance from the Earth is several hundred light years.  But the desire of mankind to find inhabited planets does not fade away.  In 2017, it is planned to launch a new satellite, which will explore the surface and study the trajectories of the ‚Äútwins‚Äù.

    <h2>  Amazing discovery </h2><p>  Most recently, scientists announced that they had found the twin planet of the Earth.  And the Kepler space satellite helped them in this.  This celestial body is slightly larger than our planet and colder.  According to these characteristics, he can be called a cousin of our Earth.  However, today the planet Kepler-186 f is the twin of the Earth, already discovered by astronomers.  The diameter of this celestial body is 14,000 kilometers.  This is slightly larger (10%) than Earth.  The orbit of a new planet is in the "Goldilocks zone" (as the star Kepler is called) </p><p>  Scientists believe that the planet Kepler-186 f is the twin of the Earth, due to the temperature conditions existing on it.  The fact that it is not too hot and not very cold allows the presence of water on the surface.  This conclusion suggests the existence of life on the planet. </p><p>  The reason to assume that the planet Kepler is the twin of the Earth also gives the distance at which it is from its star.  It is similar to the distance from our planet to the sun.  Researchers also believe that the Kepler-186 f consists of water, rocks and iron.  That is, from the same materials as the Earth.  Kepler‚Äôs gravity is also similar to ours. </p><p>  However, this twin planet of the Earth (see photo below) is not an absolute copy of our planet.  The sun around which Kepler revolves can be called a red dwarf, since it is much colder than ours.  In addition, the year on this planet lasts only 130 days.  Due to the location of Kepler-186f on the outskirts of the "Goldilocks zone", its surface is likely to cover a layer of permafrost. </p>

This, most likely, led to the creation of more dense layers of the atmosphere than on Earth.  This structure of the air masses should compensate for the lack of heat.  In addition, red dwarfs emit light, mainly in the infrared, which contributes to the melting of ice.

In earlier times, astronomers took Venus for two separate cosmic bodies.  At the same time, they gave them the name Heperus and Phosphorus. </p>

However, modern scientists believe that its surface is very dry and hot, and this does not allow water to be here in liquid form.  In addition, dense clouds of sulfuric acid constantly close Venus.  They do not allow the rays of the Sun to break through to the surface of the planet.

    <h2>  Nibiru </h2><p>  Back in 1982, NASA announced the likelihood of another planet in our solar system.  This message was confirmed a year later, when a launched infrared artificial satellite managed to detect a very large celestial body.  This was the twin planet of the Earth - Nibiru.  This space object has many different names.  This is the 12th Planet, and Planet X, as well as the Horned and Winged Disc. </p><p>  This celestial body is very large <span>.</span>  <span>The diameter of</span> Nibiru is five times greater than the earth's <span>diameter</span> .  Planet X revolves around a star called astronomers the Dark Dwarf, moving simultaneously with the Sun and at a certain distance from it.  At the same time, Nibiru periodically makes jerks either to one luminary or to another, being a definite connecting link between two different worlds. </p><p>  This huge celestial body is followed by its moons, as well as a tail of a huge mass of fragments.  This is a kind of planetary debris that destroys everything that meets in its path. </p><p>  Nibiru moves against the motion of all the planets of the solar system.  Astronomers call this a retrograde orbit.  When such an object appears in the solar system near the Earth, problems on our planet cannot be avoided.  Most likely, such a rapprochement has already occurred more than once.  This can explain the ice age and the death of dinosaurs, biblical stories and traces of intelligent life at the bottom of the seas. </p><p>  Ancient people knew about this planet.  They believed that the gods named Anunaki live on Nibiru.  They were described as humanoids, similar to people with a height of three meters.  It was believed that the Anunaki built pyramids using people as slaves.  According to legend, these Gods needed earthly gold, the dust of which was used in order to retain heat in the atmosphere of Nibiru.  It is believed that the pyramids themselves were used by humanoids for interplanetary communication.  Confirmation of this hypothesis is the absence in some of these structures of tombs, that is, rooms for which, as it was believed, all this was built. </p>
