PS3 prefix - price</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  After the success of Sony PlayStation and PlayStation 2 game consoles, released in 1994 and 2000, respectively, the appearance of a new model seemed only a matter of time.  The first rumors about a new game console appeared in 2004, but until the spring of 2005, there was no information from the Japanese manufacturer. </p><p>  A game console called PS3 was officially unveiled in May 2005 at the Electronic Entertainment Expo.  A year later, the Sony company told about how much the PS3 costs, and about the start date for the sale of the console.  For the first time for testing, a product from a Japanese manufacturer was presented at TGS 2006, where visitors had the opportunity to evaluate several games on the new console. </p><h2>  Description of the prefix from Sony </h2><p>  It is worth saying that the PS3 looks gorgeous: exquisite design, comfortable joystick, excellent features - what else is needed for an interesting pastime for your favorite video games? </p>

As a graphics adapter in the Japanese-made game console, RSX comes from the G70 architecture, which was developed by NVidia specifically for the GeForce 7 line of video cards. This video chip operates at a frequency of 550 MHz, while it has 256 MB of memory .  This allows him to display 2 high-quality HDTV streams simultaneously.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Dimensions of the game console from the Sony company are quite large - 3.25 by 2.74 by 0.98 centimeters with a device weight of 5 kilograms.  As you can see, the third part of the most popular console turned out to be much more than its predecessor in the person of PlayStation 2. <span>The noise level</span> in the PS3 is approximately the same as the previous model of the Sony game console.  The desire of the creators to reduce it led to the fact that the device is quite hot, although this, it would seem, is not dangerous and can not lead to anything bad.  However, it is better not to put the prefix in closed small niches, since it can overheat. </p><h2>  PS3 Benefits </h2><p>  Before you know how much the PS3 Slim costs, it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with its merits.  Of course, like any other product, this Japanese-made gaming console has its own advantages and disadvantages.  Let's start with her strengths.  Firstly, these are the huge multimedia capabilities of the set-top box, thanks to which the Sony product can be considered the cheapest Blu-ray disc player to date.  Secondly, the game console has quite a lot of potential, which allows developers to create more demanding video game systems for the parameters of the system. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How much is the PS3 Slim" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18703/401947.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Disadvantages of the game console </h2><p>  Before you know how much the PS3 costs, you should also mention that this console has its drawbacks.  Among them, it is worth highlighting a rather high cost, which will be described in more detail below, as well as a relatively small selection of accessories.  Also, numerous consumers of this set-top box can upset its pretty impressive size. </p><h2>  How much does a PS3 cost in Russia and the CIS countries? </h2><p>  Now it's time to talk about the cost of this game console.  The question of how much the PS3 costs is of interest to many video game lovers.  As mentioned above, the price of the console from Sony is quite high and starts in <span>the CIS countries</span> starting from the mark of 600 US dollars - quite a lot compared to the same Xbox360 or Wii from Nintendo. </p>

    <p>  Summing up, I would like to add that it is the prefix from the Sony company that will be an excellent option for those who purchase a game console for long-term use.  The same Xbox360 already uses its maximum capabilities, and Nintendo‚Äôs Wii is difficult to consider as the main set-top box. </p>
