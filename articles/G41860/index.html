  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Forms of ownership in the Russian Federation and their main characteristics. The concept of ownership, general provisions,</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Property refers to all those things and property, in addition, the property rights of the subject of law, which are protected by legal norms against unlawful encroachments.  Speaking about such a concept as the form of ownership in the Russian Federation, it is necessary to understand what constitutes a type of the term in question. </p><p>  The main forms of ownership are shown to be a certain stage in the improvement of this legal institution.  The form of ownership can be called the ownership of resources and products of production <span>to legal entities.</span>  The interpenetration of forms and types of ownership is not in doubt.  They are determined by certain historical conditions and receive their development within a particular state formation.  As regards such a process as the concept and forms of ownership in the Russian Federation, a couple of types of property can be seen at present.  This is a general and private <span>type of property.</span>  The history of the origin of private property is quite commonplace.  It came from private production, for example, from trade and craft.  The presence of private property in a subject of law implies that individuals believe that the <span>means of production</span> and products of production relate to their personal acquisitions.  Private property in the modern economic turnover is the foundation of the state and economic system of the country.  Owners of private property independently make volitional decisions of an economic nature.  Forms of ownership in the Russian Federation of the type in question suggest the presence of entities to which it belongs.  These include both citizens and organizations.  The presence of <span>private property rights</span> among the figures leads to the fact that economic activities in the country are conducted responsibly and efficiently. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In economic theory, many experts are called upon to divide property into collective and private.  Thus, forms of ownership in the Russian Federation increased by these two subcategories.  Individual ownership should include the case where the owner‚Äôs competence belongs to a specific person.  The subjects of this concept are both citizens and legal entities who can act as owners of securities, household items, cars, real estate, etc.  As for organizations and companies that operate on the basis of individual property, the greatest benefits come from the provision of various kinds of services.  As a general rule, such organizations are very easy to establish and their owners have a certain freedom in their actions.  Collective property, as the concept of ownership in the Russian Federation, belongs to certain individuals.  Subspecies of collective property are cooperative, joint-stock and partner property.  The property of cooperative purposes may include the property of persons who combined their actions in order to jointly conduct their activities.  The legal fact of the occurrence of this type of property is the result of the shares of individuals and members of the cooperative, as well as from the profits received from the sale of products.  In addition, partnership property, as a concept and form of ownership, takes place when the property refers to two or more persons.  It is formed as a result of voluntary contributions in monetary or other terms of the partnership participants.  The property of shareholders is formed as a result of the issue and sale of securities in the <span>form of shares.</span>  Accordingly, shareholders in joint stock companies act as shareholders. </p><p>  As for <span>state property,</span> it belongs to the state and has two forms.  The property number one can be attributed to the property of the federation, to the second - property of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation. </p>
