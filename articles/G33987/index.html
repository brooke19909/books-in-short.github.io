    <p>  One of the main factors is the proximity to the sea and infrastructure, markets and attractions.  They recommend paying attention to the Issara Resort 3 * hotel, which harmoniously combines a convenient location, quality of service and price. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The hotel is located in the southern part of Patong City.

    <p>  The interior is made in a simple style, on the floor ceramic tiles, wooden furniture.  Rooms are regularly cleaned and linen changed.  The windows of the accommodation offer a picturesque view of the mountains or the bustling street, but the noise of the guests will not bother. </p><h2>  Meals: bars and restaurants </h2><p>  Resort Hotel Issara Resort 3 * (Thailand, Phuket, Patong) has three stars, and catering to its guests offers only BB (breakfast).  A table is served at a nearby restaurant, and alcoholic and cold drinks are available at the bar throughout the day.  This does not upset the hotel guests at all, because Thailand is a country where you need to travel and try something new and unusual, including amazing food that excites the taste of inexperienced travelers, and makes experienced travelers return to these places again and again.  At night, Patong streets are filled with makeshift markets, not only with souvenirs and things, but also with food prepared in front of you with fresh seafood. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel Issara Resort 3 * <span>(Phuket):</span> location <span>reviews</span> </h2><p>  As tourists who visited this hotel noted in their reviews, one of its main advantages is its location.  If you are a supporter of beach holidays and can not live without the sea, then it is only a 10-15 minute walk.  For those who prefer a pool, there is a nice <span>roof terrace</span> and hot sun for even tanning.  Fans of entertainment will have a place to take a walk, nearby there is everything: restaurants, night clubs and bars, discos.  With the onset of dusk, numerous souvenir shops, mobile markets open, food carts and much more appear on the streets. </p><p>  Of the minuses - the complete absence of its own territory at the hotel: only rooms and space on the roof.  Many are upset by the view from the window - another hotel is literally 2-3 meters away.  On the network you can sometimes find information about Issara Resort 4 * (Issara Resort 4 *), the description of which fully corresponds to the hotel, which is discussed in this article.  Do not let yourself be fooled, the hotel is actually a three star hotel. </p><h2>  Service and room reviews </h2><p>  Most of the tourists in the reviews note that check-in at the hotel is quick and easy.  The staff is very polite and friendly, which in principle can be said about the whole "country of smiles."  And even if you arrived in the early morning, and according to the rules, check-in is only from 2 in the afternoon, then you will be ready to make concessions. </p>

    <p>  The rooms, according to the guests, are clean, but need redecorating.  Sound insulation is not too good, so you can hear how the air conditioning works outside the window.  The most demanding of tourists note that it would be more correct to say Issara Resort 2 *, not 3 *.  In many ways, not the best reviews are associated with breakfasts, which in reality turned out to be very modest, by choice of dishes not rich, but of decent quality, with local fruits.  However, this did not upset many, because there are a huge number of places nearby where you can always eat deliciously for little money. </p><h2>  Reviews about the beach and the sea </h2><p>  It is worth noting one interesting fact: by a royal decision in Thailand, hotels are forbidden to own their own, private beaches.  Therefore, there are only public places of rest!  Patong is always crowded and noisy compared to secluded Kata Beach and Karon Beach.  However, the sea and sand are no worse.  Tourists note that due to the abundance of water transport and entertainment, the water is often muddy, but you can see the fish.  Strong ebbs in the morning.  In the afternoon heat, even umbrellas will not help to hide from the scorching sun, so try to choose the time to visit the beach in the morning or in the late afternoon.  Of the minuses in their reviews, visitors note some pollution of the water and the territory itself. </p><p>  In general, the Issara Resort 3 * Hotel Tophotels (a popular site about tourism) rates its visitors on a solid four on a five-point scale.  The quality of the services provided and the price are quite consistent with each other and what tour operators say about him.  The hotel is not new, but solid, clean, and most importantly - it has an excellent location. </p><p>  Travelers who have already visited Patong advise young people to stay at this hotel, because rest here is more for entertainment than relaxation and restoration of strength, as well as couples, but without children, since there are practically no amenities and entertainments for small guests . </p>
