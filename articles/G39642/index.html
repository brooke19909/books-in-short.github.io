  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The most extraordinary sights of Russia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  At all times, Russia has attracted tourists who want an unusual, memorable vacation and adventure.  For them, there is every opportunity to get a new, unforgettable experience.  Among the places that tourists love, there are places that can be called extraordinary.  Among them stands the Mutnovsky volcano.  It consists of four successively merged volcanoes.  Their cones are a single array.  Here, during the observation, 20 earthquakes occurred, the last of which was in 2000.  Currently, a lake has formed at the eruption site, almost always covered with ice, even in the summer. <noindex>  <span>Mini-Hotel Mumiy Troll</span> </noindex>  - A great place with excellent recommendations, here you will find everything you need, and well-trained staff will provide service at an excellent level. </p><p>  Another unusual attraction of Russia can be called the valley of geysers in Kamchatka.  It is located in a wide gorge located in the Kronotsky Reserve, along which the Geysernaya River flows.  Throughout this gorge, you can see hot lakes, mud cauldrons, small volcanoes, steam jets and geysers themselves. <br>  The next unusual attraction is the caldera (Spanish boiler) of Uzon volcano.  A caldera was formed about forty thousand years ago on the site of the then active volcano.  It is located on the territory of the Kronotsky Nature Reserve and has a diameter of about 10 km.  In this caldera you can see lakes in which there are a lot of fish, cold rivers and hot springs, animals and birds, forests and swampy areas.  An excellent place for your overnight stay and pleasant relaxation after exploring the surrounding sights and restaurants of national cuisine - <noindex>  <span>Ester Hostel</span> </noindex>  .  Here, traveling a large male or girl company, you will be well placed in one room and spend a pleasant evening chatting.  Saving on living without loss in quality of rest! <br>  Oceanarium in St. Petersburg.  It can be said, is the pearl of the entertainment complex "planet Neptune."  The exposition of the aquarium is very interesting and fascinating.  It is divided into several sections in which visitors can see both ordinary and exotic inhabitants living in rivers and seas, as well as in the oceans.  There are three dozen aquariums on the territory where, in addition to small fish, you can see sharks, stingrays, starfish and other inhabitants of the seas and oceans. </p></div></article>
