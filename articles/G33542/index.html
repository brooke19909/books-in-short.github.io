Nevertheless, now not only a wealthy family able to purchase a projector and pay for its correct installation, but also people with average income can afford such a device.  They just prefer to do most of the work on their own.  In order to save.  And this implies following certain rules for installing the projector. </p><p>  In this article, we will describe step by step what and how to do it so that the product performs its functions efficiently. </p><h2>  Projection distance </h2><p>  This is the first thing to determine in order to find out where the projector can be placed.  I must say that it is always better to lay the potential location of the device at the stage of repair in the apartment.  This approach will allow you to correctly position the furniture and immediately provide for the appropriate mounting point on the ceiling (since it is the most convenient place to put the projector there). </p><p>  But back to the projection distance.  If you do not go into details, then this is the distance at which the device should be from the screen.  The basis of the calculation will be the projection ratio and the selected screen size (usually it is 2.54 meters).  They need to be multiplied by each other.  For example, the projection ratio is 1.4.  A screen with a size of 254 centimeters was selected (calculations are more convenient to make in centimeters).  We get 254 * 1.4 = 355.6 centimeters.  That is, the projector should be installed at a distance of about 3.5 meters from the potential placement of the screen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Vertical displacement </h2><p>  The second step is to determine the vertical displacement.  This is, roughly speaking, the angle of the projection of the image.  This indicator is indicated in the instructions and can have both positive and negative values ‚Äã‚Äã(it is recommended to take projectors with a positive bias, since they are turned upside down anyway and what was on top will become bottom).  In most modern models, this indicator can vary.  For example, you can correct the position of the bracket device itself, but we are more interested in the function of adjusting the angle of vertical mixing without moving the projector.  This also occurs and allows you to tilt the image as it is required.  In any case, you need to pay attention to this parameter when choosing a product. </p>

    <h2>  Projector Mount Height </h2><p>  To install the projector in an apartment on the ceiling, this is perhaps the most important step.  First we need the height of the screen.  The easiest way is to simply measure it, but you can use the services of online calculators or remember the school course in mathematics.  For example, take the same screen with a diagonal of 254 centimeters.  Its height will be 124.5 centimeters.  From it we will calculate the optimal position of the projector.  To do this, multiply 124.5 by a degree of vertical displacement.  As an example, imagine that it is 96.3%.  It turns out 124.5 * 96.3% = 119.9 centimeters.  That is, the projector can be placed within any point that is located above 119.9 centimeters from the center of the screen. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Bracket selection </h2><p>  The next important step is the selection of the bracket.  There are a huge number of varieties.  In order not to worry about compatibility, it is recommended to focus only on the same models as the projector itself.  Particular attention should be paid to which ceiling this or that mount is designed for.  If there is still no clear understanding of what it will ultimately be, then the bracket will set this indicator.  And if the apartment is already in a ready state, then the projector should be installed on a mount that is strictly suitable for the existing ceiling. </p><p>  It is not recommended to take cheap samples.  They can get loose and, at best, just knock down the image settings.  At worst, the projector will crash to the floor with all the ensuing consequences.  It will break, simply put. </p>

    <h2>  Installation on a standard concrete ceiling </h2><p>  This is the easiest way to install the projector. </p><ol><li>  We select the right place. </li><li>  We try on the bracket and mark <span>the attachment points.</span> </li><li>  We drill holes in the ceiling (do not get carried away, otherwise the neighbors from above will not be happy). </li><li>  We fix the bracket.  This stage entirely depends on the model of the product and those fixtures that come with the kit. </li><li>  Install the projector. </li><li>  We connect all the required cables / wires. </li><li>  Customize and enjoy. </li></ol><p>  The main disadvantage of such ceilings is the hanging wires from the projector.  There is simply nowhere to put them.  If the installation is done at the repair stage, you can knock out special grooves where the wires will be laid.  Subsequently, they can be easily coated with plaster or any other suitable method.  If the repair has already been done, then the only option is to fix special plastic boxes to the ceiling, into which the wires are laid.  It is inexpensive and not difficult, but the appearance of the room still spoils. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Drywall ceiling installation </h2><p>  Installing the projector on a drywall ceiling is associated with more problems than usual.  To begin with, the maximum weight (even if special mounts are used) of the projector can be no more than 5 kilograms.  But usually they are still heavier.  As a result, you will either have to fix the device on a metal frame (you can find it using an ordinary magnet) or cut a piece of the ceiling, mount the projector directly on concrete and then think for a long time about how to fix the hole (you can just cover it with gypsum or install a plastic plug )  There is also nowhere to hide the wires, so you will have to deal with them in the same way as in the case of installing the projector on a concrete ceiling. </p><h2>  Installation on a modular ceiling </h2><p>  This is perhaps the most successful and convenient option. </p><ol><li>  We remove part of the <span>ceiling</span> in the place where you want to install the bracket. </li><li>  We measure the fixation points and drill, as in the case of a concrete ceiling. </li><li>  We fix the bracket using the accessories supplied with it. </li><li>  We install a projector on it and connect the wires. </li><li>  We display all the cables through the ceiling, since the modular (it‚Äôs also suspended) version allows it. </li><li>  We cut a hole in the previously removed ceiling plate strictly according to the size of the bracket rod. </li><li>  Set it in place. </li></ol><p>  The only feature here is the location of the outlets.  Usually they are not made on the ceiling and the cable will still have to be removed somewhere, but they won‚Äôt lead wires at least directly from the projector.  And if you try and still make a socket right in the ceiling, then the appearance will not spoil anything at all. </p>

    <h2>  Suspended ceiling installation </h2><p>  Unfortunately for all users, it is simply impossible to work with a non-specialist with suspended ceilings without the appropriate tools and skills.  With any attempt, it is possible to spoil the ceiling as soon as possible (and it‚Äôs not cheap) than to attach something somewhere.  The cost of installing the projector on such surfaces can vary within very wide limits, however, it should be remembered that you will have to pay a lot more for a new ceiling. </p><p>  The basic principle here is about the same as in all previous cases, but it is advisable to first mount the bracket, wires and projector, and only then stretch the ceiling.  If you already have it and you don‚Äôt want to change anything (and it‚Äôs expensive, frankly), you should think about fixing it to the wall.  This is not so convenient, but still real.  Of the main differences, we can only note that instead of vertical displacement, you should pay attention to horizontal (it is also in the instructions).  Otherwise, the differences are insignificant. </p>

    <h2>  Setting the screen for the projector </h2><p>  In this case, a lot depends on the selected screen, its size, location and so on.  It is most convenient to use minimized versions.  They are a kind of blinds and they need to be opened only when the need arises.  They are mounted on the wall or on the ceiling according to the standard scheme: </p><ol><li>  Identify attachment points. </li><li>  Make holes with a drill. </li><li>  Using standard self-tapping screws / dowels / any other mounting options, fix the base of the screen. </li><li>  If necessary, provide additional clips. </li></ol><p>  It is recommended to search for detailed instructions for each individual type of screen with it, but the general principle of operation is almost always identical to each other.  In general, hanging the screen is much easier than a projector, if only because it does not require wires.  An exception are situations when it has to be mounted on the ceiling. </p><p>  Here everything will be absolutely identical, as with the projector itself, with all the ensuing features.  A small nuance: it is sometimes easier to first install a projector, and only then calculate where to hang the screen, and not vice versa (especially when the room is small and there is no place to roam).  Nevertheless, it‚Äôs more correct to do everything according to this instruction, presuming in advance the placement of all the components of the future home theater. </p><h2>  Projector Setup </h2><p>  Finally completed the installation.  Projector setup is the next and final step.  As in many other cases, almost everything depends directly on the product model itself. </p><ol><li>  Turn on the projector, making room lighting minimal.  If it‚Äôs a day outside, close the curtains tightly.  If it‚Äôs evening, turn off the light.  Immediately after switching on, expect miracles and hope that ‚Äúit will do,‚Äù is not worth it.  Practice shows that you usually have to tinker. </li><li>  Align the position of the image on the screen.  If there are such settings, then with their help.  If not, then adjust the position of the projector and / or screen. </li><li>  We check the focus (it is worth looking at the picture closer and moving away).  If everything looks clear (which is rare at once), then we don‚Äôt touch anything.  In other cases, we delve into the settings and bring the image to a state close to ideal. </li><li>  Check the brightness, color and contrast.  Usually these parameters are set by default, but there are always options for tuning, so you can really try to do better.  If it doesn‚Äôt work out, no one bothers to reset the settings back to the ‚Äúdefault‚Äù state. </li><li>  If the projector has other settings, it makes sense to check them all.  It is possible that some of the modes will be liked more or it will be possible to find something interesting (surprisingly, not so many people delve into the settings of the new technology, but in vain). </li></ol><p>  It remains to do the latter.  Upload a movie and call friends.  Or perhaps connect a computer / set-top box and finally play on a truly huge screen.  Now the opportunities have become much more, and all thanks to the competent installation of the projector. </p>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  If you have free funds, it is better to use the services of specialists.  At least they will give a guarantee for their services (well, or should give it), which will allow in case of problems to demand compensation or free correction.  But there is to do everything yourself and something goes wrong, there will be no one else to blame.  This is especially true with not very high-quality mounts, which can lead to both collapse of the ceiling (or part of it) and fatal damage to the projector. </p>
