    <p>  The presence of diverse <span>natural zones</span> is characteristic of our planet.  They replace each other and differ in their climatic conditions, flora and fauna, as well as the landscape that prevails in them.  One of them is taiga - a natural zone located within the temperate climate zone. </p><p>  Coniferous trees, which are the main representatives of vegetation, are characteristic of taiga.  There are a lot of swamps.  This is due to the fact that a large amount of precipitation does not penetrate deep into the soil due to permafrost, but also does not evaporate. </p><p>  Taiga, a <span>natural zone,</span> extends over 7,000 kilometers from west to east in Eurasia, and 5,000 kilometers in North America.  Russian taiga is the largest landscape area in the country.  It began to form long before the onset of glaciers. </p><p>  What else is characterized by taiga?  Its climate is very cold in winter and quite cool in summer.  There is a lot of rainfall in this natural area.  Soils in the taiga are podzolic and permafrost-taiga.  All these conditions favor the growth of <span>conifers.</span>  On the European territory of Russia in the taiga grow spruce, fir, pine, cedar.  These are dark coniferous forests.  The grass cover here cannot be called rich: mainly berry bushes are represented - blueberries, blueberries, lingonberries.  In light coniferous taiga of Eastern Siberia, spruce, larch and stunted <span>trees (alder,</span> polar willow, polar birch), berry shrubs grow.  In the Far East, taiga is mostly larch, rare. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In Europe, taiga is located on the <span>Scandinavian Peninsula</span> and in Finland - it covers almost their entire territory. </p><p>  Taiga, a natural zone, is conditionally divided into northern, middle and southern.  They differ in climatic conditions, flora and fauna.  So, in the northern zone, vegetation is the most sparse: trees and shrubs are mostly stunted and sparse.  The middle strip of the taiga is already more saturated with vegetation, but these are mainly mosses, grasses and blueberries.  The southern zone of the taiga is rich in flora.  There are not only dark coniferous, but also small-leaved trees (birch, aspen), and undersized shrubs. </p><p>  Taiga, whose natural zone extends from the 42nd parallel, the northern part of Hokkaido (southern border), to the 72nd parallel, <span>the Taimyr peninsula</span> (northern border), is considered the longest climatic zone of the planet. </p><p>  In comparison with the tundra, the animal world of the taiga is more diverse.  In it you can meet lynx, chipmunks, wolverine, sable, hare, shrew.  Since ancient times, taiga has been a place for furs.  Some representatives of <span>ungulate animals</span> live here <span>:</span> moose, red and reindeer, roe deer.  From rodents in the taiga live mice, field voles, various species of squirrels.  The taiga world of birds is diverse: here you can meet a capercaillie, pine nut, crossbill, and hazel grouse. </p><p>  The climatic conditions of the taiga for animals are quite favorable.  The largest number of fur animals in the world lives here.  In the cold season, the activity of animals decreases, because many of them hibernate. </p><p>  The taiga of Russia, namely the taiga massifs of Siberia, are rightly considered the green ‚Äúlungs‚Äù of the planet: these forests maintain the carbon and oxygen balance of the lower atmosphere.  Therefore, national parks and reserves are being created here to be able to thoroughly study the unique flora and fauna of this natural zone. </p><p>  Taiga is a source of wood.  In addition, it contains numerous mineral deposits necessary for man - coal, gas, oil. </p><p>  Residents of the taiga area are engaged in hunting (in particular, furs), picking berries, fruits and nuts, cattle breeding, and also harvest herbs.  Many of them are engaged in forestry. </p>
