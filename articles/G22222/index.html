They are completely indifferent whether you bought them an expensive toy of a famous brand or did something wonderful with your own hands.  It is much more important for them to have fun with you.  The best thing you can do for a young child is to give him your time.  Try to show imagination and come up with <span>how to make a car</span> out of the box.  Your baby will be extremely happy with such a gift. </p><p>  In addition, children are madly in love with cardboard boxes, because you can put anything in them.  And climb yourself, even hide from your parents.  And with your help, the usual unnecessary box can turn into a chic car.  It takes about 20 minutes, and you don‚Äôt need anything that can not be found in every house. </p><h2>  Materials and Tools </h2><p>  To make a carbide toy car, we need: </p><ol><li>  The box is large in size to fit a child. </li><li>  Stationery knife. </li><li>  Plastic or cardboard plates and cups. </li><li>  Scotch. </li><li>  Paints. </li></ol><p>  In general, nothing special.  Plates are needed in order to make the wheels and steering wheel, but if they are not, then five circles can be cut out of cardboard.  Two cups are perfect for headlights. </p><h2>  How to make a car out of the box </h2><p>  Consider the process step by step: </p><ol><li>  Glue the box with tape so that it does not open. </li><li>  Measure two-thirds of the length of the box and cut it with a knife so that a convertible is obtained.  Cuts should be done along the edges of the box without cutting along the intended line.  A place that remains uncut will be the hood.  The rest is the cabin, where the child will sit.  The cut out part of the cardboard needs to be bent forward, from it we will make a windshield. <div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a car out of the box" class="if uuid-2230846" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32890/2230846.jpg"></div></li><li>  Further on the sides you need to cut out the doors through which the child can sit inside the car.  We bend the bent cardboard so that its distant part is slightly larger than the front one.  Then we glue the structure to the box and cut out the windshield. <div class="photo" data-original="www.parenting.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a car out of the box with your own hands" class="if uuid-2230844" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32890/2230844.jpg"></div></li><li>  Glue paper "wheels" to the car.  Then attach the headlights and steering wheel. </li></ol><p>  This is a very easy way to make a car out of the box.  It remains only to hand the child paints and let him personally decorate his first car.  Do not limit the baby, let him have the opportunity to do everything exactly as he wants.  To make the child comfortable sitting inside, you can put a pillow or put a high chair. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Box fire truck </h2><p>  If you are interested in how to make a fire engine out of the box, the scheme will be similar. </p><p>  We collect the basis of the future car from large boxes.  For the body we take the box itself, the cabin is made of a smaller box.  Next, the wheels are attached.  If you want them to rotate, the plates can be attached using wire.  Of the half bobbins from tape, you can make wings for the wheels.  Next, glue several empty toilet paper bushes to make water tanks.  Flashers can be made from another elongated box. </p><p>  To smooth out all the joints and shortcomings, glue the finished machine with paper.  Wait until the structure dries well, and you can decorate it with gouache or acrylic paints. </p><h2>  Carton Box Toy Ideas </h2><p>  We examined in detail how to make a car out of the boxes with our own hands.  But this is not the only option for using unnecessary cardboard.  You can also make from the boxes: </p><ol><li>  Posh train, <span>plane, helicopter</span> and even rocket. </li><li>  A house for your child or cat. </li><li>  Kitchen, washing machine. </li><li>  Supermarket. </li><li>  Dollhouse with furniture. </li><li>  The real maze. </li><li>  A playground with the city and much more. <div class="photo" data-original="www.thebearandthefox.com" data-author=", "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a fire truck out of the box" class="if uuid-2230848" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32890/2230848.jpg"></div></li></ol><p>  Show your imagination, show your child how to make a car out of the box, play with it.  After all, children are growing so fast.  They need your attention, and the precious minutes spent with the baby will remain in their memories for many years. </p>
