It is hard to imagine that this amazing city grew up in the desert just a few decades ago.  At the end of the sixties of the last century, at the place where today is the modern metropolis, there was an unremarkable village of fishermen and pearl catchers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When huge oil deposits were discovered on the territory of the country, the so-called golden rain poured onto the city and in just four to five decades it became one of the most expensive, pretentious and high-tech megacities on our planet.  The city has many UAE attractions.  What to see in the capital?  With some masterpieces of architecture, historical monuments and interesting places of the city we will introduce you further. </p><div class="photo" data-original="poemtravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The capital of the UAE is Abu Dhabi" class="if uuid-2773327" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2773327.jpg"></div><h2>  Ethnographic Village </h2><p>  The open-air museum was created so that tourists have the opportunity to know the past of the country.  The village accurately reproduces the Bedouin settlement, which it was more than a century ago.  Workshops in which fabrics and clays, tools for metal processing are of great interest.  Authentic items, antique crafts, and traditional pastries can be bought at the gift shop. </p><h2>  Ferrari World Park </h2><p>  This park is located near the capital on the artificial island of Yas.  The shape of the facade of the building resembles the legendary Ferrari GT model, it is painted in red and decorated with the logo of the famous brand on the roof.  Here are the achievements of the famous Italian company, all the famous car models and the latest developments, interactive installations, small copies of the sights of Italy. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="ostrav.travel" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Park &quot;Ferrari&quot;" class="if uuid-2773482" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2773482.jpg"></div><h2>  Sheikh Zayed Mosque </h2><p>  The snow-white construction made of marble is an example of modern Arabian architecture.  It was erected in honor of the first president of the country, Sheikh Zayed.  Leading specialists from the USA, Germany, Italy took part in the construction and decoration of the mosque.  A huge, incredibly beautiful carpet with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã5.6 thousand meters was woven by the best masters of Iran, and the gilded chandelier of this mosque is generously decorated with a scattering of precious stones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="storyjasmine.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sheikh Zayed Mosque" class="if uuid-2773499" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2773499.jpg"></div><h2>  Etihad Towers </h2><p>  The unique attraction of the United Arab Emirates, consisting of five skyscrapers, is located in the west of Abu Dhabi on the picturesque coast of the Persian Gulf.  The highest of them exceeds 300 meters.  The complex has shops, residential apartments, conference rooms, offices, restaurants and a wonderful hotel.  On the 74th floor of one of the towers is an observation deck with a panoramic view of the city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Al Bahar Towers </h2><p>  Built in 2012, the twin towers are located in the east of Abu Dhabi.  The facade design was developed by local specialists in collaboration with Arup Engineers from the UK.  A team of talented architects managed to bring to life an interesting idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcombining the characteristic features of Arabic architecture and ultra-modern design, which gave the buildings an original futuristic look. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dreamstime.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Al Bahar Towers" class="if uuid-2773513" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2773513.jpg"></div><p>  The outer walls of the buildings are made of sliding panels moving under the influence of the sun. </p><h2>  Al Jahili Fortress </h2><p>  The fortress, built at the end of the 19th century, was designed to protect the oasis and the city of Al Ain in the emirate of Abu Dhabi.  Later it became the largest fort on this land.  Today, Al Jahili is a national monument.  The construction is located on the border with Oman in the oasis of Al Ain.  Its name translates as "green garden". </p><h2>  SEC ‚ÄúMarina Mall‚Äù </h2><p>  The most visited and largest shopping center of the capital.

The <span>shopping center</span> even has an observation deck at the top of the tower. </p><h2>  Capital gate </h2><p>  The futuristic tower located in the capital of the country has become a symbol of the unity of the past and the future.  The structure is built at an angle, so it may seem that it is falling, like the famous tower in the city of Pisa.  However, the architects did not try to copy this technique - in the construction of this structure, step structures were used, which created the tilt effect. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.yamsafer.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="UAE Capital Gate" class="if uuid-2773530" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2773530.jpg"></div><h2>  UAE Attractions: what else to see? </h2><p>  A huge part of the country's attractions is concentrated in Dubai.  That is why experienced travelers recommend definitely visiting this city. </p><h2>  Palm islands </h2><p>  An artificial archipelago consisting of three islands - Jumeirah, Jebel Ali and Deira in the form of date palms, which is recognized by experts of the whole world as a miracle of modern engineering.  This is a grandiose project and one of the main attractions of the United Arab Emirates.  The islands are made of limestone, stone and sand, which was mined on the coast of the Persian Gulf. </p><h2>  Burj khalifa </h2><p>  The highest skyscraper in the world, which resembles a cave stalagmite in shape, its height is more than 800 meters, the building has 163 floors.  This is not only one of the main attractions of Dubai (United Arab Emirates), but also its visiting card.  In the tower there is a hotel, offices, several fountains, elegant private apartments.  There are several viewing platforms equipped with stunning views of the city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.curbed.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Burj khalifa" class="if uuid-2773545" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2773545.jpg"></div><h2>  Gold market </h2><p>  It is located in the shopping <span>district of Dubai,</span> where tourists from all over the world buy gold jewelry at very low prices.  Pink, white and yellow gold are bought by weight, and not by individual products. </p><h2>  Bastakia District </h2><p>  One of the oldest areas of Dubai, which dates back to the 19th century.  In those days, pearl hunters lived here.  This activity for a long time brought the main income to local residents.  In Bastakia, there are wind towers that acted as air conditioners, and traditional Arab buildings. </p><h2>  Musical fountain </h2><p>  The UAE's popular attractions include a fountain located near the Burj Khalifa tower and which is a man-made miracle.  It is the largest fountain in the world, illuminated by six thousand light sources.  He throws water jets to a height of 150 meters and creates more than a thousand figured compositions from water columns. </p><h2>  Hotel "Sail" </h2><p>  A luxury hotel, shaped like a sail flying in the wind, is located on an artificial island in the emirate of Dubai.  The skyscraper reaches a height of more than 300 meters, and in the hall the ceiling height reaches maximum marks - more than 180 meters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.com.gr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel &quot;Sail&quot;" class="if uuid-2773577" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2773577.jpg"></div><h2>  Dubai Mall </h2><p>  Extremely popular entertainment complex located in the city of Dubai.  Here you can get lost in kilometers of showrooms, shops, cinemas, markets and attractions for tourists.  In this place there is a huge Olympic ice rink and an aquarium with thousands of underwater inhabitants, which is listed in the Guinness Book of Records. </p><h2>  Ski dubai </h2><p>  The routes of almost all excursions to the sights of the United Arab Emirates include a visit to the indoor ski complex in Dubai.  Such a resort in the middle of the desert is probably only possible in Dubai.  To see this man-made miracle, you should come to the Mall of Emirates. </p><p>  Ski Dubai is the only such complex in the Middle East.  And this is not at all surprising, because the local climate does not allow enjoying winter fun here.  But <span>the UAE residents</span> dreamed of playing snowballs, tubing and skiing, which is why a unique complex was created here with artificial snow under the roof, which does not melt under the sun. </p><div class="photo" data-original="monumentsdedubai.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ski resort" class="if uuid-2773583" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2773583.jpg"></div><p>  For this reason, Ski Dubai is open year-round.  The complex simultaneously accommodates up to 1,500 people, its infrastructure is carefully thought out, ideal conditions for skiing and snowboarding are created here. </p><h2>  Al Fahidi Fort </h2><p>  Another attraction of the United Arab Emirates, located in the heart of Dubai, which is of great historical value.  Scientists say the fort was built at the end of the 18th century.  In the old days, the powerful walls of the fortress protected the townspeople from the invasion of the Bedouin tribes and from sea attacks.  Currently, only fragments of the fort have been preserved, since the city walls were dismantled. </p><h2>  Jumeirah Mosque </h2><p>  One of the country's most beautiful Islamic temples is located in Dubai.  The magnificent building was built of pink sandstone in 1979, in the traditional Fatimid style.  The mosque accepts not only Muslims, but also under the guidance of a guide there are guided tours for everyone.  Tourists are told about interesting Islamic traditions, the traditions of the local population. </p><h2>  Interesting facts about the country </h2><p>  We have presented you the best attractions of the UAE, and now we offer you to familiarize yourself with some interesting facts about this amazing country: </p><ul><li>  The true gem of the UAE is the capital - Abu Dhabi.
