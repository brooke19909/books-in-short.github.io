  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Eco farms in the suburbs: options for recreation</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the age of high technology, rest on ecological farms is gaining more and more popularity, where you can not only get acquainted with the way of rural life, but also improve your health through walks in the fresh air and natural food.  In the suburbs there are also such farms. </p><h2>  Cheese Factory in Istra </h2><p>  If you move along Novorizhskoe highway, then after about 60 km you can reach the village of Dubrovka.  It was there that in August 2015, one young man, Oleg Sirota, a specialist in the field of IT technology, opened his own cheese production farm.  Oleg‚Äôs dream is simple - to bring his production to the federal level, to deliver products to all nearby and distant stores of the country.  Cheeses are very diverse: hard and soft, special attention is paid to the production of domestic analogues of parmesan and emmentaler. </p><p>  <span>Ecofarm</span> in the suburbs is always glad to new visitors.  Both children and adults will be able to stroll through the cheese factory, which has large panoramic windows, peering through which you can see many cheese heads that each ripen peacefully on their shelf: "Beer", "Wine", "Governor", "Istra", "Peasant".  If you arrive in the afternoon and you are lucky enough to find the owner of the production, Oleg Sirota himself, he will gladly conduct a tour for you and your children, tell you about the main stages of production, as well as interesting stories related to the appearance of cheese in the world. </p><p>  After the tour, you can independently taste the products that are available for sale in the store, which is located right at the farm.  However, if you come here solely for the purchase of cheese, you should call in advance and check availability, because some varieties may end.  The plans of the owner of the cheese factory are grandiose: start your own herd, because now milk is purchased exclusively from farmers, as well as open a museum and conduct master classes for children and adults on the primary production of cheese.  By the way, in the store you can also buy natural yogurts with berry additives, which children love so much. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="df35.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Oleg Sirota" class="if uuid-3245290" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3245290.jpg"></div><h2>  Agrofarm "Eco-village" </h2><p>  On the 110th kilometer along the Novoryazanskoye shosse, next to other eco-farms, in the Moscow Region is located "Eco-village".  The complex is famous for its unusual excursions.  Where else can you find a real crocodile farm or see a breeding of grape snails! </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.10946149999999" data-lng="38.82638769999994" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/8/0/6/4/18064.png"></div><p>  The grape snail has been known since ancient times.  Eastern Europe is considered its homeland, from where it eventually spread throughout the territory, except for the northern regions.  Interestingly, grape snails were not considered a delicacy before and they were eaten by all segments of the population.  It was an ordinary tasty and healthy protein meal.  Snails fall into hibernation, so the farm has all the conditions for their year-round wakefulness.  Various packings are offered for sale: 500 grams each or on plates in 200 g. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Rest on an eco-farm in the suburbs will be remembered forever if you choose to visit a crocodile nursery, which is also available in the Eco-Village.  Several species of reptiles are represented here, but the caiman, which reaches two to three meters in length, is worthy of special attention.  For crocodiles, this is not very much.  Both adults and children will be able to take pictures against the background of reptiles and feed them under the supervision of a specialist. </p><p>  In addition to snails and crocodiles, you can diversify your leisure with horseback riding.  The specialists of the Eco-Village will introduce you to the basic rules, help you climb the saddle, which is not easy for beginners, and will accompany you on the trip.  Communication with horses is one of the strongest antidepressants.  And, of course, a real Russian bathhouse.  At the eco-farm, it is also available.  Between excursions, you should definitely enjoy a lunch of natural products, which are prepared for guests every day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.esosedi.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Farm &quot;Eco-village&quot;" class="if uuid-3245292" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3245292.jpg"></div><h2>  "Vankovo" </h2><p>  In the Moscow region, eco-houses with accommodation are in great demand.
