    <h2>  How was the shrine created? </h2><p>  The idea is widespread, according to which the Virgin Mary herself weaved a belt from the hair of a camel, and the baby Jesus held on to him when he was just learning to walk.  The Belt of the Blessed Virgin Mary became the only surviving relic from the earthly life of the Virgin Mary.  This explains its fabulous value both morally and materially.  Touching the belt cleanses, removes heaviness from the soul, restores strength.  Cases of recovery from the most serious oncological diseases and infertility are known.  An invariable condition for the manifestation of miraculous power, according to the clergy, is the true faith of the converts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The first historically captured miracle </h2><p>  The first mention of the amazing power of the belt is associated with the Apostle Thomas, who could not participate in the burial of the Virgin Mary. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the belt of the virgin in kazakhstan aktobe" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19718/440504.jpg" width="357"></div>  Only three days later Thomas arrived in Jerusalem and in his grief asked the apostles to open the tomb in order to bid farewell to the Virgin.  When the tomb was opened, it turned out that it was empty.  Inside, there were only funerary sheets with a marvelous fragrant aroma.  The astonished exclamations of the apostles did not go unanswered - the Mother of God appeared to them with blessing.

    <h2>  Further wanderings of the shrine </h2><p>  After dressing and the Belt of the Virgin passed to the respected and pious widows of Jerusalem.  So, for many generations kept shrines in Palestine.  But in the 4th century, the Belt was placed on the ark and delivered to Constantinople (Istanbul), where it remained intact until the 10th century, when it was divided into parts and smashed to different parts of the world. </p><p>  When Constantinople fell, several places of storage of the Belt of the Virgin were known.  Among others were called: <span>Vatopedi Monastery,</span> which is located on Mount Athos in Greece;  <span>Trooditissa Monastery</span> in Cyprus, Blachernae Church in Zugdidi (Georgia), the Church of <span>Elijah the Prophet of</span> Ordinary in Moscow, <span>Kazan Cathedral in St. Petersburg,</span> St. Stephen's Cathedral in Italy and the Church of the Belt of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Syria. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Why was the pilgrimage of the Belt made possible by country? </h2><p>  Everyone dreams of touching the shrine, but some cannot afford to reach the place of its storage.  Therefore, the pilgrimage of the Belt of the Virgin Mary throughout the world.  In May 2014, the journey of the shrine throughout the Republic of Kazakhstan began.  The Belt of the Virgin in Kazakhstan was already in early May. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Virgin's belt in Kazakhstan 2014" class="if" height="472" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19718/440503.jpg" width="252"></div>  It was possible for all believers to touch the shrine in Alma-Ata within the walls of the convent, which is located on Latif Hamidi Street.  This was not the last chance for residents of the city and the region to take a closer look at the Belt of the Virgin in Kazakhstan (2014).  The relic returned to the southern capital on May 31 and stayed in Alma-Ata until June 15.

Virgin Mary herself wore a belt over her clothes.  As a consolation, she presented her belt to the Apostle Thomas, who could not arrive at her burial in time. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Virgin's belt in Kazakhstan schedule" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19718/440502.jpg" width="600"></div>  Metropolitan Alexander, who visited the Akim of the Aktobe region, Archimedes Mukhambetov, said that particles of the belt belonging to the mother of Jesus are stored in various remote places on the globe.

The last hope for hopeless patients is the Belt of the Virgin in Kazakhstan, to which they pray for the healing of sorrows and ailments.  People deprived of the joy of having a child turn to the Mother of God.  And often their prayers are heard.  The inhabitants of the country themselves believe that the possibility of healing directly depends on the strength of faith.
