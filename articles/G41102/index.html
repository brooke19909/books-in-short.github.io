    <p>  In addition, you must remember that money is invested in <span>a DSLR camera system.</span>  If the first device was Canon, then there is a high probability that the next model will be the same manufacturer, so that it remains possible to use old lenses and accessories.  Below are the most important aspects that should be considered when buying digital SLR cameras, as well as the most rated models that exist today. </p><h2>  Understanding Sensor Size </h2><p>  Most consumer DSLRs use image sensors, which, although much larger than conventional digital cameras, are slightly smaller than the 35 mm film frame.  This can be a bit confusing when talking about <span>the</span> camera‚Äôs <span>field of view</span> , since the focal lengths for compacts are often compared to the 35 mm equivalent.  The standard APS-C sensor has a 1.5x crop factor.  This means that the 18-55 mm lens that comes with most DSLRs covers a 35 mm field of view, equivalent to 27-82.5 mm.  This is comparable to the 3X zoom lens of a conventional camera with a focal length of 28 mm. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A larger sensor has many advantages.  It allows you to better control the depth of field of the image - isolate the object and create a blurred background.  This effect is often called the Japanese term "bokeh".  Much has been written about its quality, but the general rule is that the more light hits the matrix, which is numerically expressed by the aperture, aperture or number f, the more blurry the background can be.  A lens with a maximum aperture of f / 1.4 transmits 8 times more light than with f / 4, and can create a shallower depth of field with equal focal length and shooting distance. </p>

    <p>  Another reason to opt for a large sensor is to minimize image noise.  The 20-megapixel DSLR has much larger pixels than a regular camera with the same resolution.  These large pixels allow you to set a higher sensor sensitivity, measured digitally as ISO, with less image noise.  The advantage of a larger surface area is that color or brightness changes are more gradual than that of a ‚Äúsoap dish‚Äù.  This makes it possible to achieve more natural shots with a greater sense of depth. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Full frame cameras </h2><p>  Some <span>DSLR cameras (Canon</span> EOS 6D) are equipped with sensors that are equal in size to 35 mm film.  These full-frame devices are generally more expensive than their APS-C counterparts.  If in the future there is an intention to go to the full frame, you should be careful when buying lenses.  Some of them are intended for use only with APS-C.  Canon calls its APS-C lens range EF-S, and full-frame lenses are called EF.  Nikon DSLR cameras use this approach, labeling ‚Äútrimmed‚Äù optics with DX and full-frame with FX.  Sony adds the DT designation to its APS-C lenses, and Pentax calls them DA. </p><h2>  Camera selection </h2><p>  It is very important to choose a camera that is comfortable in your hands.  Although most DSLRs are similar in size and assembly, the style of the handle, the position of the controls, and other ergonomic characteristics can vary dramatically. </p>

    <p>  The selected DSLR digital camera should be the most convenient to use.  If it is too large or small to be comfortable, if the controls are not arranged in the way that the user would like, most likely you will not be able to enjoy shooting to the fullest. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Mirror viewfinder </h2><p>  By definition, the DSLR has an optical sight that shows the image captured by the camera lens, but not all of them are the same.  A mirror directs light to one of two types of viewfinders.  The first one - the pentazerkalo - is usually found on entry-level devices such as the Canon EOS Rebel SL1 worth $ 549.00 or the Nikon D5500.  In this type of viewfinder, 3 mirrors are used to redirect the image into the photographer‚Äôs eye, which turn it so that it turns out to be correct, in contrast to the inverted image on the sensor in reality. </p><h2>  Pentaprism </h2><p>  The second type of viewfinder of a DSLR camera is pentaprism.  It is a solid glass prism that does the same as a pentaser mirror.  The first, as a rule, is heavier and brighter than the second.  Extra brightness makes it easier to crop images and makes sure that the photo is in focus.  Pentaprisms usually start appearing in mid-range SLR cameras such as the Canon EOS 80D priced at $ 1,199.00, and are standard on professional devices such as the Canon EOS-1D X Mark II ($ 5,999.00).  Pentax K-70 is one of the few entry-level models with a viewfinder of this type, which has one hundred percent coverage.  This affordable camera is fully sealed for use on rainy or snowy days. </p>

    <p>  You should also pay attention to the increase and percentage of the frame, as it gives an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe actual size of the image and shows how much of the captured image can be seen.  In both cases, it is better to look for maximum numbers. </p><h2>  Another option: EVF </h2><p>  A small number of SLR cameras on the market offer a third viewfinder option - electronic.  Sony DSLR cameras with fixed translucent mirrors, such as the Alpha 77 II, are sometimes called SLTs.  Instead of redirecting light into the eye, it is reflected on the auto focus sensor.  If the user is not configured for an optical viewfinder, then these cameras are worth considering.  Even the $ 1998 full-frame flagship Sony Alpha 99 uses OLED EVF, eschewing the glass pentaprism common in other full-frame SLRs.  If this option is suitable, then you can also explore mirrorless cameras - truncated models with the same sensor size as DSLR devices, but without a mirror, which duplicate the image that hits the matrix in real time. </p><h2>  Continuous shooting </h2><p>  Compared to conventional digital devices, DSLR cameras are also high speed.  The time between pressing the shutter button and image capture, called the shutter lag, and the time between shots is often a problem with compact cameras.  SLR cameras tend to focus very quickly, and their shutter lag is almost imperceptible.  Continuous shooting is measured in frames per second.  You need to look for a camera that can shoot 3 fps, although sports photographers and naturalists will need a camera that shoots faster than 5 fps. </p><h2>  Autofocus speed </h2><p>  Of course, the auto focus system should keep up with the frame rate.  Basic SLR cameras such as the Nikon D3300 often have only a few AF points, making it difficult to track moving objects. </p>

    <p>  For high-end cameras, the <span>Canon 7D Mark II</span> and <span>Nikon D500</span> AF points cover most of the frame, making them favorites for sports and wildlife photography users.  Continuous shooting and autofocus go hand in hand, so it‚Äôs important to look for a camera that has sufficient performance for these two parameters. </p><h2>  Screen Sight and HD Video </h2><p>  Video recording is currently a standard feature of SLR cameras.  You need to look for one that holds autofocus during recording.  You should also check the speed of the auto focus when shooting in live mode, as it can often be very slow.  Canon has been successful in improving the autofocus speed when recording video on the T6s and 70D, and Sony cameras focus as fast during video recording as they do when taking photos.  If the user plans to use the video function frequently, it is important to have a microphone input jack - the external will record much better than the built-in one. </p><h2>  Telephoto lens </h2><p>  Most novice users of digital SLRs are not going to purchase additional optics, but there are those who consider it necessary to expand the standard equipment.  First of all, in addition to the standard 18-55 mm, a telephoto lens is chosen.  As a rule, a variable zoom is used, starting from 55 mm and ending with 200 mm or 300 mm, which will help to produce more approximate long-range shots.  The cost plan for such optics should include 200-300 US dollars. </p><h2>  35mm lens </h2><p>  Another popular type of optics is a quick, with a normal angle, a simple lens.  Before zooms became popular, film SLR cameras were often equipped with 50mm f / 2 optics.  Due to the smaller sensor in consumer DSLRs, today this corresponds to a 35 mm f / 2. </p>

    <p>  The standard angle gives a field of view that is almost no different from the human eye, and a fast aperture allows you to shoot in low light conditions, as well as isolate the object by blurring the background.  Depending on the DSLR camera, the price of these lenses may vary, but it should be expected that it will range from 175 to 350 US dollars. </p><h2>  External flash </h2><p>  Despite the fact that consumer SLR cameras usually have built-in flashes, many photographers prefer more powerful external devices.  They emit more light and can often be moved to use reflected light to illuminate the subject.  Flash reflections from the ceiling to illuminate the entire room can be achieved using a special device, but not a retractable DSLR camera system.  Depending on your energy needs, charge time, and transfer capabilities, an external flash can cost anywhere from 150 to 500 US dollars. </p><h2>  External screen </h2><p>  The monitor for the DSLR camera eliminates the limitations of the small screen on the back of the camera, which does not allow for accurate focusing during shooting, to manage to notice glare and shadow, correct white balance and shoot at a large angle. </p><h2>  Stabilizer </h2><p>  The DSLR camera stabilizer is a device that will minimize unwanted movements.  For example, the three-axis DJI Ronin-M with electronic suspension is designed for cameras weighing up to 3.6 kg.  It provides complete freedom to the photographer while working on images for 6 hours - this is the battery life of the device on a single battery charge.  It is enough to fix the camera and balance it, and the built-in processor itself will make the necessary settings.  An accuracy of 0.02 ¬∞ will satisfy the most demanding professionals. </p>

    <p>  In addition, it is possible to remotely control the stabilizer via Bluetooth and iOS applications.  The DJI LightBridge module is supported, which broadcasts video over a distance of 1.5 km. </p><h2>  A bag </h2><p>  Another essential accessory is a bag for DSLR cameras.  Sony LCS-BDF, for example, presents a convenient and compact case that accommodates a camera, a zoom lens and additional optics.  Mesh pockets on the front are designed for transporting and storing various media, filters, etc. There is an additional pocket on the back and a shoulder strap with a soft removable pad. </p>
