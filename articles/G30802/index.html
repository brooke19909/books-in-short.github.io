  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The meaning and origin of the surname Kostin</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Most of the people on the planet are carriers of proper names.  The name is also paired with the name.  It determines which family or tribe we are from.  A surname is a family, clan, name of a father, an ancestor to which each of us belongs.  However, not all people know where their names came from.  From this article you can find out the meaning and origin of the name Kostina. </p><h2>  How did most surnames appear </h2><p>  Many surnames are associated with the name of the locality.  Does a man live in Small Puzyaki?  So, to be him Puzyakin.  Lives in Belyavki?  So, Belyavsky will walk. </p><p>  Many surnames came from a kind of activity.  Man is engaged in pottery - to be him Goncharov.  Forges a horseshoe - will become Kovalev. </p><div class="photo" data-original="." data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="history and origin of the surname costin" class="if uuid-2764309" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97054/2764309.jpg"></div><p>  Some surnames went on behalf of the ancestors.  Mikhail became children Mikhailov, Nikolai - Nikolaev.  And this is still without memories of serfdom, when all the serfs of one gentleman, even not closely related to him by blood, called his name.  So a huge number of Trubetskoy, Menshikov or Kurochkin - far from noble origin. </p><h2>  Origin on behalf of father </h2><p>  Often the name Kostin comes from the name of his own Kostya, Konstantin, which stands for Greek as "permanent, persistent."  In Latin, the meaning of this name is the same. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So the name Kostin, according to one version, was formed after the baptism of Russia, when Greek names began to be used when baptizing children. </p><p>  And in order to determine whether a child belongs to one or another father, they said ‚ÄúKostin‚Äôs son‚Äù, ‚ÄúKostina‚Äôs daughter‚Äù, and the surname was born, which to this day is quite common in Russian open spaces.  Bones are found in the Volga region, on the Don, in the Kursk and Voronezh lands.  The geography is so vast that many Kostins, whose surnames are of the most diverse origin, live abroad. </p><p>  One of the first references to the Kostins is found in the annals of Tsar Ivan the Terrible.  The list of guardsmen was very long, among them quite a lot of Kostins.  And in the boyar books there are references to the Kostin boyars.  The merchant and noble estate documents indicate the name Kostin.  So, this surname is found, not only in vast territories, but also in many classes. </p><h2>  The legend of two brothers </h2><p>  According to another version, the name Kostin comes from two brothers.  According to legend, two brothers lived, Konstantin and David, they reigned in the Argve side and fought with the Arabian prince Murvan Glukhim.  They fought with varying success for a long time.  Either the Arabs defeated, then the princes beat them mercilessly.  And then one day they lost.  They were captured where they were brutally tortured for many years, forced to accept the Muslim faith, and then executed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="." data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="David and Konstantin Aragvetsky" class="if uuid-2764311" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97054/2764311.jpg"></div><p>  They suffered for the Christian faith, refusing to accept Islam.  Therefore, they were drowned in the year 730.  And since Kostya was a man of devotion and almost a saint, they gave him the name Kostin.  Since there was already one saint Constantine the Great, a martyr.  And <span>Kostin Konstantin was</span> also declared a holy martyr and righteous.  What is the record in religious scriptures. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Funny variant of origin </h2><p>  The next version of the origin of the surname Kostin sounds pretty down to earth.  Kostin is thin, "bones and skin."  Times were hard, thinness was often the norm.  But how was it necessary to stand out so that the children would be called by the thinness of their father?  But be that as it may, the person was apparently good and having many children, since the surname had spread so many-sidedly and multifacetedly. </p><h2>  Geographical version of a surname </h2><p>  Well, another non-romantic version of the birth of a surname is a geographical one.  As a rule, according to this version, the name Kostiny, Konstantinovy ‚Äã‚Äãand Konstantinovsky happened.  These names went from the name of the place where the children of Kostya lived for centuries - Konstantinovo or Konstantinovka. </p><div class="photo" data-original="photoclub.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Village from above" class="if uuid-2764312" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97054/2764312.jpg"></div><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  There are a lot of derivatives on behalf of Konstantin.  So one of them was Kotka, diminutive in the name of Konstantin or the Roman version of Kastanay.  Therefore, there are many versions in the <span>history of the origin of the name</span> Kostin.  Some of them are true, and some are far-fetched and obviously absurd.  However, the main thing is to remember the people who glorified their surname.  They did not forget those who dishonored her.  History is our roots.  There is no future without the past.  And on worthy examples of heroic ancestors descendants should be brought up. </p>
