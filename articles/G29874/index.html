  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Trading system "Sniper": full description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Among the many different trading strategies for trading, one can distinguish a rather sensational Sniper tactic.  This technique was developed by a practicing trader Dmitriev.  The trading system "Sniper" is an indicator-free strategy based on an understanding of the financial market and levels of market quotes.  A major role in it is played by the psychology of trading and money management.  Dmitriev in his methodology uses very simple and convenient tools, which, with the appropriate approach and proper application, show remarkable results. </p><h2>  Types of Trading Strategy </h2><p>  Trading system Dmitrieva "Sniper" has several versions.  Initially, the author of the strategy developed its first version, which formed the basis, that is, the base.  Later Dmitriev released "Supplements" for his methodology.  Then, the Sniper trading system received new changes and its second version was published, later the third and fourth. </p><p>  Strategy Options: </p><ol><li>  TS "Sniper v 1.0" - the base or basis. </li><li>  Additions to v 1.0. </li><li>  TS "Sniper v 2". </li><li>  TS "Sniper v 3.0;  v 3.1;  v 3.2 ". </li><li>  Addition and bonuses to v 3. </li><li>  TS "Sniper v 4" and also bonuses. </li></ol><p>  In each version, the author improved his methodology and added any new tools or pointed out important points, trading conditions, and features.  For almost all versions of Sniper, automated programs have been developed that facilitate trading through the system and allow using it more fully and profitably.  The last option created by the author is ‚ÄúSniper v 4‚Äù, for which the adviser is also written. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The basis or basis of the strategy </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="sniper trading system materials" class="if uuid-3097686" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41139/3097686.jpg"></div><p>  If you carefully study the material proposed by the author, you can identify several factors that formed the basis of the strategy. </p><p>  Base trading system "Sniper": </p><ol><li>  Levels having a specific name. </li><li>  Money Management. </li><li>  Safe rule. </li><li>  Management of protective orders. </li><li>  Building blocks. </li><li>  Trend Trading Rules. </li><li>  Exit accumulation zones. </li></ol><p>  Dmitriev in his strategy considers two phases of the market state: trend and correctional waiting area. </p><p>  It should also be noted that due to the constructions and understanding of the laws of the financial market, the trading system ‚ÄúSniper x‚Äù cannot be attributed to simple techniques.  Therefore, the author recommends that all newcomers carefully study courses on strategy, and for practice, use a demo account for at least 100-150 trade transactions and only after that switch to the real market. </p><h2>  Trading system "Sniper": instruction </h2><p>  For ease of perception, rather voluminous material, you can highlight the main points of the trading methodology, so that in the future they can easily be used as a memo: </p><ol><li>  You need to open an order, that is, look for suitable points for entering the market on the M1 and M5 timeframes. </li><li>  Transactions are monitored on the M30-H1. </li><li>  You can‚Äôt open deals in the middle of the movement of market quotes. </li><li>  In trading, you should always use protective orders "Stop-loss". </li><li>  The methodology provides for the mandatory conduct of statistics on transactions, which should reflect all open and closed orders with explanations.  That is, the trader must indicate the reasons (what were the market conditions, promises), why he opened the deal, its result.  In addition, it is advisable to take screenshots and highlight the most important points of trading on them.  In the same journal it is necessary to note the profit / loss on transactions, reasons and analyze the records at least twice a week.  It is advisable to keep statistics not only in electronic form, but also write down in a special notebook or notebook. </li><li>  Daily rate of 10% of the deposit. </li><li>  During the momentum growth, no action is needed. </li><li>  You can trade only when the trader is in a psychologically balanced state.  It is impossible to make deals if something bothers or the trader is upset, annoyed with something.  It is also not recommended to trade when the speculator is in too high spirits.  During trading, the trader must be focused and focused. </li><li>  The main rule of the system is earning 40 points per day.  Once this goal is achieved, you need to stop trading. </li><li>  In the trading system "Sniper" you can use one, maximum two currency pairs.  This allows you to more accurately analyze market movements and correctly enter the market. </li><li>  For accuracy training, it is enough to open 3 deals a day. </li><li>  The strategy uses lot fixing.  When the market situation is favorable, you can open 2-3 positions.  For each transaction, the deposit deposit must be less than 1%. </li></ol><p>  This memo should be constantly in front of the eyes of the trader.  Compliance with all its points significantly increases the profitability of transactions and in some cases prevents or minimizes losses. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Strategy Terminology </h2><p>  Dmitriev in his strategy uses new terms that must be studied in order to understand the meaning of the Sniper trading system and a full description of the theoretical material provided. </p><p>  Levels of trading strategy "Sniper": </p><ol><li>  Maximum and minimum of the past day. </li><li>  Banking levels. </li><li>  Impulse levels. </li><li>  Total impulse levels. </li><li>  Levels of a sharp change in trend. </li></ol><p>  It is these concepts that underlie the strategy.  With their help, the trader builds blocks on the chart and determines the future market direction.  Levels are important elements of the entire trading system. </p><h2>  The previous day's high and low levels </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="trading system sniper x Russia" class="if uuid-3097689" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41139/3097689.jpg"></div><p>  Most traders use minimum and maximum values ‚Äã‚Äãor extremes in their strategies.  These can be indicators of candles, fractals and levels that line them up.  Dmitriev offers the following scheme of work: </p><ol><li>  Over the past trading day, you must note on the chart the maximum and minimum values ‚Äã‚Äãof the daily price and set the levels.  The easiest way is to use the rectangle tool in the terminal. </li><li>  As soon as the market price approaches the marked levels, you need to open a deal during the rollback or reversal of quotes. </li><li>  Stop-loss is set within 15-20 points. </li><li>  Take-profit is set according to the general rules of the trading strategy. </li></ol><p>  Typically, this entry point does not guarantee a large profit and is used in the system as additional information. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Banking levels (BU) </h2><p>  This is one of the main and important rules of the strategy.  Banking levels are used in it throughout its existence and are designated - BU.  Even after the latest additions to the Sniper 4 trading system, they remained unchanged. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="trading system sniper 3 2" class="if uuid-3097691" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41139/3097691.jpg"></div><p>  Dmitriev defines them as strong levels of support and resistance.  He explains this by the fact that all major market participants do not work through the usual "Forex" terminals, such as MetaTrader, but through banks.  Their main task is not a speculative transaction familiar to the trader, but the maintenance of the balance of supply and demand.  Large banks periodically make exchange transactions, for example, sell dollars and buy euros, and therefore it is very important for them to know the closing price of yesterday‚Äôs session.  Knowing this pattern, one can expect strong currency movements from this banking level. </p><p>  Building Rules: </p><ol><li>  Include a period separator on the chart. </li><li>  According to London time, set the level at 00:00: if the bullish candle closes on the timeframe H1, the line is drawn above, and if it is bearish, below. </li><li>  An important condition: the bank level only works the next day. </li></ol><p>  According to the terms of the trading strategy, this type of level is marked in green. </p><h2>  Impulse Levels (DUT) </h2><p>  No less important characteristics are possessed by pulse levels, denoted as DUT.  They are characterized by three signs: the price repels them several times;  this level must be broken through by impulse movement (its size is at least 6 points);  price fixing on this indicator. </p><p>  According to the terms of the trading strategy, as soon as the market price fixes at the impulse level, a point appears for opening a position.  You can work with these levels on any timeframes starting from M1 and ending with H4.  The most profitable are: M5 and M15. </p><h2>  Total Pulse Level (TIU) </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="trading system sniper instruction" class="if uuid-3097681" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41139/3097681.jpg"></div><p>  Dmitriev chose the abbreviation TIU for their designation.  They are divided into local and total levels.  Local ones are used on lower timeframes - M1 and M5, and on older ones, starting from M30 to H4, total levels are used.  They have no differences in construction and are determined by size. </p><p>  A sale transaction is carried out when the market price breaks the total impulse level at H1.  Then it is necessary to wait on the M5 timeframe for the false breaking of the total level up and enter the market at the first local impulse level. </p><p>  <em>Important!</em>  Quite often, newcomers make mistakes when, after breaking through the total impulse level on the H1 timeframe, they expect another false breakout on M5.  As a result, market quotes do not repeat the false breakout and unfold.  Many perceive such a movement as a buy signal, this is their mistake.  It is important to remember that the total impulse level must be broken only falsely, and only once.  Only under this condition can we get a reversal signal to open a position. </p><h2>  Levels of abrupt trend change (URST) </h2><p>  These levels have the abbreviation URST and are used in all variations of the Sniper trading system up to version 4.  They are also considered the basis of the strategy.  Levels of a sharp change in trend are the configurations of Japanese candles; quite often there are options for a ‚ÄúPin-bar‚Äù or ‚ÄúSpire‚Äù.  All of them consist of shadows, on which the market direction usually unfolds.  That is, these are reversal figures and, accordingly, levels.  Usually they are used to open positions in the opposite direction or to take profits on previously opened orders. </p><p>  The scheme of work with URST: </p><ol><li>  It is necessary to mark the place on the graph with a red rectangle where there is a sharp change in the trend of market movement. </li><li>  When the price approaches the level of a sharp change in trend, it is necessary to open a deal in the opposite direction of the current impulse in anticipation of a reversal of the market movement or its rollback. </li><li>  The Stop-Loss protective order is placed at a distance of 25 points from the opening of the order. </li><li>  The entry point needs to be analyzed on the M5 or M15 timeframes. </li></ol><h2>  Money Management: Safe Method </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.safeguardsafes.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="trading system sniper safe rule" class="if uuid-3097698" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41139/3097698.jpg"></div><p>  In Russia, the Sniper x trading system is a fairly well-known strategy for trading on the Forex.  Its highlight can be considered a unique profit-taking system or the "Safe Rule".  Dmitriev offered traders an original, simple and reliable solution to partial fixation of already initially received income. </p><p>  The "safe rules" are pretty simple.  By and large, they are very similar to the system of transferring a transaction to breakeven, but have their own distinctive features.  The rule is based on the laws of the financial market, which determine that all points of opening transactions on the "Forex" in 80% of cases allow you to earn 15-20 points.  That is, in whatever direction the price goes, but in any case, having reached a certain level, it will make a rebound of 15-20 points. </p><p>  According to the "Safe Rules" in Dmitriev‚Äôs system, you need to close part of the position, taking into account profit from a closed share.  Moreover, the closed part should cover the Stop-loss loss if the price goes in the opposite direction from the transaction.  As a result, using this technique, that is, by closing a certain percentage of the order share in a reliable "safe", in the future the position will occur in safe mode. </p><p>  To get more profit, Dmitriev offers to transfer the remainder of the order to breakeven as long as the market moves in the direction necessary for the trader.  Thus, you can earn a lot more profit and increase profit margins. </p><p>  The "Safe Rule" solves two problems at once: </p><ol><li>  With a favorable outcome, it allows you to initially take profits and earn even more in the future when transferring an order to breakeven. </li><li>  In cases where the market price is against the trader, exit the transaction without loss, since the ‚Äúsafe‚Äù will securely record profit partially, and if the remainder of the order is closed by ‚ÄúStop-loss‚Äù, then the profit will be equal to losses and, as a result, the trader will not lose money. </li></ol><h2>  Trading system Dmitrieva "Sniper 3.2" </h2><p>  As a result of various additions and new improvements that the author of the strategy periodically did, the system received some changes.  First of all, they touched the levels.  The trading system "Sniper 3.2", as well as further versions exclude two types of levels: the maximum and minimum of the previous day and the bank level (BU).  Particular attention in the 2nd and 3rd version is paid to the acceleration of the deposit.  In the first version of the trading system, the author pays attention to the "Safe Rule".  But already in the second version, he offers a secure solution for Money Management. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="trading system sniper Dmitrieva" class="if uuid-3097673" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41139/3097673.jpg"></div><p>  As well as in <span>overclocking a deposit</span> , previously opened profitable transactions are used.  Overclocking is as follows: </p><ol><li>  The trader must have an open profit order. </li><li>  The entry point is analyzed at the URST or TIU levels. </li><li>  The transaction is opened in the opposite direction on the rollback.  The result is a positively open "lock".  Now, no matter what direction the market goes, the trader will make a profit. </li></ol><p>  Usually the opposite trade opens with a small profit. </p><p>  All new corrections and materials on the Sniper 3.2 trading system, as well as newer versions, have been studied and approved by professionals.  Indeed, improvements improved the trading system and made it safer to work in the financial market.  It is also worth noting that new elements have been added to the Sniper 3.2 trading system: </p><ol><li>  Pivot level 3 (Dmitriev added this element of the strategy from the second version of Sniper). </li><li>  Modified reversal zone (residual past trend). </li><li>  Retest (often a zone with spiers, repeated reversal patterns). </li><li>  Re-entry (taking profits of large players, their re-entry into the market, opening new positions). </li></ol><p>  In the third version of the "Base" there are two levels left: "Total Impulse Level" and "Level of Abrupt Change of Trend", as well as "Safe Rules". </p><h2>  Reviews of traders about the trading system </h2><div class="photo" data-original="msl-ltd.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="reviews of the trading system sniper" class="if uuid-3097702" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41139/3097702.jpg"></div><p>  Traders with various experience and experience in Forex trading participate in the discussion of the Sniper x trading system.  As always, opinions are divided, but by and large, traders respond positively to this strategy. </p><p>  Many believe that Dmitriev found a rather successful solution with the "Safe Rule", which, in principle, became famous for the technique.  According to reviews of the Sniper trading system, the strategy has good profitability indicators.  And also traders note: to trade on this system, it will take time to study it.  Therefore, beginners who want to use this technique in their work should be patient and pre-trained on a demo account. </p>
