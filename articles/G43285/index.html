This hotel complex was built in 2006.  This resort specializes in economy class hotel.  Vacationers notice a paradox in his appearance.  Outwardly, hotel buildings, structures and territory look impeccable, however, with a closer look at certain aspects (for example, the number of rooms), wear becomes noticeable.

    <h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  Its housing stock consists of fourteen three-story residential buildings.  The buildings are located in a circle.  In the middle of the space enclosed by them is an aquapark and a children's pool.  Such architecture of the Regency Plaza Aqua Park Spa 5 hotel is initially convenient for those who came to relax with children. </p><p>  The area is ideal for walking.  It is large - 170 thousand m <sup>2</sup> , and is constantly maintained in an exemplary manner. </p><p>  The local landscape design is quite sophisticated.  These are artificially created blue rivers, as well as a waterfall furnished with artistic taste.  Classical lawns are harmoniously decorated with palm trees, exotic plants, geometrically trimmed toparia.  Marble paths are perfectly smooth.  For them, roller-skating for vacationers is a pleasure.  Hotel Regency Plaza Aqua Park large - 700 rooms. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the evenings, his guests stroll along a rather dull street called La Strada, which is quite suitable for this. </p><h2>  The hotel is simultaneously five-star and budget.  Contradiction? </h2><p>  After analyzing the numerous reviews of tourists, we identified the main motives for their visit to this hotel complex. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="regency plaza aqua park spa 5" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/709894.jpg" width="600"></div><br>  This is the affordability of buying tours and their affordable prices.  Many bona fide travel agencies immediately orient their customers, so that they would initially consider a vacation in it (despite five stars) as budget.  The fairness of the above is indicated by tariffs.  In particular, current tours lasting 8 days and seven nights per person (including flight, insurance, accommodation and transfer) cost $ 603.

    <p>  Thus, the price in the offseason is less than $ 100 per day.  Such tempting rates make the hotel more than affordable for residents of Russia and the countries of the former CIS.  In fact, he works in this segment.  Is this good for the hotel itself?  Yes and no. </p><p>  On the one hand, he makes a profit in an extensive way.  After all, it is large, and even $ 100 per day per person, due <span>to the economies of scale,</span> form certain financial flows.  However, as we see, these finances are still not enough for either a total overhaul or modernization. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For the hotel itself, its location in an economy niche is fraught with some risks.  Criteria of service are gradually being lowered - at first the number of rooms (which we are already observing today), then the assortment of dishes is reduced, which means that the qualifications of cooks are also reduced.  All this is due objectively. </p><p>  This contributes to budget <span>pricing.</span>  Indeed, how to serve a 5-star person who pays less than $ 100 per day for a vacation?  We believe that the task formulated in this way is ‚Äútrick 22‚Äù.  Simply put, it is initially impracticable.  Therefore, it should be recognized that the current hotel staff, despite objectively unavoidable shortcomings, still deserves respect and gratitude from the guests. </p><p>  Look at reviews of vacationers.  Some of them contain criticism, mainly regarding signs of wear of furniture, linen, and the ‚Äúfive-star‚Äù menu of the main restaurant.  At the same time, the water park and the territory are highly appreciated. </p><p>  It is obvious, however, that eight years ago it still met the highest criteria of the hotel business.  Now it is evaluated on a five-point scale to four with a minus.  And yet - there are few foreigners there.  And this is an indicator of the class. </p><p>  Of course, the hotel complex has advantages.  In particular, it has a good family vacation, a good water park, food is normally supplied (in any case, no one mentions poisoning).  According to many customers, the repair that the Regency Plaza Aqua Park Spa 5 * hotel underwent in 2013 is insufficient.  Guest reviews are full of wishes for a larger overhaul with the replacement of worn furniture. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The length of the beach strip is 270 m, the width is 50 m. Now about the entrance to the water on the beach of the Regency Plaza Aqua Park Spa 5 hotel (Sharm El Sheikh).  Nabq Bay, a bay of the Red Sea, has a very gentle entrance and a sandy bottom.  From the shore, the swimmer will have to overcome 300 meters, where the depth is knee-deep. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="regency plaza aqua park spa 5 reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/709896.jpg" width="600"></div>
      <br>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Therefore, the entrance to the water is facilitated by the presence of a special pontoon 250 meters long.  Pontoon is essentially a floating bridge, which is really convenient to go over to the bathing place.  It is characteristic that in the end its depth does not begin immediately, as is often the case at such facilities, but gradually. </p><p>  We also note that the sand present on the beach is neither golden nor white.  It is grayish in color and rather large.  This is the natural cover of Nabq Bay.  Is the use of imported sand on the hotel beach justified in the future?  Vacationers answer this question positively.  Sun beds and umbrellas on the shore and at the pools (water parks) are present in sufficient quantities. </p><p>  By the way, the corals themselves in the waters of the Regency Plaza Aqua Park Spa 5 * beach are not there at all, however, this is offset by the presence of beautiful fish.  Also (fortunately) there are no sea urchins.  Generally speaking, Nabq Bay is famous for exotic lagoons, there are practically no reefs here.  Therefore, often this hotel is chosen by families with small children.  Snorkeling (snorkelling enthusiasts) such a hotel complex is not particularly interesting from the beginning, for them the reef kingdom of Naama Bay will be much more attractive. </p><p>  However, perseverance of searches is always rewarded: to the left of the Regency Plaza Aqua Park Spa hotel beach is an abandoned pontoon.  Having gone there, you can find a rather interesting "fish kingdom" and take some good pictures. </p><p>  Towels, sun loungers, umbrellas, air mattresses are free of charge for hotel guests on the beach.  At night, the guard ensures that vacationers do not swim. </p><p>  There is a bar on the beach, and you can even grab a bite to eat with french fries and hot dogs. </p><p>  In general, guests rate the beach of the hotel on the "top three".  The main reason - it‚Äôs inconvenient to get to a normal depth on a pontoon.  Obviously, you should look for ways, "how to make lemonade out of lemon." </p><h2>  Recommendations to the hotel: how to make the beach "five-star" </h2><p>  What to do when the nature when arranging the beach clearly "let us down"?  However, we ask ourselves whether it is possible to make the hotel beach more attractive.  Alternatively, the solution should be sought in the use of modern pontoon systems.  Hotel guests should be comfortable and interested. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="regency plaza aqua park spa" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/709902.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The original structure of this structure suggests itself, which, in addition to floating bridges, also has platforms for relaxing on the water, floating bars and restaurants.  And the width of the pontoon itself matters! </p><p>  Indeed, not every tourist is pleased to walk a few hundred meters along a narrow path, while still warming up with those who are coming forward or letting people try to overtake. </p><p>  Obviously, to implement this project, it is worth attracting real specialists with experience in the construction of entire pontoon islands, sports water facilities.  In a word, the question of raising the rating of the hotel beach remains open. </p><h2>  Pools </h2><p>  Extensive water management - 4 outdoor pools of Regency Plaza Aqua Park (one of which is heated in winter), as well as adult and children's hotel water parks, which are mentioned by the name of the hotel, are its <span>visiting card.</span>  In total, there are four gorgeous <span>water slides</span> in the water park <span>.</span>  One of them is abrupt, it is designed for adults and adolescents.  There are also special slides for children in the water park.  Especially popular among visitors is a swimming pool with hydromassage and a bar. </p><p>  Pools and water parks are maintained (as well as the territory) in exemplary condition.  Children's heated up to a temperature of 36 <sup>0</sup> C. Adult pools are both heated, designed just for swimming, and sports, in which water is not heated. </p><p>  According to reviews, the infrastructure of the pools and water parks of Regency Plaza Aqua Park Spa 5 * really admires outdoor enthusiasts.  Photos of happy children and adults - the best assessment of the efforts of staff! </p><p>  At the same time, employees unobtrusively ensure that simple rules are respected: </p><ul><li>  holidaymakers filmed jewelry and rings; </li><li>  children who do not know how to swim were equipped with special vests and arm ruffles. </li></ul><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  In addition to a spa holiday, its guests also provide related, auxiliary services of Regency Plaza Aqua Park Spa 5 *.  Sharm el Sheikh (reviews of vacationers demonstrate this), thanks to the many such hotel services, it is a tourist-friendly resort, cozy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="regency plaza aqua park spa 5 sharm el sheikh reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/709909.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the Regency Plaza Hotel itself, various services are offered around the clock: reception, currency exchange, dry cleaning and laundry, hairdresser, parking, first-aid post, mask and fins rental, car rental.  A fifteen minute walk from the hotel is the Metro supermarket. </p><p>  The hotel has a spa center.  There is a souvenir shop and a shop of oriental oils.  On the territory there are two hookahs.  One of them is located above the artificial grotto.  The second is near the beach. </p><h2>  Room furnishings </h2><p>  Rooms Regency Plaza Aqua Park Spa 5 * were furnished more than five years ago.  The furniture is modern.  There is a balcony.  The bathroom is equipped with a shower.  Comfortable double bed, spacious wardrobe, free safe.  From the equipment in the rooms there is a functional LCD TV, refrigerator, telephone. </p><p>  However, there are also disadvantages that are mentioned by guests of the Regency Plaza Aqua Park Spa 5 *.  Reviews indicate that linen, towels and bedding are washed.  Honestly, they should have been changed a long time ago.  In addition, they probably save on detergents: the laundry does not smell like the freshness that modern powders and gels give. </p><p>  There are no complaints about the quality of cleaning in the rooms.  It is carried out daily and seriously.  Fans of aesthetics periodically leave 1-2 Egyptian pounds, and swans, fish, etc. are laid out from a towel to them. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Meals in the main restaurant (there are 12 in all) are organized as standard for the resort facilities of Sharm el-Sheikh.  Hotel guests have breakfast from <sup>7:00</sup> to <sup>10:00</sup> , lunch from <sup>13:00</sup> to <sup>15:00</sup> , and dinner from <sup>19:00</sup> to <sup>22:00</sup> .  Guests of the Regency Plaza Aqua Park hotel in their reviews most often characterize breakfast as light.  The morning menu contains beans, rice, cheese, sausages, eggs, fresh vegetable salads, biscuits, rolls, waffles, pancakes, honey, dates, coffee, tea, yoghurts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="regency plaza aqua park spa 5 charm el sheikh nabq bay" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/709914.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  For lunch, the main dishes are prepared from beef, chicken, fish, and liver.  Periodically, there are squids on the menu.  Also, many vacationers praise soups - really tasty and rich.  Various side dishes - vegetable, french fries, baked potatoes in a peel, lasagna, pasta.  There is a choice of salads.  From fruits: melons, bananas, guava.  Watermelons on the menu are less common. </p><p>  For dinner, Regency Plaza Aqua Park guests are offered more assortment than for lunch.  There is a limitation: alcohol - outside the buffet, they are served by waiters.  The wine is local. </p><p>  However, vacationers have wishes.  No complaints, namely wishes to the chefs and administrators of the Regency Plaza Aqua Park <span>Spa 5 *</span> hotel (Sharm El Sheikh).  These reviews relate to the inconsistency of the status of "five stars" and the assortment of the menu.  According to the variety of dishes in each category of the menu, food (tourists do not deny its quality) still draws on good four stars, but not five, that's for sure. </p><p>  Obviously, here too, the organizers need to revise the concept.  Or you should honestly lower the category of the hotel to four stars, then everything will fall into place. </p><p>  Restaurants √† la carte Regency Plaza Aqua Park Spa 5 * (Sharm El Sheikh) serve customers for free.  Hotel guests speak well of <span>the Italian</span> restaurant Camello International, as well as the Oriental and Egyptian cuisine restaurant Falafel Oriental. </p><p>  The exception is a seafood restaurant.  There gourmet menus are selected according to various price categories.  However, alcoholic beverages in them are paid. </p><h2>  Leisure </h2><p>  The hotel has a Turkish bath, Russian bath, sauna.  Beach volleyball competitions take place regularly.  Also, free of charge, guests train in the gym, play table tennis, darts, mini-golf. </p><p>  However, some vacationers still prefer paid sports entertainment.  Classes are held by qualified trainers.  Here, fascinating horse riding lessons are organized. </p><p>  The Regency Plaza Aqua Park Spa 5 * hotel has a diving center.  It employs instructors capable of both teaching beginners and upgrading the skills of more experienced divers.  They are quite friendly and understand Russian well.  After all, the main contingent of holidaymakers in the hotel complex is Russian-speaking. </p><p>  At the disposal of the diving school there are boats, scuba gear are available for rent.  Diving classes are available for guests from among the guests.  Successful ones are issued certificates corresponding to their skills.  The most interesting for those involved in this school day trips to the sea for diving. </p><p>  Amateur divers always return with such voyages with photographs and new experiences.  Between exits to the sea, they, as a rule, rest on the territory of the hotel itself in the water park.  The sea for them is not a beach, but a lively interesting world.  This is a good vacation option. </p><p>  Qualified trainers from Regency Plaza Aqua Park Spa 5 * also conduct yoga classes with tourists.  The feedback from those involved with them is also positive: after a few lessons, the effect is felt.  With the setting of breathing and the acquisition of certain skills in yoga, hotel guests (especially middle-aged people) note an improvement in well-being. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Guests of the Regency Plaza Aqua Park S hotel, according to reviews, most often buy excursions such as: </p><ul><li>  Cairo with a visit to the pyramids of Giza, as well as the Cairo National Museum; </li><li>  Jerusalem with a visit to the temples of the <span>Nativity of Christ, the</span> Holy Sepulcher, the Wailing Wall, the coast of the Dead Sea; </li><li>  Jordan with a visit to the ancient city of Petra, the capital of the Nabatean kingdom; </li><li>  a visit to the Valley of the Kings in Luxor; </li><li>  Monastery of St. Catherine and the city of Dahab. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="regency plaza aqua park spa 5 sharm el sheikh" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/709916.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><p>  However, more often than the aforementioned expensive and fairly long excursions, guests of Regency Plaza Aqua Park SP choose voyages easier: </p><ul><li>  excursion to the Bedouins; </li><li>  ATV excursion; </li><li>  excursion in a special boat with a transparent bottom; </li><li>  jeep safari; </li><li>  camel safari. </li></ul><h2>  Animation </h2><p>  The animators at the Regency Plaza Aqua Park Spa work both on site and on the beach.  They attract vacationers to competitions in water polo, beach basketball.  Classes are held with vacationers in water and regular aerobics.  Every night at 22 <sup>00</sup> - 23 <sup>00 the</sup> forces of animators and invited artists organize a night show, which then goes to a disco. </p><p>  Do not forget here about the smallest.  There is a mini club for children at the hotel.  Animators at the Regency Plaza Aqua Park Resort entertain them using the hotel's children's infrastructure.  Especially for children equipped with children's water slides.  At the club, kids have the opportunity to use the children's buffet.  The feedback from parents about the animators who really know how to organize and captivate their children with the game is positive.  The club operates an amateur children's theater. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p> To summarize our story about the Regency Plaza Aqua Park hotel, we note that we would like to show it precisely by guest reviews.  We tried to bring more realism to our story.  After all, I do not want to offend the hotel complex staff, who are really trying to present the resort institution to their guests from the best side. </p><p>  However, despite the five-star status, despite the exemplary water park and pools, in addition to the lovingly manicured territory, some flaws in the management of the Regency Plaza Aqua Park hotel are striking.  Customer reviews clearly record this. </p><p>  Even if you do not resort to sophisticated assessment methods, but only rely on customer reviews, you can notice that a significant proportion of them on a five-point scale evaluates the services of a hotel complex by three points.  The reason for the low ratings, most likely, is the insufficient level of repairs carried out in 2013. </p><p>  Yes, the hotel industry is huge.  However, in addition to perfecting the territory and economy of the water park, one should also find funds for other investments, for example: </p><ul><li>  complete replacement of furniture in rooms with signs of wear; </li><li>  replacing medium-level plumbing with ‚Äúfashionable‚Äù; </li><li>  capital investments in the main restaurant to increase its productivity (the assortment of dishes will finally correspond to five stars); </li><li>  capital investments in the beach, because there are complaints of holidaymakers about 300 meters of ‚Äúsmall fry‚Äù, and something needs to compensate for the vicissitudes of nature, for example, to improve the pontoon economy; </li><li>  Introduce strict criteria for the uniforms of staff (uniform, always perfectly clean and ironed). </li><li>  introduce practice at the earlier stages of wear of bed linen and towels in the rooms to carry out their replacement. </li></ul><p>  Nevertheless, we are confident that it has the potential for its further development of the Regency Plaza Aqua Park Spa 5 * (Sharm El Sheikh).  Nabq Bay, a sandy bottom bay, also has an undisclosed resort potential. </p>
