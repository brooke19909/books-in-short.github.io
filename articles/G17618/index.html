  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Chertovitsky beach of Voronezh: what to be prepared for and how to get</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Voronezh region is famous for a large number of rivers and lakes.  The <span>Voronezh River</span> flows through the whole city <span>,</span> from which they made a reservoir, damming the once beautiful and clean channel. </p><p>  However, there are places in the region where the river of the same name has retained its original appearance.  Locals got a beautiful beach, where you can spend time not only for family people, but also for youth, who still have a strong thirst for fun. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.shutterstock.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="friends on the beach" class="if uuid-2341586" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73489/2341586.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The beach can be reached by bus from the central <span>bus station of Voronezh.</span>  Ticket price is approximately 50 rubles.  There are approximately 2 flights per hour, but this information should be promptly clarified. </p><p>  Getting to the car is even easier.  You should move along Moskovsky Prospekt and then turn onto Rostov.  After a few kilometers there will be a sign "Chertovitskoe".  Turning on the right side of the highway, you need to move along the main road, following the signs "Chertovitsky beach. Voronezh".  How to get there you can also check with the many beach people moving in the direction of the river. </p><h2>  Where to park </h2><p>  Chertovitsky <span>beach of Voronezh</span> is located within the water protection zone.  This means that access to it by car is prohibited.  But there will always be enterprising people who will solve this problem. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the entrance, paid parking will begin to appear.  The closer to the beach, the more expensive.  Directly at the place of rest there is the most extensive parking, leaving the car on it, you can head to the river already in a swimsuit. </p><p>  The cost is formed regardless of the time spent in the parking lot, and payment is only for entry.  Prices are constantly changing, but on average they range from 200 to 350 rubles per entry of a car. </p><h2>  Leisure facilities </h2><p>  Locals, of course, are accustomed to wild rest by the river.  However, the Chertovitsky beach of Voronezh is a real southern vacation in central Russia. </p><p>  A whole complex has been built by the river, which provides entertainment for every taste. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.summer-camps.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beach volleyball" class="if uuid-2341577" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73489/2341577.jpg"></div><p>  On the beach, you can eat several kinds of ice cream, drink kvass or something stronger.  You can even have a tight lunch with meat at completely different prices.  In barbecue tents, pork, beef and even lamb can be fried. </p><p>  For youth, foam parties are regularly held in the summer.  DJ plays provocative music, and the mass of events is amazing.  On the damn beach of Voronezh, there are places for lovers of an active lifestyle to have fun.  You can always join a company that throws frisbee or throws the ball.  There is also a volleyball net on the beach, so even a lonely leisure lover will find company. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Sport is a separate feature of the beach.  Along the river, people play badminton, beach tennis and even do crossfit.  Guests of the complex entertain themselves as they can. </p><p>  For those who are afraid to sunbathe, special umbrellas are installed on the beach.  However, lovers of comfort will have to endure the absence of any sun loungers.  Therefore, you need to think about taking a cover with you. </p><h2>  What to fear </h2><p>  A photo of the Chertovitsky beach in Voronezh will not show the pitfalls that await the inattentive guest. </p><p>  Firstly, it is worth remembering that some drinks tend to deteriorate from exposure to the sun.  Even a slight aroma of acid from purchased kvass is a serious reason to refuse treats.  There are cases when people spent fascinating days in the infectious ward without taking proper care. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Voronezh river" class="if uuid-2341092" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73489/2341092.jpg"></div><p>  Secondly, the Voronezh River is a fresh water reservoir.  This is far from the salty Dead Sea, where all bacteria die.  If you decide to swim, then control the process.  Water should not enter your mouth or nose.  Otherwise, you risk your health.  No less carefully you need to monitor the bathing of children. </p><p>  Thirdly, there are no lifeguards on the beach, and the river reaches quite serious depth in some places.  Therefore, it is necessary to adequately perceive the capabilities of your body and your own fitness. </p><p>  Soul on the beach, by the way, is not there either.  Therefore, it is important to remember about removable underwear and the need to wash off river water in the near future. </p><p>  Thus, Chertovitsky beach is a pleasant place, not far from Voronezh.  It will be interesting for both adults with children and youth. </p>
