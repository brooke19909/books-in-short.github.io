    <p>  Of course, until the construction is completed, the first tenants will experience a number of inconveniences.  But as soon as all buildings and infrastructure facilities are put into operation, each inhabitant will be provided with maximum comfort and the necessary safety. </p><h2>  Concept </h2><p>  Nine sectors of micro-districts, rebuilding around a large business center, united by recreational territory and common infrastructure - all this is included in the project.  The layout of the new residential neighborhood involves large-scale landscaping and landscaping to create the most favorable living environment for the environment, providing excellent health to all residents.  The design is based on natural landscapes, which allows you to save them in their original form, adding only a few touches. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The address of the micro-district "Snail" (Belgorod) is Belgorod district, the village of Dubovoe.  A plot of about 144 hectares located in the north-west of the village of Dubovoy was allocated for the construction of a new residential neighborhood.  This is the area on the west side of the busy Belgorod - Nikolskoye highway.  The ecologically clean southern part of Belgorod is being built up - ideal for a comfortable life. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Technology </h2><p>  The developer of the Ulitka microdistrict (Belgorod) uses a monolithic-frame technology with a filler in the form of cellular concrete for the construction of residential buildings.  The thickness of the concrete walls reaches 100 mm, which is quite enough to endow the house with the necessary heat and sound insulation properties.  The external facades of residential buildings are decorated with granite, providing sophistication, even luxury.  Each apartment has plastic windows with single-chamber double-glazed windows of European manufacture, balconies and loggias are also glazed. </p><p>  Five- and seven-story houses are equipped with a high-speed silent elevator with a carrying capacity of 630 kg.  Natural ventilation in the apartments is ensured by modern exhaust ventilation units installed in the kitchen and in the bathroom.  The first residents of the neighborhood note that the blocks do a great job with the ventilation of the room and the elimination of unpleasant odors. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The most powerful infrastructure of the Ulitka microdistrict (Belgorod) is its distinctive feature and that advantage, which is simply impossible to keep quiet.  The project provides for the construction in the territory of not only kindergartens, schools, but also a medical complex, shopping and entertainment centers.  The first floors of some residential buildings will be reserved for the organization of the service sector: bank branches, shops, cafes and restaurants will appear here. </p>

    <h2>  Beautification </h2><p>  Large-scale work on the improvement and gardening of the microdistrict is what all residents note.  Rare species of plants and trees will be planted here, excellent walking areas and relaxation areas with arbors and shady alleys will appear.  In addition, it is planned to equip modern playgrounds and sports grounds. </p><h2>  Apartments, layouts </h2><p>  The apartments of the Ulitka microdistrict (Belgorod) turned out to be extremely spacious, bright, and distinguished by thoughtful layouts.  Spacious kitchens, isolated rooms, a separate bathroom, a wardrobe for storing things, a balcony - this is what all customers will receive.  The developer in his desire to take into account the requirements and wishes of modern residents as much as possible tried to create apartments in which every square meter of space will be involved.  And judging by the reviews of the first tenants, he succeeded. </p>
