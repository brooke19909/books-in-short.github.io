The abundance of park areas and green squares smooths the overall impression of industrial facilities and strict business centers.  And if we talk about the oases of the city, then one of the most comfortable among them is Strukovsky Park.  Samara also boasts more well-groomed public gardens or areas with an abundance of attractions, but it is here that a special atmosphere is felt thanks to which one wants to return to this place again and again. </p><h2>  The foundation of the Strukovsky garden </h2>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Strukovsky park Samara" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/1023967.jpg"></div>  At the beginning of the nineteenth century there was a dense forest on the site of a well-maintained park.  These lands belonged to Grigory Strukov, who at that time was the current state adviser and manager of the Iletsk salt industry.  In a picturesque place on the banks of the Volga was built a manor and a garden.  Difficulties began in 1828, salt management was moved to Sol-Iletsk, Strukov's property was left without proper maintenance and care, and after another 20 years it began to be sold.  Chic garden bought for a symbolic amount D.E.  Obukhov is the current titular adviser, and then transferred it to the city.  At that time, Strukovsky Park (Samara) was separated from the embankment by residential and household buildings.  However, later this territory was annexed to the recreation area and landscaped accordingly.  By the beginning of the twentieth century, the park was landscaped, it contained one of the best restaurants in the city, the most distinguished and wealthy residents of Samara walked along the landscaped alleys, there was also a grotto, concert venue, shopping pavilions, benches and gazebos for recreation.

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Strukovsky park in Samara" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/1023970.jpg"></div>  In Soviet times, the Strukovsky Park in Samara was renamed the Park of Culture and Rest named after  Maxim Gorky.  One of the signs with this name has survived to the present day.  Today, the recreation area has returned its historical name, however, many residents of Samara prefer to name it in honor of the great writer.  Under Soviet rule, the park remained a favorite vacation spot for residents and visitors.  Fountains were working properly here, flower beds were full of bright colors, and even a swimming pool and dance floor were built.  At different times, attractions were also installed in the park, but for some reason a dedicated entertainment zone did not appear.  The total garden area is about 11 hectares.  Today, the park operates year-round and is popular with citizens.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This place is unlikely to appeal to those who like to ride on carousels and extreme attractions.  The park is a truly green zone, where silence and peace reign more often.  This is a favorite place for people who want to relax from the hustle and bustle of the city, young parents with children and athletes.  The main wealth of the recreation area is alleys with landscaped paths, and the main decorations are babbling fountains, various sculptures and flower beds.  It is pleasant to organize a picnic in this place, to ride bicycles in the summer, and in the winter - to ski, or just walk alone or with a group of nice people. </p><h2>  The main attractions </h2>

    <p>  One of the most interesting objects in the recreation area is a fountain located near the central entrance to the park with a sculpture of children under an umbrella.  It bears the romantic name "Boy and Girl", built in the 1930s.  In the USSR period, as already mentioned, the recreation area was called Park of Culture and Rest named after  Maxim Gorky.  Despite the change of name, the original monument to the great writer still stands here, also not far from the main entrance.  An unusual attraction of the park is a stone grotto; on its top there is a gilded sculpture of a goat.  Minor changes in the appearance of the Strukovsky garden occur annually, not so long ago there appeared green sculptures of Moomin-Troll and chess pieces.  For each warm season in the park there are new flower beds, benches and gazebos. </p><h2>  Recreation Area Entertainment </h2><p>  Strukovsky Park (Samara) is best for walking and playing sports.  There are no major attractions here, but from time to time in the recreation area mobile amusement parks stop.  There are playgrounds.  And the real pride of the park is the platform for skaters.  In the summer, various stalls operate on the territory, where you can buy soft drinks, ice cream, various prepared snacks and instant dishes.  Souvenirs and children's toys are also sold in the park.  There is also a summer scene in the Strukovsky Garden today, on weekends and holidays there are various concerts, dance evenings, festivals.  Keep track of posters and advertisements in regional newspapers, and you will not miss a single interesting event. </p><h2>  Strukovsky Park (Samara): how to get there by public and private transport? </h2>

    <p>  One of the park's newest and most unusual sights is the time capsule left by Samara reporters for posterity.  The estimated date of the autopsy is 2057, the place where this artifact was buried today stands for the corresponding memorial plate.  What is especially pleasing, anyone can visit this place, pleasant for walking and relaxing, Strukovsky Park (Samara) for free.  The history of the garden includes periods of its heyday and decline, but invariably at all times it remained the beloved green zone of the townspeople.  The rules for visiting the park include prohibitions on dog walking, drinking alcohol and smoking, damage to property.  Visitors to the recreation area can take their own drinks and snacks with them for a walk, or purchase them at local cafes and stalls.  Any actions that violate the laws of the Russian Federation and interfere with the rest of others are prohibited in the park.  There is also a penalty for garbage disposal in areas not intended for this.  Each visitor to the garden should understand that it depends on his behavior what tomorrow Strukovsky park will be like.  Samara is a modern city, and each of its residents and guests should have a civic consciousness and be careful about the surrounding nature and places for recreation. </p>
