This article will be of interest to those who use such a convenient device for the first time in their life.  The biggest difficulty arises when trying to thread the thread.  If there are no special problems with the upper thread, then you will have to tinker a bit with the lower thread.  So how to fill up a sewing machine? </p><h2>  Upper Threading Technology </h2><p>  It is with this part of the work that no difficulties should appear.  You can insert the thread correctly, just guided by intuition.  In addition, most cars have a schematic illustration of this process on the body. </p><div class="photo" data-original="stitchnerd.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to thread a sewing machine" class="if uuid-2439818" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2439818.jpg"></div><p>  To properly fill the sewing machine, it is recommended that you follow these instructions: </p><ol><li>  Thread from the spool should be drawn through the mount on the body. </li><li>  Then there is a refueling in a special regulator, which carries out the tension of the threads, and then the thread must be brought into a compensation spring similar to a hook. </li><li>  The next step is screwing into the yarn guide, and after it the end must be drawn through several fasteners before it can be pulled into the eye of the needle. </li><li>  The thread should be directed from the side where there is a recess or groove running along the needle (any of these elements can easily be felt by the fingers). </li></ol><p>  To understand how to properly fill the sewing machine, you need to know that some models are equipped with a fork that acts as a thread guide.  In this case, you just need to put the thread on it without passing through the hole.  However, this type of machine can be found quite rarely. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to thread the bobbin thread </h2><p>  Before you start refueling, you need to understand a little about where the thread should be refueled and where it will be located. </p><p>  Unlike the upper thread, the lower one is wound on a bobbin, and not on a familiar bobbin.  There is a special cap for this part where the bobbin is to be inserted.  The thread is threaded under the spring plate. </p><p>  The cap carries out a certain thread tension, depending on the model of the sewing machine. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikihow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to fill up a sewing machine" class="if uuid-2439823" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2439823.jpg"></div><h2>  Proper bobbin threading </h2><p>  Now it's time to talk about how to <span>thread a sewing machine,</span> namely the bobbin thread. </p><p>  Here you need to remove an additional table from the machine by moving it to the left.  The shuttle plate is initially removed.  To raise the needle to the upper position, turn the handwheel.  To remove the bobbin mechanism, you need to gently pull on the edge and then remove the bobbin. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to fill the sewing machine" class="if uuid-2439821" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2439821.jpg"></div><p>  When refueling the sewing machine, the thread is wound around the bobbin by fixing the spool on the upper peg and connecting it to the thread holder in a crosswise position.  At this point, its edge should go to the flywheel.  The bobbin is mounted on the second pin, the thread is attached, several times wrapping around the case.  Then, by depressing the pedal or rotating the handwheel, the bobbin is refueled. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to install a bobbin </h2><p>  To understand how to properly fill the sewing machine, you need to know this little thing.  The thread should be unwound only clockwise, the end is threaded into the bobbin mechanism through a special hole.  All that remains is to return the part to the shuttle and transfer the tongue to the position in which it was previously, that is, simply lower it.  This position fixes the mechanism motionless. </p><p>  After refueling is carried out, the mechanism must be installed in the lower part of the machine, observing the instructions attached to the unit. </p><h2>  What you need to know about thread tension </h2><p>  It will be useful to get acquainted with this part of the article before proceeding directly to work.  Having figured out how to refill the sewing machine, it is worth talking about thread tension. </p><p>  The tension is adjusted using a special bolt located on the bobbin case by rotating it. </p><p>  When unscrewing the bolt, it is recommended to remember: to avoid breakage, it is not unscrewed by more than half a turn. </p><p>  The tension itself needs to be adjusted based on the density of the material for sewing, its structure and the tension of the upper thread. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.brother-usa.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to thread a sewing machine" class="if uuid-2439820" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2439820.jpg"></div><h2>  What you need to know about caring for a sewing machine </h2><p>  Like any other mechanism, the machine needs some care, which extends the life of the machine.  There is nothing complicated here: </p><ul><li>  Lubrication of internal parts is carried out systematically using a special oil, it is recommended that this procedure be done once every six months. </li><li>  Threads and needles are selected depending on the type of fabric. </li><li>  Internal parts should be regularly cleaned with a special brush. </li><li>  If carried out by sewing fur, woolen or knitwear, then all the above steps should be carried out more often. </li></ul>
