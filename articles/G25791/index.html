    <p>  In what year Columbus discovered America, now, probably, not everyone will remember, but the fact that he did it is known to any, even slightly educated person. </p><p>  In the distant 1492, October 12, carefully, so as not to run into the reef, the ships approached the new land.  They anchored, prepared everything that was necessary, and the very next day <span>Christopher Columbus,</span> as well as the leaders of the expedition represented by Rodrigo Sanchez, authorized crown inspector, notary Rodrigo de Escoved, Juan de la Cos, and the Pinson brothers, went ashore.  That's how Columbus discovered America. </p><p>  On behalf of the king and the queen and on their behalf, he immediately became the owner of the territory he had discovered.  Immediately drew up a notarial deed, not forgetting about any formalities.  It becomes clear why the inspectors of the crown and notary were included in the expedition.  After that, the navigator was promoted to Viceroy, because after Columbus discovered America, he acquired his own vast territory.  Having hoisted the Castilian flag on the coastal land, the expedition set off to inspect the territory.  And after some time they met the locals. </p>

    <p>  It is worth noting that so far no exact description of the place where the expedition landed has been found.  Therefore, it is not known which of the <span>Bahamas</span> became the landing site when Christopher Columbus discovered America.  It is known that the name that Columbus gave to this island is San Salvador (translated "salvation"). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After several days of talking with the natives, Columbus suspected that this place was not what they were looking for.  The islanders did not own the processing of metals, they simply did not know them.  Wheel technology was also unknown to them.  Aboriginal language had nothing to do with any of the eastern dialects.  But at first it did not bother the navigator.  They were supposed to go to an island very distant from the mainland.  But the only thing that worried Columbus was that the island had absolutely no spices, in fact, like gold. </p><p>  15 days after landing on the island, the expedition approached Cuba.  But even here no palaces, no spices, no khan's headquarters were found.  Gold was also not found.  Assuming that they are now in one of the poor <span>provinces of China, the</span> researchers decided to move east.  There, where, according to Columbus, there was a richest country - Sipangu, which is known to modern people as Japan. </p><p>  On November 20, one of the ships of the expedition, the Pint, disappeared.  He just lost sight.  According to one version, the captain of the Pint, who was also the second person on the expedition, driven by a sense of profit, decided to get to gold first. </p><p>  Columbus continued to discover new lands.  On the sixth of December, the <span>island of Haiti</span> was discovered <span>,</span> which was named Hispaniola.  It is worth noting that in translation this means "little Spain", and the island itself was several times larger than Sicily.  A little later, Tortuga was discovered, which later became the most famous haven of pirates. </p><p>  On December 25, the Santa Maria crashed, which landed on reefs.  Fort Navidad was built from the wreckage of the ship, which became the first Spanish settlement in America.  The sad thing is that all the "involuntary colonists" died after some time. </p>

    <p>  On January 6, Nina met with Pinta.  After some trials, the ships replenished supplies in Haiti, and on January 16 headed for their native lands.  This is how Columbus discovered America. </p>
