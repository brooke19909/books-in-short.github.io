    <h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  The land of Baden-W√ºrttemberg was inhabited by people in the Mesolithic era.  The history of the city of Baden-Baden begins more than 2 thousand years ago, when the Roman emperor builds his baths here, the remains of Roman terms are still preserved in the city.  In 220 BC  it housed the Roman garrison, and the city was a significant part of the empire.  After the fall of Rome, the resort began to decline, the Romans no longer sent their soldiers here for treatment, and the Germans had not yet entered the taste of hydrotherapy.  Gradually, the city becomes weaker and empty. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The settlement is experiencing a second rise in popularity during the Renaissance.  Then a European aristocracy was drawn into the city to improve health.  In the 18th century, Baden-Baden became the real summer capital of Europe.  Representatives of the elite from all over the continent gather here.  After the marriage was concluded between the Russian emperor Alexander the First and the princess of Baden, following the empress Elizaveta Alekseevna, the high society of Russia stretched into the city.  All the biggest names of our country were inscribed in the guest books of the best local hotels.  Later this fashion was picked up by the Russian nobility.  To visit "on the waters" was considered a duty by all relatively wealthy people of the country.  "Russian trace" left a big imprint in the history of the city.  Here, representatives of the elite of the Russian Empire, as well as people of art, for example, Tolstoy, Turgenev, Dostoevsky, improved their health. </p>
