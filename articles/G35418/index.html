  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Vnukovo settlement: the unity of history and entertaining modernity</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The rural Vnukovo settlement is located in the north-west of the Moscow region.  The first mention of him as a settlement appeared in 1852.  The small village of Vnukovo, owned by Prince Sergei Ivanovich Gagarin, consisted of 232 peasant souls of both sexes.  By 1913, there were 17 courtyards and the apartment of a police officer. </p><p>  Since November 1925, the village of Vnukovo is already in the status of a village council. </p><p>  In 2005, the <span>rural settlement</span> Vnukovskoye was formed in the Leninsky district of the Moscow region.  And from July 1, 2012, this is already the administrative unit of the Novomoskovsk district of Moscow. </p><h2>  Components and Geography </h2><p>  The modern administration of the Vnukovo settlement with all the settlements included in its subordination is located in the Vnukovo village.  In total, it included 9 villages and 6 villages, not counting garden associations, country partnerships, partnerships of individual developers. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.6455005" data-lng="37.266806900000006" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="15"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/2/6/8/0/2680.png"></div><p>  The territory has been actively built up with residential complexes since 2010.  Many want to live in an ecologically clean area, remote from the city center, but affordable.  And already those who have settled in the new buildings of the Solntsevo-Park microdistrict, as well as Peredelkino Blizhny, indicate the ‚ÄúVnukovskoye settlement‚Äù at the address, although the official registration has not yet been completed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the expanses of 60 square kilometers there is a local hospital, Izvarinskaya secondary school and gymnasium No. 1788 in Vnukovo.  In the village of Minvneshtorg, the House of Culture and a library for children named after  K.I. Chukovsky.  On the territory of the village is located the orphanage "Young Guard". </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="New buildings of the Novomoskovsk district" class="if uuid-2429005" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2429005.jpg"></div><p>  There are beautiful parks, clean air, there are enough flowing ponds on the territory where you can relax on hot summer days. </p><h2>  Economy </h2><p>  From 2018, according to the assurances of the Moscow metro leaders, trains will run from the Ramenki station to the Rasskazovka station.  Thus, Vnukovo will not be on paper, but in fact the administrative unit of the capital.  And the transport connection with Moscow at the Vnukovo settlement will work even more actively and regularly.  This will attract capital companies and help create new jobs. </p><p>  There are already: </p><ul><li>  large chain grocery stores, </li><li>  furniture manufacturing company LLC Universal Furniture, </li><li>  pharmaceutical company LLC Izvarino-farm, </li><li>  LLC "Fuel company" Garant "", </li><li>  dry cleaners and laundries, </li><li>  Maxisus LLC, </li><li>  7 beauty salons, </li><li>  branches of four banks, </li><li>  6 restaurants </li><li>  pharmacies </li><li>  taxi service. </li></ul><p>  But the area continues to develop. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Entertaining places </h2><p>  The most interesting and famous place on the territory of the Vnukovo settlement is the village of Michurinets or Peredelkino.  Under the second name, he became known.  Built in the mid 30-ies of the XX century at the request of M. A. Gorky and by order of I. V. Stalin, the village was intended as a resting place for the creative intelligentsia of the Soviet Union. </p><div class="photo" data-original="laifka.ucoz.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="House-Museum in Peredelkino" class="if uuid-2428997" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2428997.jpg"></div><p>  Such celebrities as Bella Akhmadulina, <span>Yevgeny Yevtushenko,</span> Bulat Okudzhava, Boris Pasternak, Korney Chukovsky, Irakliy Andronikov, Lev Kassil, Margarita Aliger and many others lived here.  It was difficult to get here even to honored figures of the Country of Soviets.  And in memory of those who helped build and live for many generations, there remained street names, house museums and symbols on the coat of arms of the Vnukovo settlement. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pereprava.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Temple in Izvarino" class="if uuid-2429027" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2429027.jpg"></div><p>  Of the historical sights there is the Church of Elijah the Prophet, built after 1670 in the settlement of Izvarino.  It is mentioned in the annals of the reign of Ivan IV the Terrible. </p><h2>  How to get there? </h2><p>  Since Moscow and Vnukovo settlement have become one since 2012, you can get there with all possible urban modes of transport.  From the metro stations Yugo-Zapadnaya, Troparevo, Salaryevo, Teply Stan or by electric trains from Kievsky station in Moscow. </p><p>  Through the Vnukovo settlement lie the Kiev, Minsk and Borovskoye highways.  There are two railway stations on the territory: Michurinets and Vnukovo. </p><p>  To understand which way to get, you need to know exactly which of the settlements lies the road.  If you go to Rasskazovka, Pykhtino or Izvarino, then you should choose transport routes along the Kiev and Borovsky highways from the metro station Yugo-Zapadnaya, Michurinsky Prospekt, Ramenki.  But so far with a change. </p><div class="photo" data-original="solncewonews.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Train from the Kiev station" class="if uuid-2429032" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2429032.jpg"></div><p>  If the path lies to the villages of Ababurovo, Minvneshtorg, then transport from the <span>Minsk highway</span> or from the Vnukovo railway station. </p><p>  And getting to the village of DSK ‚ÄúMichurinets‚Äù is quite simple, since you only have to walk a couple of hundred meters from the ‚ÄúMichurinets‚Äù railway station. </p><p>  It is worth examining the timetable in advance, since there is no subway station yet, the interval for buses is from two minutes to three hours. </p><p>  Happily get there! </p>
