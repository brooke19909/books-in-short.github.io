    <p>  <span>A review of the double-decker train "North Palmyra" should begin with the fact that such trains are still rare for domestic railways.</span>  <span>Moreover, they have not only advantages, but also disadvantages.</span> </p><p>  Among the advantages are increased capacity and carrying capacity, as well as the fact that ordinary doors are located at a lower level.  This eliminates the need for high platforms.  The description of the North Palmyra train (double-decker) corresponds to these features. </p><p>  Among the minuses are low ceilings, a small space for luggage.  Also, such cars are less safe.  Due to their high height, their center of gravity shifts, so the likelihood of tipping over increases.  Among the shortcomings are the complex design of the car, which leads to a rise in price during its production. </p><p>  The first double-decker cars in Russia were created at the <span>Tver Carriage Works</span> in 1905.  With their help, people were transported to the Far East.  It is worth noting that at that time only the second floor was intended for passengers.  The first transported cattle. </p><p>  In the 60s, a two-story carriage for tourists was built at the Leningrad plant.  On the second tier, a salon and a glass dome were equipped. </p><p>  The company <span>"Russian Railways"</span> began mass production of such trains since 2010 at the base of the car factory in Tver.  "North Palmyra" is the first modern Russian double-decker train that set off on its first flight on November 1, 2013. </p><h2>  Advantages of the "Northern Palmyra" </h2>

    <p>  About the "Northern Palmyra" - a two-story train reviews received a lot of the most diverse. </p><p>  Passengers who regularly travel in this direction, among the pluses, note a pleasant design and interior, a strict adherence to the schedule.  The pros pay attention even in the details.  For example, wagon numbers are not indicated by cardboard signs, but are displayed in electronic windows on each wagon. </p><p>  Many people like that another electronic display is located inside each car.  With it, you can find out all the necessary information during the trip.  Current time, name of the station where the train arrived, air temperature in the car and outside the window.  This train has very spacious compartments compared to other trains.  In addition, there are all the benefits of civilization.  Above each shelf is a small lamp that works.  So if you want to read at night, you won‚Äôt have to bother the rest of the passengers.  There are two sockets under the table. </p><p>  Everything is very clean and in working condition. </p><h2>  Disadvantages of "Northern Palmyra" </h2><p>  Among the shortcomings in the reviews, it is often noted that the food on the Northern Palmyra train (two-story) does not correspond to a high level of service.  Many passengers even suspect that the food is simply of poor quality. </p><p>  In addition, there is extremely little space for luggage, and the car shakes a lot.  Also often have to deal with incompetent staff. </p><blockquote></blockquote>
