    <p>  First of all, prepare: </p><ul><li>  Tights (knitted or nylon fit). </li><li>  Synthetic winterizer. </li><li>  Threads in the color of tights. </li><li>  Threads are blue and pink. </li><li>  Shreds of fabric. </li><li>  Yarn. </li><li>  Wax crayons or fabric paint. </li><li>  For the frame, wire. </li><li>  A needle. </li></ul><p>  It‚Äôs better to immediately put in front of you everything from which the kapron and synthetic winterizer dolls are made so as not to be distracted and engage in an interesting type of needlework with pleasure. </p><h2>  We start to create from the head </h2><p>  Take a piece of padding polyester and fill them with the toe of the pantyhose.  The toe itself will become the upper part of the doll‚Äôs head.  Give this part a rounded shape.  Take a little synthetic winterizer, also put it inside.  He will become the nose of a power lady. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Pull it forward a little, walk around with a needle, into the eye of which a thread is inserted under the color of tights.  Better if her tone is bodily.  Give your nose any shape you want.  Do not forget about the nostrils, make them with a few stitches. </p><h2>  Make a face, ears </h2><p>  The production of dolls from kapron and synthetic winterizer continues.  Now you need to craft the eyes of the toy.  You can do it quite simply - buy them in advance at a haberdashery store where similar accessories for making toys are sold.  Making them yourself is also easy. </p><p>  For the eyelids, cut a piece from the tights, fold it in half and sew on the upper part of the eyes.  Draw squirrels and pupils <span>with fabric dye</span> or <span>wax crayons.</span>  Pieces of skin can be glued instead of pupils. </p><p>  Ears are made according to the principle of the eyelids.  Cut off a piece of fabric from an unnecessary part of tights, fold it in half, put a little sintepon inside. </p><p>  To make the head more voluminous, cut a piece of fabric from the tights more.  Fill it with syntepon, shape the cakes and sew on the back of the head. </p><p>  Make a mouth with two pieces of pantyhose.  Sew it with a thread of a suitable color. </p><h2>  Frame for arms, legs, torso </h2><p>  This is how dolls are made of kapron and synthetic winterizer.  But for now, only the head is ready.  Now proceed to the other parts of the body of the toy. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Take a large wire, fold it in half.  In the center, roll a small loop, the head will be mounted on it.  Now from one half of the wire, make the right side of the doll, and from the second - the left. </p><p>  Next, make shoulders, arms, legs from this wire.  By the same principle, it is possible to make a frame not only for an old doll, but also for a girl doll.  If your imagination goes even further, you can make a male toy or some kind of fairy-tale hero. </p>

    <p>  Having reached the fingers of the heroine, roll up the wire so that it repeats their shape.  Use smaller toes on your feet. </p><p>  This is how kapron and synthetic winterizer dolls work out. </p><h2>  Give the basis of the form and finish the work </h2><p>  After the frame is ready, begin to wrap it tightly with a synthetic winterizer.  Wrap it around the frame of the fingers and toes.  In order for these details to stand out well, you do not need to put a lot of material in these areas. </p><p>  If you are planning to make dolls made of kapron and synthetic winterizer with your own hands, then for this you need 2-3 pairs of tights.  Put one pair on the legs of the toy, then pull them so that the upper part of the tights becomes her body.  From the other you sewed your head up to this, and now make your hands. </p><p>  Now make eyebrows from the bulk thread, sew them in their place.  Fluff the rest of the yarn, make a wig out of it, put it on the doll, sew it on.  Put the lower part of the head on the loop of the frame, sew with a strong thread. </p><p>  If your heroine is big, you can not sew special clothes for her, but put on a daughter‚Äôs dress, which is already not enough for her.  If not, sew a sundress for a toy and a cap.  You can cut a triangle of fabric, cut it and just tie it on the doll‚Äôs head. </p><p>  It remained with the help of pink chalk to give a blush, put on glasses on a stitched face and admire what happened. </p><p>  This is how such dolls are made of kapron and synthetic winterizer with their own hands.  Using a needle and thread, you can change the age of the toy at your discretion, having made not a age, but a young diva. </p><h2>  Simple model </h2>

    <p>  Ears for this model do not need to be done, since this part of the face is hidden behind the hair, and make them from thick yarn.  Wind around the back of a chair or something like that in a circle.  Then cut them on one side and the other.  You got a lot of thick threads of the same size.  Find their middle.  Putting the thread on the doll‚Äôs head, align the center of the crown with the middle of the thread, sew in this place with a needle.  Braid the braids, tie them with bows or elastic. </p><h2>  Making the rest of the body of a simple doll </h2><p>  A master class will help to make such dolls from kapron and sintepon.  The next step is the construction of the body, arms and legs.  They are made on a wire basis or without it.  If you want to use the second method, fill the socks of the second pair of pantyhose with synthetic winterizer, drag them with a thread at the junction of hands and palms.  Mark your fingers with stitches. </p><p>  Do the legs in the same way.  Wear baby socks on them or sew them yourself.  You can use old baby booties or tie them. </p>

    <p>  After you dress the doll in a dress, it will appear in all its glory.  You can finish the work, but if you want to continue creating, try using plastic bottles when making dolls made of kapron and synthetic winterizer.  MK (master class) will teach this. </p><h2>  Toy on the bottle </h2><p>  For this model, in addition to the basic materials, you will need a plastic bottle with a slightly rounded shape, with a ‚Äúwaist‚Äù in the middle.  Cut the bottom from it and set it on a flat surface. </p><p>  Wrap the bottle outside with a padding polyester.  On top, put on one part of the tights, having previously cut off the toe part.  You should only see the bottleneck.  At this point, pass the thread through the top of the pantyhose web, tighten.  Tie the thread and waist of the bottle. </p><p>  Now cut off a slightly smaller piece of fabric from tights.  Sew the thread from above, then tighten, leaving a small hole equal to the diameter of the top of the bottleneck. </p><p>  Put this part on the bottle, fill it with padding polyester, make the same face as in the first example.  Sew a hole in the crown, attach hair or tie a scarf. </p><p>  The body and head are ready, it remains to make hands.  Fold 5 pieces of wire in the form of fingers, wrap them with padding polyester.  Put on this basis a section of pantyhose, tie up your fingers with ties, fill the middle, upper part of the hands with synthetic winterizer, sew them in place. </p><p>  It remains to dress the doll in a dress and you can give an author's gift to an adult or a child. </p>
