    <h2>  About provider </h2><p>  The provider is positioned as a company providing high-speed Internet.  This statement is based on the use of the latest technology.  But Ecotelecom, according to reviews from Odintsovo, for example, is slightly exaggerating.  Most people complain about the low speed of the Internet - about 40-60 Mb / s., While the stated 100 Mb / s. </p><p>  But the company has many tariffs and offers for customers.  And Ecotelecom is trying to build its service on a level.  The company offers beneficial and generally diverse and optimal cable television options not only to customers individually, but also to groups and corporate clients.  The provider works in almost all of Moscow and in the region. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Coverage map </h2><p>  The company operates in such districts of the city of Moscow as the Western, Novomoskovsky, Northern, North-Western, Central, Southern, South-Eastern and South-Western administrative districts. </p><p>  In the region, Ecotelecom is present in such cities: Balashikha, Lyubertsy, Zheleznodorozhny, Krasnogorsk, Mytishchi, Odintsovo, Podolsk, Khimki and Chekhov.  This is also the areas of Solnechnogorsk, Odintsovo, Lyubertsy, Leninsky and Krasnogorsk. </p>

    <p>  Depending on the area, customers leave diametrically opposed reviews.  For example, in Moscow, in some places, people complain about the low speed of the Internet.  Conversely, Ecotelecom, according to reviews in Podolsk, is the best provider of the city. </p><h2>  Operator Addresses </h2><p>  The head office of Ecotelecom is located in Moscow on ul.  Davydkovskaya, 3, bldg.  1, entrance 3. Another office in the capital is located on the street.  Sokolovo-Meshcherskaya in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãKurkino. </p><p>  The provider has several offices in the suburbs.  There are 2 offices in Balashikha - in the microdistrict.  them.  Gagarin and in md.  Forest town.  In Lyubertsy there is only one Ecotelecom office, which is located on Victory Avenue (Soyuz-Lyubertsy Asset Management Company).  2 offices are also in Podolsk.  These are offices on the street.  43rd Army and on the Bypass Road (Asset Management Company). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  About the work of Ecotelecom offices, however, good reviews.  Employees, according to Muscovites and residents of the Moscow Region, are polite and competent.  And, most interestingly, many users agree that if you listen to the advice of the operator or the wizard who came to you in matters of proper work with the Internet or rather with home equipment, then the speed of the Internet increases like magic. </p><h2>  Internet "Ecotelecom" </h2><p>  The data transfer rate when using the Internet, according to the provider, ranges from 30 to 300 Mb / s.  Such a pleasure is relatively inexpensive - from 399 to 749 rubles / month.  Without speed limits, regardless of the tariff, you can use the search engines Google and Yandex, Mail.ru, the social networks Odnoklassniki, Facebook and VKontakte, the online game World of Tanks and the YouTube video site. </p>

    <p>  Ecotelecom adds a lot of positive feedback about the Internet to a large extent to the free service and the ability to create a car payment or ask for a deferred payment from the provider.  In order not to overpay, you can use the service of temporary freezing of the Internet, if it is not needed yet or there is no way to pay for it. </p><p>  NTV + is attached to any of the tariffs at the same price (NTV + is the main partner of Ecotelecom).  NTV + digital television (this is the main partner of the company) can be connected forever, and for a small amount, or pay it monthly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Reviews about the provider "Ecotelecom" vary.  Sometimes negative reviews are written really unfairly in relation to the company, for example, when a cable break occurs due to the fault of third parties or if the subscriber does not comply with the specified rules for using the Internet on his equipment at home. </p><h2>  Cable TV </h2><p>  The company offers several types of television broadcasting to choose a client: </p><ul><li>  Cable. </li><li>  Interactive. </li><li>  IP-TV (NTV-Plus). </li></ul><p>  Cable television is transmitted on analogue media.  Customers are offered 1 package - "advanced social".  In the Moscow Region, cable TV from Ecotelecom can be connected in Lyubertsy, Podolsk and Krasnogorsk.  In Moscow, this can be done at several addresses: st.  Mytnaya, ave.  Peace and pos.  Kommunarka in Novomoskovsk AO. </p><p>  The package includes the most popular channels among Russians in general and Muscovites in particular.  All federal and terrestrial, as well as satellite, which are loved by the people to a greater extent.  Those who are lucky with the fact that cable TV from the provider is available in their homes leave online reviews about Ecotelecom of a positive nature. </p>

    <p>  When updating channels, there is no need to do any supernatural actions that many consumers fear.  You can reconfigure manually by flipping the cable.  The only thing is that the list of available channels itself may differ from the one in another district of Moscow or in another city of the Moscow Region.  You can see the list of channels available in your region by going to the provider's website.  After you have visited the site, you need to select the ‚ÄúTelevision‚Äù item and the ‚ÄúCable TV‚Äù sub-item. </p><p>  A cable television receipt arrives with the rest of the payments.  The cost of payment includes all the minor services and expenses of the company. </p><p>  Also, Ecotelecom can provide benefits to people or families belonging to a particular vulnerable social group.  All benefits amount to a discount of 50% of the tariff. </p><h2>  Interactive tv </h2><p>  Interactive TV is already a familiar ‚ÄúWatch‚Äù service.  It allows you to watch television online from any gadget that has access to the World Wide Web.  The advantage of this service, according to customer reviews, is that you can watch programs not only at home.  One just needs to download the application for ‚ÄúSmotryoshki‚Äù, and your favorite channels will be with the subscriber everywhere.  You can delay any broadcast by putting it on pause to look at another time convenient for the client.  Such a function keeps the ether in memory for up to a week.  But we must remember that, for example, Ecotelecom, according to reviews in Lyubertsy, provides low speed Internet.  Therefore, the quality of the work of interactive television is very unflattering, considering that the Internet is working intermittently.  However, this situation is not everywhere. </p><p>  For interactive TV, the company was not stingy with making a bunch of different tariffs, packages, bonuses, etc.  So it‚Äôs not difficult to decide what you like best. </p>

    <p>  Recently, NTV + has completely switched to IP-TV.  Such a television also offers many packages.  The minimum shows 69 channels for 25 rubles per month!  A proposal from partners of NTV + and Ecotelecom regarding a ‚Äúlifetime‚Äù ownership of the right to watch NTV + channels in case of sale will cost 4500 rubles one-time.  If there is no need for an eternal connection, then you can simply pay 200 rubles / month. </p><h2>  Telephony </h2><p>  As a telecom operator, first of all, the company made sure that the Ecotelecom brand was associated not only with the Internet and television, but also with regular landline communications.  Landline phone services are everywhere in Moscow and the region.  Reviews on this part are always good, no complaints about failures. </p><h2>  Ecotelecom contacts </h2><p>  A free short number by which you can call the company‚Äôs support service from the Ecotelecom number and the central office phones can be found on the company's website. </p><p>  The offices of Ecotelecom begin daily at 10 a.m., and end on weekdays at 20:00, and on weekends at 19:00. </p>

    <p>  For calls or feedback, you can also find the contacts of all Moscow Region offices on the provider's website in the About Company section, in the Contacts section. </p><h2>  Ecotelecom: reviews </h2><p>  The customer reviews of the company, as mentioned above, are diametrically opposed.  Either I really like everything, or everything is very bad.  Someone considers Ecotelecom the best operator with the best Internet that he had, while someone is outraged by the work of the provider.  As a rule, disturbances occur due to the low speed of the Internet, and also because sometimes workers do not immediately respond to an application.  But it is worth remembering - regarding the services that Ecotelecom provides, the reviews in Nekrasovka can differ significantly from the customer reviews on Sokolovo-Meshcherskaya.  Everything is very individual. </p>

    <p>  Despite all the differences, Ecotelecom is a convenient and profitable connection for Muscovites.  You can purchase a communication package either with Ecotelecom equipment or rent equipment.  But the most advantageous offers from the company still relate more to television.  Here reviews for some reason are mostly not the most encouraging.  But the percentage of kind words towards the operator is also large. </p>
