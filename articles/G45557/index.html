    <h2>  A little bit about the history of the building and the location of the hotel </h2><p>  The building itself was built in the 19th century and has historical value.  In those days, it was the mansion of Count Golitsyn.  The hotel was opened in 2009, and in August 2014 was renovated.  That is why the Mandarin Hotel <span>(Moscow)</span> received negative <span>reviews from tourists</span> at this time.  The guests were very annoyed by the noise from the repairs on the eighth and ninth floors.  It should be noted that the new superstructure floors have poor sound insulation.  Considering that the room can be rented for an hour, the absence of sleep for single guests from unambiguous sounds behind the wall is ensured.  This is evidenced by guest reviews. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The place for tourists and businessmen is very profitable.  The following interesting and useful objects are located nearby: </p><ul><li>  Sokolniki Park". </li><li>  Exhibition Center "Sokolniki". </li><li>  Sports Palace "Sokolniki". </li><li>  SC "Olympic". </li><li>  Shopping center "Elohovsky Passage". </li><li>  MSTU named after Bauman. </li><li>  Epiphany Cathedral. </li><li>  Plant "Arma". </li></ul>

    <h2>  Positive feedback from guests </h2><p>  Hotel <span>"Mandarin" (Moscow)</span> collects the most diverse reviews online.  Let's start with positive impressions of the institution.  Visitors like the lobby and the friendly staff in a good mood who, after registration, gives everyone a tangerine (a trifle, but nice).  The prices are quite affordable and correspond to the quality and decoration of the rooms with which the Mandarin Hotel (Moscow) is equipped.  Photos of the rooms are presented below. </p><p>  Almost everyone in their reviews praises the breakfast buffet.  You can order dinner in your room - the staff will deliver it exactly at the right time. </p><p>  The location in the area of ​​three stations and not far from the Baumanskaya and Krasnopresnenskaya metro stations is a huge plus that tourists could not fail to note in their reviews.  Despite this, the place is quite quiet.  However, not everyone likes the road from the station to the Mandarin Hotel.  Empty factory streets and deserts scare.  But this is already indirectly related to negative points. </p><p>  The bed is comfortable, the repair looks expensive, although there are minor flaws in the decoration. </p><p>  Someone even compares the hotel with European hotels: they especially note the repair in the bathroom (if we are talking about luxury rooms). </p><p>  The conference room is quite spacious.  You can use tablets for free.  It also provides services for printing text, photocopying, scanning documents and sending them by fax. </p>

    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  If you examine all the reviews of dissatisfied guests, then we can say that they relate more to the little things.  And from them just sometimes a general impression develops.  The lack of cosmetics for the shower, flaws in the upholstery and carpet, the lack of declared weights in each room and more - all this causes negative emotions among guests, and the Mandarin 4-star hotel was not so simple. </p><p>  Of the major shortcomings, some critics note the slowness of the staff and the lack of a desk, which is very necessary for business people who are on a business trip.  Probably, its availability should be negotiated at the time of booking. </p><p>  Separately allocated rooms at a reduced cost without windows facing the street.  It is hard to imagine how you can comfortably be in such a "box".  People spending the night there complained of stuffiness and a musty smell.  Not even the open door helped.  It is clear that the price is much lower, but it is better not to save on your health. </p><p>  If you were offered rooms on the ninth floor, then be prepared for the fact that the elevator can only reach the seventh, then the stairs.  If there are no large suitcases, then there is no problem. </p><p>  Some rooms have a hood that makes a loud noise.  But with complaints about this, the staff does not argue and changes the number to another quickly enough. </p><h2>  Hotel "Mandarin" (Moscow): reviews of guests about the restaurant </h2><p>  Hotel "Mandarin", as mentioned above, has a restaurant on its territory.  Guests love the food and the decoration of the rooms.  But the <span>staff is</span> not very welcoming.  But, most likely, this is due to a constant full house, although this is not an excuse. </p><h2>  Guidelines for choosing a room </h2><p>  If you want to check into the Mandarin Hotel (Moscow), the main thing is to discuss all the details, from slippers and a bathrobe to the noise level from the hoods in the room, the presence of air conditioning and a desk even at the stage of booking the room. </p><p>  Do not choose the last floors because of the working elevator only up to 7 floors. </p><p>  Upon arrival, if there are any complaints about noise and smell, it is better to ask to change the number.  The administration often goes forward.  In general, all the staff are friendly enough and try to help than they can. </p><p>  It is better not to choose internal numbers - you can suffocate.  There is no ventilation.  If you open the door to the corridor, there will be no effect.  There are also no windows, as in the room.  The only way out of this inconvenience is to open the cold water in the bathroom. </p><p>  Be prepared for the large number of foreigners who have arrived at the Mandarin Hotel (4 stars).  Moscow alone in a week receives about 60 thousand guests from different countries.  The location near attractions and a business center makes itself felt. </p><p>  Guests of Mandarin note that the lower the floor, the better the Wi-Fi signal level.  Well, of course, it depends on the level of hotel overcrowding. </p>
