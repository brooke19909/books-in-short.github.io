    <h2>  Drone number 1 </h2><p>  In the ranking of quadrocopters with a camera, the DJI Phantom Inspire 1 takes first place.  With the ability to shoot 4K-video at speeds up to 30 fps, 1080p - at 60 fps and 12-megapixel photos using the gimbal system, the drone is fully prepared to create professional movie materials that you can only dream of.  The quadcopter is a technological miracle with an aerodynamic design.  Its <span>carbon fiber</span> paws <span>are</span> removed from the camera‚Äôs field of view with one movement of the switch. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  DJI Phantom Inspire 1 </h2><p>  This is one of the smartest <span>unmanned aerial vehicles</span> you can buy, as DJI has used revolutionary technologies in it, including intelligent power management, which reports the remaining battery power and ensures that the drone does not lose power before it goes back.  The maximum flight time is about 18 minutes, and if the battery runs out or the remote control loses connection, then the sophisticated built-in GPS-positioning algorithms will put the model into autopilot mode and ensure its return to the launch point.  In addition, Inspire 1 is equipped with a positioning system in which cameras and sonars are used to determine its location, and which provides automatic raising or lowering of the legs when taking off or landing. </p>

    <p>  Possession of a device that takes first place in the ranking of quadrocopters will require large investments.  A drone costs more than $ 4,000, but the user gets everything you need, including a spare battery, 2 remote controls, spare parts, a 64 GB micro SD card and a Pelican case, which makes it easy to transport the device. </p><h2>  DJI Mavic Pro </h2><p>  The second best in the ranking of quadrocopters is the latest high-quality drone DJI Mavic Pro.  This is also a very attractive option.  Firstly, the model is extremely portable due to its design, which allows it to be folded to the size of a larger bottle.  Mavic Pro offers a transmission range of up to 7 km and a flight speed of up to 64 km / h with an average duration of about 27 minutes.  The quadcopter is provided with the latest intelligent features.  Activetrack, for example, uses advanced image recognition algorithms to track the position of a moving object using a camera without using GPS.  TapFly allows you to control the aircraft with a simple touch of the touch screen.  The drone is also equipped with additional sensors to prevent collisions with obstacles, ensure flight safety and high reliability.  The smart design and portability of the second best DJI Mavic Pro quadcopter in the ranking will cost less than $ 2,000. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  DJI Phantom 4 </h2><p>  It is not surprising that in the ranking of quadrocopters there is another representative of DJI.  Enthusiasts loved the Phantom line, and the 4th model is as elegant and well thought out as consumer drones.  With a significant portion of the same technology as the Inspire 1, the drone comes with a 4K camera that shoots at 30 fps.  The Vision positioning system provides stable and accurate hovering even without the help of a control panel, while the Phantom 4 brakes and freezes in place, even if the wind rises.  ActiveTrack mode allows you to easily configure the drone to track a moving object and shoot it, while avoiding trees or other obstacles using the built-in detection system. </p><p>  In addition, the appearance and design of the device are excellent.  This is today one of the coolest universal unmanned drones on the market, which will certainly attract attention.  There is a quadrocopter $ 1400.  The kit includes a backpack for carrying, protection for the blades and a 64-GB memory card. </p>

    <h2>  3DR Solo Smart Drone </h2><p>  If an investment has already been made in the GoPro camera, which the user would prefer to use with a drone, this model, which occupies not the last place in the rating of quadrocopters, will become a fantastic aircraft for shooting videos.  This multifunctional drone comes with a controller that is equipped with a smartphone holder, convenient controls and displays flight time on the screen, and gives a vibrating warning about low battery.  On-board stabilization allows you to focus on shooting and not worry about keeping the quadrocopter in the air. </p><p>  If you purchase an additional gimbal for your GoPro, you can perform Smart Shots - pre-programmed maneuvers such as Orbit, Follow and Cable cam, which provide the ability to take professional cinematic images. </p><p>  The 3DR Solo is equipped with important safety features, including a limitation on the maximum lift height of 122 m that meets FAA requirements, as well as a Pause button that instantly stops the drone if the pilot feels that he is losing control. </p>

    <h2>  Blade Chroma 4K / GoPro </h2><p>  This is another reliable model that occupies a worthy place in the ranking of quadrocopters with a camera.  User reviews from 4 options distinguish 2 more expensive versions.  These include a 4K camera and a remote with an integrated screen for recording video and tracking important information such as altitude, speed and the remaining flight time.  It is possible to purchase an additional battery, as well as a convenient case.  Cheaper options allow you to mount your own GoPro (Hero 4 recommended) with a 3-axis suspension.  These options are the same drone as in the version with a 4K camera, with the exception of the standard wireless transmitter.  This means that you will have to organize the broadcast of video from GoPro to your smartphone yourself.  Regardless of the modification, they all support Smart mode, aimed at beginners who are still learning the basics of control, and AP for more advanced pilots who need maximum control over their device.  In addition, great features such as Follow Me and a tracking mode that allows you to pre-set altitude and distance settings, and then focus solely on photo and video, are supported. </p><p>  The kit costs a little over $ 1400. </p>

    <h2>  Yuneec Q500 4K Typhoon </h2><p>  This model is one of the best in the ranking of quadrocopters with a camera.  According to user reviews, it differs by shooting amazing video and a reasonable price (up to $ 800).  No assembly required - just attach the propellers and the drone is ready to take off.  The control panel is equipped with a built-in touch screen that allows you to change video settings on the fly, such as resolution, white balance and exposure.  The camera is mounted on a 3-axis precision gimbal and can capture 4K videos at 30 fps or slow motion in 1080p at speeds up to 120 fps.  In addition, the Q500 Typhoon stands out for its industrial design design that differs from the streamlined DJI cases.  Yuneec also offers an aluminum case for safe transportation that lets you take your drone anywhere.  The kit also includes Handheld SteadyGrip - a compact steadicam that can be held with one hand.  By attaching a Q500 camera to it, you can record video directly to your smartphone. </p><h2>  Aukey black sparrow </h2><p>  In the ranking of budget quadrocopters with a camera cheaper than $ 100, this full-size model takes first place.  However, first using the included screwdriver you will need to make a small assembly - install the chassis and guards for the propellers.  You will also have to charge the built-in battery for several hours.  Only then can you count on average 10 minutes of flight.  The complete 2.4-GHz remote control is made of plastic and equipped with switches for calibrating the drone and putting it into Headless mode (without a clearly defined front and back) for easier control.  You can control the device from a distance of up to <span>300 m,</span> and the bright LEDs below allow night shooting.  However, flights should be performed away from buildings, people, and lines of force, because a combination of high power and light weight can lead to loss of control and, therefore, cause damage or injuries.  A built-in 6-axis gyroscope helps maintain stability - a must for beginners, but in windy conditions it helps a little.  Although video equipment is not included, a port and guides for mounting are provided for it.  The necessary accessories can be purchased separately. </p>
