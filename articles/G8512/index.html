  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Game technology in training.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Modern educational technologies, as never before, rely on psychology.  Learning by game fully corresponds not only to the psychology of schoolchildren.  Everyone loves to play: both adults and children. </p><p>  The game is a leading activity in the preschool <span>period of age</span> development.  In the following stages, the game does not disappear, but complements the leading activities of a growing child, adolescent, or youth. </p><p>  Patriotic teacher V.A.  Sukhomlinsky compared the game with a spark, which ignites the light of curiosity, inquisitiveness, and without which complete mental development does not occur. </p><p>  It should be noted the versatility of the game in human life at all stages of age development. </p><p>  First of all, the child is socialized in the game.  Through a <span>system of story-based role-playing games,</span> children assimilate and appropriate social norms, values, and attitudes.  In the process of the game, self-realization takes place, game activity makes it possible to practice various forms of life, including communication.  And, of course, the game entertains, fills leisure. </p><p>  In addition, specially organized game activities have corrective, psychotherapeutic, and diagnostic functions. </p><p>  The educational function of the game is worth noting.  Game technologies in training can change the educational process fundamentally, contribute to the achievement of high learning outcomes.  We can say that gaming technology is a model of the teacher and student.  The purpose of the joint activity is the design, organization and implementation of the educational process through the game. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Currently, game <span>forms of training are</span> popular not only in preschool and school education, but also in <span>higher vocational education,</span> as well as in training specialists of various fields in business. </p><p>  Game technology in training has a wide scope.  So, the gaming technology ‚Äúbusiness game‚Äù can be used as an independent technology in the development of educational material.  In another case, gaming technology may become elements of a broader educational technology (for example, collective learning technology).  In addition, a widespread use is made as a form of the educational or educational process. </p><p>  Game technologies in training are based on the features of game activity.  Like any activity, the game has its own structure: goal-setting, planning, goal realization, analysis of results.  In addition, the components of game activity are: plot, roles, real relationships between players, game actions, replacement of real objects with conditionals. </p><p>  Modern gaming technologies in training actively use the versatility of gaming activities, which allows you to distinguish groups of educational games: simulation games, role-playing games, innovative games and others. </p><p>  A common gaming technology today has become a business game.  She found her place both in school and in vocational training.  The business game is attractive because it makes it possible to simulate a real socio-economic system and reproduce the real interaction of participants in this system of relationships;  has the priority of collective learning;  carries a high value and semantic load.  Types of business games: imitation, role-playing, operational, business theater, psychodrama, sociodrama, etc. </p><p>  As a gaming technology, a business game has a number of structural components necessary for its implementation.  This is a direct <span>simulation model of a</span> business game, including the pedagogical goal and subject of the game, the system of interaction between participants, and the assessment system.  Another element - the game model - this is the game goals of the participants in the game, a set of roles, rules, script.  A mandatory element of technology is the methodological and technical support of gaming activities. </p>
