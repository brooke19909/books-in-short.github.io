In each industry in which Mikhail Vasilyevich worked, he managed to leave his bright mark and bring many great discoveries to the world. </p><h2>  Speaking of Mikhail Vasilievich </h2><p>  Distinguished from his peers by an innate thirst for knowledge, at an early age he learned to read and write. </p><p>  At the age of 19, the young man goes to Moscow and, posing as a visiting nobleman, is enrolled as a student in the Slavic-Greek-Latin Academy, where he subsequently receives good theoretical training and is fluent in Latin.  Then, in 1736, he was transferred to the Academic University of St. Petersburg, from where, over time, he would be sent to Germany to study mining and metallurgy.  M.V. Lomonosov continued his education in Freiburg, where he began to improve his knowledge in practice. </p>

    <p>  Throughout his scientific career, he boldly defended the interests of the people and demanded that education become accessible not only to the upper class, but also to the peasantry.  It was on the initiative of Mikhail Vasilyevich that a university was created in Moscow, which to this day proudly bears the name of the founder. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  On linguistic activity in general </h2><p><strong> </strong>  Mikhail Vasilievich made a significant contribution to the development of linguistics.  Despite his immersion in special knowledge, he found time for philological works.  Upon his return to Russia, in 1757 he published the first Russian grammar, where he revealed the orthoepic and <span>grammatical norms of the</span> language on the basis of observations of live speech.  It is important to note that the first to come up with a description of the grammatical features of Russian was Lomonosov.  As a linguist, he engaged in this from a scientific point of view, it was he who was also the first to consider the concepts of morphology, syntax, and word formation.  On the basis of his ‚ÄúRussian Grammar‚Äù, Russian language textbooks were first published. </p><p>  Lomonosov also made a huge contribution to the development of rhetoric.  His guide to eloquence was the first Russian-language book of its kind.  He also established a classification of parts of speech, examined questions of spelling and punctuation, translated into Russian many scientific terms. </p><h2>  <strong>Philological merits of Lomonosov</strong> </h2><p><strong> </strong>  A significant contribution to the formation of the Russian language and literature was made by the <span>works of Lomonosov.</span>  As a linguist, he was worried about the <span>development of the language, the</span> systematization of its grammatical, orthoepic and stylistic features.  Thanks to Mikhail Vasilyevich, an important reform was carried out in relation to the Russian literary language, and the system of versification, which has survived to this day, was approved. </p>

    <p>  As a linguist, he talked about the Russian language as a great asset.  Mikhail Vasilievich was the first to begin to give academic lectures in his native language. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  He sought to enrich the literary language, to make it accessible, understandable and at the same time unique.  We will consider Lomonosov as a linguist.  Briefly on the philological merits of this great man, we now talk. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúRussian Grammar‚Äù by M. V. Lomonosov </h2><p><strong> </strong>  The main merit of Lomonosov is the creation of solid soil for the formation of a new Russian language.  The famous work of Mikhail Vasilievich entitled ‚ÄúRussian Grammar‚Äù, which was released in 1755, is also associated with its development.  Its compilation is truly the greatest of merits that Lomonosov brought.  As a linguist, for the first time in Russian Grammar, he tried to distinguish between such concepts as Russian and <span>Church Slavonic.</span> </p><p>  Lomonosov adhered to each language, to recognize it as completely independent in relation to another - such a principle in his work.  As a linguist, he relied on certain scientific techniques that helped him to accurately distinguish between Russian and Church Slavonic.  This served as a worthy start to the further development of domestic literature.  As a linguist, Lomonosov <strong> </strong>  based on research on the features of the language: he took a long list of words or phrases, compared and juxtaposed them.  And then, based on the results obtained, he made the appropriate conclusions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lomonosov about language" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/1087859.jpg" width="514"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  At the research methods of Lomonosov, which have not undergone any significant changes, science holds to this day. </p><h2>  The ‚ÄúThree Calm‚Äù Theory of MV Lomonosov </h2><p><strong> </strong>  On the basis of his research techniques, the great Russian reformer released the theory of "three calm", which found direct application in the creation of a new literary language.  Mikhail Vasilyevich established the general principle of the interaction of various styles and genres in linguistics.  Each "calm" was characterized by a direct area of ‚Äã‚Äãits application.  Lomonosov used his theory when describing stylistic processes in a language.  As a linguist, he walked through the constant combination and assimilation of that beautiful and valuable that is in both languages. </p><h2>  "High calm" </h2><p>  Thus, to the "high calm" were attributed the words that were used to create all kinds of odes, songs, poems, speeches or solemn speeches.  This style can rightfully be considered majestic.  However, the words of such a calm were rarely used by people in everyday speech, but a competent person could understand them. </p><h2>  "The average calm" </h2><p>  "Calm calm" was intended for writing satirical plays, ironic friendly letters or historical works.  It is characterized by the predominance of Russian-language words with a rare accession of Slavic. </p><h2>  "Low calm" </h2><p>  "Low calm" is full of Russian words that are not in the Slavic language.  With the help of it comedies, songs, descriptions of "everyday affairs" are created.  In this style, preference was given to Russian, popular people. </p><p>  All the pathos of the aforementioned Lomonosov theory was characterized by the need to recognize the rights of the Russian language and literature. </p><h2>  <strong>Lomonosov's contribution to literature</strong> </h2><p>  Speaking of him as an outstanding philologist, one cannot but mention literary merits.  After all, Mikhail Vasilievich was engaged in the study of various theories with their further application in practice along with other sciences. </p>

    <p>  While in Germany, he writes an essay on unresolved issues regarding Russian versification.  In this letter, he introduces his amendments to the reform of Trediakovsky, expanding it with new poetic sizes, such as anapaest, dactyl and amphibrach.  Unlike other poets of that time, he does not neglect the use of various rhymes in his works.  The second part of his letter was an ode to the capture of Khotin, which the great reformer devoted to the heroism of the Russian army.  She was significantly different from the works of his predecessors. </p><p>  Over the years, he publishes another essay, where he establishes the already mentioned theory of "three calm".  Subsequently, it finds application in the formation of a new literary Russian language. </p><h2>  Lomonosov's contribution to the formation of the scientific terminological base of the Russian language </h2><p><strong> </strong><strong></strong>  A valuable contribution to Russian science was made by Lomonosov.  He spoke of language as the great value of the people, their eternal heritage.  Mikhail Vasilievich was convinced that the Russian language is very rich and multifaceted, that you can always find the necessary words in it to denote certain terms or concepts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="clematis as a linguist briefly" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/1087862.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The reformer fought for the purity and perfection of the Russian language, trying to rid it of "foreignism."  Therefore, he either literally translated the concept into Russian, or simply selected suitable equivalents to it.  Thanks to the scientist, words such as energy, quantity, particles, experience, quickly entrenched in Russian terminology.  Mikhail Vasilievich Lomonosov was distinguished by his exceptional courage, perseverance and endless ingenuity when creating a scientific terminological base.  As a linguist he <strong> </strong>  He made a huge contribution to the establishment of Russian-language terminological concepts. </p><p>  First of all, Mikhail Vasilievich Lomonosov, as a Russian linguist, was outraged by the abuse of foreign words in literature or in everyday life.  He was angry to the core of the nobles, who, barely learning to understand a few words in French, immediately began to insert them wherever they wanted.  Lomonosov pointed out that the aimless adoption of words of foreign origin poses a danger to the competent education of national culture.  In view of this, he urged to honor the beauty, versatility of the native language and to oppose those who introduce ‚Äúthe obscene obscenities‚Äù into it. </p><h2>  And finally </h2><p><strong> </strong>  <span>The works of Lomonosov</span> as a linguist and a famous reformer to this day find application in scientific activity.  This great man was the first to appreciate the depth, wealth, power and uniqueness of the Russian language.  In his writings, Mikhail Vasilievich Lomonosov spoke of literature as the art of the word. </p>

    <p>  He took many steps in the formation of a new literary language and outlined the prospects for its further development. </p><p>  Mikhail Vasilievich served for the benefit of the people.  It was on his idea that a university was founded in Moscow, which today is world famous.  He also managed to create a terminological base, the enrichment of which, following Lomonosov, was done by famous domestic scientists of the following decades.  That was exactly Lomonosov, the Russian linguist.  And to this day, we remember this great man and use his labors. </p>
