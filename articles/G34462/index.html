  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to reset Android using buttons?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A soft reset is just a restart of the phone.  It sounds simple, but it helps in cases with many problems and failures.  For example, it may happen that Samsung or any other phone becomes slow because the memory is overloaded with an incomplete application.  In such cases, before ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù is reset, it is enough to turn off the smartphone once or remove the battery for several minutes.  Specialists call this reset soft.  If the problem after it has not been resolved, the user should think about how to return the Samsung Galaxy to the factory settings by performing a hard reset. </p><h2>  Reasons for hard reset </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.techfury.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reasons to reset" class="if uuid-2937602" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2937602.jpg"></div><p>  There are several reasons a user should know before resetting Android to factory settings: </p><ol><li>  The smartphone has become slow.  During the life of the device, a lot of data accumulates in the internal memory, which, in particular, can lead to the fact that it will work much slower than the new one.  This reset can restore the phone to factory settings and free it from junk. </li><li>  Virus on a smartphone.  Often the user does not even know where the problems are from the phone, but the cause may be a virus that severely limits the functionality of the smartphone, in these cases only a hard reset will help. </li><li>  Preparing the device for sale.  In this case, you must be careful before resetting the "Android".  With a huge amount of hacking know-how on the Internet, personal data can be restored even after a hard reset.  Therefore, you will need not only to restart the phone, but also to thoroughly clean all the data. </li></ol><h2>  Reset and Reboot Functions </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.tenorshare.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reset and Reboot Functions" class="if uuid-2937612" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2937612.jpg"></div><p>  Many people confuse the word Reset with the word Reboot.  If the user encounters a significant delay or any other problem that he wants to fix without losing all his data, he will use the Reset function, which will simply restart the phone.  If you apply Reboot before resetting Android, you need to be prepared for the fact that this function will delete all data and phone settings. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The difference between soft and hard.  It is equivalent to the words Soft and Hard, coming from SOFTware and HARDware.  This means that if the user uses the software to restart the Android phone, it is SOFT.  Removing the battery would be a hard reset, as it relates to the device‚Äôs hard drive.  Hard Reboot requires the user to do something with the hardware of their phone. </p><p>  Some devices, such as the Nexus 5 or Samsung Galaxy S6, do not have removable batteries.  To simulate the battery, turn on the phone while holding down the power and volume down buttons so that the screen turns off and a reboot animation appears.  If the user did not have time to make a backup before resetting the Android phone, all data from the device will be lost. </p><p>  However, since most of the contents of the device are tied to his Google account, for example, applications that have downloaded, contacts, messages, emails, he can try to recover his data from the cloud. </p><p>  If the user has an Android phone, he can make a so-called Nandroid backup before resetting the Android phone to the factory settings, which can be easily restored later, and the device will be in its previous state. </p><h2>  Backup </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pocketables.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Back up your device" class="if uuid-2937622" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2937622.jpg"></div><p>  Before the factory settings of the phone are returned, make sure that there are backup copies of all important data.  If this is still possible and the phone allows, it is best to make a full backup of your personal information.  To create it before resetting the Android phone, you can use the manufacturer‚Äôs software, for example, Samsung Smart Switch or for older Samsung KIES devices, a Google account, or additional backup applications such as MyPhone Explorer or Helium Backup. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Once you have backed up all your contacts, photos, user settings and applications, you can start the reset - simply through the menu on your smartphone.  This option mainly works on all versions of Samsung and tablets. </p><p>  Before resetting the Android phone to the factory settings, perform the following operations: </p><ol><li>  Go to "Settings" in the phone menu. </li><li>  Open "Backup and reset." </li><li>  In the case of Samsung Galaxy S8, you can do a ‚ÄúReset‚Äù through ‚ÄúGeneral Administration‚Äù.  A message appears stating that you can back up all application data, Wi-Fi passwords, and other settings through your Google Account. </li><li>  Check the box "Restore automatically" if you want to restore the saved data immediately during a new installation of the application. </li><li>  For a hard reset, click on the ‚ÄúReset to factory settings‚Äù option.  There will be a hint about which data and accounts will be affected, the user will also have the opportunity to save information to the inserted SD card. </li><li>  Click ‚ÄúReset device‚Äù and again, before resetting the ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù buttons, confirm this step. </li><li>  Click "Delete All" and enter the PIN or password for security reasons. </li><li>  After that, the device will reboot with the factory settings. </li></ol><h2>  Reset in recovery mode </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.samsung-android-transfer.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reset in recovery mode" class="if uuid-2937626" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2937626.jpg"></div><p>  Sometimes it is impossible to reset the settings, for example, if the user has forgotten his password or the smartphone does not start properly.  Then only a hard reset in recovery mode will help.  It allows you to access the base system of any Android device.  The procedure for resetting the "Android" to the factory settings with the buttons: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  First, turn off the power, and then for several seconds simultaneously press "Power", "Volume Up" and "Home". </li><li>  A menu will appear in which there will be many settings to calibrate the software.  It‚Äôs best to make changes that the user is sure of. </li><li>  In this mode, before Samsung and Android reset to factory settings, they are moved using the volume buttons. </li><li>  Select the element "Erase data or reset factory settings" and confirm the action. </li><li>  Now Samsung Galaxy is reset to factory mode, and user data will be deleted. </li></ol><h2>  Complete deletion of personal data </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikihow.tech" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Complete deletion of personal data" class="if uuid-2937631" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2937631.jpg"></div><p>  Before selling the phone or sending it to the manufacturer for warranty repairs, it is recommended to delete all personal data from the device.  Before resetting the ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù in ‚ÄúSamsung‚Äù, sequentially perform: </p><ol><li>  Reset mobile phone to factory settings. </li><li>  Deleting mobile phone data: manually or using the Shredder application. </li><li>  After resetting the phone, they set up the smartphone again, but this time with a different Gmail address. </li><li>  Download random image samples to your smartphone. </li><li>  Create imaginary contacts and install various applications that have never been used before.  This overwrites old data that cannot be recovered anymore. </li><li>  Turn off the phone and reset the factory settings. </li></ol><p>  A convenient alternative to manual removal is the so-called grinding application.  Restart the phone again to the factory settings, then download the application, for example, iScredder. </p><p>  All Shredder applications are designed to automatically override the old repository with random content, so personal data cannot be restored.  After that, you can reset the phone and sell it without any problems. </p><h2>  Button Recovery Tools </h2><div class="photo" data-original="fossbytes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Button Recovery Tools" class="if uuid-2937638" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2937638.jpg"></div><p>  When it comes to factory recovery, there is little disagreement between Samsung phones, and the user may need to find specific instructions before resetting Android to Samsung.  The main functions of the phone buttons: </p><ol><li>  After turning off the power, press Volume Up + Power until the recovery menu appears. </li><li>  Use Volume Down to scroll through the settings mode and Power to select a mode. </li><li>  Use Volume Down to scroll through the delete position and press the Power button before selecting. </li><li>  Press the Power button to select a reboot system. </li><li>  Some Samsung devices require users to hold the Volume Up and Home keys, and then press and hold Power until the Samsung logo launches a factory reset. </li><li>  While holding Volume Up, press and hold Power until the Fastboot screen appears. </li><li>  Use Volume Down to go to Recovery and press the Power button to select a mode. </li><li>  When the Android icon and the red exclamation mark appear, quickly press the Volume Up and Power buttons simultaneously. </li><li>  Use Volume Down to scroll through the reset and press the Power button to select a mode. </li><li>  After complete cleaning, press the Power button to select the reboot mode. </li></ol><h2>  Soft reset phone </h2><p>  If the device freezes or starts to act very strange or slow, for example, ignores touch input, the first thing the user should try is to perform a soft reset, otherwise known as turning off / on the smartphone.  There are several options for resetting Android devices: </p><ol><li>  Hold the power button until the boot menu appears, and then press Power off. </li><li>  Remove the battery, wait a few seconds, and then install it again.  This only works with a removable battery. </li><li>  Hold the power button until the phone turns off. </li><li>  You may have to hold the button for a minute or more. </li><li>  After any of these methods, wait 10-30 seconds and turn on the phone again. </li></ol><h2>  Immune Touch Screen </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.makeuseof.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Immune Touch Screen" class="if uuid-2937649" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2937649.jpg"></div><p>  Sometimes a situation occurs when the smartphone‚Äôs touch screen does not respond well.  Elimination of external causes: </p><ol><li>  The external environment leads to the fact that the screen becomes less sensitive. </li><li>  The magnet affects the phone, so the touch screen does not work properly, the phone must be kept away from the magnetic field. </li></ol><p>  Static electricity, sweat and grease on the hand cause the phone to not respond to touch.  Before touching the screen again, make sure that the hand is clean, dry and free of static electricity.  Disconnect the Android phone from the power source to stop charging, after which the phone is likely to get rid of the problem.  At particularly high or low temperatures, it is easy to obtain an unresponsive touch screen.  Therefore, in this situation, it is better not to use the phone. </p><p>  The process of eliminating internal failures, or how to reset the ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù on Samsung: </p><ol><li>  Turn off the power and restart the device. </li><li>  Turn off your Android phone and tablet completely. </li><li>  After 1 or 2 minutes, press and hold the power key to turn it on again.  After which the touch screen will work as usual, after rebooting the device. </li><li>  Remove the memory card and SIM card. Sometimes the error may be on the memory card or on the SIM card. </li><li>  If the device provides the function of a removable battery, you need to pull the back cover of the mobile phone and remove the battery. </li><li>  Wait 1 or 2 minutes, then reinsert the battery and turn on the smartphone. </li><li>  Boot the device in safe mode.  This will help you find out if the touch screen crash is caused by a recently installed program. </li><li>  Install an antivirus program.  If a sensor failure does not affect the ability to download applications from the Play Store, download and install an anti-virus application and scan the phone.  This can solve all the problems. </li><li>  Perform screen calibration. </li><li>  Various programs are available on the Play Store that can calibrate the phone‚Äôs touch screen and improve readability.  These programs are very effective, especially when the touch screen responds inaccurately or slowly. </li><li>  Apply Factory Reset Android in recovery mode.  If the screen does not respond at all, then it's time to restart the phone in this mode.  Although this will delete the information stored on the Android device, therefore, you need to apply this solution as a last resort and, if possible, back up and restore Android data in advance. </li></ol><h2>  Rebooting TVs with Android </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.geeky-gadgets.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reboot on Android TVs" class="if uuid-2937688" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2937688.jpg"></div><p>  As you know, any Android device needs a reboot from time to time to ensure smooth operation.  Over time, they become bloated with redundant files and data, and all this makes them work slower.  Performing a factory reset removes all layers and restores the device to its original factory state.  This means that it should work just like new. </p><p>  To perform a factory reset on televisions, you will need a Toothpick keyboard and USB, especially if the remote control does not work.  Perform the following steps: </p><ol><li>  Disconnect the device from power. </li><li>  With the power off, place the pin in the AV or SPDIF port on the back of the box.  If you gently press, a small button will be felt. </li><li>  Press it lightly until you feel that it is pressed. </li><li>  Holding the button, turn on the power again. </li><li>  Continue to hold the button until the logo appears. </li><li>  When this happens, she is released. </li><li>  The TV immediately goes into startup mode. </li><li>  Go to the final stage. </li><li>  If this does not happen, the user will be taken to another screen that asks how to load the device.  A menu should appear. </li><li>  Using the USB keyboard, press until the reset mode is highlighted. </li><li>  Click a tab on the keyboard. </li><li>  Select delete all user data. </li><li>  Wait for the process to complete, select the reboot device and click the tab. </li><li>  After the reboot, provide your login credentials. </li></ol><h2>  Crash: Android stuck in boot process </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.makeuseof.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crash: Android stuck in boot process" class="if uuid-2937691" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2937691.jpg"></div><p>  There are situations when the device is locked and the user does not have a password, in which case you will need to remove the lock application.  Before resetting the ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù using the buttons, if it is stuck in the boot process, perform the following steps: </p><ol><li>  Remove the battery and wait for the capacitor to discharge. </li><li>  At the same time, press and hold the left side button (top and bottom), the right side button (only top) and the I / O button. </li><li>  Continue to hold all the buttons until the logo appears on the screen. </li><li>  Release only the I / O button and still hold the other side buttons. </li><li>  Release all buttons after the Android logo appears. </li><li>  Move to "Recovery Mode" and press the upper right side to confirm. </li><li>  When Android appears with a red triangle, press the button. </li><li>  The device is now in recovery mode. </li><li>  Next, before resetting the ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù buttons to the factory settings, use the right side buttons to move to ‚ÄúReset Settings‚Äù and press the ‚ÄúEnter‚Äù button to confirm. </li><li>  Performing a factory data reset completely erases all data, files, and downloaded applications from the computer's memory.  This is a useful trick for troubleshooting a device or selling it. </li></ol><p>  However, if the user only fixes the problem, it would be nice if he reset Android without data loss. </p><h2>  Useful factory setting tips </h2><div class="photo" data-original="techpointmag.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="https://techpointmag.com/reset-an-android-smartphone-factory-settings-without-data-lose/" class="if uuid-2937698" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2937698.jpg"></div><p>  If the user still cannot fix the problems before resetting the Android phone or the latter does not work, there is a chance that the problem is caused by a device hardware failure.  If the phone is still under warranty, you can replace it or repair it in a service center. </p><p>  If you are using low-level device software or custom ROMs, then it is likely that the recovery program has been overwritten.  In this case, there is an option that the user has a problem with the software, and not with a hardware conflict. </p><p>  When formatting an Android tablet or phone, the user will surely lose all the data on the device.  Thus, it is better to back up, synchronize, or save information in advance. </p><p>  Resetting the device is the last step.  The phone may have software problems.  This may be an error that the user uploaded to the Android system, or he may need to fix the damaged SD card. </p><p>  If charging your phone takes longer than usual, you may need to reboot the device.  Go to "Settings" and "Battery Panel" to check the battery life.  If the application creates a problem, delete it.  Before starting the process, make sure that the battery is charged at least 50%, and the device is connected to a charging device. </p>
