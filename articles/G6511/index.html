It is also noteworthy that the smallest number of citizens of this country lives in this area, but tourists here are a dime a dozen.  Here they are attracted not only by the unique Indian culture, but also by the mild climate, warm sea and bright sun.  It is about when the vacation season in Goa begins, how long it lasts and how it affects the pricing policy, we will tell in this article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="goa season" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/369592.jpg" width="560"></div>

    <h2>  A brief description of the recreation area </h2><p>  Goa resort itself, which has been famous all over the world for far from the first decade, is a narrow strip separating the waters of the Arabian Sea <span>(Indian Ocean)</span> and mountains called Sahyadri.  The very territory of the state is completely strewn with semi-mountain streams that carry their waters to the sea.  It is they who give the whole resort their unique charm and mystery.  It is worth noting that the state is divided into two parts - North and South.  In the first, the number of hotels is not so large, the water in the sea is not clear, and the color of the sand is too far from ideal - snow-white.  Nevertheless, all lovers of trans-party come here, and they spend noisy and cheerful nights here, dancing on the beaches.  The southern part of the state is a place where the cleanest sea is washed by white and golden sands.  A huge number of hotels and spa centers are concentrated here, as well as other entertainment complexes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="when the beach season on goa" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/369590.jpg?1396947342390" width="600"></div>

Why exactly at this time, tourists from almost the whole world come to India - let's try to figure it out.  In the southern part of the country, climatic conditions are divided, so to speak, into three types: winter, summer and rainy season.  Winter lasts from October to March, and during this period the air temperature in the state is approximately 25-30 degrees Celsius.  This season in Goa is considered the most popular for all Europeans who are accustomed to a cooler climate and not too bright sun.  Summer begins in March, which means that the air temperature reaches a relatively record level in the region - 38 degrees in the shade.  At this time, mainly Israelis come to rest here, but you can also meet Russians.  The rainy season in Goa lasts all summer.  There are few vacationers here during this period, as tropical rains with a “wall” may not stop for many days. </p>

    <h2>  If you plan to visit this state ... </h2><p>  All tourists who decide to go to the tropics of sultry India should remember several important facts.  Firstly, when the beach season in Goa begins (and this happens in November and ends in early February), the prices of both rental housing, food, and other trifles, increase several times.  In these months there is a large influx of European holidaymakers, which means for the Indians that people who have money will come to them.  The decline in prices can be seen from February to May, when summer begins, air temperature rises, and mainly Russian tourists and visitors from the Middle East come to Goa to relax.  Note that vacationing in upstate hotels is much cheaper than in villas and penthouses built in the South. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="holiday season on goa" class="if" height="255" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/369591.jpg?1396947388499" width="600"></div>

Therefore, breaking away from the relaxation that local hotels will provide you with, you can visit the most famous and important monuments of architecture, which also carry sacred significance.  The state has many Christian churches that were built here during the existence of the East India Campaign and Portuguese colonization.  Among these, we highlight the Church of St. Francis of Assisi with the Basilica of Jesus, as well as the Cathedral of St. Catherine.  Do not forget to visit the indescribable beauty of the city of Gokarna, near which is the beach of Om - a real gem of the southern coast of Goa. </p><h2>  Resting cheaply and insanely interesting </h2><p>  Based on all of the above, you might think that the holiday season in Goa lasts exclusively in the winter, since then the heat begins, and after it - inexhaustible rains.  In fact, all these frameworks are relevant only to beach vacations and leisure.  But the most interesting vacation option may be a trip through the river valleys of the state, through its tropical forests and endlessly green valleys.  Among these natural attractions, we’ll name Dudhsagar - a waterfall that locals call the “milky ocean”, since the waters that fall from a huge rock into the lake really have a milky hue.  The Chorao River Island is a haven for the most unique birds of various sizes and colors.  Well, a variety of flora and fauna awaits you in the Bondla Nature Reserve, which is located at the foot of the mountain slopes. </p>
