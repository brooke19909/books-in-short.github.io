It is not known how her fate would develop in the future, but the attractive Carrie, constantly dreaming of a modeling career, is leaving for New York to try her luck. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="carrie otis biography" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1136821.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  For her, a whole new streak in life sets in: a charming brunette became interested in agencies, immediately offering her a job in glossy publications with millions of copies.  Expressive staged photographs in Elle magazine instantly bring her popularity, followed by contracts with the brands Calvin Klein and Guess, and the hot photo shoot in Playboy makes her not only famous, but also the most coveted woman in America. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Wild Orchid and Love </h2><p>  Carrie Otis, driving crazy men with an exotic appearance, realizes that the modeling career is short-lived, and begins to look for new ways to earn money and success.  Having learned about the ongoing casting for the role of young Emily in the movie "Wild Orchid", she decides to try her hand.  The beauty with a beautiful figure is noticed by Mickey Rourke, who chooses a film partner with the director Zalman King. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="carrie otis" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1136818.jpg" width="394"></div>

    <p>  They say that on the samples between them immediately established a special relationship.  The famous and vicious film actor falls in love at first sight with a woman who in an amazing way combined experience and spontaneity.  Otis, who knows how to manage men, is seriously interested in Hollywood celebrity. </p><h2>  Failures in the movie and modeling business </h2><p>  The erotic film, which has received scandalous fame for the abundance of explicit scenes, does not become a springboard for a model dreaming of new heights.  Carrie Otis, whose filmography was not replenished with the main roles, decides to leave the film business, realizing that she will not reach any heights in Hollywood.  She tries herself on television, but new projects do not interest the viewer and fail.  After disappointments in the film and television business, the modeling career is also declining. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The charming Carrie Otis, whose photo was printed by all the glamorous publications, is gradually starting to lose her <span>model appearance.</span>  The started health problems always lead the girl with appetizing forms to anorexia.  Wanting to lose weight to madness, the model brings herself to mental illness and complete exhaustion, after which the girl desperately begins to fight for her life. </p><h2>  Victory over oneself </h2><p>  Overcoming a terrible ailment, Otis is gaining the hated weight with which she fought so fiercely so long before.  But I must say that this even benefited the model: <span>Marina Rinaldi</span> notes it and offers to work as a <span>plus size</span> model <span>.</span>  Carrie Otis, whose biography has dozens of covers in the most famous glossy magazines, is once again gaining her much-needed popularity. </p><h2>  A history of destructive passion </h2><p>  The stormy romance that began on the set of Wild Orchid continued after the release of the picture.  In 1992, the couple registered a marriage that lasted only 6 years.  The model often comes to work wearing sunglasses, because she is ashamed to show her bruises that her newly-made husband leaves her almost daily.  An agency that worked with a promising fashion model, without regrets, is breaking the contract with her: no one needs a battered cover girl who often ends up in the hospital. </p>

    <p>  Mickey Rourke and Carrie Otis, whose public life was watched by millions of viewers, realized that this marriage was destroying them from the inside.  The frantically jealous actor behaved like a real animal: he broke her jaw and beat so hard that the ambulance brigade, once called by neighbors, found numerous fractures in the woman. </p><h2>  The addictions of two lovers </h2><p>  Later, Carrie Otis admitted to the dark side of her modeling past, which she did not talk about earlier: ‚ÄúEveryone used cocaine not only as a way to lose weight, but also in order to adapt as much as possible to the cruel world.‚Äù  Living together with the famous actor, who did not hide his addictions, Otis will call a very difficult period in his life.  Together they took drugs and alcohol, but at some point, the model realizes that she‚Äôs just <span>going crazy.</span>  After another beating by her husband, she tries to forget herself, after which she is taken away with a severe overdose.  The model was pumped out, but it was treated for a long time for drug and alcohol addiction, and after recovery Carrie collects things and files for divorce. </p><p>  I must say that Rourke, tormented by destructive passions and frantic love, tried to return her for 8 years, brought himself to a mental breakdown.  And in an interview, he confessed that he was not going to marry anymore, since the only woman he still could not forget was Carrie Otis. </p>

It is known that in 2005 she married a scientist, and now she is the mother of two beautiful girls. </p><h2>  Revelation star </h2><p>  Wanting to tell the whole truth about the terrible business that breaks the fates of young girls, and about her addictions, which almost cost her her life, Otis releases an autobiography in which he describes in detail all the difficulties she had to face. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="carrie otis filmography" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/1138134.jpg" width="405"></div>

    <p>  She admitted that only meditation and yoga developed a strict discipline in her, with the help of which she leads a correct lifestyle.  Carrie frankly talks about anorexia and how she dealt with uncertainty about her own beauty.  Otis is currently involved in charity work and is working on a new book. </p>
