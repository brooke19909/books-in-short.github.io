  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Enlightened absolutism in Russia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  At a certain stage in the development of European countries, a specific <span>form of government</span> arose <span>,</span> called "enlightened absolutism."  The ideas of the Enlightenment had a great influence on the formation and development of enlightened absolutism. </p><p>  <span>Enlightened absolutism</span> in Russia tried to confront such problems as class inequality, the excessive role of the church in the ideological field, the arbitrariness of power.  Enlightened absolutism was based primarily on the principle of "natural rights" of a person, such as equality, freedom, the right to <span>private property.</span> </p><p>  <span>Enlightened absolutism</span> presupposed reforms that would lead to the rule of ‚Äúrational law‚Äù under the guidance of ‚Äúenlightened monarchs‚Äù.  <span>Enlightened absolutism</span> in Russia implied the realization of the ideal of the ‚Äúpublic good,‚Äù that is,  economic well-being, security of peoples and social harmony. </p><p>  When the principles of enlightened absolutism dominated Europe, the supreme power in Russia sought to modernize the country, develop trade and progress in industry.  The need to bring the management system in line with the world level and the ‚Äúspirit of the time‚Äù became apparent.  This was to strengthen the unlimited power of the monarch. </p><p>  Enlightened <span>absolutism in Russia</span> was used as a way of resolving social confrontations and reducing tension in the lower layers of the population. </p><p>  In addition, Russia at that time claimed a major role in the international arena, so Catherine II actively used words and beliefs, not violence. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But they tried to introduce enlightened absolutism in Russia on unprepared soil.  The society is not yet ripe for the adoption of such beliefs and their implementation.  There were no spiritual prerequisites for the transition to such a management system.  The bulk of the population was unenlightened, the national bourgeoisie was practically absent, patriarchy reigned in society.  The development of society was also hindered by the very nature of power.  The complete control of the monarch over all manifestations of public life, which did not want to give up any side of his own power, led to the fact that enlightened absolutism in Russia was extremely contradictory. </p><p>  It is believed that with the help of such a move, Catherine II tried to mislead Europe.  To hide the true nature of her power - that was the purpose.  Catherine 2 and enlightened absolutism is a combination of pro-government and liberal ideas. </p><p>  Catherine II was the central figure of enlightened absolutism.  In many ways, this policy was an expression of the empress‚Äôs own views and qualities.  It was a continuation of the progressive activities of <span>Peter I,</span> attempts to strengthen Russian power. </p><p>  Catherine II was an outstanding historical character.  She directed great efforts to the study of Russia: she actively studied language, history and traditions.  At the same time, she was interested in the ideas of the French Enlightenment.  Some of them found a sincere response in the Russian empress.  Therefore, the characteristics of absolutism in Russia are closely related to its personality. </p><p>  Catherine II perfectly understood that the nobility would not give up their rights and property, but at the same time condemned serfdom.  As a result, fearing for her own security and power, the empress made a choice in favor of a successful kingdom, rather than achieving liberal benefits.  As a result, these measures in Russia were tied to strengthen the autocracy thanks to the modernization of the management system.  At the same time, the rights of the nobility irresistibly expanded, it steadily turned into a truly enlightened class.  With the help of a package of measures, European culture and education spread in Russia.  The authority of Russia abroad has been steadily growing. </p>
