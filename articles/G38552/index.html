It is worth noting that on New Year's Eve all the hotels are already occupied by newly made tourists.  So what attracts Yalta in the winter?  Such a specific vacation has distinctive features that attract travelers.  But before the planned trip, the main issue should be considered - is the weather in Yalta in winter. </p><h2>  History of Yalta </h2><p>  It is still impossible to establish when a settlement appeared in this area.  Jalit is mentioned in the description of the Crimean peninsula, which was compiled by the Arab traveler Al-Idrisi in 1154.  This date is considered the most reliable. </p><p>  In ancient legends, Yalta was called the coast of salvation for the ancient Greek sailors.  In 1783, when Yalta joined the structure of Russia, it was a tiny fishing town of 13 houses and a military redoubt, which at one time was built by Suvorov in 1771. </p><p>  The first thing that they began to build on this earth is the bell tower of the church of John Chrysostom.  After, in the autumn of 1873, it was consecrated, and the emperor issued a decree granting Yalta the status of a city.  In the XIX century the city was significantly transformed.  At this time, there were about a thousand houses and more than twenty thousand inhabitants. </p><h2>  What is the weather like on the peninsula during the winter season? </h2><p>  In this southern city, severe cold practically does not occur, and snow is a completely rare phenomenon. </p><p>  Temperature in Yalta in winter: </p><ul><li>  In December it is rather cloudy and cool, such weather can be compared with March.  During the day, the air temperature is about 5-8 degrees.  Precipitation in the form of wet snow and rain often falls.  This month, it is better to refrain from vacation, as it may not be lucky with the weather.  The reviews of vacationers about Yalta in winter also indicate that unpleasant bad weather overtakes during this period: heavy rains occur and heavy dirt forms on the ground. </li><li>  In the middle of winter, rainfall ends and thanks to sunny, clear weather the earth dries up.  Daytime air temperature does not drop below 5 degrees.  If you go to Yalta for a week in January, then probably the whole vacation will take place in sunny weather.  It will certainly be cool, but nice due to solar heat. </li><li>  February in Yalta is considered the coldest.  Severe storms with strong winds rage almost the entire month.  The thermometer will certainly not please with its indicators, demonstrating subzero temperature.  However, in the second half of February, the weather may change in a positive direction: it will become a little warmer and sunny. </li></ul>

Even at a plus temperature, there may be a feeling of cold. </p><h2>  The benefits of a holiday in Yalta in winter </h2><p>  The biggest plus of holidays in Yalta in the winter season is the absence of an influx of tourists, as happens in the summer.  It is possible to purchase a ticket for an individual excursion for the same price as a group program.  Secondly, the price tags for any services or goods are significantly underestimated.  Therefore, a vacation in Yalta in the winter is considered to be an inexpensive pleasure. </p>

    <p>  Hotels with pool and food offer luxury rooms at a reduced price.  They also arrange discounts, promotions and provide additional services.  A similar picture is observed in nightlife, bars and cafes.  Due to the fact that airfare fares are not in great demand in winter, it will be much easier and cheaper to buy them.  Therefore, the date of dispatch can be thought out slowly. </p><h2>  Disadvantages of vacation in Yalta in winter </h2><p>  Photos of winter and summer views of Yalta are posted in the article.  But how does one rest here in winter?  Of course, this type of recreation has disadvantages.  All negative reviews about Yalta in winter boil down to one point - strong winds.  Because of this, traffic on the <span>cable car is</span> very often canceled <span>.</span>  True, there is still a plus in this: you can climb a plateau with a taxi and go sledding and skiing. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  A professional instructor comes to the aid of beginners for a fee.  Also in winter navigation is closed and therefore all boat trips are canceled. </p><h2>  What to see in Yalta? </h2><p>  In the cold season, there is still something for tourists to do in the city on the Crimean peninsula.

You can ask to organize an excursion to the Massandra Palace and the winery of the same name, to the Livadia Palace, the Swallow's Nest, the crocodile aquarium on the Embankment, the palace of Alexander III and much more. </p>

    <p>  It is definitely worth climbing Ai-Petri (if it is windy - by transport, if not - by cable car).  It should be noted that the plateau is cold, so when you arrive there, you need to dress warmly. </p><h2>  The main attraction of Yalta - Seaside Park </h2><p>  A very popular place on the peninsula is the Seaside Park named after Yuri Gagarin, which pleases with an abundance of trees and flowers that delight the eye until late winter.  It is located in the southwestern part of the sunny city.  Walking along it at the very beginning you can see a monument dedicated to the great Russian writer - Maxim Gorky.  Walking a little further along the avenue, admiring the evergreen trees, it is worth stopping and looking at the color music fountain. </p>

    <p>  There is also an observation deck built in the center of which is equipped with a swimming pool.  On both sides of the pool rotundas in the form of a semicircle are installed.  On one side, a beautiful view of the sea opens, on the other, a forest.  The park impresses with its vast area of ​​twenty-one hectares.  It can count more than two thousand different types of trees, shrubs and flowers.  It is very good to relax on the benches, enjoy the seascape.  If you go directly through the park, you can get to the beach "Dolphin", empty in the winter. </p><p>  There are many walking alleys in the Seaside Park, and residential complexes are located nearby.  Tourists who are looking for accommodation for rent should pay attention to them.  Also in the park there are many entertainments: a bowling center, cafes and restaurants, a shooting gallery, various attractions, nightlife and discos. </p><h2>  Popular hotels to stay </h2><p>  In Yalta, there are no problems with checking into a hotel.  There are a huge number of them for every taste.  Even if year-round hotels are closed for the winter, then there is always the opportunity to rent an apartment or a house.  It is best to choose a rental apartment, because it is affordable.  You should also arrange rental housing directly with the owners of the apartments, as specialists (agents) charge a considerable price for their services. </p>
