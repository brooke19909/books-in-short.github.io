The fact is that such loans allow the population to acquire everything they need in a short time, paying the full cost of production for several months, and sometimes years.  The most popular bank among citizens of the Russian Federation is Sberbank.  There are a large number of different programs for lending to individuals.  Let's consider them in more detail. </p>

    <h2>  Sberbank: general credit conditions, consumer credit </h2><p>  To date, this credit institution has two programs that can be beneficial to consumers.  One of them is the issuance of cash as a loan subject to the guarantee of an individual.  However, these loans do not require collateral.  In order for a citizen to meet the conditions of a Sberbank consumer loan, he must be at least 18 years old and not older than 75 years.  Separate programs for senior citizens are also provided. </p><p>  If we are talking about a loan without collateral, then most often its size does not exceed 1.5 million rubles.  If the borrower brings a guarantor with him, the amount can be doubled. </p><p>  In addition, it is necessary to inform the bank for what purposes it is planned to spend the money.  Based on this, the loan may be inappropriate or targeted.  In the first case, cash may be spent at the discretion of the borrower, but the interest rate will be higher. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Sberbank: consumer credit, loan conditions, necessary documents </h2><p>  First of all, you need to correctly determine your financial capabilities and the prospect of making money.  Sometimes borrowers overestimate their work or do not even suspect that they will soon be cut.  Therefore, once again it is worth considering all the options that will help pay out a loan in the event of a job loss. </p>

    <p>  The procedure for registering a consumer loan does not differ in a lot of difficulties.  Before visiting the bank, it is necessary to prepare all the necessary documents.  To do this, fill out the appropriate application and prepare a copy of the passport.  Also required documents confirming the employment and financial condition of the borrower.  The guarantor must submit the same documents. </p><p>  If the age of a potential bank customer is less than 20 years, it is important to consider that only his relative can act as a guarantor. </p><p>  After the package of documents is ready, you can personally visit the bank branch and transfer all the papers to the operator working in the credit department.  After that, the application is transferred for consideration to the head office.  This usually takes at least 2 business days.  If a positive decision is made, then after about a month the client will be able to get credit funds.  However, this procedure is not the only one. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If the borrower is already a client of the bank, then it provides for more favorable conditions for obtaining a consumer loan from Sberbank.  If a citizen has a salary or <span>pension card of</span> this bank, then the application is considered much faster - within a few hours.  Money can also be obtained almost immediately. </p><h2>  Consumer loans guaranteed by individuals </h2><p>  In this case, we are talking about the same product that has already been described above.  The only difference is that the maximum loan amount can be 3 million rubles.  Individuals may act as guarantors. </p>

    <p>  In this case, the conditions of a consumer loan at Sberbank will be more favorable, since the interest rate is 1% lower than under the same conditions, but without the provision of a guarantor. </p><p>  The documents required for this type of loan are the same as those already described above.  At the same time, they must be submitted not only by the borrower himself, but also by the guarantor. </p><h2>  Consumer loan secured by real estate </h2><p>  Some citizens of the Russian Federation sometimes require a larger amount, and the period for payment should be longer.  Are there favorable general conditions for a consumer loan at Sberbank for this case?  Yes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  So, the bank has developed a separate program for targeted or inappropriate use of loans, provided that real estate owned by a potential borrower is provided as collateral.  In this case, the loan amount can be up to 1 million rubles.  In this case, the amount taken is paid over 20 years. </p><p>  However, in order to obtain such a loan, it is necessary that the amount of cash be less than 60% of the assessed value of the property that is secured. </p><p>  You can also get a loan for 10 years.  In this case, the interest rate will be from 15.5% to 16.5% per annum.  However, the loan amount should not be more than 40% of the estimated value of housing, which is provided as collateral. </p>

    <p>  In order to obtain more favorable terms of a consumer loan at Sberbank and to lower the interest rate a little, you can provide borrower life insurance.  In this case, the overpayment will be reduced by 1%.  It can be reduced by another 1% if the potential customer is the holder of a bank salary or pension card. </p><h2>  Consumer loan to military personnel </h2><p>  In this case, we are talking about people who are participants in special federal funded programs. </p><p>  For example, a soldier can apply for a mortgage and at the same time receive the most favorable conditions for a consumer loan at Sberbank of Russia.  At the same time, the provision of a guarantor is not required, and the loan amount can be up to 500 thousand rubles.  Citizens are given up to 5 years to pay off debt.  If we talk about the interest rate, then it will be only 16.5%. </p>

    <p>  If a soldier wants to get a large amount on credit, then the overpayment will also increase.  In this case, the rate will be 17.5%. </p><h2>  Subsidiary loans </h2><p>  By and large, this definition does not imply entrepreneurship.  That is, we are talking about those people who are engaged in the production, cultivation or processing of agricultural products in their private or leased suburban area.  Moreover, all products are used exclusively for personal use. </p><p>  In this case, the intended purpose of the funds is implied.  Money is issued exclusively in national currency.  The payment period is from 3 to 60 months.  The maximum loan amount differs depending on the debt repayment period.  If this period does not exceed 2 years, then the client can take up to 300 thousand rubles.  If the payment term is up to 5 years, then you can draw up to 700 thousand rubles.  In this case, the interest rate will be approximately 21%. </p>

    <h2>  Who can get preferential rates? </h2><p>  Before taking a consumer loan at Sberbank, the conditions for obtaining loans should be studied in detail.  The fact is that those citizens who are already reliable customers of the bank can count on lowering interest rates.  This means that they must own salary or retirement cards.  Also, additional benefits may be claimed by those for whom appropriate subsidies are provided from the state or from local authorities. </p><p>  In addition, the bank has a positive attitude towards those who have a good credit history. </p><h2>  Are Sberbank consumer loans profitable </h2><p>  Of course, each bank has its own good and bad sides.  If we talk about the conditions of a consumer loan at Sberbank, then they will be very beneficial for holders of salary or pension cards.  It is also worth considering the reliability of this bank.  It has existed for many years and has a huge number of branches not only in Russia. </p><p>  It is also worth considering that Sberbank is an organization with state participation through which pensions are accrued to most citizens of the Russian Federation.  Based on this, it is safe to say that this bank is considered the most reliable. </p><h2>  Credit cards </h2><p>  Another way to get the most favorable terms of a consumer loan at Sberbank is to get a card.  The loan amount in this case can be up to 600 thousand rubles.  If the client does not want to wait for a long time, then he can get an instant credit card with a limit of 120 thousand rubles. </p>

    <p>  The most attractive side of this lending program is that the loan can be repaid without any overpayments.  To do this, it is enough to pay the debt within 50 days from the date of issuing the card.  If for some reason this does not work out, then the interest on the loan will be 25.9%. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  It is also worth paying attention to mortgage lending programs from Sberbank for young families.  In this case, we are talking about spouses who have at least 3 children.  As the initial or one of the subsequent payments, you can use the funds paid by the state for the birth of a second or third child. </p><p>  In addition, local governments provide <span>benefits to young families.</span>  In this case, the overpayment on the mortgage can be significantly reduced due to such subsidies. </p><p>  However, regardless of the selected program or credit institution, you must carefully study the contract.  All controversial issues are best clarified immediately. </p>
