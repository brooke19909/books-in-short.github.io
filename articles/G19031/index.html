Objective information is contained only in the reviews of travelers who have already managed to visit here.  Here are the disadvantages of this institution, they focus on: </p><ul><li>  not very convenient location in the industrial area, somewhat far from the center; </li><li>  there are no coolers with drinking water in the corridors (and the small bottle that they put in the room when checking in is completely insufficient); </li><li>  pleased with the availability of a 24-hour mini-market in the territory (this is very important, given the lack of such infrastructure near the hotel); </li><li>  high prices for accommodation; </li><li>  breakfast is not included in the price; </li><li>  administrators are often absent from the front desk; </li><li>  instead of a king-size bed, the room turned out to be a regular double; </li><li>  unattractive views; </li><li>  the room is poorly prepared for the arrival of new guests - in some places there is garbage from previous guests; </li><li>  with full occupancy of the hotel, there are queues for breakfast, and there are not enough empty seats; </li><li>  some rooms do not open windows (even to airing mode); </li><li>  standard rooms do not have air conditioning; </li><li>  when banquets are held in restaurants, the hotel is noisy; </li><li>  the refrigerator in the room is weak; </li><li>  unreasonably high prices for food in a restaurant (apparently, this is due to the lack of alternative catering establishments in the nearest district); </li><li>  low-quality razors are included in the hygiene kit - they are very dull and very irritating to the skin. </li></ul>
