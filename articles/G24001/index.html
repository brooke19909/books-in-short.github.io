Tula. </p><p>  <span>The base "Aqua Thermo" is equipped with one pool (13 * 25), which has hydraulic devices.</span>  <span>Guest houses are provided for living, there are also cafes and bars where you can drink and smoke a hookah in the evening.</span>  Address: p. Tula. </p><p>  Base "Aquarius" has at its disposal 11 pools for adults and children.  On its territory there are a hotel complex and cottages.  The camp site is located in a very picturesque place - among the mountains, therefore, in addition to treatment, visiting this place, you can get just aesthetic pleasure.  The water temperature in the pools here does not fall below 36 degrees.  Near each house there is a barbecue, where you can cook kebabs from the meat of local pastoralists or fish that can be caught independently in local lakes. </p><h2>  Thermal water treatment </h2><p>  <span>The water in the thermal springs at the outlet has a different temperature, which ranges from 20 to 100 degrees.</span>  <span>Those sources that have a temperature above 60 degrees Celsius have to be cooled by diluting the mineral water with ordinary tap water.</span>  <span>As a result, the water in the pool remains mineral, but the concentration of nutrients drops significantly.</span>  <span>Therefore, such pools no longer have great healing properties.</span>  <span>They nevertheless give a small healing effect, but they cannot be compared with concentrated thermal water.</span>  <span>If you plan to combine rest with treatment, then for this purpose it is better to choose a sanatorium.</span> </p>
