There are many factors to consider.  Moreover, this product is not cheap.  At the moment there are a huge number of any models on the market.  Even with artificial intelligence on board.  But the consumer has one task: to choose the goods that are of the highest quality and adequate in value.  In this regard, the <span>LG F12B8WDS1</span> washing machine is <span>interesting.</span>  We will analyze the <span>reviews of the</span> owners a little later.  First, let's take a look at the technical characteristics of the device.  But first, let's say a few words about the manufacturing company. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wallpapers.ae" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lg f12b8wds7 reviews" class="if uuid-2954996" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2954996.jpg"></div><h2>  About LG </h2><p>  The current manufacturer of high-quality electronics at the very beginning of its path was engaged in the production of household chemicals.  The company was founded in 1947 in Seoul and until the 70s of the last century was engaged in household cleaning.  LG released its first TV in 1972.  Then went washing machines, microwave ovens and other household appliances.  In the late nineties and in the beginning of "zero" the company mastered the production of smartphones and phones.  But household appliances have not gone anywhere.  The company has made good progress in terms of manufacturing consumer electronics.  Her goods are in steady demand.  The LG F12B8WDS7 washing machine, which we started to review, belongs to the category of consumer electronics and has excellent technical characteristics.  However, we will analyze this product in more detail.  Let's start with the appearance of the device.  In this case, it is important. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="likechef.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine lg f12b8wds7" class="if uuid-2954997" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2954997.jpg"></div><h2>  Appearance and design </h2><p>  <span>The LG F12B8WDS7 washing machine is</span> made of metal and plastic.  There is a door with a porthole in front (front loading).  Above it is a control panel covered with plastic.  The central place of the control panel is occupied by a convenient selector of washing modes.  On the right side of the control panel is an informative screen.  It displays almost all the necessary information.  The control panel menu is completely Russified, which can be considered a very good advantage.  In general, the design of this washing machine is standard for devices of this class.  With some additions, of course. </p><p>  The car will perfectly fit into any interior.  Its dimensions are quite compact.  Its height is 85 centimeters, width - 60, and depth - 44. This unit weighs only 59 kilograms.  There will be no problems with transportation.  The diameter of the loading hatch is 30 centimeters.  This will allow you to comfortably load into the car even quite voluminous things.  However, we turn to the technical characteristics of the device.  They are of particular interest. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.holodilnik.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lg f12b8wds7 customer reviews" class="if uuid-2954999" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2954999.jpg"></div><h2>  Machine Specifications </h2><p>  Now let's move on to other features of the LG F12B8WDS7 typewriter.  Its characteristics are as follows.  "Wash" has the design of Direct Drive.  This means that no belt drive is used to connect the motor to the drum.  Only direct gear connection.  It is much more reliable. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The maximum spin speed is 1200 rpm.  This is unrealistic a lot.  And thanks to the successful design of the mechanism, the centrifuge will not particularly affect the wear of individual components.  The volume of the drum is 42 liters.  This is enough to overwhelm almost all the things in the house in one sitting.  As for the noise level, this car is not very loud.  In normal washing, the noise does not exceed 57 dB.  The volume in operation is added only when the centrifuge for spinning is turned on.  Yes, and then not really.  Only 74 dB at maximum speed. </p><p>  For one washing cycle, the machine consumes 1.1 kW / h.  This makes it one of the most economical in the market.  The device also uses water very economically - only 56 liters per wash.  In general, the characteristics of this washing machine are acceptable.  Now it‚Äôs worth considering the more integrated washing programs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="otzovik.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lg f12b8wds7 instruction" class="if uuid-2955009" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2955009.jpg"></div><h2>  Wash Modes </h2><p>  The <span>LG F12B8WDS7</span> washing machine <span>, reviews</span> of which we will analyze a little later, has as many as 13 washing modes.  They include a special mode for sports items (and even sports shoes), a mode for washing outerwear, a special option for washing down jackets and other clothes of the same plan.  There is a gentle mode for bedding and complex fabrics.  Delicate washing will help keep delicate fabrics intact.  There is also a special program for washing wool. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The most interesting thing is that this machine has the option of washing with steam.  This is a revolutionary feature that does little harm to things.  Naturally, the washing time differs depending on the selected mode.  It is worth noting that with any washing mode, the option of saving water is turned on, which is not so bad.  But in some cases, this option can lead to the fact that things will not be washed enough.  For complex cases, it is better to disable this option.  Now let's move on to other features of the washing machine. </p><div class="photo" data-original="otzovik.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lg f12b8wds7 specifications" class="if uuid-2954998" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2954998.jpg"></div><h2>  Spin and other features </h2><p>  The <span>LG F12B8WDS7 washer</span> features advanced spin features and a wealth of other very useful options.  So, for example, the machine has the ability to manually adjust the spin speed.  This option is useful in cases where there are various delicate fabrics inside the machine that can tear at high speeds.  It is also possible to spin with steam.  This process is more gentle than mechanical. </p><p>  There is a convenient option to delay the start of washing.  But it allows you to set the maximum delay time of only 19 hours.  In principle, this time should be enough for almost everyone. </p><p>  There is also an option for intelligent control of the washing process.  And it is always on by default.  This allows the machine to wash clothes most correctly when using a particular washing mode. </p><p>  At the same time, the typewriter clearly lacks the ability to automatically position the drum.  She would have come in handy.  Another omission is the lack of surge protection.  In our latitudes, alas, this is not all as good as we would like.  Therefore, such protection is needed.  There is only one way out - to connect the machine to the network through a power strip with the option of voltage stabilization.  Then she will work for a long time. </p><h2>  Features of the operation of this machine </h2><p>  What other features does the LG F12B8WDS7 washing machine have?  The instruction manual that comes with the machine is written rather clumsily.  It does not give a clear answer to any question related to the operating rules of this device.  Therefore, you have to consider them here.  Firstly, you should not rely on water filters installed in the house.  Our tap water is unrealistically hard.  And its use without special emollients will lead to a quick failure of the washing machine.  Therefore, at each wash you need to add some kind of softener along with the powder (for example, the same "Kalgon"). </p><p>  Secondly, this washing machine is not equipped with a built-in voltage rectifier.  But everyone knows how stress in our country loves to jump.  You will have to use a special surge protector to connect the machine to the electrical network. </p><p>  Thirdly, this washing machine has a unique design of legs that dampens vibration during centrifuge operation.  Do not try to place any rubber mat under the legs (supposedly to further reduce vibration).  This will only increase the vibration and may cause the failure of some components of the washing machine. </p><h2>  Washing machine positioning </h2><p>  How does LG evaluate its brainchild?  It is worth noting that the <span>LG F12B8WDS7, reviews</span> of which we will analyze in the next chapters, is positioned by the company itself as a budget device designed to wash things of a different nature.  But if you look at the price of a washing machine, you get the impression that it belongs to the middle price segment.  Although the set of options she has is really budget.  Probably, this situation turned out because in Russian consumer electronics stores this model is sold at inflated prices.  And if you use the prices recommended by the manufacturer, then you get a budget-class washing machine.  But our "businessmen" frankly do not care about the manufacturer's recommendations. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wallpaperup.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lg f12b8wds7 review" class="if uuid-2955017" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2955017.jpg"></div><h2>  Positive feedback from owners </h2><p>  Now it's time to consider the behavior in real conditions of the LG F12B8WDS7 washing machine.  Customer reviews are a very important factor in any review.  It is with their help that you can understand whether it is worth purchasing this device or not. </p><p>  Owners do not have a single opinion about this washing machine.  Many of them claim that they have been using the machine for several years (it was manufactured in 2014) and there have never been any problems with mechanical components.  Well, quite possibly.  Reliability provides direct drive.  And a unique vibration damping system.  The owners also note that the built-in intelligence copes with washing fabrics of various types. </p><p>  Many also liked the possibility of delaying the start of the wash.  This helps a lot if a person works on a shift schedule.  Many owners noted that after several years of using this washing machine, the water saving option stops working.  Here, most likely, problems with the electronics.  But at the same time, people have found a plus in this fact: things are erased better.  Many more note excellent washing when using steam.  The spinning technology of this washing machine also aroused extremely positive emotions among the owners.  They note that the machine wringes things out efficiently, but at the same time delicately.  As a result, there are no problems with this.  Many also like the informative display and convenient mode selector. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wallpapers.ae" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine lg f12b8wds7 instruction" class="if uuid-2955032" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2955032.jpg"></div><h2>  Negative owner reviews </h2><p>  Oddly enough, but there are b those who were not satisfied with the LG F12B8WDS7 washing machine.  Negative reviews reveal the main disadvantages of this device.  Moreover, at such a price they might not have been.  For example, many users complain that in the water saving mode the machine does not reach things.  As a result, a precipitate of powder is observed on them.  Everything would be fine, but this option is always enabled by default.  Also, people do not like uninformative instructions at all.  Even with a deep study of it, it is not clear what mode should be washed.  A reputable company like LG could make the operating instructions more adequate.  It is also worth mentioning the complaints of the owners about the lack of an option to eliminate power surges.  For many, the washing machine just failed.  I had to change the electronics. </p><p>  However, these are almost all the disadvantages.  They are no more.  The machine is characterized by high reliability and excellent performance in almost any environment.  And this is the most important thing. </p><h2>  Verdict </h2><p>  <span>The LG F12B8WDS7 washing machine, the</span> reviews of which we <span>reviewed a</span> little higher, is an excellent and very reliable product from a manufacturer with a worldwide reputation.  Those who buy this model just do not know the serious problems in its operation.  Despite all its flaws. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we examined the budget washing machine with direct drive and inverter motor LG F12B8WDS7.  The review makes it clear that this is a good and reliable washing machine.  She has many more advantages than disadvantages.  Therefore, it seems to be almost an ideal option for acquisition, based on reasons of economy.  It is unlikely that any manufacturer will sell the same car at a similar price.  And this is despite the fact that Russian retailers wind up a substantial amount when selling interest. </p>
