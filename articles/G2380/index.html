Sunny sea beaches, hiking trails, untouched nature, extreme flights and rafting, cycling - all this can be found in the vast expanses of Russia.  Every year, more and more tourists are attracted to the foothills and ridges of Altai.  Ancient tracts, beautiful wildlife, clean air, clear water - these are the indicators that become key for a doubting traveler. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Utkul Lake Altai Territory fishing" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34978/907196.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The origins </h2><p>  There is an opinion of archaeologists that in ancient times Altai was a coast of the inland sea.  It, experts say, was in the center of a single continent.  And this part of the land had favorable living conditions.  This is evidenced by the fact that for ancient unique specimens of flora and fauna these places are home, including Lake Utkul.  <span>Altai Territory</span> is rich in reservoirs that bear traces of antiquity.  Among them there are salty, mineral, alkaline and fresh.  No other point in the world has such a diversity of forms. </p><h2>  Holiday Options </h2><p>  So, in one of the Zavyalovsky lakes found blue clay, which rejuvenates the skin and body.  In Kolyvani, a chilli plant was preserved, which grew millions of years ago.  Pond Cave decorates a waterfall.  And one of the spring lakes has salt water, similar in composition to the filling of the Dead Sea.  Bathing in it is useful for the treatment and prevention of various diseases and skin rejuvenation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Seven <span>Karakol lakes</span> constitute a complex of glacial origin.  They are located at different levels of the stepped system, connected by a single duct.  The water temperature in them does not exceed 10 degrees Celsius, so few dare to swim there.  The coast is surrounded by beautiful mountain landscapes. </p><p>  Another similar option is Pink Lake.  Its name is due to the special appearance of plankton, which gives the surface a light pinkish tint.  There, the thickness of the liquid is so dense and salty, a person does not drown in it.  The bottom is covered with salt bark, so you should walk on it carefully. </p><p>  A huge variety of lakes has Altai.  Utkul Lake, unlike many reservoirs of foothills, is surrounded by steppes that may seem boring to tourists.  However, people claim that the endless steppes also have their own charm.  Moreover, this vast expanse of water is appreciated mainly for the abundance of fish and the tranquility of nature. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Utkul Lake" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34978/907171.jpg" width="600"></div>

The reservoir has a large area - approximately 10 square meters.  km  Its shape is stretched by almost 11 km, with a width of 1.5 km.  The depth at some points is 10 meters, shallows are also found, but the main space goes under water by 3-5 meters.  The coastline is mostly boggy.

    <p>  There are many fish there, but it is most convenient to catch it from a boat, since access to open water is limited from the shore.  In the first half of the last century carp, bream, silver carp and other species were bred here.  Therefore, it is recommended that those who wish to catch large and rare fish visit Lake Utkul in the Altai Territory.  Fishing in these places will be an unforgettable event for beginners and experienced anglers. </p><p>  ‚ÄúNative‚Äù for these places are roach, perch, pike and other species of fish.  They also reach record sizes here.  The Bulanikha River flows into the lake, and the r.  Utkul.  Thanks to this, there is no stagnation of the masses, which contributes to the natural cleansing and renewal of flora and fauna. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Utkul Lake Altai Territory" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/909309.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Water properties </h2><p>  Inveterate fishermen note the heterogeneity of the bite, which is difficult to associate with some external factors.  However, at a good time, you can catch fish of trophy size there.  Also, Utkul Lake (Altai Territory) can change the transparency of water, which is very important for successful fishing.  At the same moment, in different parts of the stratum, it can have excellent visibility or turn out to be of different degrees of turbidity.  Because of this, the plans of lovers of a good catch often suffer. </p><p>  In the hunting season, hunters often visit Lake Utkul.  Altai Territory boasts an abundance of waterfowl and pine forest.  Hunters during the spring-summer period track the number of populations.  Based on these data, a certain number of hunting permits are reserved. </p><h2>  Advice </h2><p>  Tourists who plan to visit various places of Altai by personal transport, including Lake Utkul, are advised to travel in a cross-country vehicle.  This condition is important because in this region there are few asphalt roads.  On flat ground, patency is complicated after rain, and in mountainous areas it is difficult to drive in any weather. </p>
