    <p>  Near the hotel is a clean beach.  But in order to reach it, it is necessary to cross the railway tracks.  This is best done at a traffic light, although other places are available.  But trains run here often, so it‚Äôs better not to risk it. </p><p>  The hotel area is surrounded on all sides by numerous shops, stalls and cafes.  Almost everywhere you can pay with credit cards. </p><p>  If you drive one stop in the direction of the railway station, you can get to the Sberbank branch.  Dolphinarium and Oceanarium are a short drive from the hotel.  To get to the Olympic Park or Sochi Park, you need to go 40 minutes by bus number 124c. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2>

    <p>  A good option for a good holiday is the hotel "Calm" (Adler).  Reviews 2015-2016 also indicate an acceptable pricing policy of the complex.  Of the main advantages, one can distinguish a favorable location near the beach area.  The only confusion is that there is a railway nearby.  If you choose the right number, then excessive noise from passing trains can be avoided.  The territory has its own parking.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  The rooms always have hot water.  The air conditioner saves from heat.  On the ground floor there is a special room where you can wash and iron things.  Pool water is always clean.  Those who prefer swimming in cool water will definitely enjoy evening dives.  Each guest can count on a set of bath towels.  Rooms are cleaned once every three days.  If you stop only for such a number of days, then you can not get to the cleaning.  Breakfast for an amateur.  Some guests are unhappy with its quality and quantity.  But, despite all the minor flaws, the hotel "Calm" (Adler) is a worthy choice for tourists. </p>
