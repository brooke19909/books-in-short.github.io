    <h2>  History </h2><p>  <span>Paper money</span> appeared in Russia in 1769.  They were called bank notes and represented obligations according to which the bearer could receive coins in the bank for the corresponding face value.  The first series was very poorly protected from counterfeiting - fakes were produced on an industrial scale, which led to depreciation.  Coins continued to be the main means of payment: their value was much higher, as well as public confidence in them. </p><p>  In 1818, new banknotes of Russia began to be issued.  These were the same banknotes, but their quality turned out to be an order of magnitude higher, as well as security.  The paper was much denser, <span>watermarks</span> appeared <span>.</span>  Many specialists were involved in further improvement of banknotes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Banknotes of Russia" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30601/701267.jpg"></div>

The problem was resolved by the release of "chervontsy", which began in 1922.  New banknotes had gold and commodity security, so that their solvency could remain stable (depreciation ceased). </p><h2>  After the collapse of the USSR </h2><p>  After the collapse of the USSR, State Bank tickets remained in circulation, their release by the Bank of Russia continued for some time.  In 1993, a <span>monetary reform</span> took place <span>:</span> State Bank tickets were declared insolvent, they were replaced by the first series of Bank of Russia tickets.  The second series of those was released a year later: the appearance of the notes underwent certain changes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bank of Russia notes" class="if" height="430" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30601/701268.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  In 1995, a new series of banknotes was issued again.  They looked the same as modern banknotes of Russia.  The main differences between them are in the face value: for the 1995 series, it was a thousand times higher than that used now. </p><h2>  After 1998 </h2><p>  The essence of the next monetary reform carried out in 1998 was denomination.  That is - in the change in the denomination of banknotes, accompanied by their gradual, but complete replacement.  New banknotes of Russia were issued.  Their appearance almost completely corresponded to the appearance of banknotes of the 1995 model.  Only the numbers and relief elements designating the face value have changed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="10000 Russian banknote" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30601/701269.jpg" width="567"></div>

Due to strong walking, it quickly lost its properties, due to which its release was soon discontinued.  Only its metal equivalent, a 5-ruble coin, remained in use. </p><h2>  Modifications </h2><p>  Despite the very high quality and security, Russian banknotes continued to need modifications.  Those did not keep themselves waiting: new series of banknotes were released.  First of all, the updates concerned protection against counterfeiting: the increasing capabilities of counterfeiters led to the appearance of fake banknotes, hardly distinguishable from genuine ones. </p><p>  In addition, two completely new banknotes were gradually introduced into circulation.  Their dignity is 1000 rubles and 5000 rubles, respectively.  All the latest protection measures were ‚Äúrun in‚Äù precisely on them, subsequently being added to the new series of notes of lesser value.  For some time, there were rumors that a banknote of 10,000 denominations was being prepared. A banknote of Russia of this denomination should have been the result of the latest developments in the field of banknote protection.  The new "ten thousandth" has not yet been released, but the active improvement of the "thousandths" and "five thousandths" continues. </p><h2>  Signs of authenticity (security measures) </h2><p>  Paper notes of Russia used today are protected by a significant number of special signs of authenticity.  Forging such banknotes is extremely difficult: you will need special expensive equipment, materials and certain knowledge.  Therefore, the creation of small batches of fakes is unsustainable, and it is not possible to establish large-scale production, since it will be easy to detect.  The identification of low-quality fakes is not a difficult task: special signs are given special attention to authenticity, so ordinary citizens who do not have special equipment can also recognize these. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Modern banknotes of Russia" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30601/701270.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Signs of authenticity are divided into several groups.  Some are visible to the naked eye at a certain angle, others are detected by transillumination.  Some can only be recognized in the visible electromagnetic radiation of a certain range. </p><h2>  Tangible </h2><p>  Signs of authenticity of this group are recognized when touched.  The first of these is paper quality.  A low-quality fake is recognized immediately: it is perceived differently by the fingers.  In addition, there are relief elements on the banknotes designed to determine their face value by people with impaired vision.  The inscription ‚ÄúTICKET OF THE BANK OF RUSSIA‚Äù on the front side also has a perceptible touch to the relief. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="New banknotes of Russia" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30601/701271.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In addition, in the manufacture of banknotes of the latest series, a wide protective strip is used that comes to the surface in certain places.  These are perceived as completely smooth.  On banknotes in denominations of 500, 1000 and 5000 rubles, the area where the strip comes to the surface has a much larger size and is made in the form of a narrow window ("stained glass window"). </p><h2>  Visible </h2><p>  The visible signs of authenticity are given special attention.  These Bank of Russia notes have a number of elements that can be detected with the naked eye.  Some of them are visible from any angle.  These include the digital designation of the face value, located in the lower left corner of the front side.  It is made with a special silver paint. </p><p>  The visible signs of authenticity include the ability of the protective strip to change color, noticeable from almost any angle.  Other visible signs of authenticity can be detected by examining a bill for clearance, or by examining it at a certain angle. </p><h2>  Visible to Clearance </h2><p>  Examining a banknote in the light, you can immediately find several signs of authenticity or determine the fake by their absence.  First of all, watermarks are visible.  They are located in the bright fields of the bill, to the left and right of the main image.  One of them duplicates the digital designation of the face value, the other - repeats one of the elements of the main image.  The protective strip is perceived as a solid opaque line. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Banknotes of Russia" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30601/701272.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Microperforation also belongs to this group of signs.  This is applied to all new banknotes, the face value of which is <span>100 rubles</span> and above.  You can find it on the right side of the front side of the banknote.  A figure corresponding to the face value and made of many small holes will be visible in the gap. </p><h2>  Visible at a certain angle </h2><p>  Signs of authenticity visible at a certain angle include moire patterns, elements made with color-changing paint and hidden images.  The moire pattern begins to dimly shimmer with different colors when changing the angle of view.  Color-changing paint gives a similar effect, but it is brighter and applies immediately to the entire image element.  Banknotes of Russia issued in 2004 and later are protected by such methods. </p><p>  A latent image can be found on the ornamental strip, if you look at the banknote lying on a flat surface at eye level.  This is called the Kipp effect: the pattern is designed in such a way that the difference in the shade of the element is detected only at a certain angle. </p><h2>  Hardware Identifiable </h2><p>  The rest of the protective elements deposited on the banknotes of Russia can only be detected by special equipment.  First of all, these include protective fibers embedded in paper.  They become clearly visible in ultraviolet light, like some elements of the image.  There are also infrared tags that are noticeable in the light of an <span>infrared lamp.</span> </p><p>  In addition to those visible in a certain range, very small image elements include microtext and some patterns that can be detected by hardware features.  They can only be detected with a sufficiently strong magnifier.  Also, some sections of the surface of banknotes are processed with a special composition having magnetic properties.  By such tags, authenticity can be established using appropriate equipment. </p>
