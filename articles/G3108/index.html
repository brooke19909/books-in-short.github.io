    <h2>  Dimensions </h2><p>  What do you pay attention to initially?  Of course, at such an indicator as the size of the device.  Since we have a tablet in front of us, the dimensions should not be very small.  Otherwise, you can call Prestigio Multipad 4 the most ordinary smartphone. </p><p>  The dimensions of our tablet, to be honest, are within the normal range.  You cannot call them too big or small.  Rather, moderate: 257x10x1075 millimeters.  Such a device will be convenient for both entertainment and study.  It is convenient to carry it, because the place of such a tablet in a bag takes a little.  It is ultra thin.  And this fact cannot but rejoice.  This device also weighs not very much - only 680 grams.  For a tablet with such dimensions, this is not so much.  True, there are many more characteristics that should be considered before buying.  Which ones?  Let's get to know them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Display </h2><p>  For example, another point regarding dimensions is nothing more than a display.  At Prestigio Multipad <span>4 Diamond</span> (and other models) it is quite good.  The diagonal of the device is 10.1 inches.  Just the perfect indicator, which will ensure high-quality work with text, the Internet and games.  This is exactly what many buyers need.  After all, tablets are often bought to a greater extent for entertainment.  In addition, you can find some models with 8 inches.  Also quite worthy. </p><p>  Prestigio Multipad 4 Diamond is also equipped with a good screen resolution.  It is 1280 by 720 pixels.  Watch movies in high quality or Full HD?  Easy!

    <p>  Prestigio Multipad 4 also has a special protective glass.  It is able to <span>protect the tablet</span> from sunlight and moisture.  This means that even in sunny and clear weather you can see a clear and bright image on the display.  In addition, this device is capable of transmitting up to 16 million colors and shades.  Do not be surprised at this indicator - this is normal for modern devices. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  CPU and system </h2><p>  In addition to the screen, characteristics like a processor and an operating system are now important for any phone or tablet.  They are more responsible for the operability and speed of the device.  The Prestigio Multipad 4 Diamond 7.85 3G is what many customers are looking for.  According to users, this model is of good quality, as well as power. </p><p>  The processor in Prestigio Multipad 4 (10.1 inches and other models) is quite powerful.  It has 2 cores and a clock frequency of 1.6 GHz.  This is enough for a tablet, especially for a gaming one.  In principle, you can always find a more powerful processor on other tablets.  But it‚Äôs just in Prestigio Multipad 4 that all the characteristics are built in such a way as to provide the buyer with maximum power and return. </p><p>  As for the operating system, everything is extremely banal here.  <span>Prestigio</span> Multipad 4 <span>tablets</span> (Diamond 7.85 or other types) have an Android-based OS installed.  Probably, now most of these devices are equipped with it, only different versions.  In our case, for example, 4.0.4.  If you wish, you can easily update it to the latest version.  But the most popular among them is 4.2.2.  It is with this version that you can run a lot of games and applications on Prestigio Multipad 4 Quantinum and other types of this tablet.  Incidentally, the latter differ only in size and a little in terms of the proposed memory.  Therefore, you can describe the characteristics of Prestigio Multipad 4 for most models at the same time.  So let's try to figure out what else this product is good or bad. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  RAM </h2><p>  RAM for the phone and tablet is extremely important.  It allows you to fully activate all the features of the processor.  So it is also worth paying attention to.  Fortunately, the Prestigio Multipad 4 7.85 3G tablet boasts a pretty decent indicator in this area.  After all, it has 1 GB of RAM. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="prestigio multipad 4 diamond 7 85 3g" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/960624.jpg" width="538"></div>

    <p>  At first glance it may seem that this is not enough.  Indeed, now there are tablets with 2-4 GB.  Only if we take into account the processor, we can understand that there is enough RAM in the tablet.  According to many buyers, 1 GB is enough to simultaneously launch several of the most powerful and latest innovations in the gaming industry.  This is what many crave, especially children and adolescents.  They often need tablets exclusively for games.  And 1 GB of RAM, which is equipped with Prestigio Multipad 4 Diamond 3G (and other analogues), is most suitable for this lesson.  But why?  For what reason should you not look at models with 2 or 4 GB of RAM?  We will talk about this a bit later.  In the meantime, let's pay attention to another feature that is important for any tablet. </p><h2>  Flash memory </h2><p>  Of course, any device needs memory.  But not operational, but built-in.  The one on which our personal data will be stored.  And the more this indicator is on the phone or tablet, the better.  Prestigio Multipad 4 Quad and its analogues can boast a pretty good amount of space.  It is 16 GB. </p><p>  But in reality, only 14 GB is at the disposal of the user.  2 of them are given to the operating system and tablet resources.  In principle, if from time to time to clean the device from a variety of "junk" and unnecessary documents, then this place is enough for a long time.  In general, 16 GB for a tablet is normal.  Yes, sometimes you can find models with 32 and even 64 GB.  But only pay for such a device will have an extremely large amount.  If you don‚Äôt have enough space for Prestigio Multipad 4, then you can resort to one small trick. </p><h2>  Memory card </h2><p>  It is about using an additional memory card.  Some tablets currently lack such an option.  But not Prestigio Multipad 4 7.85.  The thing is that in these models there is a separate slot for a memory card.  Its format is microSD.  This is the most popular type of memory card.  So, if necessary, the space on the tablet can be slightly increased. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="prestigio multipad 4 10 1" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/960623.jpg" width="600"></div>

          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Of course, there is a limit to everything.  And memory cards also have it.  The maximum allowable amount of additional memory for Prestigio is 128 GB.  Above this indicator, you will begin to have problems with the operating system.  For added security, it is recommended that you do not fill it up completely when using an optional memory card.  Leave about 1 GB blank.  This will avoid unnecessary problems with the device.  For example, it will save you from system crashes and prevent the <span>tablet from slowing down</span> when processing a large amount of information. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  For the tablet, communication also plays a rather large role.  After all, basically such devices are used for games and work on the Internet.  So, the connection should be good.  Otherwise, all meaning is lost. </p><p>  Prestigio Multipad 4 Quantum, like many models, supports not so many signal types.  Only 2G and 3G, as well as Wi-Fi.  This is enough for a modern tablet.  Only the Prestigio does not support the popular 4G network so far.  So you have to rely only on high-speed Internet, obtained through 3G and Wi-Fi. </p><p>  In addition, a rather important point regarding communication is the availability of Bluetooth 4.0 and a USB socket.  This allows Prestigio Multipad 4 to synchronize with your computer, as well as receive and receive files wirelessly at high speed.  Sometimes it can be really useful.  Especially when it comes to transferring movies or big games. </p><h2>  Slots </h2><p>  It is also worth paying attention to the presence of slots on the tablet.  The more diverse they are, the more functional this or that model is considered.  In our case, we can say that Prestigio Multipad 4 is equipped with quite extensive functionality.  What is it about? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="prestigio multipad 4 diamond 7 85" class="if" height="344" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/960622.jpg" width="600"></div>

          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  For example, that in this model there is 1 slot for a standard memory card, as well as a USB connector.  It is in every tablet.  But there are also features.  For example, Prestigio, like most analogues, has a headphone jack.  It is standard - 3.5 millimeters.  This means that if necessary, you can even connect speakers.  Sometimes this technique is extremely useful. </p><p>  But also the Prestigio Multipad 4 has a connector for an HDMI cable, that is, you can connect the tablet to a TV for example.  And if necessary, watch a movie on the big screen.  Very useful and pleasing to many buyers feature.  However, it does not greatly affect the technical characteristics.  Only on the sympathy of potential consumers. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  It is also worth paying attention to the fact that the Prestigio Multipad 4 is equipped with a very powerful battery.  It allows you to work with the device for a long time without recharging.  It seems to be a trifle, but very nice.  Many users try to choose a tablet that will work for a long time.  And that is important.  Especially if you prefer to play with the device. </p>

    <p>  The battery capacity of the Prestigio is 6400 mAh.  This indicator provides active work for about 6.5 hours.  But the device is able to ‚Äúwait‚Äù for operation for about 3 weeks.  And this is provided that all functions such as the Internet or alarm will be disabled. </p><h2>  Price tag </h2><p>  The last thing to consider when trying to choose a tablet for yourself is nothing but the price.  And it must match the quality.  In the case of Prestigio Multipad 4, it is. </p><p>  In general, this device costs about 12-15 thousand rubles.  For many, this is a lot of money.  But at sales, you can find a model for about 8-9 thousand.  Given the power and capabilities of the device, the price is acceptable.  And it pleases so many buyers.  If you see Prestigio Multipad 4 for 5,000 or less, then do not buy at that price.  This is a real fake.  A good gaming tablet cannot be too cheap.  So be careful. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Well, now it's time to take stock of our talk today.  As you can see, we figured out what the Prestigio Multipad 4 3G tablet is like.  You may notice that this is a very decent device at an attractive price.  But here's the answer to the question of whether to buy Prestigio, everyone should for himself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="prestigio multipad 4 diamond 3g" class="if" height="296" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/960620.jpg" width="600"></div>
