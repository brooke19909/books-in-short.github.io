Popular coat models for women</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A coat is a wardrobe item necessary for many of us, which everyone wears with pleasure.  There are different <span>types of coats,</span> and you need to choose the option that is ideal for your silhouette.  A one-piece sleeve, the pattern of which is given in the well-known edition dedicated to cutting and sewing, serves as an ornament for any coat. </p><h2>  1 Piece Coat </h2><p>  Sewing a coat with a one-piece sleeve is distinguished by a special pattern.  Its peculiarity is that the armhole line is completely or partially absent, therefore the back of such a coat is cut out along with the sleeves, and shelves are also cut out. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="one-piece burda coat pattern" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/723140.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Such products can be of various shapes and silhouettes; their patterns are created on the basis of models with a set-in sleeve. </p><p>  In order for such clothes to fit successfully on the figure, you need to choose the material from which it will be made.  As a rule, fashionable women's coats are sewn from natural fabrics, mainly woolen.  The construction of a one-piece sleeve for such patterns is based on the already known patterns developed by designers of fashion houses. </p><h2>  Jacket with one-piece sleeve </h2><p>  Jackets are one of the most popular types of clothing.  You can sew such a jacket yourself, especially if you use the pattern from the magazine "Burda Moden". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To make a jacket, you will need two meters of raincoat fabric and two meters of padding polyester on the lining.  Sixty centimeters long lightning can also be used.  All this is necessary to create a unique product exactly to your size.  The one-piece sleeve, the pattern of which is given in the magazine "Burda Moden" for 2002, greatly simplifies the creation of such a product. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="one-piece sleeve pattern" class="if" height="428" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/723138.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Sew such a jacket with a sewing machine and overlock.  It is advisable to use both for better seams. </p><h2>  Tweed coat </h2><p>  Tweed is a practical and lightweight material that often makes outerwear.  Winter tweed items often appear in the collections of world leading designers such as Aleksander Wang, Dolce &amp; Gabbana.  Now, for sewing models, not only natural tweed is used, but also its synthetic substitutes. </p><p>  Tweed coat models are sewn using modern sewing techniques, using a four-thread overlock.  Winter species sew on the lining.  Usually this coat is buttoned. </p><h2>  Leather coat </h2><p>  If you plan on tailoring a coat, then pay attention to the creation of such a leather product.  At the beginning of the twentieth century, Chekists wore such things, and in European countries they were worn by taxi drivers and pilots.  Then this form was a purely masculine version of clothing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tailoring a coat" class="if" height="404" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/723111.jpg" width="589"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the mid-fifties, Christian Dior created the first female model of a leather coat.  Such coat models were enjoyed by the fair sex.  They were very practical, because a leather product does not let in either wind or moisture.  But leather is an expensive material, and whoever wanted such a model often sewed it from leatherette. </p><p>  Modern designers create a variety of models of leather coats, from a variety of types of leather.  Also for such types of outerwear suede and morocco are used. </p><p>  The fashionable colors of such leather coats are black, steel, terracotta, green, brown.  The length of such a thing to the knee looks very impressive, but the maxi length for a leather coat will also be good. </p><h2>  Cashmere coat </h2><p>  A good pattern for a coat with a one-piece sleeve, "Burda Moden" often offers such.  Cashmere outfits look exquisite and are quite suitable for an evening appearance. </p><p>  Cashmere is an expensive material because special conditions are needed to make it.  It is made from the fluff of mountain goats that graze in the meadows.  As a result, the material is light and warming. </p><p>  If you want to wear a cashmere coat, then keep in mind that such material often needs to be washed, and it cannot be machine washed.  The automatic machine will cause the cashmere item to simply fade, and spools will begin to form on its surface. </p><p>  After washing, the cashmere coat is dried on a cotton cloth and does not even need to be ironed.  The beige cashmere coat that celebrities in Western cinema love to wear looks great. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The beige cashmere coat is always elegant, with well-chosen accessories you can create your own unique look.  If you come across a successful pattern of a coat with a one-piece sleeve, "Burda Moden" offers such, then you can try to sew such a coat yourself. </p><p>  A black belt, a vest with a white shirt, and a leather briefcase are perfect for a beige coat. </p><h2>  Silk coat </h2><p>  Coats can be worn not only in winter.  If you are a fan of these clothes, then there are models designed for spring and summer.  The machining of a whole-cut sleeve in such models is especially meticulous. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fashionable women's coats" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/723124.jpg" width="225"></div>

Armani designers regularly show on the catwalk long silk products without a belt, the Bian fashion house shows a coat on which rhinestones and sequins are sewn. </p><p>  This summer product, in fact, is an elongated jacket in which there is no lining.

In many cases, a summer coat looks like a dress and in the warm season performs, rather, a decorative function.  This is an evening outfit that will help you look stylish in any company.

    <p>  Knitted coats have many advantages.  First of all, they always look stylish.  Then, such a coat usually costs less and weighs a little, which is important for clothes used in cold weather. </p><p>  A knitted coat goes well with blue jeans and ugg boots, long knitted coats combined with stiletto heels. </p><h2>  Knitted coat knitting </h2><p>  A knitting coat will come in handy not only in winter in cold weather, but also in spring and summer on a cool evening.  To create such a coat you need about a kilogram of yarn, you can take acrylic and cotton.  You can take synthetic yarn, consisting of half wool, half acrylic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="one-piece sleeve modeling" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/723136.jpg" width="305"></div>

    <p>  To knit a product of size 40, you need to dial the third number 122 loops on the knitting needles and knit in front rows.  There is a good pattern for a coat with a one-piece sleeve, ‚ÄúBurda Fashionable‚Äù also gives such knitting.  To give the product an A-shape, you need to make reductions at the end of every ninth row, knitting two loops together front.  Knitting in this way forty centimeters, then knit directly another twenty centimeters. </p><p>  Here the armhole begins, in order to indicate it, you need to close three loops from each edge, then close two loops in each second row.  Then we knit straight again.  After another twenty centimeters, five loops are closed for the bevels of the shoulder and at the same time ten loops are closed for the neck.  The second side is done symmetrically. </p><p>  Shelves fit with round edges.  In order to make a rounding, first you need to put on the knitting needles twelve loops and in every second row to put on the needles another seven loops.  After the ninth addition, start on the other side to perform the additions, as on the back, to get an A-shape.  Then we knit directly, we perform armholes in the same way as on the back.  Similarly, we form the top.  Similarly, we knit the right shelf. </p><p>  To create sleeves, you need to dial 50 loops on the knitting needles and knit with the front surface.  To get the bevels of the sleeve, you need to add one loop in each 11 row, then one loop in each 10 row.  After thirty-five centimeters, we form a sleeve ridge.  To do this, we close three loops on each side, and then in each second row we close two loops once.  Finished parts need to be moistened, allowed to dry and then joined using a kettel seam. </p><p>  Please note that when worn this product may become ten centimeters longer. </p><h2>  Crocheted coat </h2><p>  A spectacular coat made by a hook will decorate your figure very much, and if you knit from tight threads, you can also create a thing that will warm you in the winter cold. </p><p>  A one-piece sleeve, the pattern of which is often given in knitting patterns, can also be present in such a product with a hook.  Very suitable for any type of figure coat with a diagonal effect. </p><p>  In order to knit it, you will need nine hundred grams of light pink yarn and six hundred grams of red yarn with a composition - half wool, half acrylic.  You need to crochet the fifth number. </p><p>  When knitting, you will alternate single crochet and embossed columns that are knitted like a crochet, front loop, while the hook is inserted three rows below.  Modeling a one-piece sleeve when crocheting is much easier than when sewing. </p><h2>  Crochet coat process </h2><p>  We pick up a chain of 68 loops with a pink thread, knit, alternating single crochet and embossed columns.  In each twentieth row we decrease one loop. </p><p>  When the number of loops is equal to 58, we continue to knit with a straight fabric to the armholes.  The armholes begin to knit at the height of the canvas 64 centimeters. </p><p>  To do this, we close six loops on each side, as a result we get 46 loops, on which we continue knitting.  It is necessary to finish the part at a height of 85 centimeters. </p><p>  For the right shelf, we hook 32 loops and knit, making the same reductions as on the back.  At a height of 64 centimeters, we reduce six loops on one side, after a few more centimeters we need to close three loops on the other side to cut the neck.  We finish the work at a total height of 85 centimeters. </p><p>  A pattern coat with a one-piece sleeve (Burda Moden often offers such) is also suitable in this case.  The sleeve is knitted as follows: we collect a chain of 36 air loops and knit, adding 1 loop four times in every eighth row.  At a height of 35 centimeters, we begin to form a sleeve ridge, for this, in each second row we close two loops, and when 12 loops remain, we close all the loops. </p><p>  You can also make a collar for such a product: we make a chain of 64 air loops with a crochet, then we knit a familiar pattern to a height of twelve centimeters.  Then we collect the entire product, connecting its parts with each other.  Before that, it is advisable to wet all its details, wash and dry.  Wash by hand and dry in natural conditions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="machining a whole sleeve" class="if" height="468" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/724337.jpg" width="438"></div>
