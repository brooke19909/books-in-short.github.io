After all, many do not know what cameras are and how they differ.  Therefore, before buying, the user must answer a number of questions that will help find the most suitable option. </p><p>  But first of all, you need to know what types of cameras are.  As a rule, they are classified into compact and mirror.  The first type also includes transition bridge and super zoom cameras with a wide range of focal length changes and greater control over exposure settings.  Their lens is built into the body and cannot be replaced. </p><p>  Mirrorless cameras are close to the second type, since they allow the photographer to work in manual, automatic and semi-automatic modes like SLR cameras.  They have interchangeable lenses. </p><p>  Now we will dwell on cameras of different types in more detail. </p><h2>  Compact entry-level cameras </h2><p>  When deciding which camera is best for a novice photographer, you need to pay attention to inexpensive small-sized devices, simple, no frills, ideal for everyday shooting.  Often they are powered by AA batteries, which quickly lose their charge and therefore are not very economical.  The best solution is to invest in a set of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries and a charger.  It's more expensive, but such batteries provide better battery life and can be used again and again, reducing the total cost of ownership of the camera. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Most budget compacts are equipped with lenses with 3-10x optical zoom, which usually corresponds to 35-105 mm.  This range is convenient for normal shooting, although some cameras expand it a bit, offering ultra-wide or extra-long focal lengths.  A camera with a 28 mm lens is ideal for group shots and landscapes, and with a 140-150 mm lens for capturing remote details.  Which camera is better for a novice photographer?  As a rule, compact zoom over 8 times is available for compacts above the average level; therefore, such models are worth closer examination. </p><p>  In recent years, there has been fierce competition between camera manufacturers in providing budget cameras with the functionality of high-end devices.  During this time, the size of the LCD screens has gradually increased.  A 2.7-inch display is standard on low-cost models, and 3 ‚Äùoptions are increasingly common.  This does not directly improve the quality of photographs, but provides a better overview of the scene and viewing the footage. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.currys.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikon Coolpix A300" class="if uuid-2631796" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2631796.jpg"></div><p>  Choosing which <span>camera is</span> better <span>for a novice</span> photographer, you should follow the advice of professionals and pay attention to image stabilization.  Although such systems in cameras of this type are not as perfect as in higher-end models, they usually do their job and can help capture clearer shots. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Is it so important for a novice photographer what resolution the camera has?  Professional photographers do not recommend giving too much importance to the number of megapixels that compact cameras have, since they are all equipped with sensors with sufficient resolution.  In fact, a large number of pixels can even damage image quality (especially when shooting in low light), and photos take up a lot of space on the memory card.  If there is no particular reason for creating larger images, remember that less is better. </p><p>  Compact cameras are great for novice users and children, but those who want to control the shooting settings should consider other options. </p><h2>  Standard compact cameras </h2><p>  Most compacts of this type cost 8-20 thousand rubles.  Some of them offer wide-angle lenses, and almost all of them work on rechargeable lithium-ion batteries that come with the camera.  At the budget end of the range, special attention is paid to style - thin and colorful cases with many fashionable features, such as built-in Wi-Fi and face and smile recognition.  More expensive models may include zoom lenses with larger focal lengths and larger LCD screens, which may even be touch-sensitive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cameralandsandton.co.za" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony Cyber-shot DSC-W800" class="if uuid-2631818" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2631818.jpg"></div><p>  What kind of cameras are of this type?  Many compacts offer something like artificial intelligence, which automatically adjusts a number of settings depending on the subject.  According to professionals, this is ideal for less confident users, who may be confused by the abundance of adjustments.  If the user likes style and mobility, then the Sony Cyber-shot lineup is a good place to meet, since many compact cameras are either thin, bright and saturated with technology, or differ in all of the above qualities, while the Canon IXUS line is also always highly rated . </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Although these cameras are good versatile models, they can scare away users with big hands or those who are used to larger controls.  With the exception of cameras with a touch screen, in which control is carried out through a series of virtual buttons on the LCD, compacts are equipped with a set of buttons and a navigation panel.  Often they are quite small, and sometimes it is difficult to understand what is being pressed, especially since not all cameras have their markings clearly marked. </p><p>  Cameras of this type are suitable for users who prefer stylish things. </p><h2>  Compact for enthusiasts </h2><p>  In this section, we will talk about what kind of cameras there are that provide high quality images in a small case.  This is usually achieved with a larger sensor and high-quality optics, as well as manual control and superior assembly.  With good lighting and using the right photography technique, you can achieve the results that SLR cameras have.  This makes them ideal backup cameras for more expensive models.  Even when the light level drops, the noise control offered by the compacts is generally good, although inferior to the best professional devices. </p><p>  These are the cheapest cameras that support recording in RAW format, used by those who want to take the whole process of processing photos into their own hands.  Some models have a sync contact for connecting optional accessories such as the viewfinder and flash.  Cameras with <span>telephoto lenses are</span> sometimes equipped with geolocation modules that record the location of the scene in the footage. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bhphotovideo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Panasonic DMC-FZ300" class="if uuid-2632488" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2632488.jpg"></div><p>  Some cameras offer high-resolution LCDs, which are found in SLR cameras.  Since they allow you to enlarge an image without sacrificing quality, according to professionals, they are ideal for checking the detail of an already finished shot or for checking focus while composing a frame. </p><p>  In addition, advanced compact cameras with a large image sensor (more than an inch), full manual control, recording in RAW format and a lens with a wide relative aperture begin to appear.  Great examples of these types of models are the Canon G9X and Sony RX100 Mark IV. </p><p>  Professional compact cameras are great for creative photography and shooting in low-light conditions, but not for those who are trying to save money or are looking for point-and-shoot devices. </p><h2>  Super Zoom Cameras </h2><p>  Cameras of this type combine the flexibility of a wide focal range with a small body.  Many of them offer manual exposure control (for example, with the option of aperture priority or shutter speed, and some also allow you to manually focus attention, which means that the photographer can make many decisions on his own. </p><p>  One important aspect of an over-zoom camera is its image stabilization system.  When shooting at longer focal lengths, more effort is required to keep the frame clear, which makes the image stabilization system in the lens or sensor vital.  In some cameras, this is implemented through manipulation of sensitivity, i.e., by increasing ISO.  Professionals advise avoiding this if alternative solutions are available. </p><p>  Another popular feature of these models is the rotatable LCD screen.  It is detached from the case and allows you to shoot in otherwise extremely uncomfortable positions (for example, at ground level).  It can also help when shooting in bright conditions, as it allows you to find a position in which glare on the screen is minimal. </p><p>  A key aspect of the camera is its magnitude.  There are models with a more modest focal length, but with a wide aperture (for example, Panasonic FZ200).  On the other hand, cameras are available with a huge range of focal lengths (for example, the Nikon P900 with an incredible 83x zoom). </p><p>  Cameras of this type are great for outdoor activities and travel, but they no longer fit in your pocket. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.startribune.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikon P900" class="if uuid-2631848" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2631848.jpg"></div><h2>  Mirrorless cameras with interchangeable lenses </h2><p>  Although compact <span>system cameras</span> have only become available in recent years, they have significantly changed the photo market.  Some models use the same sensor as digital SLR cameras, and they can achieve the same standard for image quality.  Others, such as Pentax Q, use small sensors to further reduce camera size.  They can be made much smaller due to the lack of a traditional SLR camera.  This means, however, that they do not have an optical viewfinder.  Instead, an electronic viewfinder or LCD screen is available for composing the frame. </p><p>  Since the market segment for mirrorless cameras is new and growing, the entire range of lenses for them is not yet completely filled.  One of the advantages of such optics is that, like the cases on which it is installed, it can be made smaller and lighter.  For those planning to travel the world, a multi-lens hybrid case may be the best solution in which image quality is key.  The Micro Four Thirds line was the first of these systems to come on the market, and today it offers the most opportunities, in particular because compatible optics are being developed by Olympus and Panasonic, as well as by some third-party manufacturers. </p><p>  Each of the largest players in the camera market produces at least one compact system camera, however, at present, only Sony produces a full-frame version. </p><p>  Mirrorless models are an excellent alternative to high-end compacts, especially for street photography and travel.  Professionals do not recommend using them for shooting objects that require fast focusing, which are provided by SLR cameras, and for those who are used to using the viewfinder. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ifixit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon EOS 6D" class="if uuid-2631898" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2631898.jpg"></div><h2>  What cameras are: DSLR cameras </h2><p>  SLR cameras are what many people think of when it comes to advanced photography.  Thanks to serious advances in technology, it is no longer axiomatic that they offer better image quality than mirrorless ones, but this is a completely different shooting style, which some prefer more.  In general, it is still true that the widest range of optics is available for DSLR, so that the photographer can choose the one that was created specifically to meet his requirements. </p><p>  What are the lenses for SLR cameras?  Basically, they are classified by focal length, maximum relative aperture, type of mount, sensor format.  For example, optics can be normal, wide-angle, super-wide-angle, macro, telephoto, with a fixed or variable focal length. </p><p>  Most consumer DSLR cameras offer APS-C format sensors, which are slightly larger than Micro Four Thirds but smaller than full-frame ones.  This means that the conversion factor is about 1.5x for any mounted lens, increasing the equivalent focal length.  The disadvantage of this solution is that it is more difficult to achieve wider angles, and usually this means investing in a full-frame housing or ultra-wide-angle optics that can withstand partial cropping.  Over time, full-size sensors are beginning to become more affordable, with Nikon and Canon offering entry-level full-frame cameras such as the Canon EOS 6D and <span>Nikon D610.</span> </p><p>  Digital SLR cameras currently have the widest range of accessories.  Regardless of which professional camera is selected, in addition to many lenses, an external flash can be connected to it.  Many models are equipped with an additional grip with batteries, which provides longer battery life and makes shooting in portrait orientation easier.  Since high-definition video has become a standard feature, stereo sound recording can be invested in external microphones, and the small depth of field offered by the larger sensor can be useful for creative photography and shooting in low light. </p><p>  Professionals advise using SLR cameras to get maximum quality pictures, shoot moving objects and record videos.  However, they are expensive and large. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ephotozine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX100 Mark IV" class="if uuid-2631837" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2631837.jpg"></div><h2>  Which camera is best for the photographer: weight and portability </h2><p>  The user must be realistic about how seriously he plans to take a photograph. </p><p>  Carrying a large and massive camera is difficult and inconvenient, and owners who are not very serious about shooting will most likely leave it at home and want to buy something more suitable.  This is a really important factor, so before buying, you need to go to the store, take the camera and feel it in your hands just to make sure that its weight and design really satisfy the potential buyer. </p><p>  The size and weight of the camera is not entirely proportional to the quality of the images that can be obtained with its help, so thinking that more is better is not worth it.  In general, compact cameras, as a rule, are better adapted to be carried in your pocket than others, while SLR cameras require much more effort.  Mirrorless models, as a rule, occupy a middle position, but there are noticeable exceptions that exceed some DSLRs in size. </p><h2>  Sensor Size and Pixels </h2><p>  In digital cameras, image capture occurs on the so-called  a sensor that looks like a piece of electronic film.  Tiny elements, called pixels, on this sensor record the details of the photographed object. </p><p>  You might think that the more pixels a sensor uses, the more details it can convey, and theoretically this is true.  But in real life, this is only part of the truth.  More pixels do not always mean better pictures, as camera designers have to balance between the resolution of the sensor and how small the pixels must be so that they can fit on the sensor. </p><p>  Small pixels look like small speakers ‚Äî they rattle a little.  What are the matrices of the camera?  In general, compact cameras use very small image sensors with very small pixels.  Digital SLR cameras are equipped with larger sensors, so they have more pixels. </p><p>  When buying a mirror or mirrorless camera, professionals advise choosing a model with a resolution of 12 to 50 megapixels.  Sensors of compact or super zoom cameras for obtaining good quality images should have from 10 to 14 megapixels. </p><h2>  Zoom and Focal Range </h2><p>  No matter which digital camera is selected, it will have a specific set of lenses or zoom settings.  If this is a compact camera, you have to live with what it offers, so you need to make sure that it covers all the ranges that you plan to use. </p><p>  The numbers on the packaging mean nothing.  ‚Äú10x zoom‚Äù only means that the longest setting is 10 times longer than the widest.     ,     ,          . </p><p> ,     ,   ,  ,         ,  ,   .   ,      ,         ,   . </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trustedreviews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon G9X Mark II" class="if uuid-2631828" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2631828.jpg"></div><h2>   :    ? </h2><p>        ,        ,    ,            . </p><p> Buying reviews on seller‚Äôs sites and chats may reflect problems you might encounter in the future.  However, it should be remembered that most of these people are not experts and may not use the product correctly or equally and may not see all of its shortcomings.  It is worth to read the reviews written by professional reviewers in journals with a regular technical team. </p><p>  The point of this is to read many reviews and evaluate the range of opinions.  Often, top reviewers notice what is hidden from the eyes of others. </p><h2>  Should I buy the latest model? </h2><p>  It is always tempting to buy the latest products, but often what they can offer compared to last year is less than the price difference. </p><p>  You can be very upset to learn that a newer camera has appeared, and the acquired one is already outdated, but this rarely affects the quality of photos that can be taken using the already ‚Äúold‚Äù camera. </p><p>  Not quite the latest models, as a rule, are still very good and are sold at competitive prices.  Even the option of acquiring a used camera is possible. </p><h2>  Where to buy a camera? </h2><p>  On the Internet you can find many profitable offers, but they don‚Äôt give advice on websites and, importantly, you can‚Äôt take a camera to try it out.  Therefore, there is no alternative to going to a photo store where you can talk with an assistant and hold the camera in your hands.  If, for example, the question arises about what kind of tripods there are for a particular brand of camera, you can ask it and immediately get an answer, and if after a while a new question arises, you can return to the store and ask the same person. </p><p>  The same is true for the purchase of a compact camera, if such an acquisition represents the beginning of a serious hobby.  And building relationships with a good photo store is priceless. </p>
