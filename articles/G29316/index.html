People come here not only for the sun and the sea, but for luxury, bliss, exclusively professional service, as well as man-made wonders built on petrodollars.  You are waiting for the bulk islands and artificial oases in the desert, the highest skyscrapers in the world and safari on jeeps and camels. </p><p>  Emirates are not so far from Russia as Cuba or Thailand, and in winter you can sunbathe and swim here.  But is it possible to make it to get to this paradise for wealthy tourists for not too much money?  Of course!  For this, there are last-minute tours to the UAE from Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities.  Let's look at exactly where and how you can get if you order such a ticket from the operator.  But first, find out what that means. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kuoni.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Last Minute Hotels in UAE" class="if uuid-2333462" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2333462.jpg"></div><h2>  What are last-minute tours in the UAE? </h2><p>  Most often, companies sending travelers to world resorts redeem places in hotels and / or on charter flights in blocks.  But it also happens when critically little time is left before the start of the tour, but it is not possible to realize everything.  Then the operator begins to reduce prices in order to at least minimize losses - unavoidable, if places remain unredeemed at all.  Sometimes the "burning" cost is possible for a flight, and sometimes for hotel accommodation.  But more often than not, the price falls on both.  However, travel to the United Arab Emirates has its own characteristics. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When selling last-minute tours from all <span>tour operators in the UAE</span> , the price of only plane tickets is usually reduced.  Companies are no longer daring to buy ‚Äúblocks‚Äù in hotel hotels, because this is too much risk.  Last- <span>minute tours to the United Arab Emirates</span> become a week - a maximum of 10 days before departure.  After all, you still need three or four days to apply for a visa to the country.  But whether you expect last-minute tours to this country is up to you.  Indeed, during this time they can buy up places in the hotels you like.  The maximum amount that can be saved while waiting for last minute tours in the UAE is several hundred dollars. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.holidaypirates.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tours in the UAE in April" class="if uuid-2333667" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2333667.jpg"></div><h2>  Seasons </h2><p>  Often inexpensive trips to the UAE can be bought in the summer.  But Russians usually do not like to go there at this time.  The fact is that in the Emirates in the summer months, real hell reigns.  In winter, the UAE is very popular, but since the country is in the desert, it can be pretty cool there.  Swimming is sometimes not too comfortable, unless you can sunbathe.  You will have to take a sweater or jacket with you, because after sunset the temperature can drop to ten degrees of heat, especially when the wind rises.  The most requested months are spring.  Tours in the UAE in April are probably the most ideal.  Air temperature does not rise above 30 degrees, and prices are reasonably moderate.  Good October and November. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.holidaypirates.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Last Minute Hotels in Dubai" class="if uuid-2333487" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2333487.jpg"></div><h2>  Tours in Dubai </h2><p>  Different emirates of the country are very different from each other.  Therefore, choosing a tour in the UAE, including the last-minute, pay attention to the direction.  No wonder Dubai hotels have become a symbol of luxury.  There is always an atmosphere of exclusive relaxation.  The prices for tours to this emirate are very high, and if you even save a couple of hundred dollars by buying a last-minute ticket to some ‚Äúfives‚Äù and ‚Äúfours‚Äù, this will not save you.  But even here, rest can be affordable for a not-so-rich tourist. </p><p>  If you choose a hotel no higher than ‚Äúthree stars‚Äù, a standard room and a location far from the sea, then you can take a tour.  Then a week of rest will cost you no more than $ 430 - this, along with insurance and flight.  Free Wi-Fi is usually even in the most modest hotel.  If you're lucky, then you can go to Dubai shopping festivals.  This is an ideal place and time for shopping, when you can buy things from world brands and still not let all the money go. </p><h2>  Tours in Sharjah </h2><p>  This emirate in itself is a great option for a budget holiday in the United Arab Emirates.  Last-minute tours to the <span>UAE (Sharjah)</span> can be even cheaper.  Traditional culture, modern skyscrapers, green oases of parks and the amazing beauty of the lagoon, as well as excursions, shopping and a variety of entertainment await those who decide to come here.  But still, travelers should know that Sharjah is the exact opposite of Dubai. </p><p>  Strict morals reign here, alcohol is completely banned, and even the morale police work.  Therefore, tourists should dress in accordance with local decency.  But almost all the hotels here are located on the first line, there are more beaches, unlike Dubai, and bathers can choose between the Gulf of Oman and the Gulf.  And in the evenings it is a lot of fun.  What are the hundred-meter-long musical fountain in Al-Majaz Square, a laser show, the grandiose observation wheel "Eye of the Emirate".  Most often people come here not only because food and accommodation in Sharjah are the cheapest, but also because only here you can see the real Arabic flavor, try local dishes and buy original souvenirs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gocollette.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Last Minute Hotels in Abu Dhabi" class="if uuid-2333653" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2333653.jpg"></div><h2>  Tours in Abu Dhabi </h2><p>  If you have already decided to travel to the Emirates, you can consider another not too expensive travel option.  This is Abu Dhabi.  Such a tour in the UAE can also be last minute, and also very interesting.  This emirate has quite affordable prices, although, of course, there are many hotels here, the cost of living in which is simply sky-high.  This is the actual capital of the country, there is the seat of government.  Here you can count not only on beach vacations, shopping and excursions, but also on entertainment in night clubs and discos. </p><p>  This emirate has the largest park in the entire Middle East - Cornish Road, which stretches along the coast for ten kilometers.  And over its entire length more than 60 fountains are installed.  If you value the romance of the desert combined with modern technology - this is the emirate for you.  A cheap last-minute trip to Abu Dhabi is a wonderful opportunity to appreciate this fastest growing resort in the UAE. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gocollette.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Last-minute tours from all tour operators in the UAE" class="if uuid-2333606" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2333606.jpg"></div><h2>  Offers from Moscow and St. Petersburg </h2><p>  Vacations with reduced prices are, as we have seen, in different regions of the Emirates.  So, last-minute tours to the UAE from Moscow can be bought in Sharjah, in Dubai, in Ajman, in Abu Dhabi.  Prices for these vouchers are not much different.  So, a trip to 2-3-star hotels located in these regions, lasting 3-4 nights, will cost from 17 to 20 thousand rubles. </p><p>  The main direction of tours from St. Petersburg to the UAE is Dubai.  Therefore, there, in principle, it is possible to buy last minute packages.  Although there are also offers in Sharjah.  The price includes flight, insurance, accommodation at the hotel you have chosen, as well as the type of food.  For example, a week in the Emirates from St. Petersburg operators costs from 33 thousand rubles per person in Sharjah and from 37 in Dubai. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tours in the UAE &quot;all inclusive&quot;" class="if uuid-2333680" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2333680.jpg"></div><h2>  Are there all-inclusive tours in the UAE? </h2><p>  There can only be one answer to this question - of course, yes.  But the price of rest is quite high.  The fact is that only the most expensive and fashionable hotels offer such a food system for tourists.  A week in a five-star all inclusive hotel will cost at least $ 1,200-1,300 per person in Abu Dhabi or Ras al-Khaimah.  But the smallest price for an all-inclusive package at a hotel of this type in Dubai will be one and a half thousand dollars.  Of course, this is the cost of a regular trip.  Last-minute tours will save you a hundred or two dollars.  In addition, you can also book more budget hotels - four or three-star.  Then the price will start at $ 840 per person.  However, tourists warn that the all-inclusive system in the Emirates is quite specific.  This is breakfast, lunch, dinner with alcohol and the usual basic cocktails.  Snacks between meals are very rare. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gocollette.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="UAE tours from St. Petersburg" class="if uuid-2333661" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2333661.jpg"></div><h2>  Last Minute Travel Reviews </h2><p>  The trip to the Emirates made an unforgettable impression on many vacationers, and the opportunity to save several hundred dollars on last minute trips helped to visit unnecessary excursions or at least shopping centers.  Very good reviews about last-minute tours to the UAE in April or in the fall.  Experienced tourists are advised not to choose luxurious rooms and hotels, but to limit themselves to standard ones.  The main thing is that the hotel should be conveniently located both in relation to the beaches and to public transport.  Thus, you can sunbathe, and explore the country or at least several of its regions on your own, especially since in the Emirates you can literally get everywhere by bus or metro. </p><p>  In Sharjah, hotels are quite cheap because of the Prohibition, but more comfortable.  Well, and if you can‚Äôt live without alcohol in any way, you can take it with you.  But then it‚Äôs better to fly to Dubai airport.  In the hub, Sharjah can be searched and taken away. </p>
