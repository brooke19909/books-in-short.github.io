But to his descendants, he became known as Ivan Fedorov.  The biography of this remarkable person is rich in events and travels, from which it is important to highlight the most significant details.  These brief theses of the life of a great man became the basis for creating books on the topic "Ivan Fedorov, a biography for children."  The biography of this person will be interesting to everyone who is interested in the development of Russian literature, primarily for young readers.  The biography of Ivan Fedorov for children should indicate the main points of his activity as an associate and first printer.  After all, the development of the Russian language is impossible to imagine without prints.  And the name of the initiator of the Russian book is Ivan Fedorov. </p><h2>  short biography </h2><p>  The years of life of the first printer are 1510-1583.  The exact date of birth of Ivan Moskovitin is unknown.  His surname, most likely, did not come from a generic name, but from the place of birth.  In those days, Russia was called a small principality, territorially assigned to the Commonwealth.  The vast northern territories of modern <span>Russia in the 16th century</span> were known to foreigners as Muscovy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ivan Fedorov short biography for children photo" class="if" height="353" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1004439.jpg" width="250"></div>

    <p>  It is known that at a young age, Ivan traveled a lot and studied at European universities.  Literacy among Europeans struck Ivan Moskvitin - after all, by that time the printed book had been known in Europe for more than a century.  The level of education was many times different from what Ivan Fedorov saw in his homeland.  The biography would not be complete without the stories about how Europe impressed him. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  First printing house </h2><p>  An interesting biography of Ivan Fedorov for children must necessarily indicate the place of the first printing house, which was located in our country.  The first printing workshop was opened in Moscow. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ivanfedorov short biography years of life" class="if" height="247" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1004444.jpg" width="300"></div>  Her activity is firmly connected with the name of its owner, who called himself Ivan Fedorov.  A brief biography of this man indicates that he did not start this good work alone, but with a typographer and partner, whose name was Pyotr Timofeevich Mstislavtsev.  According to the decree of Tsar Ivan the Terrible, books of religious content were to be published in the printing house.  Ivan Fedorov was appointed responsible for the sovereign printing house.  A brief biography for children may indicate that the first printer was a jack of all trades - he himself cut out complex engravings using pear wood boards for himself, invented a collection of fonts, and decorated his <span>first books himself.</span> <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="An interesting biography of Ivan Fedorov for children" class="if" height="497" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1004447.jpg" width="600"></div>

Biography of Ivan Fedorov for children can not ignore this colorful book.  Amazing vignettes, crisp print and magnificent illustrations made this book a real work of art. </p><p>  Many of the Apostle‚Äôs editions contain printer comments.  In them, the commentator shows himself to be a widely educated person, fluent in the literary norms of the Russian language of that time.  Most of the comments were simply signed: "Ivan Fedorov."  A brief biography of this man must indicate that he printed his books not only at the behest of the sovereign.  The main task of the author was to print a book "for the enjoyment of Russian people."  The first ‚ÄúApostle‚Äù earned the full approval of the church and was published in 2000 copies.  To this day, no more than 60 rarities have survived. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="biography of Ivan Fedorov for children" class="if" height="464" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1004443.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Watchmaker </h2><p>  The second book published in the Moscow printing workshop was The Watchmaker.  Its authors were still <span>Peter Mstislavets</span> and Ivan Fedorov.  The biography of the Russian book printer dwells little on his second book.  It is known that it was also a religious publication, and was allowed to print with the full approval of the Orthodox Church. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Relocation </h2><p>  The biography of Ivan Fedorov for children should not be based on the sad episodes of his life.  For a number of reasons beyond its control, the printing business in Moscow had to be curtailed.  Perhaps the reason for their departure was the immediate danger posed by the new soldiers of Ivan the Terrible - the guardsmen.  The first printers left the principality of Moscow and settled in the <span>Grand Duchy of Lithuania,</span> in the city of Zabluduow, which is currently located in Poland.  The fame of the first printers reached these remote places - Fedorov and Mstislavets were warmly greeted in the courtyard of the hetman Grigory Alexandrovich Khotkevich.  A great zealous of Orthodoxy and a supporter of the independence of the Principality of Lithuania, he offered the first printers his protection.  Soon, under his patronage, a small printing workshop was founded in which books were published in Church Slavonic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ivan Fedorov short biography for children" class="if" height="415" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1004456.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The Teaching Gospel </h2><p>  The first Zabludovskiy edition was the "Teaching Gospel", published in 1569.  After his release, the paths of the first printers parted - Mstislavets went to the city of Vilno, and Ivan Fedorov took care of the fate of the printing house.  The biography of that period of life shows that the case was put on a firm basis, and new books found their readers.  It is important to know that in those days books were not only a source of knowledge, but a means of investing capital.  Printed materials were very expensive, and enterprising rich people preferred to invest in books, not caring about what was written in them.  Be that as it may, the Teaching Gospel showed the success of this undertaking, and Ivan Fedorov began to think over the publication of a new book. </p><h2>  The Psalter </h2><p>  1570 was the best of the whole period of life in Zdolbunov.  This year, the famous ‚ÄúPsalter‚Äù, decorated with a front-engraving with an image of the Israeli king David, was released in large circulation.  This is one of the most luxurious editions of Fedorov, which he dedicated to his patron - one of the pages depicts the coat of arms of Khotkevich.  Unfortunately, only four copies of this book have survived to our time - two of them are in Western Europe, one in Russia, and one in Ukraine. </p><p>  The Union of Lublin put the hetman Khotkevich in a difficult position.  He could no longer support the life of the printing business, and was forced to refuse Fedorov's support and patronage.  The typographer left the hospitable Zablud√≥w and moved to Lviv.  Thus began the Lviv period of his work. </p><p>  In 1574, the first printing workshop in Ukraine was founded in Lviv. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ivan Fedorov short biography" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1004450.jpg" width="280"></div>  And again, the only author, proofreader and editor in it is Ivan Fedorov.  A biography for children would necessarily indicate the return of the book printer to his first creation - in Lviv, the first book again was ‚ÄúThe Apostle‚Äù.  In Lviv, Fedorov was not obliged to anyone either by money or by position, therefore the Lviv ‚ÄúApostle‚Äù is the first of Fedorov‚Äôs books in which he has his own publishing brand.  The first grammar textbook in Russian was published here, which was called the ABC.

    <h2>  Work with Konstantin Ostrogsky </h2><p>  Over time, luck left the first printer, and in Lviv he began to pursue financial failures.  He was forced to curtail his activities and accept the invitation of the rich and influential tycoon - Prince Konstantin of Ostrog.  The prince welcomed the educated people and appreciated their society, so in his entourage formed a union of learned people led by Gerasim Smotrytsky.  The Ostroh Academy functioned here, which really needed its own ‚Äúdrukarnya,‚Äù as the printing press workshop was called in those days.  Here Ivan Fedorov began preparing a publication of a unique Bible, which was supposed to overshadow all the printed editions of God's word available at that time. </p><p>  In 1580, the Ostrog Printing House issued the New Testament with the Psalter.  So there was a ‚ÄúBook-collection of things unnecessary‚Äù, the authors of which were Timofei Mikhailovich and Ivan Fedorov.  A biography for children should indicate the contents of this publication.  In the "Book .." was a short list of some phrases from the New Testament, indicating their location on the pages of the Gospels.  The design of the ‚ÄúBook‚Äù is interesting - the front page of the publication was decorated with huge gates inviting the reader to open the world of the book. </p><h2>  Ostrog Bible </h2><p>  Of course, the most famous publication of Ivan Fedorov during this period was the Ostrog Bible.  This wonderful work is the cultural heritage of all Slavic peoples, and an example of printing art.  If it were necessary to publish the book ‚ÄúIvan Fedorov.  A Brief Biography for Children ‚Äù- a photo of the Ostrog Bible would rightfully adorn its frontispiece. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ivan Fedorov biography" class="if" height="470" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1004448.jpg" width="345"></div>  In total, five editions of this magnificent book have been published.  Ivan Fedorov corrected his financial affairs and returned to Lviv at the peak of fame.  Here he tried to rediscover the printing press, but died without seeing the results of his undertaking.  The children of the first printer and his students had the chance to open the Lviv printing house.  Fedorov was buried at the Onufrievsky cemetery near the temple.  The son and students of the first printer worthily continued the work of Ivan Fedorov, but did not reach the fame of his teacher.
