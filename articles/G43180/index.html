  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Biologically active substances</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>Biologically active</span> substances (abbreviated as biologically active substances) are special chemical substances that are highly concentrated in certain groups of organisms (humans, plants, animals, fungi) or in certain groups of cells.  Biologically active substances are used in medicine and as a prophylaxis of diseases, as well as to maintain a full life. <br><br>  Biologically active substances are: <br><br>  1. Alkaloids - nitrogen-containing <span>compounds of organic</span> nature.  Typically of plant origin.  They have basic properties.  Insoluble in water, form various salts with acids.  They have good physiological activity.  In large doses, these are the strongest poisons, in small doses, medicines (Atropine, Papaverine, Ephedrine medicines). <br><br>  2. Vitamins - a special group of organic compounds that are vital for animals and humans for a good metabolism and full life.  Many of the vitamins take part in the formation of the necessary enzymes, inhibit or accelerate the activity of certain enzyme systems.  Vitamins are also used as <span>biologically active</span> food <span>additives</span> (included in their composition).  Some vitamins enter the body with food, others are formed by microbes in the intestine, and others appear as a result of synthesis from fat-like substances under the influence of ultraviolet radiation.  A lack of vitamins can lead to various metabolic disorders.  A disease that arose as a result of a small intake of vitamins in the body is called vitamin deficiency.  The disadvantage is <span>hypovitaminosis,</span> and an excessive amount is hypervitaminosis. <br><br>  3. Glycosides - compounds of organic nature.  They have the most diverse effects.  Glycoside molecules consist of two important parts: non-sugar (aglycon or genin) and sugar (glycon).  In medicine, they are used to treat diseases of the heart and blood vessels, as an antimicrobial and expectorant.  Glycosides also relieve mental and physical fatigue, disinfect the urinary tract, calm the central nervous system, improve digestion and increase appetite. <br><br>  4. Glycolalkaloids - biologically active substances related to glycosides.  The following medicines can be obtained from them: Cortisone, Hydrocortisone, and others. <br><br>  5. <span>Tannins</span> (another name - tanides) are able to precipitate proteins, mucus, adhesives, alkaloids.  For this reason, they are incompatible with these substances in medicines.  With proteins, they form albuminates (anti-inflammatory agent). <br><br>  6. Fatty oils are <span>esters of</span> fatty acids or trihydric alcohol.  Some fatty acids are involved in <span>metabolism, accelerate the</span> elimination of cholesterol from the body. <br><br>  7. Coumarins are biologically active substances based on isocoumarin or coumarin.  In the same group include pyranocoumarins and furocoumarins.  Some coumarins have an antispasmodic effect, others exhibit capillary-strengthening activity.  There are also coumarins of anthelmintic, diuretic, curariform, antimicrobial, analgesic and other effects. <br><br>  8. Trace elements, like vitamins, are also added to dietary supplements.  They are part of vitamins, hormones, pigments, enzymes, form chemical compounds with proteins, accumulate in tissues and organs, in the endocrine glands.  The following trace elements are important for humans: boron, nickel, zinc, cobalt, molybdenum, lead, fluorine, selenium, copper, manganese. <br><br>  There are other biologically active substances: <span>organic acids</span> (there are volatile and non-volatile), pectin, pigments (another name is dyes), steroids, carotenoids, flavonoids, phytoncides, ecdysones, essential oils. </p>
