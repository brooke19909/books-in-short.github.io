    <h2>  Biography </h2><p>  The businessman rarely talked to reporters and did not give interviews.  Many sources claim that Kogan only once told about himself.  Vladimir Igorevich tried to avoid social events and cameras.  According to many, the businessman managed to succeed, thanks to the ability to communicate with politicians, influential figures and others with famous people whose names do not leave the Forbes list. </p><h2>  Childhood </h2><p>  Vladimir Kogan, whose biography begins with North Palmyra, was born on April 27, 1963.  The family consisted of design engineers who worked at classified enterprises in the Soviet Union. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The future businessman did not attend any nursery or kindergarten.  Volodya‚Äôs upbringing was dealt with by his grandmother, who taught him to write and count, preparing for school. </p><p>  Not many people know that after the 8th grade, Vladimir Kogan, whose photo at that time was only on the honor board, and not on the list of the richest people in Russia, entered the Physics and Mathematics School No. 239.  She is also notable for the fact that at one time she released the notorious Perelman. </p>

    <p>  Then Vladimir was waiting for the Polytechnic Institute.  However, he was expelled from the university after 1 year.  The reason was the refusal to travel to the construction team.  Hard work for the benefit of society, Vladimir Kogan preferred a trip to the Pamirs.  However, what he did there with friends is not known for certain.  According to one version - mountaineering, according to another - the study of hemp plantations.  After there were two years of the army. </p><h2>  Carier start </h2><p>  In 1983, Kogan Vladimir Igorevich went to defend his homeland.  He served in the anti-aircraft forces.  He returned home in 1985 and decided to start studying again, this time at the Civil Engineering Institute.  Here, young Kogan was doing well.  He even managed to get the nickname "Great." </p><p>  In 1989, he began working as a mechanical engineer at an automobile base owned by Intourist.  At the same time, the young man is trying to do business.  To begin with, the Magic store was opened, followed by several other companies.  In those days, Leningrad boasted many underground clubs.  Among them, one can distinguish the Club of Economists, which included representatives of radical liberal views - <span>Alexei Kudrin,</span> Anatoly Chubais and many others.  One of the sponsors of this club was Vladimir Kogan. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  He was the first in Russia to open a company that specialized in the sale of computers - Petrovsky Trade House.  In 1994, the company became an auctioneer of Promstroybank, which successfully acquired shares in other enterprises. </p>

    <p>  Kogan decided to exit the banking business in 2003.  He sold a block of shares of Promstroybank to VTB, and he focused on the career of a civil servant. </p><h2>  State service </h2><p>  Already in 2004, Kogan was appointed deputy director of Rostroy.  Vladimir Igorevich managed to engage in resuscitation of the project, which was aimed at erecting fortifications to protect Kronstadt from floods.  The construction of dams was suspended due to funding problems.  Soon, the project became the largest in Russia, and later received the name "Putin Dam".  Eleven dams, several systems for passing ships and a section of the route were built. </p>

    <p>  Two years later, Vladimir Kogan took up the post of one of the directors of the company Mosmetrostroy.  In 2008, he took the helm of the department of the Ministry of Regional Development.  In the summer of 2011, the largest dam was completed, in honor of which a ceremony was held.  Kogan was awarded the Order of Merit to the Fatherland. </p><h2>  Today </h2><p>  In 2012, the oligarch became the director of Rostroy.  However, at the post he was destined to linger for a short time.  The reason for this was the disagreement with the director of the Ministry of Regional Development.  Then Kogan decided to return to the banking business.  At the same time, his son became one of the directors of Promstroybank, receiving a 25% stake. </p><p>  Today, the main asset of Vladimir Igorevich is a group of companies "Neftegazindustriya".  In 2010, the company bought a promising company in Krasnodar - Afipsky refinery.  Then the media reported that a port would appear a hundred kilometers from the plant, which would save money on the transportation of petroleum products.  It was said that the enterprise will start functioning in three years, and its annual turnover will be 11 million tons of oil.  In addition, directors are considering the construction of a second such facility with an even higher turnover annually. </p>

    <p>  In the fall of 2015, he became the owner of the main block of shares of UralSib Bank.  Various sources indicate that the entrepreneur from the banks of the Neva became the owner of 82% of the shares.  Soon, stock prices rose nearly 150%.  After the appearance of information, the media actively promoted the news that the bank was headed by a close friend of the president of the Russian Federation.  However, according to one of the influential businessmen, Kogan‚Äôs relationship with Putin is seriously exaggerated. </p><h2>  A family </h2><p>  Vladimir Kogan is married.  He met his chosen one while still a student - they worked together in a construction team.  Lyudmila Valentinovna is two years younger than her husband.  Lyudmila Kogan studied at the Civil Engineering Institute, and then at St. Petersburg State University at the Faculty of Law.  She was the director of the popular Versace boutique.  It was the Kogan family that transferred most of the assets when he became a civil servant. </p><p>  In 2007, Lyudmila Valentinovna took a leading position at BFA-Development, which is responsible for commercial real estate in the Northern capital.  In the period from 2008 to 2013, the company's turnover amounted to more than one billion dollars.  One of the owners of the shares of BFA Bank is the son of a couple who graduated in 2013.  In total, Lyudmila and Vladimir Koganov have 4 children.  However, little is known about the life of other offspring. </p>
