It is good for tourists with imagination, as well as for people who want to combine the sun, sea and desert in their vacation.  In addition, from here you can go to fabulous places, visit the Valley of the Kings, the temple complexes of Luxor ... Traveling, by the way, will not be very expensive.  It takes about an hour to get to the destination from the airport, which is easy with an air-conditioned transfer.  These very southern outskirts of Hurghada not so long ago began to be built up by resort villages, and therefore almost all the hotels there are new.  Therefore, we will try in this article to analyze what tourists say and write about this hotel and a recreation area that is quite new for Russian tourists. </p>

    <h2>  Convenience of location: tourists rating </h2><p>  It is difficult to say exactly how to determine the location <span>of the Imperial</span> Shams Beach Resort 5 * <span>hotel</span> .  It is far from both Hurghada itself and its airport.  Between them fifty kilometers.  This is the Soma Bay (resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSafaga).  Therefore, the transfer here will be quite long, although not tiring.  On the other hand, constantly taking off and landing planes do not interfere.  But this is the southernmost resort, and the sea here is always warm.  And if you want to make an excursion to Luxor or who live closer to the center of Hurghada, you have to shake on the bus all day or leave for an utter wound, then the inhabitants of the hotels on Soma Bay are some three hours drive from this famous historical place, and therefore they can get there going there is much easier.  So the reviews of tourists depend on what kind of vacation they want.  If people prefer to live closer to Hurghada with its nightlife, then, of course, they are not very happy with the location of Imperial Shams Beach Resort 5 *.  If vacationers want a clean sea and secluded beaches - then they write positive feedback.  And those who love historical sights are generally delighted. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  What is the overall impression of the hotel </h2><p>  This hotel has a "younger brother" called Imperial Shams Abu Soma 4, although it itself already has a five-star status.  In addition, there is another hotel - "Shams Prestige", already more expensive.  They all have a common territory.  The hotel under consideration was built in 2007 and is a six-story building.  Tourists note that the territory is very large and well-groomed.  Beautiful gardens, many places where you want to sit and relax.  Even for ten days of stay, it is not always possible to inspect all corners.  In addition, a feature of the Soma resort is that you can safely walk through the territory of neighboring hotels and inspect their parks.  After all, there are no settlements nearby, and bars, restaurants and discos - only hotel rooms.  So you should not be afraid of the penetration of "strangers".  Wi-Fi is available throughout the hotel.  In addition, the hotel has not just a mini market, but a whole set of shops and boutiques with all kinds of goods and souvenirs that can only be purchased in Egypt.  Those wishing to organize a conference here are offered to rent a huge hall for two hundred and fifty people. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Rating of the southernmost resort of Hurghada - Soma Bay </h2><p>  How can you describe the resort where the Imperial Shams Abu Soma is located?  Hurghada is an official region to which it formally refers.  However, here are the most beautiful reefs, the cleanest and most decent beaches and the newest and most comfortable hotels - almost all of them are just ‚Äúfives‚Äù, like the hotel we are describing.  It is also good for active tourists who, after sunbathing, observing the underwater world and sea baths, still have the strength for night life.  In the evenings, clubs and entertainment in Hurghada await them, which is very easy to get to.  Good for those who crave just calm and solitude.  And those who want to improve their health can go to the local centers of thalassotherapy, which are famous no less than the Tunisian ones.  This is especially true for those who suffer from stress, metabolic disorders, skin diseases and other similar troubles. </p>

    <h2>  About staff: what vacationers say </h2><p>  At the Imperial Shams Beach Resort 5 * hotel (Safaga), employees are quite sane and accurate.  They clean cleanly, even ideally - especially if you leave a little bakshish, as is customary in Egypt.  Guests write very positive reviews about the animators.  In fact, the staff is very friendly and friendly.  True, not all hotel staff speak Russian, but if you know at least a little English, you will not have any problems at all - they will do everything in a few minutes.  Great bartenders: drinks are not diluted and advised that it is better to take.  In general, everyone is very helpful, polite and just climb out of their way to feed and entertain you. </p><h2>  Imperial Shams Beach Resort 5 *: can I go here with my children? </h2><p>  Tourists agree that the management of this hotel is child-friendly.  For them, there are equipped rooms for games, a good playground, and a club, there is a special animation.  Of course, kids can use the pools - for them there are sections in all adult "ponds".  But that is not all.  There is also a separate plunge pool for young guests.  An extra bed for a child is supposed to be free of charge, and it is placed at the first request.

    <h2>  About daily bread </h2><p>  Imperial Shams 5 *, like many other hotels of this type, practices the all inclusive system.  It can be used in the main restaurant "La Bomboner", where they are fed according to the "buffet style".  The beach grill and cafe Il Paso also offer this kind of service.  Snacks and drinks are available there.  In the evenings there are √† la carte restaurants: Porto Fino (Italian) and El Khan with oriental cuisine.  At the reception desk, the Siesta bar is open around the clock, mainly with drinks.  Good reviews also about the bar "Ksyu-Ksyu".  All food items are decorated with carving of carrot roses and palm branches.  The food is varied and delicious, so you don‚Äôt want to leave the restaurant.  Everything is very fresh, especially <span>chicken, fish</span> and salads.  Great pastries and sweets.  However, the cuisine is mainly European - since this is the main contingent here.  Alcoholic drinks are provided until six in the morning, which many tourists noted as a special bonus.  Moreover, the whiskey here is just great.  By the way, guests of the Imperial Shams Abu Soma Resort can go to eat at the restaurants of the neighboring Shams Safaga or Prestige hotel - the all-inclusive system applies to them too. </p><h2>  About entertainment, or "Not with bread alone ..." </h2><p>  The hotel Imperial Shams 5 * has a good animation - basically all the performances are played in the amphitheater.  In addition, if you find out the programs in neighboring hotels, you can watch different shows in any of them.  Here you can do aerobics, play water polo, squash, billiards, table tennis, darts.  On the beach, warming up with volleyball.  And those who want to burn the calories accumulated in restaurants, visit the fitness center.  You can go diving and windsurfing, but these activities are paid.  There is a disco.  Admission is free, but this does not apply to drinks.  There is also a night club.  There is a good aquacenter on the beach with various water activities - diving, snorkeling, windsurfing, parakiting ... You can <span>ride horses</span> and camels. </p><h2>  About the sea and water procedures </h2><p>  The beach is right next to the hotel.  It is sandy and so good that you don‚Äôt need special slippers at all, like in other Egyptian resorts.  The sea here is simply amazing.  On the one hand, there is a good entrance and complete safety for children, and on the other hand, if you go to the depths, you can admire beautiful corals and fish without ordering special excursions for this.  Many have seen octopuses and sea turtles.  There is a reef with fish not far from the entrance, and since it is shallow there, you can look at them even without a mask.  The water is very warm at any time of the year.  Imperial Shams Resort also has three pools.  In the cold season, one of them is heated.  They are very clean - they are purged three times a day with a special device. </p>

    <h2>  About pricing </h2><p>  Although the vacationers who visited the Imperial Shams Abu Soma (Egypt) are very different, but almost all of them said that this "five" was unusually cheap, despite the fact that its services, rooms and food are very high quality.  The price for a tour for a week for two is about a thousand dollars (with a flight).  A SIM card with the Internet for one gigabyte of information costs eleven conventional units.  The cost of excursions varies - from $ 15-20 for a trip in a boat with a "glass bottom" to hundreds per person for a two-day trip to Luxor.  Prices for souvenirs, oils and perfumes in the hotel market are much higher than in Hurghada, so many are advised to go shopping specifically. </p><h2>  About travel </h2><p>  There are many excursions here, but guests of the Imperial Shams Abu Soma advise taking them from the hotel guide, and not on the beach, because you can run into charlatans.  Moreover, the tour operators in the hotel are not only responsible for the safety of travelers, but provide them with good air-conditioned transport.  Guides always come to the rescue and are ready to clarify any issue.  They not only sell tours, but also recommend them to guests, and talk in detail about the pros of each of them.  Especially popular are trips to the bathyscaphe, trips to the dolphinarium (its program is very popular with children who receive a lot of positive things), as well as a free ‚Äútour‚Äù to Hurghada for shopping.  And of course, a trip to Luxor is always unforgettable.  Karnak Temple, <span>royal tombs,</span> Valley of Queens ...
