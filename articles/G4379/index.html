  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is an ATM and what is it for?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Surely each of us used payment instruments, in particular, dealt with ATMs.  However, not everyone knows how they work.  A modern ATM is not only a device for issuing cash.  Through it you can also replenish your bank account and make money transfers.  But first things first. </p><h2>  When did it appear? </h2><p>  Such devices appeared about half a century ago.  The first ATM is an ATM machine that can handle cash withdrawals only.  And then there were no plastic cards.  In order to withdraw money from such an ATM, users had to first receive special checks at the bank. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.komando.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ATM withdraw" class="if uuid-2421122" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/2421122.jpg"></div><p>  Today, this unit is a multifunctional device with modern hardware and software. </p><h2>  Varieties </h2><p>  In Russia there are several types of such devices: </p><ul><li>  Recycle (the most modern, appeared recently). </li><li>  Cash-in (which accept cash). </li><li>  Classic (only work on the issue of money). </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ATM bank photo" class="if uuid-2421126" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/2421126.jpg"></div><p>  A modern ATM is a whole complex with many options.  In fact, it replaces the bank office.  Also note that these units do not include self-service terminals (although they have the same principle of working with banknotes as Cash-in devices). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How is it arranged? </h2><p>  A bank ATM is a regular computer to which specific peripheral devices are connected.  If you turn off one of them, the device will not stop working.  For example, when dismantling the <span>receipt printer, the</span> system will give a signal on the monitor, but will still work with the card in normal mode. </p><p>  If we talk about the main parts of the ATM, this is a safe and a technical unit.  At the top of the latter there is a keyboard, card reader, monitor and receipt printer.  Additionally, the device is equipped with a surveillance camera.  But usually banks prefer external surveillance.  This is necessary in case of theft of money from an ATM. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  Until recently, OS / 2 was used as the base operating system.  Now ATMs in St. Petersburg and other cities operate on the basis of Windows 7, 8, 10 and others. Among the software, it is worth highlighting drivers for the operation of the main peripheral devices.  Also, specialized banking programs are installed on this computer.  The number of software may vary.  However, all these programs have the same task: </p><ul><li>  data encryption; </li><li>  communication with the processing center of the bank; </li><li>  data transfer (these are codes, card details, transaction type, and so on); </li><li>  real-time response processing. </li></ul><h2>  Safe </h2><p>  It contains the most important thing - banknotes.  In classic ATMs (including Alfa Bank), a dispenser is located in a safe.  It is needed for a set of notes and forming them into a bundle for cash dispensing.  Banknotes are packed in special cassettes.  Each has its own specific denomination.  A dispenser typically holds four to six of these cassettes.  Additionally, the safe has a reject.  This is a dispenser for rejected bills.  This cassette is designed for two thousand cash sheets.  We also note that ATMs program for a certain number of notes that go through the presenter.  Usually no more than 40 banknotes are passed through it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="ATM take photo" class="if uuid-2421123" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/2421123.jpg"></div><p>  The collection of money from cassettes is carried out in several ways: </p><ul><li>  mechanical; </li><li>  vacuum. </li></ul><p>  In the first case, special rubber wheels are used, which ‚Äúlick‚Äù the most extreme bill, which is in the dispenser.  Then it is fed through belts to the storage compartment.  With the vacuum method, suction cups are used to collect banknotes.  Next, the money falls into the presenter. </p><p>  How is cash withdrawn through an ATM?  A bundle of banknotes is folded in the storage compartment in accordance with the request of the client.  Then the shutter opens (special protective device).  After the client receives the desired amount.  We also note that if the banknotes are not collected within 30 seconds, the system will automatically pull the stack back and send it to the reject. </p><h2>  Force majeure </h2><p>  Sometimes it happens that the banknotes when moving in the device are wrinkled, torn or jammed belts.  In these cases, the system generates an error, and the ATM finishes its work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bank ATM take photo" class="if uuid-2421124" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/2421124.jpg"></div><h2>  The electronic board </h2><p>  Each ATM safe has a special electronics board.  Thanks to her, the interaction between the dispenser and the system unit is carried out.  The board also communicates with the keyboard and printer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinguard.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ATM is" class="if uuid-2421119" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/2421119.jpg"></div><p>  The system unit also has direct interaction.  He communicates with a network card, which provides communication between the device and the <span>processing center of the bank.</span> </p><h2>  Other points </h2><p>  There are two modules in units with Cash-in technology: </p><ul><li>  for receiving cash; </li><li>  for issuance. </li></ul><p>  The first contains several cassettes.  So, one is for receiving cash, and the other is for rejected banknotes.  Also, the unit can be equipped with several redzhtey.  The cassettes themselves have two compartments.  The first discards money that is not taken away by the client, and the second - fake or damaged banknotes.  Above is a special detector.  It is a module that checks banknotes for authenticity according to several criteria.  Each bill goes through a narrow tunnel with numerous sensors.  If the bill is false, the machine can ‚Äúspit it out‚Äù.  In this case, money will not be credited. </p><h2>  ATMs today </h2><p>  Recently, devices with deposit modules began to appear.  In addition to issuing and accepting money, they can accept material assets as well as important documents for storage. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hansab.lt" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="like an ATM" class="if uuid-2421120" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/2421120.jpg"></div><p>  In order to carry out the operation, an envelope is issued to the bank customer.  It indicates the date, time, card number, as well as other data for identification.  After that, the necessary thing is put into the envelope, and it is sent to the <span>deposit box.</span> </p><h2>  Duration of work </h2><p>  The operating time of these devices is not always the same.  It depends on the demand.  Usually this period is one to two weeks.  But if you often use an ATM, the duration of the work can be only a couple of days.  Why not fill the cassettes to the maximum and thereby extend the continuous operation of the device?  The fact is that it is not beneficial for banks to spend a lot of cash on cassettes.  After all, they won‚Äôt work during this time (and after all, some of them could go to issue loans, for example).  Therefore, cassettes are filled with only a certain amount.  And when the money runs out, collection is made. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ATM photo" class="if uuid-2421125" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/2421125.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we found out what an ATM is and how it works.  Today, this device makes our life much easier, since it replaces almost a whole banking office.  Most of the operations related to cash withdrawals and transfers can be carried out independently.  In addition, on some devices you can replenish your account.  It is very comfortable. </p>
