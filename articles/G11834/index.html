Reviews of tourists about the mystery of the ancient world</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the most iconic places in the Urals is Arkaim.  The reviews of those who have been here indicate that not only tourists, but also esotericists, psychics and occultists seek here.  What is this place?  Arkaim is an ancient fortified settlement dating back to 3-2 millennium BC.  It is located on an elevated cape, which appeared as a result of the confluence of the rivers Utyaganka and Bolshaya Karaganka.  At a distance of 2 kilometers to the north-west is the village of Aleksandrovsky, belonging to the Bredinsky district.  The settlement was opened in 1987 by an archaeological group.  After 4 years, this zone was declared a reserve. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="arkaim reviews" class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/231448.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Arkaim is a rather complex structure, which includes a fortified city, the remains of ancient pastures and two necropolises.  The first consists of two walls in the form of rings.  They are attached to the premises in the form of a circular sector.  And this is only one hundredth of what can be said about such a monument as Arkaim.  Reviews of tourists notice the fact that in the construction of the city there is a clear geometry.  So I want to calculate the intention of the creators.  Moreover, many observe the coincidence of some details of Arkaim with similar elements of Stonehenge.  So, one and the second monument are located at almost the same latitude, and the location is a cup-shaped valley with a relief horizon.  And the more you compare these two places, the more you find details that repeat each other.  From this we can conclude that Arkaim is a near-horizon observatory. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="trip to arkaim" class="if" height="216" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/231450.jpg" width="318"></div>

In the central part was the area.  A ring road ran between one and the second wall.  Summing up the above, we can conclude that the city was a fortress and two ring houses.  Thousands of legends and myths revolve around the settlement of Arkaim.  Reviews of tourists talk about them.  Many of the legends are controversial.  So, according to one of the scientific hypotheses, this city is a space observatory.  However, none of the versions has a sufficient number of confirmations. </p><p>  What to see in the reserve Arkaim?  Reviews from tourists show that the best way to start the inspection is from the historical park.  There are gravestones made of stone, mysterious menhirs.  In addition, the park houses the medieval Aksai complex.  It will be interesting to visit the Temir Kurgan reconstruction museum, where scientists, based on excavations of the Sarmatian mound, recreated a copy of the family tomb of the steppe nomads.  No less attractive is the ethnographic museum "Cossack Manor", which presents a collection of exhibits collected from all over the Southern Urals.  Here you can not only see household utensils, but also learn about the traditions of their ancestors. </p>

These dwellings resemble round dugouts.  It was their appearance that helped to withstand difficult climatic conditions.  It should be noted the Museum of Nature and Man.  Its exposition is divided into several eras, each of which will introduce a certain period of settlement of these lands.  Not so long ago, a new object for inspection appeared on the territory of the Arkaim museum - a camp of a steppe nomad, consisting of four yurts.  Here you can not only familiarize yourself with the way of life of the people, but also spend the night in one of the yurts by making a lease.
