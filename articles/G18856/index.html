    <h2>  Hotel Policies </h2><p>  In accordance with the rules adopted by Alanya Turkler Artemis Hotel 4 *, check-in for arriving guests is carried out, as in most other hotels, after 14:00.  If you arrive at the hotel complex earlier than the indicated time, then if you have available rooms of the category you have reserved, you will be settled immediately.  But at the peak of the tourist season, the hotel is often full, as they say, "to the eyeballs."  In this situation, in case of early arrival, you will most likely be asked to wait until the previous guests have vacated the room and prepare the hotel maids for check-in.  At the same time, you can leave your things in a special room and take a walk around the hotel, have lunch, swim in the pool or go straight to the sea. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As for the discharge from the hotel, it is necessary to vacate the room and hand over the keys before noon.  At the same time, you should pay for your stay, as well as for using any additional services, if you have resorted to them.  You can pay either in cash or by credit cards of the Mastercard and Visa systems.  If you have a card of another payment system, then the possibility of using it in Turkler Artemis 4 * should be checked with the hotel in advance. </p>

    <h2>  Turkler Artemis Hotel 4 *: reviews of tourists from Russia </h2><p>  Since it is very important for many tourists at the stage of choosing a place to stay on vacation to find out the opinions of those people who have already been here, we summarized the comments of our compatriots staying at the four-star Turkler Artemis hotel in Alanya.  In general, most of the reviews were positive.  But in fairness it should be noted that some tourists were very unhappy with their choice of hotel.  We offer to understand the situation in more detail. </p><p>  First of all, many tourists care about the condition of the hotel rooms themselves.  So, our compatriots found the rooms at Turkler Artemis spacious, fairly clean and well furnished.  However, some travelers complained about the old plumbing.  As for the cleaning of the rooms, it was carried out efficiently and regularly.  There were also no problems with the timely change of bed linen and towels. </p><p>  In most cases, the issue of nutrition becomes controversial.  The Turkler Artemis Hotel was no exception.  Most of the guests of this hotel complex found the food quite acceptable, the choice of dishes in the restaurant was quite diverse, and the food quality was good.  Some tourists note many fruits and vegetables.  The other part of travelers, by contrast, is convinced that a four-star hotel should offer its guests a more varied menu with a large number of meat and fish dishes.  However, in general, no one here remained hungry. </p><p>  Many complaints from the guests of the Turkler Artemis Hotel in Alanya caused a hotel beach.  So, many tourists were unhappy that the sunbeds and umbrellas here are quite old and mostly broken.  Also, many left an unpleasant impression of entering the water.  After all, the bottom here is quite rocky, and some vacationers even got hurt. </p><p>  As for the service and work of the hotel staff, there are practically no complaints at this point.  So, our compatriots really liked that almost all the employees at the reception speak excellent Russian.  The waiters in the restaurant are fast and always friendly.  The same goes for maids and other employees. </p><p>  But on the issue of animation, the opinions of tourists again diverged.  So, someone called the animators the true masters of their craft, who made the rest of the hotel guests more diverse and interesting.  Someone found the entertainment program boring and monotonous.  It is possible that the hotel just changed the team of animators.  So some of the tourists were more fortunate with the entertainment program. </p><p>  In general, most of the travelers were completely satisfied with their stay at Turkler Artemis (Alanya).  They do not exclude the possibility of coming to this hotel again and are ready to recommend it to all friends. </p>
