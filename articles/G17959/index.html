Such devices do not differ in high performance and radiation coverage in comparison with street lamps and spotlights, but at the same time not a single modern house can do without them.  We are talking about Led-models, which for several years of their stay on the market were able to significantly push out traditional sources of home lighting.  They use <span>12V LED lamps</span> as elements of spotlights, and to illuminate individual decorative niches, and even in ensembles of landscape-architectural complexes. </p>

    <h2>  Overview of 12V LED Lamps </h2><p>  LED devices are distinguished by their operational properties and sophisticated design, which also expands the control capabilities of such lamps.  As for operational advantages, almost all Led devices demonstrate high indicators of durability, energy saving, brightness, uniformity of light scattering, etc. In any case, when compared with competitive devices that are also available on the market for the average user. </p><p>  In terms of design, there are several features.  To begin with, it is worth noting that 12V LED lamps for AC are equipped with special driver converters.  Thanks to this addition, the current goes into a constant state.  To this, it is worth adding the presence of diffusers, stabilizers, fuses and other auxiliary and protective equipment in the sets, which has become a prerequisite in equipping LEDs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  For what purposes is it worth buying a 12V lamp? </h2>

    <p>  Home use is the main focus for small-format lamps, but also in decorative street design can not do without them.  And here it is important to consider a significant limitation.  The fact is that in the very family of LED lamps, 12V models are considered the least protected and capricious to external influences.  Therefore, for example, at temperatures above 40 ¬∞ C, they are undesirable.  This applies not only to the direct rays of the sun, but also to <span>lighting</span> systems <span>for saunas, baths,</span> platforms with boiler plants, etc. It is optimal to use 12V LED lamps as part of ceiling structures, in the design of design objects, as well as in highlighting small functional areas.  The fact is that such models are not suitable for a full-fledged lighting function, but as a delicate, aesthetic and compact source, they can quite find their place in any home. </p><h2>  Basic selection options </h2>

This indicator usually ranges from 2 to 6W.  At the same time, it makes no sense to select one element of this type for lighting.  As a rule, they are used in the complex in whole series.  For this, special ribbons, boxes or niches are purchased into which the lamps can be integrated in groups.  Again, the average power of such elements is 3W at a voltage of 12V.  But there is another nuance.  When choosing a transformer unit, one should take into account not the average power value among the fixtures, but the total - this indicator will be controlled by the regulator.  An important characteristic is the color temperature.  In the middle segment there are 12V LED lamps that provide temperatures in the range of 2700-6500K.  Among them, you can find models in yellow, cold and neutral colors. </p><h2>  Design Choice </h2>

    <p>  The type of construction is mainly determined by the format of the cap.  For example, in the marking you can see the designations G and E. In the first case, it is indicated on the pin-type base, and in the second - on the threaded mechanism.  The diameter of the connecting part is also marked next to the letter.  That is, the user needs to have an idea about the snap-in in which it is planned to integrate the device.  There will be no problems if you plan to install typical 12V LED lamps for the home.  How to choose devices for such purposes?  Focus on the formats E27 or E14.  These are the most common socles.  Special cases include the GU10, MR16 and R50 systems.  Thanks to such socles, you can get a rotary type device, install an element with a reflector or use a reflex lamp, respectively. </p><h2>  Optimum light cone angle </h2><p>  In contrast to the classic incandescent and halogen lamps, LED models have gained more opportunities in terms of regulating light scattering.  In practice, this means that the lamp will not cover with light all the maximum space available to it, but only that part that is either provided by the design or installed by the user.  The aforementioned <span>LED lamps of</span> 12V reflex type provide the most favorable conditions in this regard.  Such a model does not scatter light uselessly on unnecessary areas, but concentrates it on specific objects.  Actually, this is the principle of the optimal system of spot lighting, the characteristics and capabilities of which should also be taken into account. </p>

    <h2>  How to install LED lamps 12V? </h2><p>  Installation work should begin with the preparation of the power cable and the installation location of the lamp.  Depending on the design of the cartridge and the type of components, the mechanics of integrating the device into the cartridge may vary.  For example, special rings are sometimes offered that provide a damping and clamping effect between the lamp and the installation niche.  The most problematic are the installation of 12V <span>LED ceiling lights</span> for the home.  Installation of such models should initially be made with the expectation of integration into the subceiling frame.  The fact is that such devices are integrated directly into the structural basis of the suspended ceiling.  At least in the same place, in a special niche, fixation should be done with clamps or brackets.  But before that, it is necessary to connect to the power supply line. </p><h2>  Which manufacturers to prefer? </h2><p>  The most worthy models in quality are offered by Osram and Philips.  The products of these companies are considered the most technologically advanced both in terms of functionality and basic performance characteristics.  But these same lamps and the most expensive.  As an alternative, experts also recommend Era, Gauss, Camelion, Feron and others.  These ranges offer affordable 12V LED lamps for the home, but their quality does not always match the level of the two above-mentioned brands.  However, some second-order manufacturers often turn to the same Philips accessories to complete their designs. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  Models of 12V luminaires occupy a special niche in the general segment of electrical engineering.  Their specificity is due to a number of characteristics that knock such models out of the general series.  It is enough to note the low power, modest voltage and small size.  It would seem that in addition to decorative qualities, modern 12V LED lamps are not able to attract anything.  But it is not so.  The combination of low energy requirements and flexible configuration capabilities in terms of placement significantly expands the scope of application of such devices.  Of course, there are quite logical warnings from manufacturers, but if we are talking about providing a lighting system at home, the number of design variations can be limited only by the owner‚Äôs imagination. </p>
