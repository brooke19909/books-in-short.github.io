The map of museums encourages the traveler with a meaningful and varied vacation, there are ancient monasteries, churches, architectural monuments, monuments and the amazing atmosphere of the old Russian city.  Perhaps this is why residents value the historical heritage and create new museums.  Among the most extraordinary places that are worth seeing is the Museum ‚ÄúTeapot House‚Äù. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  By the work of entrepreneurs Andrei Vorobyov and Dmitry Nikishkin, a museum was opened in the village of Veskovo, where the kettle became the main exhibit.  The collection has more than 130 copies of teapots of various shapes and materials.  Household items related to the tradition of this meal complement the exposition. </p><p>  The Kettle Museum in Pereslavl-Zalessky is housed in a two-room wooden hut decorated with an old Russian stove.  There is a museum in one room and a souvenir shop in the second.  The interior of each room is provincially simple and cute at the same time.  Here you can admire teapots, old tablecloths, samovars, homespun paths, cups and luxurious inscriptions found on shelves with exhibits or window sills. </p><div class="photo" data-original="4turista.ru" data-author=": Shanti, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Yaroslavl" class="if uuid-3228637" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31591/3228637.jpg"></div><p>  The museum of the teapot in Pereslavl-Zalesky is located on the route to the Museum-Estate ‚ÄúBoat of Peter I‚Äù, so the tourist does not have to look for a unique house, where there is comfort and ancient objects for long evenings, seasoned with delicious tea and intimate conversations. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Exposition </h2><p>  It is impossible to pass by the museum - bright, interesting, with many inscriptions, it attracts attention and invites you to visit.

In addition to the main character, on the shelves and benches of the hall, there is an extensive collection of items related to the tradition of tea drinking.  These are sugar tongs, tin cans for storing tea leaves, crackers, scales, bone abacus, coasters and much more. </p><div class="photo" data-original="myshkin.pravorg.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kettle Museum in Pereslavl Zalessky Description" class="if uuid-3228638" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31591/3228638.jpg"></div><p>  Also in the museum of the teapot of Pereslavl-Zalessky exhibits related to the life of the townspeople are presented.

Its volume is designed for 15 liters, and the main feature is the design that allows you to maintain a constantly high temperature of the water, at the same time, without bringing it to a boil. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.mytravelbook.org" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="museum teapot house" class="if uuid-3228634" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31591/3228634.jpg"></div><p>  Other exhibits of the teapot museum in Pereslavl-Zalessky are also interesting, as the sea is of interest, giving sailors the opportunity to drink a hot drink in any storm.

In addition to large containers where water was heated, there were also teapots; they are also presented in the museum in a wide variety of elegant forms.  Created from brass, copper, porcelain, silver, they still flaunt today, inviting you to taste tea with bagels and pies. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  The description of the teapot museum in Pereslavl-Zalessky will be incomplete, if not to tell about excursions.  In the classical sense, they are absent, but there are guides.  They are ready to tell the story of the tradition of tea drinking, the appearance of tea in Russia and the first teapots, as well as tell about each exhibit, its structure and where it was brought from.

For example, there is a special device that helped our ancestors remove any shoes except for boots.  It is made in the form of a horned bug, cast out of cast iron, to guess why we need such a ‚Äúbug‚Äù in the house we can no longer do. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cyrillitsa.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vesikovo village" class="if uuid-3228635" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31591/3228635.jpg"></div><p>  Some items not so long ago left everyday use.  For example, many remember the radios from the 60s, pioneer ties, Lenin's busts, cup holders, typewriters - these items and many others are abundantly placed on the shelves of the museum, forcing the older generation to nostalgically plunge into pleasant memories. </p><h2>  Shop </h2><p>  After the cognitive part, most visitors gladly go for souvenirs, since the shop is in the next room.
