Sometimes there is a variable package, where you can see a couple of praises of the device Lexand <span>LR-4500.</span>  Owner <span>reviews</span> will be presented in the article. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In the box you will see: </p><ul><li>  the device itself; </li><li>  bracket; </li><li>  a charger designed for a standard cigarette lighter; </li><li>  three cables such as <span>mini-USB, mini-HDMI</span> and AV-cable; </li><li>  detailed manual in Russian; </li><li>  warranty card; </li><li>  other advertising waste paper. </li></ul><p>  The package bundle can be called mediocre, but due to all kinds of inserts and pads, the box has very impressive dimensions (just right for a gift), despite the modest dimensions of the gadget itself. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  The Lexand LR-4500 model with all its appearance looks very much like a regular camera, and there are good reasons for that.  Firstly, it is a five-megapixel lens that protrudes from a monoblock for a good two centimeters and is located in the upper right corner.  Secondly - the buttons on the end, very reminiscent of the familiar "Descent" and "Change of focus."  Thirdly - this is the display, exactly the same as it happens with ordinary "soap dishes".  Despite the slightly clumsy and specific design, this does not prevent the gadget from being somewhat attractive and even somewhere solid. </p><p>  The left end of the device is devoid of any elements, and on the right are two connectors - HDMI and mini-USB along with a “clover” of an additional speaker.  The lower edge is reserved for the interface for micro-SD-cards, with the slide quite deeply recessed.  On the top of the gadget we will see three oval-oblique buttons - Mode, Menu and Mute, as well as a thread for the bracket on the Lexand LR-4500.  User reviews note that the key layout is not very convenient, because some motorists are used to installing the recorder on a “torpedo” or “upside down”, which greatly complicates access to the buttons in our case. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  There is a display on the rear panel of the device, a slightly higher operating status indicator, and on the right there is a block of function keys together with a microphone and a data reset hole (“cold start”). </p><p>  The entire design of the Lexand LR-4500 is assembled from a fairly high-quality plastic with a matte and dumb metallized surface.  The gadget is as if divided into two parts by a black stripe that runs along the entire perimeter.  Its purpose is not entirely clear, so we will consider this moment as a designer chip. </p><p>  As for the build quality, then, as users note, it is quite solid: there are no any backlashes, creaks or crunches.  But for some reason, a feeling of thoroughness does not arise if you hold the Lexand LR-4500 video recorder in your hands.  Owner reviews have repeatedly noted some visual flimsy design;  Among other competing vehicles, this is clearly not a Mercedes. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  The ordinary software that comes with the recorder is clearly not ergonomic and intuitive.  Not everyone can deal with the settings, menus, and basic functionality, and even with an interface fully translated into Russian. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In total, the gadget has three working screens: video recording, photography and working with existing material (not counting the settings).  By the way, users note that the menu is quite extensive and confusing for Lexand LR-4500 (firmware 2013.4500LR.1806.2709).  It’s better to deal with it right away, how to set it up and don’t get in there without the need, especially in motion. </p>

    <p>  The main working area is reserved for the viewfinder.  The lower and upper sections of the screen show the current parameters: operating mode, video quality, battery indicator, time, etc.  The entire recording in motion is shown on a small screen, which for some reason cannot be turned off, and this can distract some drivers. </p><p>  By itself, the Lexand LR-4500 does not turn on, this function was left to a rather sensitive motion sensor: with the slightest shake, the gadget immediately starts recording.  I am glad that the sensitivity indicator can be configured in the menu, and with a large spread.  In addition, there is an adjustment of the duration of the video being shot, that is, the cycle - for 1, 3 and so on minutes. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The diagonal of the device (2 inches) is determined by the dimensions of the recorder itself, and a large screen would simply not fit in it.  It does not shine with attractive characteristics: pixelation, controversial gamma and coloring of elements are noticeable, but the screen copes with its main tasks no less than the topic.  Lexand LR-4500 has no problems with setting modes, choosing menu items, photos / videos. </p>

    <p>  The gadget’s angle overview is at an acceptable level, but you don’t have to rely on being able to make out the numbers of passing cars or other small elements.  To do this, you will have to turn to identifiers or to more advanced models of this manufacturer for help. </p><h2>  Photo and video shooting </h2><p>  Judging by user reviews, a good five megapixel camera can cover an area of ​​about 140 degrees, which is good news.  For the most part, this was promoted by a lens noticeably extended from the housing.  Nevertheless, the Lexand LR-4500 camera still has some “fishiness” of the picture.  Overview of the angles, although at the proper level, but all the time there is some blurring of the areas on the sides. </p><p>  The very quality of the shooting, according to the owners, looks very good: almost all the events that occur in front of your hood and even slightly touch the curb fall into the frame.  There are no white spots at the cyclic joints (1, 3, 5, and 10 minutes) in the recordings.  The Lexand LR-4500 camera does not have infrared capabilities, but working in the dark is quite acceptable due to the good photosensitivity of the main elements. </p><h2>  Battery life </h2><p>  Car owners note that a 350 mAh non-removable battery is a weak spot in the recorder.  Such a funny capacity is enough for no more than half an hour of shooting.  Of course, it’s good that the device, by virtue of its dimensions, does not take up much space on the windshield, but constantly keeping it “on a leash” with the cigarette lighter is not the most convenient option.  Although, on the other hand, it’s not so often that you meet a motorist who uses only the autonomous mode, regularly charging and disconnecting the recorder between trips. </p><h2>  Competitors models </h2><p>  Oddly enough, but if you do not take into account nameless gadgets with blurry characteristics from the Middle Kingdom, then there are not so many obvious competitors in our respondent, and specifically, only two.  We will consider them below. </p><h2>  MiVue 358 from Mio </h2><p>  Having almost the same price tags, dimensions and basic technical characteristics, the Mio 358 is inferior in viewing degrees - only 120 versus 140 ° LR-4500.  But unlike our experimental Gadget “Mio” is equipped with a special night mode, which is much better than the capabilities of the LR line. </p>

    <p>  In addition, the 358th model has a noticeably larger screen diagonal (2.4 inches) and is characterized by a higher battery life due to the capacious 470 mAh battery. </p><h2>  Cubex V31 from Neoline </h2><p>  Another competitor to the LR-4500 can be called a pretty device from the Neoline V31 series.  Just like in the first case, Kubeks has smaller viewing angles, but a more attractive screen and battery life.  The original and really beautiful design of the model, a good 2.4-inch screen, a 470 mAh battery and an affordable price tag make the gadget a little more attractive than our respondent. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  For users, the LR-4500 DVR from Lexanda leaves behind some mixed feelings.  On the one hand, this is a hypertrophied type of optics, but on the other, it doesn’t seem to interfere, and viewing angles are noticeably larger than competitors. </p>

    <p>  The quality of the gadget's recording did not disappoint.  Although the night mode is not stated in the specification of the device, as well as the backlight, the video can nevertheless be written in the dark, and it is quite legible.  The menu and all its branches, of course, can’t be called but a damn leg, but once you figure it out and set it up, you can forget about it. </p><p>  In general, if you are looking for a registrar for high-quality recording, but do not have a large budget and are ready to put up with small "Chinese" shortcomings, then the Lexand LR-4500 is quite suitable for you. </p>
