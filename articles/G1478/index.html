In the sixth - 2 PSSN <span>, from the seventh to the tenth - one PSSN, in the eleventh - 2 PSSN, from the thirteenth to fifteenth - 2 C2H, in the sixteenth - 2 PSSN and, finally, 1 PSSN.</span>  <span>We complete the series in the same way as the first, using the joint venture.</span> </p><p>  The third row begins with three lifting eyelets.  In the first four loops, we perform one 1, in the next five - two in each.  In the next eight - one at a time, in the next five - two at a time.  It remains for us to do 1 1 in the last loops.  We complete the <span>joint venture in the third loop of the VP of the previous row.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to crochet an owl applique" class="if uuid-2864678" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/2864678.jpg"></div><h2>  We continue to work with the oval blank </h2><p>  We start the fourth row as well as the third, with three VPs, we knit 1 1 in the same loop, in the next two - one , then 2 1.  We repeat the rapport six times: 1 1 (in the first loop) - 2 1 (in the second).  Next, we knit in two loops one 1, two 1 - in the next, repeat.  <span>Again we use rapport 6 times: 1 1 - 2 1.</span>  <span>In the next two loops, we perform one C1H, then 2 C1H.</span>  <span>Then we knit 1 C1H to the end of the row.</span>  <span>Close the joint venture (similar to row number 3).</span> </p><p>  <span>Fifth row: 3 VP and 1 C1H (in the same loop).</span>  <span>In the next two - 1 1, then - 2  in one loop.</span>  <span>This simple pattern is repeated until the end.</span> </p><p>  <span>Close the row using the joint venture.</span>  <span>The thread is carefully cut and fastened.</span>  <span>The head of the applique crocheted "Owl" made by yourself.</span>  <span>See, it‚Äôs not at all difficult!</span>  <span>The main thing is to carefully follow the instructions and count the loops.</span> </p><h2>  Stage Two: Owl Ears </h2><p>  <span>We knit the ears according to the following pattern.</span>  <span>We attach the main color yarn to the side of the head (from the center of the workpiece we count 14 loops to the right).</span>  <span>First row: 2 VP, 1 1 in the next 4 loops, 2 half-columns connected together, the first in the same loop as the last of the four , the second in the next.</span>  <span>We knit over.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  <span>We start the second row with 2 VP.</span>  <span>First we knit 2 PSSN, connecting them together, then 1 PSSN.</span>  <span>In the last two loops we do 2 PSSN with one vertex.</span>  <span>We turn the workpiece.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet applique owl description" class="if uuid-2864679" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/2864679.jpg"></div><p>  <span>Third row: 2 VP and a group of half-columns with a crochet with a common top, in all the loops of the base.</span>  <span>Congratulations, the first eye is ready.</span>  <span>The second is performed from the other side, by analogy.</span> </p><p>  When both ears are ready, carefully shape the edge.  To do this, attach the thread of the main color to the head and make the strapping with columns without a crochet. </p><h2>  Stage Three: Torso and Eyes </h2><p>  We continue to work on our crochet <span>"Owl" applique</span> .  A description of the method of knitting eyes, beak, wings and paws will be presented below.  We do the body of the owl according to the scheme that was used when performing the head, using the thread of the main color.  We get an oval blank. </p><p>  Proceed to knitting the eyes of an owl.  We take a white thread, we make an amigurumi ring, 3 VP and 12 C1H into the ring.  We close the joint venture into the third loop of the initial chain. </p><p>  We knit the second row from 2 VP, 1 PSSN (in the same loop), 2 PSSN (in each next loop of the circle), SP (in the second loop of the chain).  The first blank for the eye is ready.  By analogy, we carry out the second. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY crochet owl applique" class="if uuid-2864710" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/2864710.jpg"></div><p>  Getting to knitting the pupils.  Take a black thread.  We make an air ring, 1 VP and 8 SC in a circle.  We close the joint venture, fix the thread.  The second pupil is performed according to the same scheme. </p><h2>  Stage Four: The Beak </h2><p>  We begin to make the beak.  To do this, we will use yellow or orange yarn.  We perform an amigurumi ring, 3 VP, 2 double crochet.  In a circle we do not connect, we turn the workpiece. </p><p>  In the second row, we make 3 VPs and a group of double crochets connected at the same vertex (in all loops).  We fix the thread.  Congratulations, the beak is ready!  The application "Owl", crocheted, takes on a recognizable shape. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet application owl master class" class="if uuid-2864686" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/2864686.jpg"></div><h2>  Stage Five: Wings </h2><p>  To perform the wings, we take a thread contrasting in color to the body.  We make an amigurumi ring, 3 VP and 2 C1H, do not connect in a circle, turn. </p><p>  We knit the second row of 3 VP, 1 1 (in the same loop), in the next - 1 1 and 1 1 - in a chain of VP.  We turn. </p><p>  In the third row we make 3 VP, 2 1 in the same loop, in the next two - one 1, and finally 1 1 in a chain of VP.  We turn. </p><p>  Fourth row: 3 VP, in the same loop and in the next - two double crochets connected at one vertex.  In the remaining three - one 1, and 1 1 - to the top of the chain.  We turn. </p><p>  Fifth row: 3 VP, in the same loop 1 , in the rest, except the last, one  each.  The row is almost ready.  In the last loop and at the top of the chain we knit double crochet, connecting them together.  We turn the workpiece again. </p><p>  Sixth row: 3 VP, 1 C1H (in the same loop), in all the rest - one C1H and in the loop of the chain too.  We turn. </p><p>  Seventh row: 3 VP and 1 1 (the same way), one double crochet - in all loops except the last two.  Now we run double crochet with one vertex in the last loops.  We turn the wing. </p><p>  Eighth row: we perform 3 VP and a group of double crochet columns with a common vertex in all base loops.  We do not cut the thread yet.  We proceed to strapping the wing along the edge.  We make 1 VP, using single crochet columns, arrange the blank along the entire perimeter.  Now you can fasten and cut the thread.  The first wing is ready. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY crochet owl applique 2" class="if uuid-2864761" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/2864761.jpg"></div><p>  We perform the second according to the same scheme.  An important point: after you tie the wing, you will need to turn it and make the harness on the other side.  This is necessary so that the parts are the same.  Our beautiful <span>crocheted owl is</span> almost ready <span>.</span>  The application can only be collected and added to the trunk of the legs. </p><h2>  Stage Six: Feet for the Owl </h2><p>  In order to tie the last element of the applique, we take a yellow or orange thread.  We attach it by stepping to the left of the center three loops.  We perform three VP, 1 C1H (in the same loop), 3 VP and 1 half-crochet (in the same loop) and one more (in the next).  Repeat this pattern twice.  The first foot is ready.  We knit the second by analogy, stepping six loops to the right from the center of the body.  Congratulations, all the details are ready.  Now you know how to crochet an owl applique. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY crochet owl applique 3" class="if uuid-2864881" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/2864881.jpg"></div><h2>  Stage seven: assembly of the finished product </h2><p>  We pass to the final stage of work - assembly of the product.  Gently sew the wings to the body. </p><p>  We take a needle and white sewing thread.  We embroider a white dot on each pupil.  White eye blanks are fastened together.  Sew the pupils to the white base.  We make beautiful cilia with black thread.  Sew the eyes and beak to the head, and the head to the torso. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY crochet owl applique 4" class="if uuid-2864915" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/2864915.jpg"></div><p>  The work is done!
