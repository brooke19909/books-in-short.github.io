It fully lives up to its name: The Color Hotels Side 4 *. </p><h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  The Color <span>Hotels Side 4 *</span> is located 65 kilometers from Antalya, 5 kilometers from Side and 15 kilometers from the village of Manavgat.

The hotel is located on the waterfront itself and is considered young and very modern, since it was opened in 2012.  It was built by international standards, and stands out for its brightness, which in itself already creates a wonderful mood among many hotels on the coast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the color hotels side 4" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1470317.jpg" width="600"></div>

The city is located on a peninsula seventy-five kilometers from Antalya, and is considered one of the busiest resort destinations throughout Turkey.

In the west of the city, the coast is always crowded with vacationers, but in the east the coast is less crowded, and therefore the rest here is more comfortable.  In addition to the center of Side, the resort also includes a number of pretty villages and towns with good beaches, which have recently become more and more popular among tourists: Kizilot, Sorgun, Kyzylagach, Kumkoy, Cholakli. </p><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  The Color Hotels Side 4 * has at its disposal 125 rooms.  All apartments have a private balcony, satellite TV, individual air conditioning, Wi-Fi. </p><p>  The hotel has rooms of the following categories: </p><ol><li>  Double Land View is a double room with panoramic city views (22 square meters).

Alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks are offered in any quantity, they are included in the price of the tour.  The food is quite varied, however, there are not so many meat dishes.  The main restaurant is a buffet.  At lunchtime, you can eat at the beach bar, so as not to return to the hotel.  The set of dishes here is no different from what you will be offered at the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the color hotels side 4 turkey konakli" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1470310.jpg" width="332"></div>

The territory itself is small, but located on it: parking, hairdresser, car rental, laundry, pools, water slides, shops, luggage room.  Check-in at the hotel occurs exactly at two in the afternoon and not a minute earlier, even if you arrive long before this time.  This is not entirely convenient.  Of course, guests are immediately registered at the reception, things are sent to the left-luggage office, bracelets are handed out, and you can go for breakfast and lunch.  But you can get into the room only at 14.00. </p><p>  Pets are not allowed in the hotel.  From the hotel to the beach about six hundred meters.  If you do not rush, you can walk for ten to fifteen minutes.  But this can not be done, because every fifteen minutes there is a completely free shuttle bass.  The bus adheres to the schedule; you need not worry about this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the colors side hotel 4 turkey side" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1470315.jpg" width="600"></div>

The archaeological complex is a real open-air museum.  Its territory can be reached through the ancient main gates of the time of the Hellenes.  And then go along the main street with a colonnade to the museum, which is located in the building of public baths.  Here is the ancient agora and the remains of the Tiche and Fortune temple, and the theater, which once hosted gladiator fights.  Nearby is the temple of Dionysus, near which the restored fountain flaunts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the color hotels side 4 turkey colakli" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1470319.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In addition to historical sites, Side has many bars, restaurants and discos that entertain guests until dawn.  The most popular club is Oxide.  For supporters of shopping in the city, jewelry stores, shops with leather and carpet products work.  The best traders are on Kolonnaya Street, they sell quality goods. </p><h2>  The Color Hotels Side 4 *: reviews </h2><p>  Summing up the conversation about the hotel, I want to pay attention to the reviews of tourists who visited this complex.  In their opinion, the complex is focused on vacationers with children, as stated.  The building itself and everything that is on the territory is very bright and beautiful, in short - colored.  However, the bulk of vacationers are Germans (eighty percent of them are here), Czechs, Turks.  Even the prices in local shops are oriented to German citizens, and therefore the cost of goods is set in euros.  You will not find anything cheaper than one euro. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the color hotels side 4 side" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1470320.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Inside the building itself and the rooms are made in a simple style, there are no luxurious interiors. </p><p>  As for the service, on arrival, check-in does not occur before 14.00, and even a cash bonus is not able to solve this problem.  With departure the same story.  You need to hand over the number at 12.00, they are not allowed to stay, even if your flight is much later.  At the same time, things are handed over to the left-luggage office at the reception and people remain languishing in the lobby. </p><p>  The Color Hotels Side 4 * <span>(Turkey, Konakli)</span> inside is very clean and well maintained.  The rooms are cleaned regularly.  Towels are changed daily, but with regard to the beds you have to remind.  Not all apartments have a good view, from the windows of some you can see the neighboring wasteland.  If the room enters the stage for animation and the pool, then, of course, in the evenings it will be noisy due to the views. </p><p>  The furniture in the apartment is new and beautiful, the shower and other appliances are in good condition.  On satellite TV you can watch three Russian-language channels. </p><p>  The food at the hotel is quite acceptable.  True, there is not always meat dishes, as a rule, fish is served at lunch, local sausages or sausages fried in the morning, and tasty meat in the evening.  Snacks and salads are enough, everything is fresh and good.  Fruits are served enough, but their assortment is not diverse.  But taste is a matter of chance, some tasty, others not.  But this is not a minus of the hotel, since this trend is observed in all hotels of the country.  In the daytime, the bar offers snacks and ice cream.  Alcoholic drinks and cocktails are very different.  In general, local alcohol is free, but foreign brands need to be paid separately.  Sweet desserts and pastries are very tasty, even those who do not consider themselves sweet tooth should try them. </p><p>  The hotel‚Äôs beach is about six hundred meters, you can walk on foot, but somehow you don‚Äôt want to.  Therefore, it is easier to get on a bus that runs all day.  The beach is just wonderful.  Sandy beach with a gentle slope into the sea.  The water is always warm and clean.  For children there is expanse.  You can dine at the beach bar, the food is the same as in the hotel, maybe only a little less assortment. </p><p>  Animators entertain adults around the pool and on the beach during the day.  And in the evenings, musical programs await guests on the stage, sometimes even a fire show. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the color hotels side 4 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1470323.jpg"></div>

    <p>  For those tourists who wish to visit local attractions, local guides organize trips.  Excursions are quite expensive, so our compatriots prefer independent tours.  It is very interesting to visit the ancient <span>attractions of Side.</span>  And the city itself is good for walking and shopping.  You should definitely visit the local cafes and try fresh fish dishes. </p><p>  The coast of the resort is an ideal place for diving, for this reason there are many centers providing training in the basics of this wonderful sport.  In such places you can rent all the necessary equipment to enjoy the beauty of the underwater world.  Well-trained tourists are even offered to watch the sunken ships and planes of the Second World War. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Can I recommend the Color Side Hotel (Side, 4 *) for relaxation?  Turkey is a colorful country with a developed network of resorts.  Many hotels of various levels have been built on the country's coast, there are plenty to choose from.  If you are planning a vacation in the Side area, and do not want to spend a lot on the trip, then The Color Side is quite suitable for a budget stay for the whole family. </p>
