Here you can fully relax on the coast of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãJapan, enjoy the picturesque landscapes of unspoiled nature and majestic boulders on the shore.  For those who are not chasing big waves, the Bay of Peace (Primorsky Territory) is ideal.  Photos, which are in the article, fully convey the beauty of this place.  You can get here by car from the city of Nakhodka.  You need to go along the highway to the village of Pervostroiteley.  Near it there will be a turn onto a <span>country road,</span> which is marked by a sign.  Moving along it, you can get directly to the coast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="calm bay of the coastal region" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1416822.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Briefly about the bay </h2><p>  Calm Bay of the Primorsky Territory, as mentioned above, is located in <span>the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãJapan.</span>  From the city of Nakhodka it is separated by a distance of 30 kilometers.  This place greets tourists with clear emerald water.  In the summer, the sea warms up to a comfortable temperature - + 22 ... + 25 ¬∞ .  The beaches on the coast are clean, covered with fine white sand.  There are areas on which there are large boulders.  From a distance, their cluster looks mysterious and majestic.  They are rough to the touch, so tourists are advised to walk on them only shod.  In some places, the approach to the coast is steep.  It is covered with low vegetation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The bay is surrounded by mountains on three sides, due to this there is practically no wind.  Accordingly, waves are rare here.  Such conditions provide a safe swimming, make it possible to ride catamarans and diving.  The underwater world is very diverse.  You can fish both from the water and from the shore. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="calm bay" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1416823.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Neighborhood </h2><p>  Calm Bay of Primorsky Krai is attractive for connoisseurs of relaxation with tents.  In its vicinity you can find a lot of firewood, also a stream with clean water flows here.  The absence of a gale, the possibility of fishing, swimming in the purest sea water - what else is needed for a good rest? </p><p>  For those tourists who do not want to give up the benefits of civilization, there are recreation centers.  The best of them is "Calm Bay."  We will tell you more about it a little later. </p><p>  Arriving in these places, tourists can not only enjoy a beach holiday, but also engage in active sports.  There are all conditions for climbing, running or mountain biking. </p><p>  Fans of beauty are advised to visit the "Devil's Finger".  It is a rocky formation.  A huge boulder hangs from its top.  If you observe from the side, you get the impression that he is about to fall down. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Given that previously the territory of Spokoynaya Bay was in the border zone, rest in these places was prohibited.

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Those who have already rested in these places can share their impressions.  Clear water, unusual picturesque landscapes, good weather and sandy beaches pleased their Spokojnaya Bay (Primorsky Territory).  Reviews of tourists are mostly only positive.  The only thing that can overshadow the trip is the dirt road that goes through the pass.  During rains, it is very eroded, so it is difficult to overcome this area with a conventional passenger car.  Also, some tourists who come here every year give tips on booking rooms.  The best are those houses that are located near the bathhouse.  They are somewhat separate from the others and fully equipped.  That is why nothing can overshadow the rest in the Bay of Spokoynaya. </p>
