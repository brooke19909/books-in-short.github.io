However, the latter will definitely not have time to watch.

A lot of kind words are addressed to the medical staff, who are really professional here.  The rest of the reviews diverge.  As usual, living conditions and food are a moot point, most like it, but there will always be those who are not comfortable with something. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the riverine sanatorium of Belarus" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/982641.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Sanatorium equipment </h2><p>  An excellent diagnostic room works on the base, where you can confirm the diagnosis or get advice from specialized specialists.  A clinical laboratory, ultrasound rooms, electrocardiography and functional diagnostics are constantly operating.  Many of the patients go through the gastroenteroscopy room, as many people with digestive problems come here in profile.  Most often, reviews about the sanatorium "Porechye" (Belarus) relate specifically to the organization of treatment.  And in this he has no equal.  The medical staff here is selected at the highest level, each patient receives a full examination, treatment and recommendations for the future.  Many thanks go to the doctors and nurses who work here. </p><h2>  Sanatorium "Radon" </h2><p>  As you might have guessed, in these places there is not only a health resort called ‚ÄúPorechye‚Äù.  The resorts of Belarus are presented in such a rich assortment that we could hardly list them all.  However, one cannot ignore the famous Radon.  It is located in a pine forest, on an equipped reservoir, at the confluence of two rivers.  This sanatorium works wonders in treating diseases of the musculoskeletal system.  There is a whole scientific center that is engaged in the development of new programs and methods for treating various problems.  The source of radon is the most important resource of the sanatorium, thanks to which its work becomes possible.  This is a fairly large health resort, while more than 600 people can relax here.  The treatment is based on <span>radon baths,</span> complemented by mud baths that are brought from <span>Lake Wild.</span>  The basis of climatotherapy is the cleanest air and the smell of coniferous forest.  All the health resorts of Belarus are famous for these natural factors (at the same time, ‚ÄúPorechye‚Äù keeps prices at a lower level).  Rest and treatment in "Radon" will cost an average of 2000 rubles per day.  Of course, the real cost will depend on the selected procedures. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="health resort Porechye Belarus" class="if" height="477" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/982646.jpg" width="600"></div>

Unlike the responses written to the sanatorium "Porechye" (Belarus), reviews about it are most often left by people with diseases of the cardiovascular and nervous system.  This is easy to explain, because the profile of this health resort is completely different.  Here you will find new buildings, well-groomed territory and beautiful views of the pine forest.  Your attention is offered by rooms of various levels of comfort.  This category is standard and luxury, and for those who value comfort and privacy, there are two-story cottages that stand apart. </p><h2>  Sanatorium "Praleska" </h2><p>  It is located on the territory of the Volkovysky district, in a huge mixed forest.  Here, among coniferous and deciduous trees there is also an artificial lake.  Here, river water mixes with spring water from underground chinens.  To accommodate guests, there is a large sleeping building, and the second, a little smaller, is used as a medical building.  The number of rooms is only 90 places, so you need to book in advance.  Mineral water is used here to treat patients.  A rich diagnostic base implies the presence of computer, ultrasound diagnostics and electrocardiography rooms. </p><h2>  Treatment rooms and doctors </h2><p>  The resort offers aromatherapy and hydrotherapy, halotherapy, and acupuncture rooms.

The price of a standard voucher for 21 days includes the whole range of procedures you need.

You can not only stay in a stunningly beautiful place and breathe in the cleanest air, but also get professional medical help, which, in combination with optimal conditions (clean air, calm environment) will work especially effectively.  Despite everything, the health resorts of Belarus were and remain one of the best in the post-Soviet space.  Be sure to visit one of them to prevent or treat existing diseases. </p>
