But does it have anything in common with the geographical location indicated on the map of Russia?  This remains to be seen.  But in any case, this place is worth a visit. </p><p>  The wonderful <span>Karelian nature, the</span> ultramarine surface of Koncheozero, which stretches for thirty kilometers - all this attracts tourists.  Moreover, this attraction is located not so far from Petrozavodsk, some forty kilometers away.  They come to Sampo in groups to the paleovolcano Girvas and to the <span>Martial waters.</span>  But besides ordinary tourists who want to touch the enchanting nature of Karelia, hundreds, if not thousands of esoteric people rush here.  What are they looking for on this mountain?  We will also consider this in this article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sampo Mountain" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1679980.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Sampo in terms of geology </h2><p>  We will not bore you with numerous scientific terms.  We will only say that the relief of Karelia was finally formed under the influence of numerous glaciers.  The last of them went north twelve thousand years ago.  Glaciers were run into perfectly round boulders (the so-called "ram's foreheads"), piled the rock in low lonely hills (kams) or exposed the crystalline interior of the earth (selga). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In a word, Sampo is a mountain composed of vertical movements of the earth's crust, as well as under the influence of a glacier.  Here you can see the long stretches of selg.  Numerous Karelian lakes are located in the faults today. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mount Sampo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1680011.jpg" width="353"></div>

    <h2>  Mountain - the character of Kalevala </h2><p>  Karelian-Finnish mythology represents Sampo in the form of a mill.  This magic item ground grain, gold and salt in such quantities that there was enough for everyone to prosper.  The Sampo mill was forged by the blacksmith Ilmarinen as a ransom for his bride, the daughter of Louhi.  But I had to steal a gift.  The blacksmith, in the company of the sage V√§in√§m√∂inen and Lemmink√§inen, goes to Pohjelu, euthanizes all its inhabitants and takes out Sampo.  They try to take the mill away by boat, but Louha catches them.  As a result of the battle, the mill breaks and falls into the water.  That is why the Karelians consider the sea richer than land.  The wreckage of the mill throws ashore surf.  V√§in√§m√∂inen collects them, so Mount Sampo appeared.  It is endowed with magical properties, gives the land a harvest, and the nearby lakes - rich fish stocks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mount sampo karelia" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1680003.jpg" width="500"></div>

You can judge and wonder for a long time where the mystical mountain is located.  Many researchers, starting with the creator of Kalevala, Elias L√∂nnrot, searched for her in different parts of Karelia.  It is believed that Sampo is actually not a mountain, but a natural dam on a large but shallow lake.  Thanks to this dam, the water does not freeze, which is why the number of fish has increased several hundred times.  But the Sampo described by us is a mountain with clearly defined geographical coordinates.  But does she have anything to do with mysticism? </p><p>  The fact is that until the sixties of the twentieth century, this hill was nameless.  It received its name in connection with the creation of the Soviet-Finnish film "Sampo" based on "Kalevala".  This mountain was chosen for its picturesque nature and the views that open on Koncheozero.  The hill, turned into a movie set, became known as Sampo.  The film was shot, and the name stuck and received official status. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mount Sampo photo" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1680010.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  For esotericists </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the nameless hill became magical solely by the will of the scriptwriters, the path of those who want to stand on the axis of power and feel the special energy of space does not overgrow it.  For the esotericists, Sampo is a mountain, not so much cleansing the chakras as fulfilling wishes. </p><p>  It is believed that you need to climb to the top of the hill, hang on the branch of a hundred-year-old pine growing there a shred of your clothes and make a soulful desire.  That's all!  No hard work, no need to purposefully go to the goal!  Arrived, hung a T-shirt and wait for your dream to come true. </p><p>  By the way, the entire top of the hill is an unpleasant sight due to human laziness and superstition.  The perennial pine will soon collapse under the clothes that were hung on it.  But the esotericists laid a convenient staircase with a railing, thanks to which it became much easier to climb to the observation deck. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to get to Sampo Mountain" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1680028.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get to Sampo Mountain </h2><p>  A natural landmark is located thirty-seven kilometers northeast of Petrozavodsk.  First you should move along the P15 highway.  Then you need to turn onto the P21 road.  It should go to the village of Shuyskaya, or rather, to the road sign to the village of Kosalma.  Fourteen kilometers will have to follow a narrow highway between two lakes - Uksh and Konch.  There are no road signs in this section.  But the place is easy to find, since there is a parking lot with lots of parked cars and buses nearby.  Mount Sampo, whose photo is the hallmark of the Karelian region, attracts many tourists and pilgrims. </p>
