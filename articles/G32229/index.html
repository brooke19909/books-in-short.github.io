  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Human race</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the modern world, several <span>races</span> stand out <span>, the main</span> are the four races of man (some scholars insist on three): Caucasoid, Mongoloid, Negroid and Australoid.  How does division happen?  Each race has hereditary traits that are unique to it.  Such signs include the color of the skin, eyes and hair, the shape and size of such parts of the face as the eyes, nose, lips.  In addition to the external obvious distinguishing features of any human race, there are a number of characteristics of creativity, abilities for one or another work activity, and even structural features of the human brain. </p><p>  Speaking of four large groups, one cannot but say that they are all divided into small subraces, which are formed from various nationalities and nationalities.  Nobody has been arguing about the species unity of man for a long time, the best evidence of this unity is our life, in which representatives of various families get married and get married, and viable children are born in these <span>interracial marriages</span> . </p><p>  The origin of races, or rather their formation begins thirty-forty thousand years ago, when people begin to populate new geographical areas.  A person adapted to live in certain conditions, the development of various racial attributes depended on this.  <span>Natural selection</span> determined these attributes.  At the same time, all races of man retained the general species features characterizing the rational man.  The evolutionary development, or rather its level, is the same among representatives of different races.  Therefore, all allegations of the superiority of a nation over others have no basis underneath.  The concepts of ‚Äúrace‚Äù, ‚Äúnation‚Äù, ‚Äúnationality‚Äù cannot be confused and confused, since representatives of different races who speak the same language can live on the territory of one state. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Caucasoid race: the <span>indigenous people</span> living in <span>Europe, South</span> Asia, North Africa.  Northern Caucasians are fair-faced, and southerners are dark-faced.  Narrow face, strongly protruding nose, soft hair. </p><p>  Mongoloid race: the center and eastern part of Asia, Indonesia and the open spaces of Siberia.  Dark-skinned skin with a yellowish tint, straight tough hair, a wide, flat face and a special cut in the eyes. </p><p>  Negroid race: a large part of the population of Africa.  The skin is dark in color, dark brown eyes, black hair - thick, stiff, curly, large lips, and the nose is wide and flat. </p><p>  Australoid race.  Some scientists distinguish it as a branch of the Negroid race.  India, Southeast Asia, Australia and Oceania (an ancient black population).  Strongly developed superciliary arches, <span>wavy hair, the</span> pigmentation of which is weakened.  Some Australoids of the west of Australia, southern India, in their youth are natural blondes, the process of mutation, once entrenched, was to blame. </p><p>  The characteristics of each human race are hereditary.  And their development was primarily due to the need and usefulness of a particular attribute to a representative of a particular race.  Thus, the vast <span>nasal cavity</span> warms up cold air faster and easier until it enters the lungs of the Mongoloid.  And for the representative of the Negroid race, the dark color of the skin and the presence of thick curly hair, which formed an air gap that reduced the effect of sunlight on the body, were very important. </p><p>  For many years, the white race was considered the highest, since the Europeans and Americans conquering the peoples of Asia and Africa, it was so profitable.  They started wars and seized foreign lands, mercilessly exploited, and sometimes simply destroyed entire nations. </p><p>  Today in America, for example, they are looking less and less at racial differences, races are mixing, which sooner or later will lead to the emergence of a hybrid population. </p>
