Lovers of active pastimes can book excursions to numerous historical and natural monuments.  Tourists who prefer a relaxing holiday will enjoy the country's cleanest sandy beaches.  South Goa - a state that is just perfect for a beach holiday.  There are many budget hotels, one of which is the complex <span>The Byke Resort Goa</span> Old Anchor 3 *.  He will be discussed in this article. </p><h2>  Read more about holidays in South Goa </h2><p>  To begin with, it is worth noting that this resort is focused on respectable holidays, so the cost of living here is usually a little higher than in North Goa.  At the same time, the beaches here are clean.  On the streets, for example, you will definitely not find untidy herds of cows or packs of dogs.  Expensive hotels were built everywhere, and tourist infrastructure was created.  Most often, elderly travelers from Europe come here, but the Russians have not yet managed to fall in love with the resort.  A distinctive feature of South Goa - magnificent white beaches, the purity of which is carefully monitored. </p><p>  The state is divided into several resort villages.  The Byke Old Anchor Resort 3 * hotel is located in the town of Cavelossim, which is focused exclusively on a calm and quiet vacation.  Here you will not find cheap bars and noisy night clubs.  But the strip of coast along is lined with velvet sand, and the sea was chosen by dolphins, which both adults and children like to watch.  Along the beaches there are many restaurants offering fish and seafood dishes.  Some establishments may even cook you a dinner of fish that you yourself caught.  Other attractions include descent along the Sal River, excursions to the tropics, where you can watch exotic birds and plantations.  Often in Cavelossim parties are held with fireworks, performances of magicians and acrobats. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where is the hotel situated? </h2><p>  As mentioned above, The Byke Old Anchor 3 * hotel is located in Cavelossim.
