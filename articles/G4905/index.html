People added one more to all natural divas - the man-made sea Krasnoyarsk, which has become a favorite vacation spot for Russians. </p><h2>  Buzim Lake </h2><p>  The name of the lake causes a smile, because the word "buzim" can be interpreted as "have fun." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest recreation center Buzim" class="if" height="346" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/466651.jpg" width="479"></div>  However, Lake Buzim is a fairly calm pond, surrounded by an evergreen coniferous forest, under the canopy of which there is a carpet of grass and flowers.  The lake was born thanks to a dam on the river of the same name.  Four years ago, the walls of an artificial barrier were destroyed, and the lake again became a river.  But the dam was quickly restored, and now again you can admire the serenity and beauty of the local nature, forgetting about the city bustle.  They come here savages, put up tents on the shore, go fishing, pick mushrooms and berries and cook food at the stake, in general, enjoy the romance.  And here lovers of comfort are given a wonderful vacation by the recreation center ‚ÄúBuzim‚Äù, located right on the lake.

Photos taken by tourists demonstrate the water surface of the lake framed by trees.  There is a good beach at the base.  On the opposite side, where tents are usually located, there is no such smooth descent into the water.  Both beach-goers and savages can be on the beach, but the latter will have to pay entry fees to the base.  You can make boat trips and catamarans around the lake; they are provided at the camp site for a fee.  You can also take bicycles and barbecue grills for use, but experienced vacationers advise you to bring your own, since there are not enough base ones for everyone.  To services of visitors - a sauna with the pool, a small golf course, a billiard room, sports grounds, tennis tables.  There are halls for banquets and conferences.  Meals at the base are organized in your own restaurant, where breakfast is served according to the buffet system, and lunches and dinners can be ordered according to your preferences (children's, vegetarian dishes, menus for fitness).  On weekends, discos and music festivals are held at the base. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holiday Village Buzim photo" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/466649.jpg" width="469"></div>

    <h2>  Rest on the Krasnoyarsk Sea </h2><p>  The Krasnoyarsk reservoir created on the Yenisei is so huge that many call it the sea.  Several large rivers flow into it, at the mouth of which beautiful bays formed.  The most popular - Tubinsky, Biryusinsky, Buzz.  On their shores built magnificent recreation centers.  Krasnoyarsk is located about 45 km from the hydroelectric power station, and the reservoir itself stretches for almost 400 km, so the distance and travel time to the resting place will depend on which bay to choose.  But in any case, you need to go to Divnogorsk (by car, bus or train), and then by bus or taxi.  The scenery on the Krasnoyarsk Sea is magnificent.  There are beaches convenient for swimming and launching boats, there are fringed with dense green forests, and there are decorated with harsh rocks.  One of them looks like a ring.  They say that if you go under it and make a wish, it will come true.  There are many fishermen on the reservoir in winter and summer, because there is always enough fish here.  And in the Derby Bay not only animals are caught, but also household items, since an entire village is flooded here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest in the Krasnoyarsk Territory" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/466644.jpg" width="428"></div>

    <h2>  Where to stay? </h2><p>  Many come to the reservoir savages, pitch tents and relax in Spartan conditions.  Fans of living in comfort are welcomed all year round by wonderful recreation centers.  Krasnoyarsk, Divnogorsk, Minusinsk, Abakan - far from a complete list of cities whose residents constantly come to the reservoir.  In summer, the weather is like in the southern seas.  Air warms up to +30 and above, and water - up to +25, so you can swim and sunbathe.  True, comfortable beaches are not everywhere.  In the bays of Sisim and Tochilny they are sandy, and in other places they are mostly rocky.  Another drawback is the lack of toilets.  Almost every base on the Krasnoyarsk Sea has these amenities, but the "savages" are not allowed there.  And the bases are not everywhere.  For example, in the bays of Daursky, Volchikha, Sisim, you can only sit in a tent.  Excellent modern bases, where vacationers are provided with the widest range of services and rooms with all amenities, are located in the bays of Shumikha, Tochilniy, Shahobaikha on Ogur, in the Primorsk area.  The cost of rooms, depending on the category, is from 600 to 1500 rubles per day.  There are several free hunting lodges in Volchikha Bay.  Here are such accommodation options in the Krasnoyarsk Sea. </p>
