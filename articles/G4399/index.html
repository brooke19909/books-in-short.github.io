Make a panel yourself.  What can be used as a material for creativity?  Yes, anything.  You can make a beautiful picture from coffee beans, buttons or leftover skin.  Look for ideas for inspiration as well as workshops below. </p><h2>  Money Tree </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY panel" class="if uuid-2345311" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2345311.jpg"></div><p>  Have you accumulated a lot of little things?  You can make a money tree out of it.  This panel will be easy to do with your own hands, but it will look very impressive.  If you believe in the teachings of Feng Shui, you can even give the picture a sacred meaning.  If you strongly believe that the panel will make you richer, perhaps this is exactly what will happen.  It is not in vain that they say so much that thoughts materialize. </p><p>  How to make such a picture?  First of all, you need to build a foundation.  The easiest way to do this is to knock together three small boards.  Or you can take a whole sheet of plywood.  Now you need to draw a sketch.  When this stage is completed, arm yourself with a trifle and a glue gun, and create a crown.  To make the picture look more interesting, you can plant an application of owls or butterflies on a tree.  The barrel must be made of acrylic paste.  Be sure to depict ground or grass under a tree.  You can complement the composition with various flowers and birds. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Button Panel </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.deco.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself mural on the wall" class="if uuid-2345314" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2345314.jpg"></div><p>  If you draw poorly, then you should not think that you will not be able to make interesting decor for the apartment.  Show your imagination.  Do-it-yourself panel can be made very simple, but to realize the idea effectively.  For example, lay out a heart of buttons.  As a basis for such a panel, you need to take the canvas.  Pull it onto a tablet or subframe, and then tint the fabric with strips.  To do this, you can use both oil and regular gouache mixed with glue.  We draw the contour of the heart.  You need to place it not in the middle of the canvas, but a little with a shift up.  In the lower part, you can then make an inscription, but even if you do not plan to do this, you still need to raise your heart slightly above the center.  Otherwise, visually your picture will not be balanced.  When the silhouette is ready, you need to fill it with red buttons of various shapes and sizes.  You can make a fabric backing in the form of the base of the heart so that the striped canvas is not visible. </p><h2>  Couple in love </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself decorative panel" class="if uuid-2345318" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2345318.jpg"></div><p>  One of the simplest ideas for making panels with your own hands is to draw a picture and supplement it with paper applications.  You only need to come up with a plot.  If you do not know how to draw, then you can print the outline of the picture, cut it and circle.  The panel will be made on a stretcher, on which a sheet of Whatman paper should be pulled.  In its lower part we place a silhouette and paint it with ink.  Why ink, and not a marker?  Ink does not leave streaks, but ugly strips remain from the marker, and it can also deform the surface of the sheet if you press the felt-tip pen too hard.  Now you need to cut hearts from colored paper in pastel colors.  Make blanks of different sizes, and fold them in half.  Now hearts need to be glued with one side to the panel.  We begin to attach the blanks to the upper left corner, and move down diagonally.  It remains to draw thin black lines that will visually connect the application and the drawing. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Ballerinas </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY panel" class="if uuid-2345321" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2345321.jpg"></div><p>  Is your daughter keen on ballet?  Then she will definitely appreciate your do-it-yourself work.  The panel on the wall will depict two dancing ballerinas.  These will be ink drawings, supplemented with small cuts of tulle.  Where to start making crafts?  You need to find a stretcher of a suitable size and pull a piece of paper on it.  Now you need to apply the image to the sheet.  If you draw two ballerinas, be sure to make figures of different sizes.  Now paint the contours with black ink.  If the layout is unsuccessful, then it is not necessary to start work again.  You can simply draw some interesting decorative element in the empty space of the sheet, or make an inscription.  Cut two rectangles from tulle and sew them on one side with the needle seam forward.  Assemble and attach the skirt as shown in the picture above.  Bright panels that can be inserted into the hands of ballerinas, as well as plastic flowers and bows, will help to complement the panel.  They can decorate the girl's hairstyle and her skirt. </p><h2>  Peonies </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY panel" class="if uuid-2345323" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2345323.jpg"></div><p>  A beautiful mural on the wall with your own hands can be made of fabric, nails, thread and boards.  First you need to build a base.  Knock down two boards together.  Now draw a vase outline on them.  In its upper part flowers will be located.  How to make peonies with your own hands?  A panel of fabric will be made as follows.  You draw a petal pattern, and then transfer it to the material.  For this purpose, you should choose something subtle, but at the same time holding a shape.  Ideal for nylon.  If you don‚Äôt have the necessary material, you can starch the one that is.  Cut the petals, and then use the hot gun to collect them into buds.  Remember that the flowers must be different.  Some do more, others do less.  Sticks of flowers can be made from wooden skewers wrapped in cloth.  Leaves can be made from thick cotton.  Take the small nails and drive them into the boards so that they form the silhouette of a vase or can.  Glue the flowers to the base, and then wind the threads on the nails. </p><h2>  A pineapple </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself mural" class="if uuid-2345324" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2345324.jpg"></div><p>  An interesting panel of threads with your own hands can be done in a matter of hours.  All you need to make this craft is the base, nails and threads.  As a substrate, it is desirable to use a dense piece of wood.

Be sure to make a jumper between the leaves and the fruit itself.  Now you need to take the Iris threads and wrap them in a chaotic manner so that a dense net forms.  First, create the bottom of the pineapple, and then, by analogy, the top. </p><h2>  Honeycombs </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY panel" class="if uuid-2345329" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2345329.jpg"></div><p>  How to make a panel of fabric or paper in the form of hexagons fashionable this season?
