What is the weather there?  Has it become more comfortable?  We will talk about this in our article. </p><h2>  Weather in September </h2><p>  Unfortunately, one cannot say that the temperature in Dubai will drop sharply in September.  It will still be hot in this resort.  Tourists who come to Dubai are waiting for unbearable stuffiness.  Despite the fact that the climate is arid, in September in Dubai, relative humidity literally rolls over.  On average, it reaches seventy percent.  However, during the day this indicator fluctuates significantly.  By noon, when all the tourists are shrouded by the rays of the scorching sun, the level of relative humidity will drop to a minimum.  With twilight the situation changes dramatically - the level will increase to 90%. </p>

    <p>  Tourists who came to rest in Dubai in September, get off the plane and get into a real steam room.  Such changes should be paid attention to those who have problems with the heart, blood vessels, and respiratory system.  Also, such differences will be extremely bad for those who suffer from weather dependence.  The average temperature in this resort is +38 degrees.  Meteorologists record this temperature in the shade, in the sun it is a couple of degrees higher. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At such a time, just strolling through the streets is difficult.  Of course, they are saved by air conditioners, which are installed not only in restaurants, cafes, but also in public transport, at stops. </p>

    <p>  By the way, in various institutions sometimes cool the air so much that warm clothes may be required. </p><p>  Going to Dubai in September, take a UV protective cream with you.  This tool must be used.  You should also drink as much clean cool water as possible.  You can not do on vacation and without a panama with wide fields.  Thus, vacationers eliminate the risk of sunstroke.  With its help, it will be possible to protect the skin from burns. </p><p>  If we talk about the weather in Dubai in September at night, then it does not really change.  In the dark, the temperature drops to +28 degrees. </p><p>  The main sign of a season change is fog.  They wrap the city in the morning in a haze.  As the end of autumn approaches, their density and frequency increase.  This nuance must be taken into account by all motorists in order to avoid accidents on the roads. </p><h2>  What to do in September? </h2><p>  What to do in Dubai in September?  Despite the fact that weather conditions are not particularly suitable for our compatriots, tours to this resort are popular and, in addition, have a lot of positive aspects.  The main advantages of a holiday in Dubai in the autumn are a small number of tourists.  Thanks to this, vacation at the resort will be measured, without any fuss. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The shores of Dubai are washed by the clear, turquoise waters of the Persian Gulf.  Water in September ranges from + 28-30 degrees, which allows tourists to splash around as much as they like.  Vacationers can visit both private and public beaches.  The latter are equipped with showers, but sun loungers and umbrellas can be rented for an additional fee. </p><p>  On private beaches, everything is different.  They usually have a comfortable, fenced area, which has lounge areas with pools, as well as restaurants and bars offering a wide range of drinks (including alcoholic), various dishes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If we talk about the popular aqua entertainment, then in Dubai there are a lot of them.  Tourists can enjoy water skiing, scuba diving, or go on an exciting journey with a banana ride. </p><p>  To make a dive, you need to have a special diver certificate.  Those who like to sunbathe should be vigilant enough.  Since the sun in the United Arab Emirates is very active, even a cream with the maximum SPF factor does not save from its action, it is advisable for tourists to come to the beach in the early morning.  That is, being there is from about seven to nine in the morning.  You can also visit the beach after lunch, from about 16:00. </p><p>  In the early days, those who came to this resort, it is best to sunbathe under a canopy.  This will be enough to protect yourself from burns. </p><h2>  Entertainment and excursions </h2><p>  It is more reasonable for tourists who have an international driving license to rent a car.  It will help to somewhat limit being under the hot sun.  In addition, renting a car will allow tourists to save a lot of time on the road, since Dubai is a huge metropolis, and the distance between tourist sites is decent. </p>

    <p>  Those who do not have rights can use the services of a taxi or bus.  True, the first option is not at all cheap. </p><p>  So, still, what do tourists who come to visit Dubai do?  Familiarity with its mysterious and amazing world should start with a visit to the tallest building (not only in the city, but in the whole world) - Burj Khalifa.  Tickets should be purchased in advance, as they may simply not be enough due to the large influx of people. </p><p>  In the evening, after 18:00 and until eleven in the evening (on weekdays - until 22:00), on a 30-acre lake of the same name, tourists can see the performance of the “Musical Fountain”.  It is illuminated by more than six thousand lanterns, as well as 25 colored spotlights. </p><p>  True shopaholics can visit the nearby Dubai Mall.  This shopping center will also be appreciated by entertainment lovers.  Dubai Mall has many different stores with branded clothing and jewelry.  The shopping center has a lot of entertainment options, namely: an ice rink (quite spacious), an aquarium (the largest in the world) and a children's town called "Kidzania".  In addition, there are countless food courts. </p><p>  If tourists are tormented by the heat, they want coolness, then we can advise you to visit one of the many water parks.  The most modern and new of all is Aquaventure.  It is located at the Atlantis.  This water park has many exciting water attractions, and next to it is a gorgeous sandy beach. </p>
