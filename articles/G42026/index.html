    <p>  The hotel has a cafe, where guests can enjoy set meals or custom-made meals. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews, today many Russians already spent their holidays in the village of Divnomorskoye.  Hotels by the sea are well-known among vacationers.  As a rule, these are new, modern, not too large buildings.  Many guests are attracted to them by the lack of fuss and noise, from which they so want to relax at least during their holidays. </p><p>  The indisputable advantage of the village travelers call the opportunity to choose a hotel in accordance with their requirements.  I am glad that in many hotels much attention is paid to young guests, for whom playgrounds and games rooms are created. </p>
