The size of this settlement is small.  However, the tourist infrastructure here is actually very well developed.  In order to make guests of the resort feel comfortable, for example, many convenient hotels have been built in Porec.  And one of the most frequently visited Russian vacationers is Plavi 3 *. </p><h2>  Hotel Location Features </h2><p>  This three-star hotel is located not in Porec itself, but in its suburbs - in the center of Zelena Laguna, on the seashore.  A tourist train runs from here to the city daily.  If desired, you can also get to Porec by boat.  The nearest airport is about 65 km from the Green Lagoon center.  Therefore, tourists who flew to Croatia to rest by plane, have to get to the hotel for quite some time - about 1.5 hours.  Tourists who have booked rooms here, usually by taxi, arrive at the hotel from Pula Airport.  The cost of transportation is 600-900 kunas.  In terms of rubles, the trip costs about 3200-4700 p.  Of course, it's pretty expensive. </p>

    <p>  Therefore, many tourists travel from Pula to Porec by intercity bus.  Travel in this case is much cheaper.  A bus ticket costs only about 50-70 kunas (262-367 rubles).  Take public transport from the airport directly to the intercity bus station in Porec.  The distance from it to the hotel itself is 5 km.  You can overcome it by taxi.  It will also be convenient to catch a tourist train. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The center of Porec from the hotel is even less kilometers than to the bus station - 4. The beach is literally 20 meters from the hotel buildings.  The exact address of the Plavi Hotel is: Zelena laguna, 52440 Porec. </p><h2>  general description </h2><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Almost every tourist who has ever booked rooms in this hotel leaves a good review about it on the Web.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">"Oh, Hotel Plavi 3 * (Croatia, Istrian Peninsula</span></span></span> <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">),</span></span></span> <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">you are so nice, I will definitely be back here again!‚Äù</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">- So, of</span></span></span> <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">course, none of the former guests exclaims at specialized forums and websites.
