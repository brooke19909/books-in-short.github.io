    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  Festa Via Pontica 5 * is located in the town of Pomorie (Burgas region).  The location is very advantageous and convenient, since it is in Burgas that the nearest airport is located.  At 100 meters from the hotel there is a bus stop with which you can get almost anywhere.  And there are many attractions nearby.  For example, Bourgas North Beach is 12 kilometers from the hotel.  At about the same distance is the Skyscraper Project.  And quite nearby (~ 2.5 kilometers) is the Salt Museum.  At 300 meters from the hotel there is a water park.  In 15 minutes, by the way, you can drive to the old Nessebar, a UNESCO heritage site. </p><p>  The beach at Festa Via Pontica 5 * is private, which cannot but rejoice.  He is literally at arm's length.  And this is the most important thing for tourists. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Wellness Services </h2><p>  Festa Via Pontica 5 * is a truly unique hotel.  At least because in its territory there is an excellent medical center.  It is called Festa Medica.  Here you can go through the diagnosis of diseases, comprehensive rehabilitation, physiotherapy, or simply prevention. </p><p>  In the procedures, estuary mud is widely used - a valuable natural product obtained from the bottom of the Pomorie salt lake.  It is rich in substances such as potassium, calcium, chloride, magnesia, hydrogen sulfide, etc. It is also proved that it not only stimulates the metabolism, but also has anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects.  By the way, alkali is also used in the procedures. </p><p>  The medical center of the Festa Via Pontica <span>5 *</span> hotel <span>(Bulgaria)</span> treats diseases associated with the musculoskeletal system, central and peripheral nervous system and metabolism.  But this, of course, is not all.  They also deal with diseases that affect the respiratory, cardiovascular and reproductive systems, as well as the skin. </p>

    <h2>  SPA </h2><p>  It is also worth noting that the Festa Via Pontica 5 * hotel has its own beauty center.  What could be better than ending the evening with a visit to a steam bath or a warm sauna?  Probably only a deep relaxing massage. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, the list of services here is much wider.  In the SPA-salon, as well as in the medical center, real masters of their craft with the appropriate education work.  So the customers here are served perfectly. </p><p>  Especially popular here are mud masks and body wraps, galvanic, salt and hydromassage baths, aromatic peeling and antioxidant care using mavruda.  This is a Bulgarian red grape variety, which is one of the most valuable. </p><p>  Many more are enrolled in so-called tightening therapy and chocolate wraps.  But one of the most unusual procedures is a regenerating mask with silver water.  However, everyone can get acquainted with the full list of services on an individual basis - upon arrival. </p>

    <h2>  What else is there in the hotel? </h2><p>  Festa Via Pontica Health Leisure 5 * has a very developed infrastructure.  In general, every little thing has been thought out - if only the guests would feel comfortable.  There is free Wi-Fi distributed throughout the hotel, parking (5 ‚Ç¨ per day), 24-hour reception, ATM, food delivery service with drinks in the apartment, luggage storage and concierge. </p><p>  It should be noted that the hotel offers transfer services (both from / to the airport and in the area).  But if the guest has a desire to get his own car for the rest, then he will be given the choice of cars that are possible for rent.  There is a rental point here.  The hotel also has private rooms for guests with reduced mobility.  Also in the complex there is a swimming pool, a separate playground for children‚Äôs games and a mini club for the smallest. </p><p>  Finally, it is worth noting that the staff working in the hotel speaks not only Bulgarian, but also English and Russian. </p><h2>  Accommodation options </h2><p>  So, now you can talk about the apartments that the hotel has.  The fund of the complex consists of 93 rooms.  The most inexpensive are 2-seater with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã25 square meters.  m </p><p>  Inside the modern apartments, there is one huge king-size bed, cable TV, climate system, dressing room and a seating area with a table for work.  There is also a plumbing unit with a bath, shower, hairdryer, free hygiene products, toilet and bidet.  It is also worth noting that all guests are provided with bathrobes, towels and linen. </p><p>  The cost of a week stay in these apartments (with breakfast) for two people will be 75,000 rubles.  But this is the standard price.  In fact, if you take advantage of early booking and reserve a room for May / June (that is, not at the peak of the holiday season), you can save 60-70%!  And this means that the price will immediately drop to ~ 25,000 p.  With full board, by the way, the standard cost rises to a mark of 100 tons. </p>

    <h2>  Other numbers </h2><p>  Naturally, deluxe apartments in a 5-star hotel are also available.  Their area is 30 square meters.  m. There is a separate living area and bedroom.  In terms of amenities - everything is the same, only more space.  Even the price of accommodation is the same.  Suites are also available, but there are no special differences either.  Again, the main difference is the increased space.  The suites are 40 square meters.  But already for living in these rooms will have to overpay.  But not so much - about 3-4 thousand rubles a week. </p><p>  The last option is a luxury apartment.  They are called that.  And these numbers really match their name.  Above is a photograph, looking at which it is difficult to disagree that they are luxurious.  This number, rather, looks more like a separate luxury apartment.  Of the distinguishing features - marble flooring, a spacious balcony with sun loungers, heating system, carpets, zoned space and dining area. </p><p>  But the price of living in such apartments is much higher.  With breakfast - about 115,000 rubles a week for two.  But, as people living in such a room assure, the expenses are worth it.  In any case, this is a 5-star hotel, and you need to relax here in a big way. </p>
