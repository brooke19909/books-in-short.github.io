Resting in a wide valley crossed by two rivers, it is no coincidence that it is called the "gate to the Dolomites."  The natural heritage of mankind attracts connoisseurs of magnificent landscapes and lovers of unusual architecture. </p><h2>  The capital of the province of the same name </h2><p>  The charming Bolzano in Italy, the sights of which made its appearance unique, is the capital of South Tyrol (province of Bolzano).  Located in the Trentino-Alto Adige region, it has a unique identity that is of interest to tourists.  This is an Italian temperamental and German thorough city, lost in the mountains, near the border with Switzerland and Austria. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tomswallpapers.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Province of Bolzano" class="if uuid-2756309" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2756309.jpg"></div><p>  A storehouse of natural and architectural monuments, surrounded by the magnificent crests of the Dolomites, has a developed infrastructure.  The meeting place of different cultures is striking in a harmonious combination of rich history and modernity.  Acquaintance with the original Bolzano means the discovery of many features that were born where the cultures of the Mediterranean and Central Europe intersected.  Indeed, despite the fact that it is an Italian city, 25% of the population speaks German and calls it Bozen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The history of the city of Bolzano in Italy dates back to 15 BC.  In impassable swamps, the first settlements appeared in the form of military posts, founded by the tribes of the Lombards, Ostrogoths, and Franks. </p><p>  In the XII century, a small settlement departs to Bishop Trento Ulderich II, uniting several neighboring settlements into one.  After almost 150 years, Bolzano passes under the rule of the Habsburgs, turning into a major political and economic center of the county of Tyrol.  German immigrants flock here, industrial enterprises appear that contribute to the rapid development of the village. </p><p>  After the French Revolution, the city joins Bavaria, then to Italy, and later to the Austrian Empire.  In 1919, he again became part of Italy.  Soon an autonomous region of Trentino - Alto Adige is created, which is divided into 2 provinces: Trento and Bolzano. </p><h2>  Walther Square </h2><p>  Some travelers consider the main attraction of Bolzano in Italy the magnificent nature, which throws into a real aesthetic shock.  Others emphasize the amazing architecture, which is an incredible mixture of different styles.  Acquaintance with the city begins with the main square - Piazza Walther, which contains the most interesting monuments.  All the main streets lead from it to the Italian pearl. </p><div class="photo" data-original="backroadjournal.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Walther Square" class="if uuid-2756315" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2756315.jpg"></div><p>  Walther Square, named after the German poet who worked during the Middle Ages, is the place where annual fairs, folk festivals and theater performances are held.  In the middle of local attractions stands a sculpture dedicated to a talented creator. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Religious monument </h2><p>  What to see in Bolzano?  One of the most beautiful buildings in the square is the Cathedral of the Assumption of the Virgin with a pointed tower.  The building, famous for its colored dome with balustrades and gargoyles, was seriously damaged in 1944 during the bombing.  After the war, restoration work began, during which it became clear that several churches existed on the territory of the religious monument. </p><p>  The Gothic portal is decorated with sculptures, and the northern facade is decorated with the crucifixion of Christ.  The interior is mesmerized by the unreal beauty of fresco paintings by ancient masters of Italy. </p><h2>  Castle of san antonio </h2><p>  A stone's throw from the historic center is one of Bolzano's most interesting sights - an old castle erected in the 13th century.  Surrounded by vineyards, it is open to visitors all year round.  A well-preserved building stands out thanks to a high tower with numerous windows. </p><h2>  Franciscan Monastery </h2><p>  But the main treasure of the historical center is considered to be the well-preserved Franciscan monastery, hiding behind a high stone wall.  This is one of the main historical monuments not only of the city, but of the whole of Italy.  The architectural complex, made in the Baroque style, was founded in 1221. </p><h2>  Roncolo Castle </h2><p>  An unusual attraction of Bolzano (Italy) is a medieval castle erected on a steep cliff.  The spectacular location makes a lasting impression on visitors.  The powerful citadel, built for defensive purposes, once belonged to the Habsburgs who rebuilt and restored it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="ar.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Roncolo Castle" class="if uuid-2756321" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2756321.jpg"></div><h2>  Cable Car Rise </h2><p>  You can admire the amazing beauty of the administrative center of the province of the same name and see all the sights of the city of Bolzano in Italy by taking a cable car.  The landing point is located near the railway station, after which an amazing flight begins over the mountain range.  Passengers overcome almost five kilometers in 12 minutes, rising to a height of 950 meters.  From the picturesque panoramas is simply breathtaking. </p><h2>  Where to go for a walk? </h2><p>  As in other European cities, the resort has several areas.  Two of them are connected by Portikov Street, whose length is only 300 meters.  Tourists walking along it instantly fall into the atmosphere of the Middle Ages.  On the oldest street where Tyrolean merchants lived, there is no place for contemporary art. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.utrip.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Portikov Street" class="if uuid-2756325" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2756325.jpg"></div><p>  Another Day Bottai street is a real paradise for tourists.  An incredible amount of souvenir shops, fashion stores drives all shopaholics crazy, after a successful shopping in cozy restaurants serving national dishes.  Here everyone will lose track of money and time. </p><p>  But Via Della Mostra is an elite district in which only wealthy citizens can buy housing.  Walking along it will allow you to find out how the representatives of the highest caste of the city live. </p><h2>  The cultural center of the region </h2><p>  The interesting sights of Bolzano in Italy are the local museums, the exhibits of which tell about the history and culture of the region. </p><p>  The Archaeological Museum stores priceless artifacts that tell of the appearance of a small settlement that has turned into a modern city, as well as its formation during the Middle Ages.  The main exhibit of the rich collection is the mummy of the unknown, obtained by two climbers.  The primitive man discovered in the Alps was buried more than 5 thousand years ago, along with an ax and a quiver with arrows.  And local scientists recreated the life of the ancient Tyrolean. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bolzano-bozen.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Modern Art Museum" class="if uuid-2756328" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2756328.jpg"></div><p>  The Museum of Modern Art surprises with its unique architecture.  The glass building, which looks very unusual, attracts hundreds of tourists.  The institution is often used as a platform for exhibitions of authors who have achieved world fame. </p><h2>  Happy city holidays </h2><p>  Entertainments and sights of Bolzano necessarily become the object of close attention of all tourists.  The cozy town has always been the point where trade routes between Northern and Southern Europe passed.  In 1070, the first fair was held here, and the traditions of its holding are preserved to this day. </p><p>  In February, an ice music festival takes place, which is an amazing sight.  Artists playing instruments carved from ice perform on a stage created from snow panels.  This holiday combines the eternal beauty of nature and the amazing power of art. </p><p>  Tourists who visited the city in March participate in a cheese festival.  At the exhibition site, more than 90 varieties of aromatic products from all over Europe are presented. </p><p>  At the end of July, a fun event is taking place attracting hundreds of tourists.  Various musical groups come to the festival dedicated to the beginning of the strawberry harvest, and local producers showcase the best varieties of sweet berries.  Eating a giant strawberry cake is the main highlight of the colorful action. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bolzanosurroundings.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Flower festival" class="if uuid-2756330" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2756330.jpg"></div><p>  But the most memorable is the flower festival, which is held on the main square in early May.  Gardeners gathering seedlings and plants for sale come here from all around.  A wonderful aroma spreads in the air, filling the atmosphere with a festive mood.  During and after the event, all the houses of local residents are decorated with floral arrangements that enliven an already vibrant town. </p><p>  Vacationers can always be at the very center of fun events, having received a lot of pleasure from visiting city festivals and getting to know the main attractions of Bolzano in Italy. </p><h2>  Hotels: where to stay? </h2><p>  The charming town is loved by tourists from different countries, and therefore all hotels should be booked in advance.

But unfortunately, it is impossible to get to the most German city in northern Italy from Moscow, since there are no direct flights from Russia.  You can fly to Verona or Rome, and then use local lines to get to the multinational village. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="46.7340955" data-lng="11.288801499999977" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="7"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/8/0/1/5/8015.png"></div><p>  There are buses from the airport with numbers 10A and 10B, and a stop is located next to the arrival terminal. </p><p>  In addition, there is a train station that can be reached from Verona, Trento or Merano.  Trains from Austria and Germany make a stop, and on Thursdays there is a direct train to the city from the capital of our homeland, following the route Moscow - Nice. </p><p>  The city bus network is extremely developed, and you can get to Bolzano from Poland, Germany, the Czech Republic, Romania and other countries, as well as from nearby Italian cities. </p><p>  Another option to get to the tourist paradise is to rent a car.
