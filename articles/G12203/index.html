What to give preference to?  Today, among <span>keyboards,</span> electronic (or digital) piano holds a special place.  It is a modern alternative to acoustic.  In addition, the electronic piano is most adapted to our active urban lifestyle. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  An electronic digital piano is an excellent option for those who can not allocate space in the apartment for a bulky acoustic instrument.  But small size is not everything.  A digital <span>musical instrument</span> weighs quite a bit.  In addition, there are models that can be folded and stored in a niche or in a closet, freeing up space in the room.  This is especially true for owners of small apartments. </p>

    <p>  Another advantage of an electronic keyboard instrument is that it has a special headphone jack.  This will allow you to make music, without interfering with the household and neighbors to relax after a hard day. </p><p>  One of the advantages of the electronic piano is the lack of strings in its construction.  This frees the owners from the need to search (several times a year) for the wizard to configure, as well as pay for its services. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For those who have already learned to play musical compositions, the electronic piano provides another interesting opportunity.  The tool is connected to a computer on which the results of hard work can be recorded.  These music files are later listened to. </p><h2>  Kinds </h2><p>  These tools are divided into two types.  The first one is the digital piano.  The second type of such instrument is a synthesizer.  What are their main differences? <br>  A digital piano is like an acoustic piano.  It repeats the number and size, as well as the height of the keys of the classic instrument.  The digital piano has pedals, as well as a cover with a music stand.  But the most important thing is that the digital instrument has a balanced keyboard mechanics. </p><p>  The synthesizer has smaller dimensions and fewer keys.  This tool has a semi-weighted keyboard.  It is equipped with many useful features and is very compact. </p>

Of course, this should not be a synthesizer.  The electronic piano is the instrument whose capabilities are as close as possible to the classical version.  Of course, a synthesizer will become a more convenient tool for members of a musical group or lovers of arrangements.

    <p>  This part brings the digital instrument closer to the acoustic one, for which such a quantity is the standard. </p><p>  If an electronic piano is purchased for a professional or you want to save a little, then you should pay attention to a cheaper option.  It can be a 76-key digital instrument.  An electronic piano with a reduced key size is also suitable in this case.  But if the instrument is purchased for a child who takes lessons from a teacher with an acoustic model, then the children's electronic piano should have 88 full-sized keys.  Otherwise, it will be very difficult for your child to master musical lessons.  An electronic piano for a music school should be as close as possible to the parameters of an acoustic instrument. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Before making a purchase, you will need to test the keys and make sure that they are: </p><ul><li>  do not knock during the game; </li><li>  have minimal reel amplitude; </li><li>  hard pressed. </li></ul><h2>  Keyboard mechanics </h2><p>  How to choose an electronic piano for this characteristic?  The keyboard mechanics of the model you are considering should be as close as possible to a classic instrument.  What does this mean?  The keyboard should be balanced and balanced.  It requires the presence of a decrease in the stiffness of pressing, starting from the keys located in the lower case. </p>

    <p>  And here it is necessary to study the description of the model.  If her passport indicates the presence of a half-weighted keyboard and easy keystrokes, then for students of a music school such an instrument is far from the best option. </p><h2>  Housing </h2><p>  This parameter is also worth paying attention to those who do not know how to choose an electronic piano.  This is especially important if the tool is purchased for a child.  A beginner musician needs to master the correct setting of hands and landing.  And this is possible only on the piano, whose keyboard is at the same height as the acoustic instrument. </p><h2>  Polyphony and acoustics </h2><p>  In which case will the electronic piano sound fully?  Reviews of experts indicate that a good instrument should have 128-note polyphony.  It is this amount of notes that simultaneously sounds in the best digital piano.  But in addition to this, your chosen model should have a powerful speaker system from 40 to 60 watts.  This will provide the instrument with real sound. </p>

It is desirable that its level ranged from 3 to 4 samples (this concept means examples of the sound of piano sounds recorded in the memory of a digital piano).  This characteristic brings the digital instrument closer to the classic.  An electronic piano for children can be selected with one or two or with two or three samples.  Such an instrument will be in a lower price category, however, it sounds much simpler.

    <p>  Experts give these recommendations on the question of how to choose an electronic piano not by chance.  After all, the basis of a good playing on a keyboard instrument is the correct landing of a novice musician and the setting of hands, as well as the necessary sound extraction.  If you start to learn musical literacy, using a tool with a light keystroke, or located not at the level necessary for the game, then this will certainly affect the quality of the performance. </p><h2>  Price factor </h2><p>  What else is worth paying attention to when buying an electronic piano?  Prices are also an important factor in choosing any keyboard instrument.  The fact is that a good piano from any manufacturer costs a lot of money.  This is due to the fact that the basis of high-quality sounding of the instrument is modern electronic and technical solutions.  The main task of the digital piano, acquired for training, is to maximize the approximation of its characteristics to the classical counterpart.  This applies not only to the sound quality, but also to the sensations that the musician experiences during the game.  That is why prices for an electronic piano depend on the quality of all systems included in it. </p><p>  As for professional tools, their cost is quite impressive.  It is in the range from 120 to 160 thousand rubles.  Lovers and students should not buy such an instrument.  These models are suitable only for people who are well versed in playing the piano. </p><p>  The highest quality digital piano models in terms of their external characteristics and sound can be bought for 90-160 thousand rubles.  By playing them, a person gets the same sensations as when playing musical compositions on a classical acoustic instrument. </p><p>  The lower <span>price range of</span> electronic pianos is between 40 and 100 thousand rubles.  The characteristics of such an instrument satisfy only very inexperienced listeners.  The fact is that such models are very far from the classical piano.  And the more a beginner musician begins to master the game, the less listeners will be satisfied with the quality of its sound. </p><p>  You can buy an electronic piano inexpensively.  The lowest price for such an instrument is up to forty thousand rubles.  However, models purchased at this cost have a low sound quality, and their parameters are very different from the classic counterpart. </p><p>  Which digital tool to choose?  You decide.  But in any case, it is worth approaching its acquisition with all responsibility, so that after a month he will not be forgotten by his owners. </p><h2>  Manufacturer's choice </h2><p>  There is another important factor that can be decisive when buying a particular model.  This is a manufacturer of electronic piano.  When buying a tool, you should pay attention to the line of products offered by the company. </p><p>  If the range of instruments produced by her includes professional models, this will indicate the presence of technologies that provide high-quality sound for this manufacturer.  In this case, the budget digital pianos of this company are probably distinguished by good characteristics.  Their sound will be better than that produced by a manufacturer‚Äôs instrument that does not produce models for professionals.  Consider the brands of the most popular electronic pianos in more detail. </p><h2>  Beginner Electronic Piano </h2><p>  Before proceeding with the selection of a particular brand of keyboard instrument, it is worthwhile to finally determine the purpose for which it is acquired.  In this case, one should impartially evaluate the level of skill of the musician and the amount with which you are ready to part with the purchase of goods. </p><p>  For beginners, experts recommend purchasing the Casio electronic piano.  The models of this brand are relatively inexpensive, but they contain all the features that beginners need. </p>

    <p>  An excellent choice for beginners is the electronic piano Casio PX-130.  This model has 88 weighted keys.  When playing such a piano, you get the feeling that you are sitting at a classical acoustic instrument. <br>  This model from a well-known manufacturer has one interesting feature. </p><p>  The electronic piano "Casio PX-130" allows you to play in the "duet" mode.  This function is useful when a novice musician is engaged with a private teacher.  The keyboard of this model is divided into two parts having the same timbre.  This allows the student to play simultaneously with his teacher. </p><p>  A wonderful model from "Casio" is also equipped with a recording function.  After all, it can be very useful to listen to your game from the side.  The Casio PX-130 electronic piano also has a built-in <span>metronome.</span>  <span>It is</span> also important for practicing playing techniques by novice musicians.  Prices for this piano model are in the range from 22 to 25 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Yamaha has a great reputation as a musical instrument manufacturer.  There is no doubt in the quality of its goods, because it is confirmed by time.  For beginner musicians, the company offers the Yamaha P95.  It does not have a duet function, however, it has its own advantages that are associated with simulating keystrokes on regular keys.  On the upper octaves of an acoustic piano, the player makes various hand efforts.  This is due to the fact that the bass strings are much thicker than those in the upper ranges.  The Yamaha P95 electronic piano also has this feature.  This function was implemented thanks to the Graded Hammer Standard technology.  By the way, the piano of this model can be adjusted in accordance with the musician‚Äôs playing style and his preferences.  In <span>specialized stores</span> you can buy this tool for about 23 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Casio owns the Celviano AP420 model.  This electronic piano is the best option for those who love the traditional look of the instrument and appreciate the high quality sound.  In addition to the keyboard, this model is equipped with pedals, a sliding cover for keys, a holder for notes and a bench for the musician.  From the technical characteristics, three levels of sensitivity to touch can be distinguished.  This allows you to use Casio's instrument for learning to play the piano. </p><p>  Being engaged in it, the user practically does not feel the difference with a classical piano.  However, it should be borne in mind that this model is a more serious choice and significantly different in cost from those described above.  Such a piano can be easily purchased by those who already play music well.  The price of this model is within 45 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Digital Pianos for Advanced </h2><p>  The uninitiated person is unlikely to notice the enormous difference that exists between models for beginners and those designed for professional musicians.  However, experts will definitely pay attention to the higher quality of acoustics and the sensitivity of the keyboard.  One such instrument is the Yamaha P155 Electronic Piano.  The peculiarity of this instrument lies in the optimal combination of compactness and sound quality.  And all this was made possible thanks to the latest sampling technology called Pure CF Sampling.  For each of the notes of this model four sound levels are recorded, reproduced depending on how hard the musician presses the key. </p><p>  We can safely say that the Yamaha P155, despite its compactness, is quite a serious thing for performers, including those who speak in front of large auditoriums.  The price range of this model ranges from 45 to 55 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Another professional model from Yamaha is the Arius YDP181.  You can meet these electronic pianos even in the best concert halls of our planet.  For these instruments, samples recorded from a Yamaha CFIIIS grand piano are used.  Moreover, the company coped with its task on the top five with the inherent meticulousness of all Japanese.  These electronic pianos have two tracks for recording memory.  This is convenient when playing separately with the right and left hand.  Subsequently, such recordings serve as a great accompaniment to the musician himself.  The design of the model follows the shape of a classical piano.  This makes the tool not so convenient to move, but more comfortable to use and pleasing to the eye.  The cost of this model ranges from 60 to 70 thousand rubles. </p><p>  You should not treat Casio just as a good manufacturer of calculators.  In addition to a huge assortment of diverse equipment, she produces wonderful professional digital pianos.  One of the most advanced models of the company is the Casio Celviano AP-620.  By the ratio of quality and price, this tool surpasses all described above.  The piano has 250 tones, which is without a doubt a lot.  In addition, the electronic instrument is equipped with features such as a duet and auto accompaniment.  It can support transportation, records on 17 tracks and has many other equally useful functions. </p><p>  Among the frills of this model, a special coating of keys with synthetic material imitating ivory in color and tactile sensations can be distinguished.  According to experts, the tool has less pressure sensitivity compared to models from Yamaha, but for the rest of the characteristics it is on the same level with them.  Moreover, its price is most attractive to the buyer.  <span>The</span> Casio <span>Digital Piano is</span> beautiful and similar to a classic acoustic instrument.  Its value ranges from 45 to 55 thousand rubles. </p>

    <p>  The Privia PX-750BK uses an intelligent acoustic resonator.  It is the latest sound processor designed to create multi-dimensional sound.  This instrument uses a technique that compresses audio information.  And all this without reducing its quality.  As a result, the listener receives a surround live sound, which, like a wave, is pouring from the body of a digital piano.  The polyphony of the model is 128 notes.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Moreover, the acoustic resonator built into the instrument raises the sound to the highest level, creating smooth dynamics with tones having a high frequency. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Such an instrument will be an excellent choice for musicians of various levels. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It can be both unprepared beginners and professionals who appreciate an excellent level of sound and similarity to a classical piano.</font></font></p><h2>  Possible breakdowns </h2><p> ,    ,       , ,         .    ,      .    ,    .          .   : </p><ul><li>       ; </li><li>    ; </li><li>  ; </li><li>  ,    ; </li><li>   . </li></ul><p>       ,      .  ,           - . </p>
