    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The ski resort "Listvennaya" is becoming more and more popular every year as a family vacation.  According to skiers, they are satisfied with the proximity of the complex to Yekaterinburg, it is easy and short to get to the "Leafy".  This is an ideal place for beginner skiers, mostly children.  I do not like that they take money from their own transport to enter the territory.  The disadvantages include expensive food in a cafe.  Many would like to come not for a day, but since there is no housing at the complex, one has to be content with one-day ski tours. </p>
