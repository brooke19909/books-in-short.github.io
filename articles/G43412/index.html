  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What are fundamental and applied linguistics?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Currently, there are many sciences that can be called the most important for humanity.  Each of them, <span>without a doubt,</span> made a huge contribution to the development of man and his abilities, many discoveries were made that changed the life of man.  In this light, some sciences, such as, for example, linguistics, are sometimes underestimated. </p><p>  Many find it difficult to answer if they ask them why linguistics is needed, what exactly it studies, etc.  However, linguistics is primarily the science of our language, and language, without a doubt, is of paramount importance to us.  This is what helps us to communicate with other people, maintain social connections, exchange information.  Including language is of great importance for other sciences, because it helps to store and transmit information, use it for further research. </p><p>  Another name for linguistics is <span>linguistics.</span>  <span>This</span> term is more understandable to Russian people.  Currently, fundamental and applied linguistics stands out as one of the main directions of development and study. </p><p>  In universities, special attention is paid to this direction, additional directions are being created, to which fundamental and applied linguistics occupies one of the priority places in the curriculum.  Now such specialists are in great demand in many areas of the academic sciences, and they are also actively involved in high-tech <span>sectors of the economy.</span> </p><p>  In the future, experts in this field can conduct <span>research</span> on theoretical linguistics, including participating in many programs.  The tasks that fundamental and applied linguistics can solve are really vast, and not limited to any narrow circle. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In linguistics, there are also traditional trends, which, however, have also received a new development in recent times, this includes, perhaps, structural linguistics, as well as formal linguistics. </p><p>  The traditional tasks of this science include the study of the language in all its diversity, it is also called upon to find effective mechanisms for preserving the native language, as well as fixing all the changes that occur in it.  It is simply necessary both for integrity and for understanding the mechanisms that occur in human society. </p><p>  Language is of great importance for a person, because they say that when he begins to forget his native language, he loses a piece of himself, his soul, so that he can develop and live on, he must remember and honor his language. </p><p>  However, from a scientific point of view, fundamental and applied linguistics solves several other issues.  Recently, the emphasis has changed somewhat, because now knowledge of foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äãhas become demanded, therefore this science helps to develop methods that would be useful in mastering an unfamiliar language. </p><p>  Based on the achievements of this science, intelligent systems are created, as well as a variety of electronic dictionaries, which have become more popular recently.  These achievements have a serious impact, and progress requires not only technical knowledge, but also knowledge about the person and his language.  Only a combination of all these elements will help to achieve new heights and use their capabilities to their full potential.  Indeed, as many say, the <span>possibilities of man,</span> if not unlimited, are very wide. </p><p>  Linguistic technologies confidently occupy the forefront in modern society, and technology can not do without what this modern science has to offer.  Each of us daily faces her and her achievements in everyday life.  It really is. </p>
