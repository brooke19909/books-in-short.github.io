  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What can be home ventilation do-it-yourself</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  During the design of the house, special attention must be paid to the ventilation system.  It is no secret that for normal life, a person needs oxygen and the optimal air temperature for the body, depending on the time of year.  Such extreme methods, for example, as a few hours of airing the whole house in the winter, not everyone will like.  In order to solve the issue of fresh air entering the room, its heating and the outflow of carbon dioxide, it is necessary to deal closely with such a problem as the ventilation system of a private house.  There are many ways to solve this problem. </p><p>  For someone who is used to doing everything with their own hands and at minimal cost, the best way out of this situation is to do it yourself with home ventilation.  This implies a person‚Äôs organization of the natural inflow and outflow of air.  In order to solve this problem, you can plan a stove or a fireplace in the house.  They will perfectly serve as an air heater in the winter, and carbon dioxide will come out of the house through them.  To a greater extent, this system applies to wooden houses and is the cheapest.  In addition, home-made ventilation can be provided through conventional fans and hoods, which also makes it possible to significantly save.  However, both methods are ineffective and inconvenient to use. </p><p>  <span>Do-it-yourself ventilation at home</span> can be arranged in the same way as <span>installing fans</span> in the wall.  This will require some tools for installation work, as well as a fan with a pipe.  Before starting work, you need to decide on the place where the fan will be installed.  When a place is selected, a hole for the ventilation pipe is made in the wall using the punch.  It should be noted that the size of the hole to be made should be several centimeters larger than the diameter of the pipe itself.  After that, we place the fan itself in the ventilation pipe and install it in the resulting hole in the wall.  Further, for blowing cracks you will need a <span>mounting foam,</span> which will subsequently harden for about 10-12 hours.  When there are no gaps or openings around the fan, proceed with connecting the <span>ventilation system</span> to electrical power.  Now you can start decorating. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There is also another way out in solving such a problem as ventilation at home - this is an air supply unit.  The operation of this installation is to supply fresh air to the room, its heating, possibly cleaning, as well as replacing the "exhaust" air with oxygen.  DIY ventilation can be assembled from individual devices, such as: a fan, a heater, a muffler, an air humidifier, etc.  However, it is much more convenient to use an already assembled ventilation system.  It will consist of approximately the same devices, but they will be located in one housing.  It is also possible remote control of such a system or from the panel.  The most applicable system in residential and work premises.  The essence of the ventilation system is that the air vents supply oxygen to the room, distributing it.  Built-in heaters heat it, and the fans, by their nature of their work, make it possible for a "new" stream to take the place of the "old" air.  As a rule, such systems are not equipped with hoods, otherwise it would be a supply and exhaust system.  ‚ÄúExhausted‚Äù air leaves the room through open doors, windows, and ventilation systems provided in each building.  In order for air not only enriched with oxygen, but also clean air to enter the building, a filter can also be installed in such systems. </p><p>  Regardless of which choice was made: DIY ventilation at home <strong> </strong>  or a supply ventilation system - the main thing is that the house is safe and comfortable for the life and health of all its households. </p>
