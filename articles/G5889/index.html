    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  On this point, vacationers had practically no complaints.  Moreover, according to our compatriots, the food at Best Delta is organized at a very decent level.  When booking a stay, most tourists chose the half board option, which includes breakfast and dinner.  All meals are served in buffet style.  As the guests note, in the morning it was possible to eat a variety of foods and dishes.  A surprise for many was the availability of several varieties of champagne.  As for dinners, the guests were also very pleased with them.  So, in the evening you can taste various fish and meat dishes (veal, pork, lamb, rabbit, chicken), a variety of side dishes, fruits and vegetables, desserts and pastries.  In addition, depending on the theme of the evening, additional tables were set with seafood, dishes of Chinese, Mexican, Asian or Italian cuisine.  Free ice cream is also available.  But if you do not eat on an all-inclusive basis, then you will have to pay extra for drinks at dinner. </p><p>  In addition, tourists note that next to the hotel there are several shops and supermarkets where you can buy groceries.  Also in the vicinity of the "Best Delta" you will find several restaurants and pizzerias with affordable prices. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  People who are interested in tours to Mallorca, as a rule, in addition to the cultural and sightseeing programs plan to have a great time, basking on the beach and swimming in the warm sea water.  Therefore, proximity to the beach plays an important role in choosing a hotel.  What does the Best Delta 4 * considered by us offer in this regard?  The beach closest to the hotel, judging by the reviews, somewhat disappointed many tourists.  The fact is that it is rocky, without a convenient entry into the water.  There are no sunbeds here, and it‚Äôs rather tough to settle directly on the plates.  Therefore, some vacationers bought air mattresses.  The distance from the hotel to the beach is about one and a half kilometers.  Moreover, part of the path is a serpentine, which can be quite difficult to climb.  In this regard, many tourists preferred to rent a car and visit other beaches. </p>
