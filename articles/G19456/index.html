After navigating to the address of the official link, a page with fields intended for filling appears before the user.  After entering the password and login, as well as after pressing the "enter" button, the service functionality will appear before the employee.  True, this function is available only after registration directly in the banking client system. </p><h2>  Services and facilities provided </h2><p>  Sberbank Internet Banking for legal entities allows you to use absolutely all banking products necessary for successful growth, as well as for the subsequent development of the organization.

For example, one standard costs nine hundred and ninety rubles, a touch will cost two thousand, and an electronic analog with a screen of four. </li><li>  Monthly service charges in this system are six hundred and fifty rubles. </li><li>  Suspension of service in the system - six hundred and fifty.  Sberbank rates for legal entities are considered quite acceptable. </li><li>  Installation along with technical support of the service on the working computers of clients in combination with training in using the system will cost one thousand rubles. </li><li>  The provision of a service called ‚ÄúE-invoicing‚Äù is currently three hundred rubles a month. </li></ol><p>  Now we will find out why business organizations should use the service in question. </p><p>  What are the advantages of BPS-Sberbank Internet banking for legal entities? </p><div class="photo" data-original="aerossurance.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="remote service bps sberbank" class="if uuid-3132276" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3132276.jpg"></div><h2>  Reasons to use </h2><p>  The described Internet banking has a list of obvious advantages that are very relevant for modern business.  In addition to the convenience and efficiency of maintaining accounts, and at the same time document management, online activities for managers and accountants of organizations give obvious freedom of action, freeing from the need to be tied to a workplace or computer.  After the procedure of connecting to the system, you will not need to visit the bank office or stand in lines.  The interface in the online system is clear and convenient.  Thanks to BPS-Sberbank, all products and services of the bank are becoming more affordable. </p><p>  In addition, the service in question has a number of such features: </p><ol><li>  The ability to enter the office offline. </li><li>  The presence of round-the-clock access to operations, and, in addition, to the state of the current account. </li><li>  Possibility of a separate entrance for business clients. </li><li>  Providing automatic management of payroll registries. </li><li>  Availability of security and protection of data and documentation through authentication via electronic keys. </li><li>  The ability to service bank corporate cards. </li><li>  No additional hardware required. </li></ol><h2>  Possible errors of the problem and their solution </h2><p>  As it is obvious, access to the Internet client of BPS-Sberbank on the official website is not so easy to obtain, and the difficulties that appear from time to time should also be taken seriously.  Consider some points that customers often encounter. </p><p>  For example, the system can often not be allowed into the office due to an incorrect password and login.  Perhaps the problem itself is absent, so you need to make another attempt by checking the keyboard layout and input language.  If the problem still persists, then you will have to contact the bank where the account is serviced.  They come with a statement about the loss of control over your personal account in order to get the latest data for access. </p><div class="photo" data-original="itexperts.co.za" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="BPS Internet Bank Sberbank for legal entities" class="if uuid-3132273" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3132273.jpg"></div><p>  It also happens that the phone number changes to which sms with one-time passwords come to enter the account.  In this case, you also need to contact any branch of Sberbank.  As a rule, they write a statement marked ‚Äúcorrective‚Äù and introduce a new mobile phone number. </p><p>  The account holder, as well as the head or chief accountant, may change.  A corresponding application is submitted to the bank branch regarding the registration of a new user with the update of all information and access keys.  Old certificates must be replaced. </p><h2>  Token not detected </h2><p>  It also happens that a token is not defined.  This is a fairly common problem, and it can be directly related to the browser.  For example, in Mozilla Firefox may simply not support the function if an older version is installed on the user computer.  To work with the cabinet recommend a version not lower than the thirteenth.  If we are talking about Internet Explorer, then you need an option not lower than the seventh.  They also recommend that you go to the "device manager" in order to update the driver manually.  It should also be noted that any interesting answers to frequently asked questions can always be found on the website of Sberbank. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pchservices.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bps sberbank all products and services of the bank" class="if uuid-3132279" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3132279.jpg"></div><h2>  Registration in the system </h2><p>  In order to access remote services from Sberbank, you must register.  To do this, you need to come to the branch of the relevant bank.  This is one of the innovations.  Earlier registration on the Internet was allowed, but now for the purpose of security, the rules have changed.  At the office or any branch of the bank, the representative of the legal entity will be asked to fill out an application.  After that, a contract for remote servicing of BPS-Sberbank is drawn up.  Only after that a login and password will be presented, with which the organization will be able to enter your personal account.  Connection to Internet banking, as noted earlier, is paid and amounts to about one thousand rubles. </p>
