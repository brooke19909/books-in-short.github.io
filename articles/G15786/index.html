Where to stay in Berlin? </p><p>  The supply of housing in this city is huge.  In addition to ordinary hotels, guests of the capital can book hostels, small guesthouses or private apartments.  This housing can belong to a different price segment - from economy to luxury class.  In this article we will present you with a brief overview of Berlin hotels. </p><p>  In addition to the "star" of hotels, tourists are also interested in their location on the city map.  After all, I want the place of residence to be close to the sights of the capital of Germany. </p><p>  And what hotel would recommend experienced travelers for the first time arriving in Berlin?  Which hotels have the best reviews? </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="52.52000659999999" data-lng="13.404953999999975" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="9"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/0/7/4/6/10746.png"></div><h2>  The most original hotels in the city </h2><p>  Often traveling people often complain that all hotel rooms are similar to each other.  A week later, you don‚Äôt even remember how your room looked in Paris, Beijing or Montevideo. </p><p>  Do you want to keep impressions about your stay in the capital of Germany for a long time?  Here is a brief description of the most original hotels in Berlin. </p><p>  The first place by unusual is Propeller Island City Lodge.  When the artist Lars Stroschen decided to rent rooms in his house, he realized that he had many competitors in Berlin.  Therefore, he applied his skill as a painter and installer when decorating hotel rooms.  The hotel has 31 rooms, and none are like the other.  For just 115 euros (8,653 rubles) you can end up in a horror movie, a gothic novel, a brothel or in the middle of a golf course. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Hotel Nhow is located on the banks of the Spree.  The originality of the hotel is that customers can order in their room not only food and drinks, but also ... musical instruments.  Violation of silence here is not only not forbidden, but also welcome.  The price of pleasure is an average of 120 euros (9045 rubles) per room. </p><p>  And for those who like fine art, they can choose the Art Louis Kunst Hotel.  On the walls of the rooms, instead of the usual engravings and reproductions, there are paintings and huge murals by contemporary masters. </p><p>  A huge advantage of the hotel is its location - in the very center of Berlin, overlooking the Reichstag.  Under one roof, rooms of various categories are collected: from economy class (35 euros or 2634 rubles per bed) to suites (200 euros or 15 074 rubles). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.uniqhotels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotels in Berlin: reviews" class="if uuid-2924632" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2924632.jpg"></div><h2>  Boutique Hotels </h2><p>  You are not a fan of shocking and excessive originality, but still want to remember the hotel room in Berlin?  Then choose boutique hotels.  The rooms in these hotels also do not look alike.  Each of them has its own atmosphere. </p><p>  And sometimes, instead of numbers from numbers, the room has a name.  An example is the Zoo-Berlin Boutique Hotel.  It is located near the metro station of the same name.  The building was recently reconstructed, but the art deco style in which it was built at the beginning of the twentieth century was completely preserved. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Having settled in one of these chic rooms, you are as if transported to the belle-epoque.  Do not even dream to get here during the Berlin Biennale.  The hotel is fully reserved for VIP persons. </p><p>  The Radisson Blue Hotel is another example of accommodation in Berlin that will be remembered for a long time.  Despite the fact that this is a chain hotel, it is distinguished from other Radisson representative offices by a cylindrical aquarium 25 meters high.  This tank is installed over the entire height of the building.  And inside the aquarium there is an elevator with transparent walls.  You can view the underwater world of coral reefs both in the lobby and in a restaurant, cafe, on the observation deck and on any floor. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.agoda.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The best hotels of Berlin" class="if uuid-2924638" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2924638.jpg"></div><h2>  Chain Hotels </h2><p>  Many travelers, arriving in an unfamiliar city, are looking for a hotel of their favorite range.  After all, to paraphrase the famous saying, ‚ÄúHilton‚Äù and in Africa ‚ÄúHilton‚Äù.  In chain hotels the proper level of service is respected.  The client knows what amenities await him in the rooms. </p><p>  Sometimes the buildings of representative offices of the hotel chain are similar to each other, like clones.  In Berlin, there are all hotel chains.  There is also a Hilton, and Kempinski, and Sofitel, and the already mentioned Radisson. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  <span>Chain hotels</span> can be of different stardom, but mostly these are ‚Äúfives‚Äù and 4 * +.  Very good reviews tourists leave about Novotel Berlin Mitte.  This hotel is located in the heart of the city.  Alexanderplatz, Berlin's main square, can be reached at a slow pace in 10 minutes. </p><p>  Also nearby are such attractions of the capital as the GDR Museum, St. Nicholas Church, Palace Square, and the TV tower.  Hotel amenities - as elsewhere in the offices of Novotel. </p><p>  That is, there is a currency exchange, travel agency, free Internet access and other services.  Tourists in the reviews mention delicious and varied breakfasts, a sauna, a fitness room and a solarium.  The cost of a double room of the standard category in Novotel is 4933 rubles.  But breakfast is not included in the price. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.accorhotels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Novotel Berlin Mitte" class="if uuid-2924647" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2924647.jpg"></div><h2>  The best hotels of Berlin </h2><p>  The Radisson Blue, already mentioned by us, refers to several categories of hotels at once.  This is a chain hotel.  She has a status of 5 stars. </p><p>  In addition, it is located in the very center of Berlin, on Karl-Liebhnecht Strasse.  Just a few meters away is the red town hall of Lustgarten and other key sights of the German capital.  Radisson Blue, the price of a night in which starts at 7,400 rubles, is also included in the list of hotels whose staff speaks Russian. </p><p>  Speaking about the best hotels in Berlin, it is absolutely impossible to ignore the silence of Hotel am Steinplatz 5 * (10,600 rubles per room).  Despite the remoteness from the center and the high cost of accommodation, this hotel is never empty, as it is the standard of luxury in Berlin. </p><p>  A high rating of 9.6 points out of 10 for Das Stue Hotel.  The hotel occupies a stately old building on Drakesstrasse.  The room rate at this hotel starts from 14,100 rubles per night. </p><h2>  4 star hotels </h2><p>  Tourists recommend not chasing the high cost.  No less comfortable accommodation can be found in four-star hotels in Berlin.  Their cost is an order of magnitude lower than the "fives", but you will hardly notice the difference in the level of service.  The decoration of the rooms in the ‚Äúfours‚Äù of the German capital is impressive, and in some cases chic. </p><p>  The buildings have the necessary leisure infrastructure, such as a swimming pool, baths, restaurants, bars, lounges.  Doors will open the doors for you, the corridors will bring the suitcases into the room, and the maids will maintain impeccable cleanliness in the rooms. </p><p>  The Titanic 4 * has a high rating.  Tourists praise the pool, spa area and service of this hotel.  In this case, the hotel room costs 5670 rubles. </p><p>  Four-star hotels can be found both in the center of Berlin and in various parts of the capital.  Some of them belong to well-known hotel chains, such as Melia or Holiday Inn.  There are boutiques among the ‚Äúfours‚Äù.  An example of this is the Boutique i31 Berlin Mitte 4 *. </p><h2>  3 star hotels </h2><p>  These hotels are the most popular among tourists.  And it‚Äôs clear why.  In these hotels there are no "bells and whistles", such as: porters who open your doors, massive chandeliers in the lobby and other glamor. </p><p>  But the rooms have the highest level of comfort.  They have a climate control system, plasma TVs, minibars, bathrooms with cosmetic branded accessories.  At the same time, the cost of a standard room ranges from two and a half thousand to 5,200 rubles. </p><p>  In Berlin, booking hotels with a three-star status is necessary, since it is this accommodation that is in greatest demand among visitors.  Why is there such a variation in prices? </p><p>  The cost depends on the location of the hotel, its belonging to a well-known network, room category.  For example, living in Amano, which is located in the very center of Berlin, will cost you 4950 rubles.  The same, if not the best, level of service at Alecsa Hotel Am Olympiastadion will cost three thousand rubles already. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.telegraph.co.uk" data-author=": Paul Sullivan, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Berlin Hotels in the Center" class="if uuid-2924661" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2924661.jpg"></div><h2>  Apartments </h2><p>  If you want to save money in the capital of Germany, but prefer to live in good conditions, look for a hotel in the name of which would be the word Apartaments or the abbreviated Apart.  After all, it means that the hotel rooms have a small, but their own kitchenette. </p><p>  You can shop at the nearest supermarket and have a feast at home.  Given that the average bill in a cafe in Berlin is 35 euros, the ability to cook for yourself will be a tangible savings. </p><p>  Apart hotels come in a variety of statuses, from five to two stars.  They can be located both in the city center and on its outskirts.  Condominiums with their pool and park are greatly appreciated.  Also, tourists like the so-called guest houses.  These are small family hotels, consisting of a dozen rooms and a living room, which serves delicious meals.  Due to the fact that such establishments come in all sorts of different statuses, in Berlin the cost of hotel apartments ranges from 2 to 6 thousand rubles per room. </p><p>  Good reviews of the Mark Apart Hotel 3 *, which is located on Litzenburger Strasse.  Accommodation in it costs from four thousand rubles for a double standard room. </p><h2>  Two Star Hotels </h2><p>  Tourists urge not to be afraid to stay in hotels of this category.  In them you will receive the same high level of service, but for much less money. </p><p>  And the modest status of the hotel does not mean at all that it is located on the outskirts of the city, in a dull sleeping area.  There are many interesting locations in the very center of the capital. </p><p>  "Alex Hotel" is an example that can destroy all stereotypes about cheap hotels in Berlin.  In the reviews, tourists characterize it as a wonderful place in order to get acquainted with the sights of the capital of Germany.  This hotel is located in the center of the capital.  This is the Mitte district.  Alexanderplatz is a quarter-hour walk from the hotel.  The hotel is located in a green zone. </p><p>  On one side, the Friedrichshain National Park adjoins it.  A double room in Alex costs six thousand rubles, but this price already includes a rich continental breakfast, which is served in buffet style.  The rooms in the hotel are spacious, with new furniture and premium bedding.  Alex Hotel features free WiFi throughout the property. </p><p>  The staff at the 24-hour reception speaks several languages.  There is always a fresh press in the lobby; there is a vending machine with hot drinks.  At an early check-out, guests can leave their luggage in the storage room.  Reception staff will always be happy to help guests with booking tickets. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Alex hotel" class="if uuid-2924670" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2924670.jpg"></div><h2>  Budget hotels (no stars) </h2><p>  The economy-class hotel in Berlin does not at all resemble the dubious backer shelter in third world countries.  No, everything is just as respectable here as in three-star hotels. </p><p>  Hostels are often located under one roof with a real hotel - in the basement or, on the contrary, in the attic.  They consist of a common dormitorium (bedrooms for 6-8 people) and full rooms for 2-3 people.  The last rooms can even be equipped with their own bathroom. </p><p>  But most often amenities are on the floor.  What is so attractive for tourists in hostels in Berlin?  They have a common kitchen where you can cook your own food, and coffee, tea, sugar and other pleasant things are generally free there.  You should not assume that hostels are located on the outskirts of the capital. </p><p>  Some of them, such as Check In Hostel Berlin, are located in the city center.  Incidentally, this hotel offers free Wi-Fi and a washing machine. </p><p>  The shared kitchen of this hostel has a stove, microwave, several large refrigerators, a full set of dishes.  There are also very original budget hotels.  Die Fabrik - baxpax Hotel, for example, is located in a former factory, the workshops of which are converted into rooms. </p><p>  Prices for budget hotels in Berlin are very affordable.  They range from 500-800 rubles.  A bed in the general dormitory will cost even less - 400-500 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lastminute.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Overview of Berlin Hotels" class="if uuid-2924616" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2924616.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotels in the center </h2><p>  Tourists who come to see the sights of Berlin, of course, want to live nearby.  If you do not want to spend money on transport and time on the road, choose hotels with the names Mitte, Down Town, or Alexanderplatz in their names. </p><p>  But in the center of Berlin there are many more hotels.  The Mitte district, which means ‚Äúmiddle‚Äù, is literally packed with hotels, hostels and apartments of different levels of stardom. </p><p>  Here is a short list of places where all tourists can stay - from backpackers to business class travelers.  Of the five-star hotels, the West West Grand Berlin, Radisson Blu, Regent, Eurostar, De Rome-Rocco Forte have an excellent rating.  The cost of living in them varies from 10 to 19 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Much more in the center of the capital of 4 * and 4 * + hotels.  These are Park Inn, Marriott, Melia, Adina Apartment.  The price of a room in them is about 6-8 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Of the "triples" you can recommend the "Best Western", "Alexanderplatz Accommodation", "Amano".  The cost of accommodation with breakfast is 3 - 4.5 thousand rubles. </p><p>  From budget hotels, many accolades are devoted to Alex Hotel 2 *.  This hotel is located near Alexanderplatz.  But the cost of placing in it, despite its modest status, is 6 thousand rubles per room. </p><p>  Budget travelers can use hostels in central Berlin.  These are ‚ÄúBakspaks Downtown‚Äù, ONE80 ¬∞, ‚ÄúPangea People‚Äù and others.  With early booking, they can accommodate just a thousand rubles per day. </p><h2>  Hotels in Berlin with Russian-speaking staff </h2><p>  Tourists who do not speak either German or English have a hard time.  After all, you need to somehow communicate with the reception staff. </p><p>  I would also like to ask them about how to get to the sights of the city, to clarify such practical issues as travel by public transport and so on.  For such travelers the list of hotels compiled by us in which the staff speaks Russian will be useful. </p><p>  Firstly, almost all five-star hotels in Berlin have a receptionist who can explain to you.  Things are not so brilliant in hotels of a lower rank. </p><p>  Of the ‚Äúfours‚Äù, Russian is spoken in the Select Berlin The Wall, Eckers Hotel Kurf√ºrstendamm, Steinberger.  Of the three-star hotels, a language barrier will not arise at Cui Damme Apartments, Go-Apartments and Alexanderplatz Accommodation. </p><p>  You will be surprised, but in budget hotels and even hostels you can speak Russian.  After all, Berlin is the capital of the former GDR, where this language was taught at school. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Azimut hotel" class="if uuid-2924677" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2924677.jpg"></div><h2>  City hotels away from the center </h2><p>  Not all travelers need to live in the very center of the German capital.  Business people are attracted to areas of international fairs that come for shopping - shopping malls, parents with children - the famous Berlin Zoo. </p><p>  The last category of tourists can recommend Azimut Hotel 3 *.  There are two hotels with that name in Berlin.  Now we will talk about the "Azimut Hotel Kurf√ºrstendamm." </p><p>  It is located a hundred meters from the metro station of the same name.  In addition to the zoo, nearby are such attractions as the Kaiser Wilhelm Church, Des Ventes Theater and the Europa Center Shopping Center. </p><p>  The three-star hotel has rooms of various categories, from a single "standard" to "suites".  The hotel has parking and free Wi-Fi is available in all rooms. </p><p>  As for the second Azimut Hotel, it will be of interest to those travelers who have an early departure.  Indeed, the Azimut Hotel City South Berlin is located just a 15-minute drive from Sch√∂nefeld International Airport. </p><p>  The hotel provides a shuttle service to the air harbor.  But there is a direct bus to Sch√∂nefeld.  The same route, but in a different direction, will take you 40 minutes to the city center. </p><p> There are many shops in the southern part of Berlin.  Near the Azimut Hotel there are McDonald's, various cafes.  This hotel has earned popularity with tourists for its breakfasts, which are included in the price. </p><p>  This is without a doubt the most plentiful and varied morning meal in all of Berlin.  Breakfast includes hot Viennese waffles, pasta with mushrooms and many other goodies. </p><p>  For just two thousand rubles, you will be provided with a spacious room with top-quality bedding and fluffy towels.  By the way, Russian-speaking personnel work in Azimut, which is located in the southern part of the city. </p>
