It is believed that since then, painted in different colors, carved and decorated with precious stones, the eggs have become the main gift for this Christian holiday.  Such a souvenir can be made with your own hands. </p><h2>  How to make a testpiece for decoration </h2><p>  There are many techniques: braiding Easter eggs with beads, painting, decoration using papier-m√¢ch√© elements.  But for each method you will need a blank. </p><p>  You can buy a finished wooden blank in the shape of an egg or make it yourself from some other material.  So, for a quick and easy result, gypsum is well suited.  And if there are children in your house, then most likely it will not be difficult to find a suitable form for pouring.  Hard plastic packaging from chocolate eggs is perfect for making gypsum workpieces: </p><ul><li>  It is enough to dilute the powder with water in a ratio of 1: 2 to get a liquid paste. </li><li>  Pour the resulting mixture into halves and press them together.  For fixing, you can use ordinary elastic bands. </li><li>  The gypsum dries for about three hours, after which the product can be painted, braided with beads or decorated in any other way. </li><li>  Excess gypsum and other irregularities are removed with sandpaper. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="diy-is-fun.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="easter egg bead" class="if uuid-2435976" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/2435976.jpg"></div><h2>  Real Egg Harvesting </h2><p>  Another, even simpler option is to take real testicles and make molds for filling from them.  To do this, in addition to the gypsum mixture, you will need a long thick needle and syringes: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  First you need to wash the testicle and make a small hole in its upper part, and then extract the contents with a syringe and rinse the future shape well under running water. </li><li>  Then, with another syringe inside, it is necessary to pour gypsum and leave the workpiece to dry in an upright position. </li><li>  After extracting from the shell, the surface is sanded and proceed to the decor. </li></ol><h2>  Beading the Egg with Beads </h2><p>  Beads are traditionally used to decorate clothes, interior items, create various accessories and gifts, including for decorating Easter eggs.  This material allows you to create patterns and ornaments of varying degrees of complexity.  For beginners, you can recommend a very simple way of decoration: using a string of beads. </p><p>  On a thread of 4-6 additions, about 3 meters long, beads of the same diameter but different colors are strung.  The thickness of the thread is needed so that each ball "fits" tightly in place and does not move anywhere. </p><p>  It is not necessary to think through a particular pattern, it is enough to simply string the beads in any order. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="blue and white beaded pattern" class="if uuid-2435956" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/2435956.jpg"></div><h2>  How to stick a string with beads </h2><p>  It is advisable to pre-color the Easter egg blank to match the beads used.  To adjust the thread length, one end must be left free.  You will also need glue - instant or regular PVA is suitable.  To make it more convenient, you can use a glue gun, but then you will have to work very quickly until the sticky surface has hardened. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Bead braiding the egg from the bottom, scrolling it and climbing up a spiral.  The rows should fit snugly together. </p><div class="photo" data-original="redtri.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="egg beading" class="if uuid-2435951" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/2435951.jpg"></div><h2>  Hand Bead Egg </h2><p>  Another way to braid eggs with beads for beginners who do not yet know how to create complex patterns is to use weaving techniques.  This is a very simple version of weaving, which allows you to create a flat and neat canvas with various patterns: </p><ol><li>  To work, you need a diagram that you can draw on your own or use a ready-made one. </li><li>  Hand weaving - braiding an egg with beads in rows using a special thread and a long thin needle.  The blank can be used wooden - it does not slip and is quite light.  But plaster, plastic or foam plastic is also suitable. </li><li>  Before starting work, it is best to scatter beads in special containers so that it is easier to choose beads of the desired color. </li></ol><p>  The technique of braiding eggs with beads is quite simple: </p><ul><li>  You need to start with weaving a belt, the width of which is selected based on the diameter of the workpiece or as many beads are collected as indicated in the diagram. </li><li>  It is advisable to use for the upper and lower parts of the beads of smaller diameter than all the others - then the edges will bend and lie flat on the workpiece. </li><li>  Having decided on the size, we collect the first row, focusing on the pattern of the ornament. </li><li>  Then we string another bead and pass the thread through it and the previous bead of the first row, after which we again display through the hole just dialed. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="colorful easter eggs" class="if uuid-2435961" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/2435961.jpg"></div><h2>  How to fasten and continue the thread </h2><ul><li>  If the beads are large, it is advisable to pass the needle through two beads so that they lie more evenly.  Next, we pick up a bead and repeat all the steps, tightly braiding one bead to another. </li><li>  In fact, the thread moves in a circle until it reaches the end of the row.  At this stage, you need to tighten and fix all the beads. </li><li>  Turn the work over and string the next row in the same way, evenly pulling up the beads after each pass of the needle. </li><li>  When the thread ends, we fix it by passing it several times through the bead in the finished canvas, and cut it off. </li><li>  We fix the new thread in the same way, threading it several times through several beads in the last row. </li><li>  Gradually, a piece of canvas will transform and turn into a girdle.  We knit it until it completely covers the entire workpiece. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="smart bead egg" class="if uuid-2437553" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/2437553.jpg"></div><h2>  Reducing the row and fastening the belt </h2><p>  If the beads at the ends turn out to be the same, in this case their number must be reduced, without tying 2 beads on approximately every fifth row. </p><p>  In the row of diminishing, the last two loops do not knit - you need to pass a needle through them and pull the thread.  In the next row, these loops can be knitted. </p><p>  When finished, we try on the belt on the workpiece and, if everything is in order, we fix two beads on the upper edge, so as not to allow the canvas to disperse. </p><p>  You need to put it on the upper, narrower part of the testicle.  Gently pull, straighten and begin to sequentially connect the beads together, constantly pulling the thread. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="gift bead egg" class="if uuid-2437566" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/2437566.jpg"></div><h2>  Top and bottom decoration </h2><p>  At the next stage of our workshop on weaving eggs with beads, we will make the crown and bottom of the bead testicle.  To do this, we use another technique - the mesh: </p><ol><li>  We collect about 5 beads on the needle, skip two rows and knit. </li><li>  Then again we collect five beads and again we repeat everything until we go through the circle.  We pay attention to the workpiece itself and do not follow the instructions too thoroughly.  When braiding eggs with beads, it is important to adjust to the shape in time, choosing the right number of beads, evenly reducing the number.  If it turns out to be too loose, it is better to redo it immediately so as not to spoil the product. </li><li>  After fixing the thread, we bring it through the third bead and knit the next row in the same way. </li><li>  Then we make a reduction by knitting the middle loop of the cell, two beads, again the middle loop and two more beads until the circle closes. </li><li>  We pull up and start knitting rays from three beads, connect them through the middle and tighten the thread. </li></ol><p>  In the same way, we braid the eggs with beads from above, using a grid of fewer beads.  Beautiful craft for the holiday is ready! </p>
