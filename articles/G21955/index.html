  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why is tax optimization necessary for an organization?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For most organizations, the main goal is to produce as many services or goods as possible, while using legal methods, but with minimal loss of tax payments.  For small and large organizations, an effective tax system is as important as, for example, a marketing strategy, because with a well-developed tax system, significant savings are possible for the organization, which would otherwise go to the budget.  A good taxation system also ensures the overall security of the enterprise and its employees. </p><p><noindex>  <span>Organization tax optimization</span> </noindex>  - these are various techniques and capabilities that will allow the company to choose the right solution for certain nuances of firms.  With the help of proper optimization, as well as risk forecasts that await the company, complete stability in the market is possible: during optimization, minimum costs are achieved for the two largest items of business losses. </p><p>  Ideally, optimization is desirable before the arrival of the tax audit, and if possible, even before the creation of the company itself, or at least the official registration of the enterprise, because the tax system will be established immediately when creating an enterprise.  Just at this moment, optimization can bring maximum benefits: when there is not yet an established system that needs to be fixed.  Due to the fact that tax legislation in the CIS countries is not only very difficult, but also unstable, the company needs to take into account law enforcement, and possibly judicial practice. </p><p>  Optimization of taxation mainly consists of optimization at the initial level, from an assessment of possible risks, support by specialists of complex agreements on transactions, preparation of counter-objections by professionals after an audit of the enterprise by tax authorities.  A careful check of the actions of the tax authorities is also important in order to identify non-compliance with the law, as well as competent litigation if the situation is completely unfavorable. </p><p>  However, most firms begin optimization already at the stage of a stable firm.  In this case, the optimization will consist of checking tax accounting, checking contracts and documents, possibly dividing into several structural divisions.  It is also necessary to reorganize the entire contractual base and create an autonomous system of internal control over the level of taxes. </p><p>  Many entrepreneurs do not even know that their existing system is not perfect and not optimally built, as a result of which they suffer significant financial losses and also suffer negative consequences in their future activities. </p></div></article>
