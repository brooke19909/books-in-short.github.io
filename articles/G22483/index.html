Rest here leaves a lot of positive emotions and impressions.  The local nature attracts and has always attracted poets and writers, artists and musicians, as well as everyone who wants to replenish their vitality. </p><p>  This article will focus on Foros and its main attractions. </p><h2>  Foros - the southernmost village in Crimea </h2><p>  Foros is the extreme southwestern village of the Yalta City Council, located on the <span>southern coast of Crimea (South Coast).</span>  Where its name came from remains a mystery.  It is assumed that the village was so named by the Greeks who once lived on its territory.  Indeed, in Greek, the word ‚Äúforos‚Äù means ‚Äúlighthouse‚Äù, ‚Äútax‚Äù, ‚Äúduty‚Äù. </p><p>  This piece of paradise, famous for its marvelous beauty, stretched from the very coast of the Black Sea to the road "Sevastopol - Yalta."  The center of the village rises only 32 meters above sea level. </p>

    <p>  Rest in Foros always leaves a lot of positive emotions.  The village boasts a mild climate with warm winters and a long, humid, but not burning heat, summer. </p><h2>  Holidays in Foros </h2><p>  The most western resort of the <span>southern coast of Crimea</span> is located near the sea.  The path to it runs along a winding mountain road.  Overcoming it, you finally find yourself in a real magical corner! </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This village is to the liking and distinguished guests.  In the distant 1916, famous figures of that time, singer Chaliapin and writer Gorky visited Force for the whole summer!  And in memory of this meeting, a memorial plaque was erected on the building where they lived.  Moreover, later the Russian government presented the writer with a local dacha, where he created his most important novel. </p>

    <p>  The park was founded by Count Kuznetsov, and it was popularly called the ‚ÄúRussian Tea King‚Äù.  He bought a huge plot of land in order to build a picturesque park on it next to his palace.  Together with his wife, doctors advised him to settle in this place. </p><p>  Compositionally, Foros Park is divided into three parts: upper, middle and lower.  The most picturesque of them is the middle part.  It is notable for its artificial lakes, located at different levels (terraces), which communicate with each other and turn into a beautiful cascade.  The upper part of Foros Park is a mixed forest with all sorts of natural trails that wiggle steeply along the slopes. </p><h2>  Foros Park: how to get there </h2><p>  How to get to the park?  There are several ways to do this.  If traveling from Yalta, then by bus or taxi "Yalta - Foros".  From Sevastopol - by a bus going along the Sevastopol - Foros route from the bus station itself, or by the Sevastopol - Miskhor bus, Sevastopol - Yalta bus (in this case, you need to get off the highway and go down to the village). </p>

    <p>  The park is located on the territory of the sanatorium of the same name.  To get into it, you must go through the checkpoint.  You can do this for free. </p><p>  In addition to the beauties of the park itself, you can also see the Foros Church, built with the money of the same Count Kuznetsov. </p><h2>  Foros Church </h2><p>  This wonderful majestic temple is an example of traditionally Russian architecture of the century.  It is located on the very edge of the Red Cliff. </p><p>  In 1892 this church was erected.  The temple has nine different domes.  This feature gives the church solemnity and a certain pomp.  Another important feature of this temple is its orientation.  The Foros Church is turned towards the sea, and not to the east (as is customary in the construction of all Orthodox structures). </p>

    <h2>  Kuznetsov Palace </h2><p>  Count Kuznetsov chose a truly successful place for his residence!  Landscapes of <span>indescribable beauty</span> open from either side of the windows of the building. </p><p>  The interior of the palace is no less impressive: oak doors, parquet, marble fireplace - all this has survived to this day in its original form.  Impeccable style and elegant simplicity are felt throughout. </p><p>  Looking at the Kuznetsov palace, we can conclude that the architect did his best.  The building wonderfully fits into the local landscape.  Today in the count's mansion is the main building of the Foros health resort, which bears the same name with the village - "Foros". </p>
