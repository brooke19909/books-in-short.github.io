    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  Where to start talking about a credit institution such as Promsvyazbank?  Rating is the first thing that interests potential customers, and this is important, but first, a few words about the organization itself. </p><p>  So, this Russian bank is private.  Its full name is as follows: ‚ÄúPromsvyazbank Public Joint Stock Company‚Äù.  Often you can still see the abbreviation - PSB. </p><p>  According to official information, the <span>client base of the</span> bank consists of approximately 100,000 entrepreneurs and two million individuals.  It has more than 300 points of sale and about 8,500 ATMs.  Plus, there are about 200 self-service terminals.  The services of this bank are offered in 88% of the territory of the Russian Federation.  What is important - the organization has its branches in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, India, China and Cyprus.  Three years ago, an office was opened in Switzerland, and the bank also plans to begin work in China, and more precisely, in Hong Kong. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Promsvyazbank, whose rating is very high, was founded in Moscow on May 12, 1995.  Initially, the organization‚Äôs customers were telecommunications companies.  But it developed dynamically, so that soon (after 3 years) the bank took its place among the hundreds of the best-sized assets.  And in 2005, he climbed to 15th place.  Starting from that moment, Promsvyazbank, whose rating has grown significantly over the 10 years of the existence of a financial institution, began to develop even more actively.  He began to turn into a "universal" organization.  Already in 2007, he had his points of sale in 100 settlements of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  The bank became so popular that in 2005, in September, a Slovenian organization called Nova Ljubljanska Banka acquired its share in the amount of 7.69%.  True, a year later the owner bought this part back.  And after some time 15.32% has already been sold to Commerzbank.  And in 2007 PSB ceased to be a closed joint-stock company, changing its status to OJSC. </p><p>  But the most interesting thing is that at the height of the crisis of 2009, he entered the TOP-rating of banks.  Promsvyazbank has become one of the most reliable in all of Russia.  He took the fourth place in this TOP. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Assets </h2><p>  In many ways, how good a bank is is determined by the size and volume of its resources.  Which, in fact, are assets.  Take, for example, a bank called Elbin.  It is unlikely that many have heard of him.  Which is not surprising, because it is at 549th, the last place in the Russian rating of banks!  And its assets (those same resources) make up only 830,750 thousand rubles.  Not very much, if you recall that the equity capital of Sberbank, which is known to absolutely every person, is 3.2 trillion.  And even more assets - 27.3 trillion!  The figure is quite difficult to perceive.  But it‚Äôs enough to say that this is 27.3 times a thousand billion.  Impressive?  Move on. </p><p>  Promsvyazbank can also boast of solid assets, the ranking of which is on the 9th line (according to data for November of this year, 2016).  Its assets are 1.2 trillion.  Equity - 123.44 billion.  And these numbers simply cannot but impress.  And the fact that most of these funds consists of the investments and investments of the organization‚Äôs clients is the best proof of its reliability. </p><h2>  news </h2><p>  Not surprisingly, Promsvyazbank's reliability rating is high.  Literally everything indicates that he is good.  Take, for example, the recent news that appeared in early December 2016.  It became known that Promsvyazbank became one of the three leading financial organizations in the premium services segment.  The results were announced by Frank Research Group.  It is a leading research company in the field of financial services analysis. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It is worth knowing that the assessment of the level of service and the quality of <span>remote banking services,</span> various privileges, investment offers and other criteria were taken into account.  The head of the affluent customer service department assured that Promsvyazbank pays special attention to the premium segment and the development of the business area.  And since people value personal service, although they use remote channels, the organization decided to open new zones for them.  In 2017, it is planned to create them in other Russian cities, and not only in Moscow and Moscow Region. </p>

    <h2>  Interesting to know </h2><p>  Talking about the reliability rating of Promsvyazbank, I would like to say that not so long ago this organization became a laureate of a prize called SPEAR'S Russia Wealth Management Awards.  And this is an important fact.  Since this award, the ceremony of which is held annually, is awarded to the best representatives of private banking services, whose activities are associated with the management of large capital. </p><p>  This award is a true recognition of the effectiveness and success of the organization.  And confirmation of their high level of professionalism. </p><h2>  Interest rates </h2><p>  No wonder a company like Promsvyazbank, the Central Bank rating puts it in the top ten.  This organization cares not only about wealthy clients, but also about all the people who turn to it for services.  Recently, for example, Promsvyazbank decided to reduce interest rates on loans.  For small business they are now equal to 9.4%, and for medium - 8.3%.  For comparison, one of the most profitable offers of Sberbank is ‚ÄúBusiness Invest‚Äù, and annual rates for it range from 11.8%.  Looking at the difference, it becomes clear: Promsvyazbank‚Äôs senior vice president was right in saying that their company offers the best financial market conditions for entrepreneurs. </p>

    <h2>  Work with individuals </h2><p>  Many people are interested in: how good is Promsvyazbank in terms of the services provided to ordinary citizens?  Still, not everyone in our country is a wealthy person or business owner.  Well, this organization has succeeded in working with individuals. </p><p>  As an example, you can consider a service such as "Solid Interest."  It is beneficial for people who want to invest somewhere their money and increase income.  An account is opened for a person on which he puts a certain amount for a given time period.  The rate is 8.25% per annum.  Another 0.25% may be added if the person owns the Orange Premium Club or Your PSB Premium service program. </p><p>  Suppose a client decided to open a ‚ÄúSolid Interest‚Äù deposit by depositing a million rubles in the account.  At the end of the term (1 year), he will receive these funds back, plus a profit of ~ 83 000 r.  And if you invest more?  Then you get quite a good passive income. </p>

    <h2>  Mortgage </h2><p>  Promsvyazbank's credit rating is an interesting topic, so it‚Äôs worth going deeper into it.  Nowadays, the most popular type of loan is a mortgage.  And many draw it up at Promsvyazbank.  Why?  But because the organization offers favorable conditions. </p><p>  You can buy an apartment in a new building, taking a mortgage at 10.9%, and even with state support.  What are the benefits?  Firstly, the declared rate is valid for the entire loan term, but if people use the services of building partners.  Secondly, the down payment is only 20%.  That is, if a person wants to buy a one-room apartment for 2,000,000 rubles, then he will have to pay initially only 400,000 rubles.  Thirdly, the bank does not take any additional fees for processing a loan and offers early repayment without fines and restrictions. </p><p>  And the most important advantage is the transparent and few requirements for the client.  Citizenship must be Russian, age - from 21 years to 65 years on the date of return.  A residence permit or a permanent place of employment is also in the Russian Federation.  Work experience - at least a year.  And in the last place - 4 months.  It is acceptable to involve a co-borrower, but it can only be a legitimate partner (husband / wife).  And if a man takes a loan, then he should not be subject to appeal.  That's all.  The conditions are as simple as possible - this is the main reason why many people apply for a mortgage at Promsvyazbank. </p>

    <h2>  In the end </h2><p>  And as another proof of the reliability of Promsvyazbank, I would like to say that this summer the Internet bank of this organization was recognized as the best in all of Russia.  Research was conducted by a magazine called Global Business Outlook.  This business publication annually organizes award ceremonies in various categories of economic business activities.  And PSB Internet Banking was recognized as the most reliable and the best.  After all, every fourth client of the organization uses it. </p><p>  By the way, in the middle of spring of this year, PSB introduced a new Internet bank to people.  Not only the design has undergone changes, but also the content.  Useful functions were added, and the most popular operations that customers use most often became available in just one click. </p><p>  In general, as you can see, there is plenty of evidence for the reliability of PSB.  The most obvious is the size of the assets and the place in the rating of the Central Bank.  Already in what, and in these facts there is no doubt. </p>
