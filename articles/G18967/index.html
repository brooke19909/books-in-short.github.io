    <p>  In the <span>Smolensk region</span> , 392 kilometers from Moscow, the city of Roslavl is located, with a population of about 51 thousand people. </p><p>  Its main feature is a rich history that began back in the 12th century.  The first mention of the city is connected with the personality of <span>Rostislav Mstislavich</span> - it was he who founded the Rostislavl fortress on the conquered lands back in 1137, which later became the city of Roslavl. </p><p>  At the beginning of the XIII century, this place became the residence of the prince and his retinue, it was from Roslavl that the Smolensk principality was governed. </p><p>  For several centuries Roslavl passed from hand to hand, experienced many wars, civil strife, attacks of foreign invaders, only with the advent of Soviet power did the city begin to exist peacefully and develop before the war.  Roslavl was by then a major transport hub, and so the Nazis stubbornly tried to break into the city, and they succeeded: for 784 days, Roslavl was in the occupation of the enemy, after which there was a triumphant liberation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now Roslavl is included in the list of historical cities of Russia, succeeds in economic terms (developed chemical, heavy, food, light industry), is a major traffic intersection. </p><h2>  Architectural attractions of Roslavl </h2>

    <p>  From 1833 to 1845, the church of the Kazan Icon of the Mother of God was built in Roslavl.  The initiative belonged to a local resident merchant A.F. Mukinin, who wanted to build a stone cathedral instead of a wooden one.  At one time, the church burned, was desolate, but now it is completely restored and is actively functioning.  Address: st.  Red Army, 104. </p><p>  Transfiguration Monastery - one of the main attractions of the city of Roslavl, located on the street.  Proletarskaya, 52. It consists of two parts: the Cathedral of the Transfiguration of Our Savior, built in 1811-1819, and the church of Alexander Nevsky (construction in 1857-1872).  In addition, the monastery was surrounded by a unique fence, with towers and gates, but only fragments have survived to this day.  At the moment, the religious organization operates, and the buildings are being restored. </p><h2>  Interesting monuments </h2>

    <p>  It is historically established where the city came from, and this place is considered a landmark of Roslavl - the ancient settlement "Burtseva Gora".  It still has earthen ramparts organized for protection, and a monument has been erected where the Rostislav Mstislavovich fortress was located.  On a mountain area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 5,000 square meters, scientists have discovered many finds dating from the XII-XIV centuries, which shed light on the history of the city.  The mountain is located between the streets of St. Prince Rostislav and Krasnoarmeyskaya. </p><p>  The Ring Park at the intersection of Proletarskaya and Bolshaya Smolenskaya Streets got its name due to the fact that it is located inside the traffic circle, the green zone alternates with monuments dedicated to the events of the Great Patriotic War, the townspeople love to walk here on warm summer evenings. </p><h2>  Where to spend interesting time in Roslavl? </h2><p>  The Museum of History and Art is a landmark of Roslavl, the address and reviews of which can be found on the official website of the organization.
