    <h2>  Nudist movement </h2><p>  The social movement, preaching nudity as a means of maximum rapprochement with nature, originated in Germany at the beginning of the 20th century and received the name "nudism", from the Latin nudus - naked.  Followers of nudism around the world hundreds of thousands, nudists are united in clubs of interest, they have special places for recreation, beaches and <span>sports grounds.</span>  Nudism has nothing to do with exhibitionism, if among the nudists someone begins to show sexual interest in others, he is asked to leave. </p><p>  In the world there are a number of nudist territories, one of the most recognized and popular is the city of Cap-Dag with its infrastructure, shops, post office and a police station.  The resort town is located on the Mediterranean coast of France, so the <span>nudist beaches</span> in it are equipped to the highest level.  Staying on the beach in clothes is prohibited, at the entrance there are signs of the road type with the image of underpants crossed out with a red stripe. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Who has the right to wear clothes </h2><p>  In clothes only policemen who willingly write fines to visitors if they did not manage to undress in time.  The fines are small, symbolic, but the order is strictly observed.  You can change clothes, or rather, undress in one of the many cabins located around the perimeter of the beach. </p>

    <p>  The history of the French center of nudism, the resort town of Cap-Dag, began in 1956 with the advent of the Helios Marine camping site.  Tourists from all over France began to gather in the car parking with service.  The location of the campsite was good from the point of view of further development, and when it became clear that visitors were not averse to supporting nudus, the nat-town Cap-Dag appeared on the site of the campsite.  France is a democratic country, and over the course of several decades the city has become a center of pilgrimage for nudists from all over Europe. </p><p>  Currently, the city has more than fifty restaurants, several dozen supermarkets and four discos.  One of them - "Cleopatra" - is intended for sexual encounters of lesbians. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Cap-Dag consists of several residential areas-complexes: Port Nature, Heliopolis, HelioVillage, Port Ambonne and Port Soleil.  In the center is the Hotel Eve.  In addition, in each residential area there are villas and apartments for the seasonal stay of visitors, as they say, for every taste and budget. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There is also temporary economy housing, Port Nature has built a long five-story complex, one end of which is located on the beach, and the other is lost in the city blocks.  The building is divided into 8 sections with different levels of comfort.  Most rooms are designed for three to four people, the complex has two large pools, and shopping centers are located in the first and fifth sections.  When registering a residence card, guests are informed that in Cap-Dag hotels towels are not issued for either the bath or the beach.  This is the tradition of the resort city.  Towels must have their own, brought with them or bought at a nearby store. </p>

    <h2>  Complexes </h2><p>  Heliopolis complex is a five-story building, built in the shape of a huge horseshoe, covering several pools, tennis courts, golf courses and squares.  The open part of the horseshoe faces the beach.  Apartments in Heliopolis are designed for couples with children, as well as groups of tourists from seven people.  The complex has a special children's area with attractions, swings, a trampoline and carousels.

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Complexes of the town of Cap-Dag, reviews <strong> </strong>  of which the most favorable, unite a sandy beach with a length of 14 kilometers, of which two kilometers fall on a purely nudist zone.  It is characteristic that among nudists, such outdoor activities as towing parachutes and diving are not popular.  These two activities are excluded from the list of sports events for nudists.  But <span>beach volleyball,</span> badminton, <span>water skiing,</span> jet skis and windsurfing are in demand. </p><p>  A vast beach requires serious rescue support.  The rescue service has several hundred qualified swimmers and speed boats.  Since 1987, all the beaches of Cap Dagh have been the owners of the Blue Flag pennant, which is awarded for a high degree of environmental cleanliness. </p>
