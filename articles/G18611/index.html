The climate on the island is subtropical, so many tourists come here almost year-round. </p><p>  For locals, <span>Cyprus</span> in April is not even the beginning of the season.  For residents of the middle latitudes of our country, this weather is already the height of summer.  The weather resembles mid-June-early July.  The winds finally subside, there is practically no rain.  There are still very few people, and the days are warm and sunny. </p><p>  The temperature in Cyprus in April reaches an average of +21 <sup>0</sup> C. You can wear shorts and a T-shirt, but in the morning and evening it is still cool, therefore a light jacket is required.  This time is suitable for tourists who can do without the sea, but are eager to breathe fresh air and enjoy the spring colors of the area, which are dimming by the beach season.  But the tan received this month will last much longer than summer. </p>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  In Cyprus, the water is still cold in April, but the holiday season is already beginning.  And there are always many brave souls who are not stopped by the low temperature of the sea and they are happy to take sea baths.  But most tourists prefer heated pools near hotels.  You can swim fully in the sea only at the end of the month. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The sea temperature in Cyprus in April is not more than +18 degrees (Paphos, Larnaca, Limassol).  Ayia Napa is slightly warmer (+19 <sup>0</sup> C). </p><p>  There are no storms at this time, and the sea takes on a bluish-turquoise color.  The transparency of the water allows you to see the small living creatures and shells at the bottom. </p><h2>  Weather in the regions </h2><p>  The average temperature on the island at this time of year is +21 <sup>0</sup> C. As soon as the sun hides, the temperature drops to 12-14 degrees above zero. </p><p>  It is colder in the mountains and during the day the thermometer does not rise above +15 degrees. </p><p>  The average temperature in the popular resorts of Cyprus in April: </p><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if" style="width: 562px; height: 304px;"><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Resort </p></td><td colspan="2" valign="top"><p>  Temperature, in degrees Celsius, above zero </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"></td><td valign="top"><p>  Night </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  Day </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Larnaca </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  14 </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  22 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Pathos </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  thirteen </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  21 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Nicosia </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  12 </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  21 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Famagusta </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  14 </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  22 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Protaras </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  14 </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  22 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Ayia Napa </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  14 </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  22 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Cacopetria </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  fifteen </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  20 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Limassol </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  12 </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  20 </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  In the third decade of the month, the temperature in all regions rises significantly. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather in cyprus in april" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2101092.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Rain and dust storms </h2><p>  Nevertheless, the weather in Cyprus in April is comfortable, and even if the clouds are heavy, this does not mean that an umbrella is required.  In the region no more than 10% of rainy days of the total number of days per year. </p><p>  The only thing that can upset a tourist is a <span>dust storm.</span>  Such a weather phenomenon brings wind from the African continent, and most often it happens in April.  But, fortunately, this happens very rarely, and not even every year. </p>

    <h2>  Larnaca </h2><p>  If the hotel is not located in this city, then you should definitely go to Larnaca.  On the territory of the settlement is the <span>church of St. Lazarus.</span>  Indeed, it is built in honor of St. Lazarus, who resurrected Christ.  At the burial place of the relics of Lazarus, a church was erected where the iconostasis of the 17th century and the miraculous icon, the relics of the saint himself, were preserved.  The building dates from the 9th-10th centuries. </p><p>  Weather in Cyprus in April allows you to easily go to the village of Lefkara.  Here, back in the XVth century, women wove lace.  All products are very thin and resemble a web, have the most intricate designs.  The village sells magnificent Cypriot jam and silver, soap from olives. </p><p>  <span>The Stavrovuni monastery</span> with the main relic is a small part of the crucifix with a nail from the cross on which Christ was crucified.  And in order not to jostle, it is in April that you can feel the calm and tranquility of the room.  The monastery still has 25 hermits.  They engage in traditional crafts, prepare incense and paint icons.  But women are not allowed into the territory. </p><h2>  Limassol </h2><p>  Inveterate party-goers must visit this city, even in April.  There are so many Russian-speaking people in the city that no communication problems will arise.  There are also entertainments for children in the city, there is a zoo, an aqua park. </p><p>  In the territory of Limassol there is also the ancient city of Kourion, it is called <em>an open-air museum</em> .  And when the weather in Cyprus is still relatively cool in April, it is better to go here.  The founding date of the city is considered to be the 12th century BC, and it is located on a hill 70 meters high.  After the earthquake in the VI century, many structures went underground, but the remaining buildings are still impressive.  In addition to this, there are many graves of famous people in the city, dating back to 2000 BC. </p>

    <h2>  Celebrations and festivals in the second month of spring </h2><p>  On April 1, Cypriots do not celebrate April Fool‚Äôs Day, but the island‚Äôs national holiday.  This day marks the liberation from the English colonialists. </p><p>  If vacation in Cyprus fell on the second decade of the month, then you should definitely go to the village of Polemi.  A grandiose tulip festival is held here.  It was in April that all the valleys around the village were strewn with bright colors.  A festive dinner is organized in the central square.  Later, folklore ensembles begin their performance and everyone else dances. </p><p>  And naturally, Easter is one of the main religious holidays of all the peoples of the world.  On the night before the holiday, bonfires are burned in the squares in all the settlements that symbolize the resurrection of Christ and the burning of Judah.  In all houses, cakes and eggs are baked, lamb is prepared on skewers.  There is a festive liturgy all night.  At the end of the holiday, ceremonial fireworks are arranged in all settlements. </p>

    <h2>  Holiday Prices </h2><p>  Despite the low attendance by tourists in Cyprus in April, ‚Äúpulling a burning‚Äù ticket is quite difficult.  Accommodation prices are already higher by 20% compared to the winter season.  But, in any case, a ticket in mid-spring will be cheaper than in mid-summer in the "high" season. </p><p>  In restaurants and taverns, prices are little dependent on the season and almost always at the same level. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  In the end, I want to note that for those who want to escape from the hustle, admire the beauties of the island and not chase swimming in the sea, you should go to Cyprus in April.  Reviews of tourists are the best about spring holidays, when there are few people, everything around is blooming and pleasing to the eye.  In the region, everything is ready to receive guests, the doors of all institutions are open.  And even if you do not swim in the sea, you can return home with a great tan, good mood and save a little on the trip. </p>
