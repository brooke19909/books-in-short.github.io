    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  When choosing a hotel, potential visitors are guided by several criteria.  And one of the most important is where the hotel building is located, in which particular place.  Protaras Narcissos (Cat. A) 4 * is located two kilometers from the city center.  Only a five-minute drive away guests of this hotel from Ayia Napa.  This, I must say, is a very popular holiday destination, because it was not without reason that they gave it a second name - Cyprus Las Vegas. </p><p>  And, of course, one cannot fail to note the attention for the sake of which the overwhelming majority of tourists travel to the resorts - the sea.  The hotel is 300 meters from the coastline.  At any time you can go down to the clean sandy beach.  And if you want to see local attractions, you can visit Cape Greco National Park - it takes only 10 minutes to get to it by transport.  In general, if we talk about which hotel has the most favorable location, then Protaras Narcissos (Cat. A) 4 * will definitely be ahead of everyone.  By the way, the airport is also not so far away - just 50 kilometers from Protaras. </p><h2>  Sports and recreation </h2><p>  Of course, few of the guests stay at the hotel, having arrived at the resort.  But sometimes, especially towards the end of the vacation, there is a desire to spend time in the hotel.  In Narcissos (Cat. A) 4 * (Cyprus), you can do anything.  For example, swim in the outdoor pool, relax on the terrace, sunbathe.  Lovers of an active lifestyle have the opportunity to play tennis, billiards or darts.

    <p>  Apartments with one bedroom for two will cost a little more - at 30 thousand rubles.

So the affordable price is undoubtedly another reason why Narcissos (Cat. A) 4 * has become so popular. </p><h2>  Service and personalized service </h2><p>  Another important point.

    <p>  Guests can leave their belongings in the luggage storage room.  By the way, it has already been said that here we have a very special attitude towards visitors.  Indeed, the Narcissos Hotel (Cat. A) 4 * even offers special rooms for people with disabilities.  Family apartments are also available.  Perhaps the only thing that is not allowed here is to come with animals.  But rarely does anyone take their pets on vacation. </p><h2>  Staff </h2><p>  A few words should be said about which people work in this place.  After all, the communication aspect is very important.  Hotel workers are very friendly and never refuse to help - this is evidenced by the reviews that leave the guests.  Cleaning is carried out daily; towels and linen are regularly changed.  Workers speak English and Greek, however, as some people who have stayed at this place assure, the administrator girl speaks good Russian.  So if you have any questions, you can turn to her.  If we talk about vacationers, it should be noted that many of our compatriots come here.  Perhaps, precisely because of the large number of Russian tourists, many employees of shops and hotels learned the basics of this language.  In general, the contingent of vacationers who have chosen the Narcissos (Cat. A) 4 * hotel for their vacation is happy - small companies, couples with children, elderly pensioners, and young people are meeting.  Although young people often choose nearby Ayia Napa, where there are much more nightclubs and other similar entertainment. </p><h2>  Accommodation with children </h2><p>  If potential tourists plan to bring their children with them, then this seems possible.  Moreover, in many cases, accommodation for young tourists is completely free.  For example, if the child is not two years old.  In this case, he is even provided with a cot.  If you come with two older children, then you will need to pay 20% of the total cost for their placement.  Just keep in mind that there can be one extra bed.  And if this service is necessary, then you should discuss this in advance when booking.  After all, as has been said before, the hotel is never empty, so there may not be enough beds.  By the way, you don‚Äôt need to worry that children will be bored on vacation - the hotel has a playground for young guests, an entertainment room and, of course, babysitting services. </p><h2>  Sea vacation </h2><p>  Tourists are also concerned not only about the surroundings, bars, restaurants in the resort.  They are also interested in hotel services.  It is also important how a beach holiday in one place or another seems to be.  Turkey, for example, is famous for its coral reefs and rich underwater world.  Greece - picturesque cliffs.  And Protaras - white sandy beaches, endlessly stretching along the coast.  The sea is azure, transparent and clean, regardless of the season and the number of tourists.  Perfectly smooth bottom, warm water, gentle sun - all this attracts visitors.  So if you decide to go to Cyprus to spend a few days of carefree holidays, moving away from noisy cities and everyday worries, then this is a great option.  Moreover, the beach from the Narcissos is across the road.  By the way, there is everything you need there - sun umbrellas, sun loungers, a bar with soft drinks, etc. </p>
