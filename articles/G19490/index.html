How to prevent freezes in the future?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Each smartphone works in such a way as to perform certain processes.  Those, in turn, are created by applications and downloaded by the user if he wants to enter his favorite game, for example.  Sometimes it happens that these processes become too many, and the operating system becomes unable to process such a quantity of data.  Simply put, the phone freezes and stops processing user commands. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the Apple technique is considered reliable enough and one that does not cause inconvenience during use, there are times when iPhone 5 hangs.  What to do in such situations, and how to solve a similar problem without harm to the device, we will describe in this article. </p><h2>  When does a freeze occur? </h2>

Specialists from service centers note that this can happen at the very beginning of using phones like iPhone 5s.  "Hang ... What to do?"  - a question arises for any ordinary user.  And this leads to the desire to install more applications, to use the functions that the new product offers.  Often the owner of a new phone just downloads a lot of games with high graphics requirements and launches several at once.  While in the <span>background,</span> applications continue to load the device.  In such cases, the question again arises: "What should I do if the iPhone hangs?"  More on this later in the article.

When the user does not know what to do if the iPhone hangs, of course, the first output, which does not provide any interference with the phone, is simply waiting for the processor to return to its normal operating mode on its own after a few minutes.  It is possible that one or more applications will be closed for this. </p>

    <p>  If you need a device now, there is no time to wait, and iPhone-4c freezes what to do, you do not know at the same time - then it is worth doing the following operation.  It is necessary to hold simultaneously the central button located under the screen (it is called Home - return to the home page), as well as the device shutdown key (on the top panel on the right).  In general, this combination is intended to create screenshots of the screen, however, if you hold it longer, an automatic reboot occurs.  This is what you need when iPhone-5 freezes (you don‚Äôt know what to do). </p><h2>  It‚Äôs not a phone that hangs, but only one application </h2><p>  The methods described above reveal what to do if the iPhone hangs and does not give any signs to any commands - whether it is pressing the Home button or trying to lock the screen.  In the event that only the application that you were currently using hangs, it‚Äôs even easier to act. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  It is enough to press the return button to the home page twice to get into the directory of running applications.  The one that hangs and does not respond to commands needs to be closed, and your device will return to normal operation. </p><h2>  Nothing helps, the phone does not respond </h2><p>  Judging by the feedback from users of Apple products, in quite rare cases, but the described actions do not help.  This may indicate a more serious malfunction of the machine.  For example, if your iPhone-3 vibrates and freezes, you don‚Äôt know what to do - you should try to connect the gadget to the charger.  If the phone began to charge and reboot, it means that everything is in order - it was just that the battery had a low charge for this operation. </p><p>  If even connecting to the power of your iPhone did not help him get out of the freezing state, this means that the problem may be at the hardware level.  To solve it, you need to bring the phone to the service center, so that experts will help you. </p><h2>  How to prevent future freezes </h2><p>  In fact, preventing an iPhone from freezing is not so difficult.  Since the main reason for such freezes is either ‚Äúoverloading‚Äù the device with programs that consume too many resources (namely, RAM), or launching applications that generate errors (though this depends entirely on the developers). </p>

    <p>  It turns out that the iPhone does not hang, you need to monitor how many applications work in the background, and periodically close them when there is no need for their functioning. </p><h2>  How to speed up the system </h2><p>  If your iPhone freezes quite often, and you would like to somehow speed up its work, we recommend that you take some action with it.  So, for example, if the device of older generations (models 3, 4 of the series and earlier) hangs periodically, it‚Äôs probably all about iOS firmware.  The thing is that Apple regularly releases updates to its operating system, which consume more resources.  This is done in order to make older models work worse, which would encourage users to buy new phones.  You can solve the problem of slow operation of old devices by abandoning updates and rolling back the system to "your" version - the one that was installed on the device initially.  It will work much better, you see. </p>

    <p>  In addition to installing an earlier version of iOS, you can also try using various applications that optimize the system.  For example, these are various ‚Äúcleaners‚Äù - programs that find and delete old files, temporary data and other ‚Äúgarbage‚Äù, as your iPhone accumulates, it will work more slowly.  You can find these programs on the Appstore, many of them are offered for free.  We advise you to sort them by rating and read reviews to choose the best and more effective. </p>
