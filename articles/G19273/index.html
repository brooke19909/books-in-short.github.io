And this means that many of our compatriots will face the question: where to go to relax and which direction this time to choose?  Today, Russians, for obvious reasons, are increasingly choosing exotic tours.  The fact is that today people are interested not only in idle holidays on the seashore - a beautiful tan and bathing.  Many try to combine it with sightseeing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pattaya time" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1727815.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Recently, tours to Pattaya have been very popular.  From Moscow to this Thai resort, seven to eight hours of flight.  But such a long flight today few people stop.  After all, Pattaya is considered one of the most famous resorts in the kingdom of Thailand. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  Few people know that once upon a time there was a small fishing village.  The situation radically changed during the years of the Vietnam War, when American troops began to be deployed nearby.  Everywhere began to build hotels, bars and other entertainment venues, initially intended for the military. </p><p>  Today, most tourists associate this resort with complete freedom.  It is for such sensations that about two million vacationers fly here every year.  Our compatriots do not stand aside.  Tours to Pattaya from Moscow, Novosibirsk, etc. in the high season are literally like hot cakes.  Some Russians prefer to stay in hotels, of which there are several hundred, while others rent villas or apartments.  In Thailand, foreigners, including our compatriots, are loved, which is not surprising: they are the main and sometimes the only source of income for local residents. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Popular resort </h2><p>  Pattaya, reviews of travelers about holidays in which the vast majority are delighted, receives tourists from all over the world all year round.  There is always beautiful weather.  Even from April to November, when the rainy season begins in the rest of Thailand, the flow of tourists to Pattaya is not reduced.  Unlike other islands, the prices at this resort are very affordable.  Here tourists are offered a huge list of entertainment.  Restaurants, bars and nightclubs are open until the morning.  Time in Pattaya is very fast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hillside Resort Pattaya 3 service" class="if" height="319" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1727817.jpg" width="550"></div>  People come here not only to swim and sunbathe, but also to go scuba diving, to study the local culture and attractions, and simply in search of new adventures and sensations.

    <p>  Unfortunately, Pattaya is not as developed as, for example, Phuket.  There is no international airport.  The nearest air harbor is about forty kilometers away.  The airport operates mainly charter flights.  I must say that this is a fairly profitable way to fly for those tourists who save on everything, including airfare.  From our country, charter flights are carried out mainly from Moscow, although there are flights from Omsk, Novosibirsk and Rostov-on-Don. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Travel Tips </h2><p>  Those who are going for the first time on vacation to Thailand, in particular to the resort of Pattaya, should heed the recommendations of experienced travelers.  It should be borne in mind that in most hotels only breakfast is included in the price, and tourists should take care of lunch and dinner themselves.  Those with gastrointestinal problems should be aware that Thai food is mostly spicy because it contains hot chili peppers.  You can‚Äôt drink water from the tap, you need to buy only purified butylated water, which is in supermarkets. </p><p>  You can eat not only in the cafe, but also from the "macaques" - the so-called remote trays, which are constantly moving.  Judging by the reviews, the food in them is quite tasty and inexpensive.  It should also be remembered that in beachwear, as well as in shorts, you can not go to Buddhist temples.  Waitresses in cafes and maids in hotels decided to leave a tip in the amount of at least twenty baht. </p><p>  Thailand is in a single time zone.  Time in Pattaya and Moscow varies by three hours.  When it‚Äôs nine in the capital, it‚Äôs noon in the Thai resorts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hillside Resort Pattaya 3 Entertainment" class="if" height="409" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1727811.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Where to stay </h2><p>  There are a lot of hotels in Pattaya.  Those who come here not for the first time know that they should not be guided by their stardom.  In Asian countries, this concept is purely arbitrary.  You must first look at the photos of hotels located in the city of Pattaya, read the reviews of vacationers.  Basically, tourists opt for three-star hotels, which even in high season sell quite affordable tours.  The location of the hotel depends on what kind of vacation a vacationer has in priority.  Those who love an active nightlife should stay in the center, where there are many nightclubs and bars, and those who come with family and young children should take a closer look at the more remote options located in Jomtien or Pratumnak.  It is on the territory of the latter that Hillside Resort Pattaya 3 * is located.  Many of our compatriots have positive reviews about living in it.  Therefore, we propose to dwell on it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Hotel Description </h2><p>  For several years, along with the Germans and Poles, the Russians also began to choose exactly Hillside Resort Pattaya 3 *.

The hotel area is always clean.  This is evidenced by the reviews of those who have already visited the Hillside Resort Pattaya 3 *.  The hotel infrastructure for its category is quite developed.  It was built in 1994.  Since then, the building has been reconstructed several times.  Today it offers comfortable rooms with comfortable furniture and all the necessary attributes.

It serves gourmet <span>Thai cuisine.</span>  Fans of traditional European dinners will also not be dissatisfied with the restaurant located on the territory of Hillside Resort Pattaya 3 *.  The hotel bar offers residents drinks and snacks for every taste.  Here you can try your hand by playing billiards. </p><p>  In general, the issue of food in Pattaya is easily solved.  Literally next to each hotel there are numerous cafes where tourists can inexpensively have lunch and dinner.  In addition, such a concept as a mobile kitchen is very common here, the services of which, judging by the reviews, are often used by our compatriots.  Upon request, guests can receive a breakfast in the room. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Pattaya is a sea, sights and a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãimpressions.  That is why many choose this destination for a vacation.  All year round, beaches here are literally crowded with vacationers.  The most famous in Pattaya is Jomtien Beach.  It is the closest located to the Hillside Resort Pattaya 3 * hotel.  Jomtien Beach is considered one of the symbols of the resort. </p><p>  Before him from the hotel twenty minutes leisurely step.  You can also get to it in a tuk-tuk.  However, many of our compatriots recommend renting a bike or a car during their stay in Pattaya, so as not only to get to the beach quietly, but also to be able to explore local attractions. </p><p>  Jomtien is stretched for four kilometers.  For the convenience of vacationers, sun loungers with umbrellas are installed here.  Their cost is from forty to one hundred butts per day.  There are also cafes.  Orders are delivered directly to the tables at the sunbeds.  Prices are the same as in street similar establishments. </p><p>  In the high season, from November to April, when there are no tides on the sea, the entrance to the water is very comfortable. </p><h2>  For children </h2><p>  And although the tour operators Hillside Resort 3 * hotel is positioned as a family, for little guests there is practically nothing provided for.  The only thing you can get on request is a diet menu.  There is no playground or game room on the territory.  But, despite the lack of infrastructure for children in the hotel, many families rest here.  The fact is that the entrance to the sea here is very convenient for kids, and the presence of a park and attractions near the hotel, where you can go with young travelers, is another plus in favor of this hotel. </p><p>  Children over five years old are provided with an extra folding bed for a fee.  The cost is three hundred and fifty Thai butts per night.  Children under the indicated age can be accommodated for free in existing bedding.  There are no cots, highchairs, or a babysitting service on request. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Hillside Resort 3" class="if" height="447" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1727814.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  rules </h2><p>  In Hillside Resort Pattaya 3 * you can not settle with animals, including small ones.  Check-in is scheduled for three in the afternoon and departure for eleven in the morning.  But, like in many Thai hotels, they do not adhere to a clearly established schedule when tourists arrive.  Caring for their guests, employees of the registration desk literally in fifteen to twenty minutes draw up documents and hand in the room keys.  On-site smoking is only allowed in designated areas. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  An outdoor pool is on site.  Around him are mattresses and umbrellas.  There is also a bar.  The pool is small, surrounded by tropical trees.  It is always very clean.  During the ebb and flow season, many guests prefer to swim in the pool.  Hillside Resort Pattaya 3 *, in which there are few entertainments, is positioned by many of our tourists as a hotel designed exclusively for overnight stays.  Nevertheless, it is quite popular among Russians.  Most of our compatriots prefer not to pay "big" money for rooms in five-star luxury hotels, because during the day they mostly travel or are on the beach.  From the entertainment on site, in addition to the pool, only billiards are offered. </p><h2>  Sightseeing Tours </h2><p>  For several years now, Thailand has become a favorite destination for Russians.  Our compatriots most often choose three-star hotels, including Hillside Resort Pattaya 3 *.  Reviews about living in it are somewhat different, however, you can meet a lot of Russians here.  Along with spending time on the seashore, our compatriots prefer to travel, explore local attractions and cultural monuments.  Most of them do it on their own by renting a car or motobike. </p><p>  The list of places worth visiting is <span>the Erawan waterfall,</span> which has seven cascades, the Kwai River flowing through the tropical jungle, the ancient city of Ayutthaya, the ancient capital of the kingdom of Siam, which has amazing energy .. </p><p>  From Pattaya you can buy a one-day excursion to the capital of Thailand, Bangkok, to see the Royal Palace and the temples of the Emerald and Reclining Buddha, ride on Chao Phraya in long-tailed canoes, climb to the observation deck in the highest hotel in Southeast Asia.  The price of the tour - 1800 baht per adult and a thousand - for a child includes a two-way transfer, entrance tickets, lunch, a Russian-speaking guide, insurance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pattaya reviews" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1727813.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  Clo Keo Zoo is very popular among tourists.  On its vast open territory you can see various animals and birds.  Those who wish can visit Ramayana - a modern water park, <span>Nong Nooch</span> Garden <span>,</span> where you can take amazing photos and watch shows with trained elephants.  You can buy sightseeing tours both in the hotel itself and in the tourist offices located near Hillside Resort Pattaya 3 *.  The reviews of our compatriots indicate that although it‚Äôs cheaper on the street, the risk that you can run into scammers is quite large.  Therefore, experienced travelers are advised to purchase sightseeing tours only in proven places. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Many Russians liked the value for money offered by the Hillside Resort 3 * hotel.  Thailand, which managed to visit quite a lot of our compatriots, judging by the reviews, is a very peculiar country.  Here, for example, you can see ants both in a three-star hotel and in luxury apartments.  Many tourists, especially those traveling in a budget class, prefer to stay in inexpensive hotels in order to use the difference in room rates for entertainment and excursions.  Most Russians return to the hotel only late in the evening, therefore, it considers it inappropriate to pay for additional services.  Apparently, this is why Hillside Resort Pattaya 3 * is so popular among our compatriots.  Reviews about staying in it vary.  Some people think that this hotel is not worth visiting, others write that they really liked it. </p><p> Its main drawback is its remoteness from the beach, although in most reviews, Russians consider the location of Hillside Resort Pattaya excellent.  The calm and quiet area of ‚Äã‚ÄãPratumnak is great for relaxing with family and small children.  Somewhat annoying remoteness from the stop of tuk-tuk, however, many preferred to walk to the beach on foot or rent a motorbike to travel around the Pattaya resort. </p><p>  Reviews about nutrition also vary.  Some consider breakfast to be scarce, others say that they did not stay hungry.  Many of our compatriots liked Thai cuisine, although people suffering from gastritis and other diseases of the stomach, it is better not to try the tasteful dishes.  Locals add a lot of chili peppers to them, explaining that they take care of tourists who may get upset by unusual food. </p><p>  Regarding the work of the staff, the reviews of our compatriots are the same: this is the main "treasure" of this hotel.  The girls at the reception, always smiling secretly, will help in any matter.  The maids also work perfectly, which for the entire period of rest may never catch the eye of the guests.  The rooms are always clean, towels are changed every day.  Every day after cleaning guests received two bottles of bottled water. </p><p>  Plumbing works normally, most of our tourists did not have problems during their stay at Hillside Resort Pattaya 3 *.  And if there were any questions, then after a warning to the registry employee, they were immediately resolved.  Many of our compatriots liked the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãserving breakfast in a hotel house among mango trees.  The hotel has good soundproofing.  Each floor has free wireless internet. </p><p>  Our compatriots advise buying fruit on the street leading to the beach.  Prices here are significantly cheaper.  For example, pineapples cost twenty-five butts apiece; watermelons can be purchased at the same price. </p><p>  The beach is great.  Two years ago it was completely renovated.  Now everything is clean, cafes are working.  Many advise you to rent a car or motobike and drive around the resort on your own.  The latter can be rented for one hundred and fifty butts, leaving a deposit.  Tip: be sure to first fix the appearance of the motobike on the phone, in order to avoid trouble later.  Despite some shortcomings, most Russians have remained quite relaxed in this hotel and recommends it. </p>
