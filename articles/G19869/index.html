Mostly textile compositions are used as decoration.  The textile applique looks perfect on clothes, decorative pillows, wonderful pictures are obtained.  Since this work of art has a long history of existence, there is a lot of execution technique. </p><h2>  What fabric is worth choosing </h2><p>  Non-woven material will be the best option for embodying textile patterns on another surface.  It is easy to work with such samples, and they do not dissolve.  An ideal option would be felt, flannel, felted wool. </p><div class="photo" data-original="leafytreetopspot.blogspot.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fabric selection and preparation" class="if uuid-2363581" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2363581.jpg"></div><p>  But buying fabric specifically is not always profitable and necessary, especially if the application of fabric is not a constant hobby, but a one-time necessity.  Therefore, you can take shreds of any textile, even crumbling.  It is enough to properly prepare the material for use. </p><p>  But still there are limitations.  Adhering to them, you can simplify the process of work: </p><ul><li>  The material should not fade and leave traces of paint on other materials. </li><li>  It is better not to use faded shreds that degrade the appearance of the finished product. </li><li>  If the textile is divided or easily torn in the hands, then you can not use it for the manufacture of applications. </li><li>  Depending on the conditions of further operation, it is worth considering the characteristics of the tissues. </li></ul><p>  If you take into account all the factors regarding the choice of textiles, the work will turn out beautiful and spectacular. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Proper textile preparation </h2><p>  An application of fabric, which is not very difficult to do with your own hands, will look like a designer if you properly prepare the textiles before doing the work.  The principle of processing the material is determined by its characteristics. </p><p>  There are several stages of preparing the fabric before making the applique: </p><ol><li>  If the fabric is crumbling, then you should make sure that in the process of compiling the picture and sewing a piece of textile does not crumble.  Need to process the edges.  To do this, you can wrap a small strip of fabric from the edge and sew it, glue it.  Synthetic samples are sometimes burned over a candle.  Sometimes it is enough to starch a sample. </li><li>  So that the fabric does not change shape during the finishing process, it is necessary to wet the already cut part with warm water.  Then dry with an iron.  Ironing is done through a thin, dry cloth.  This procedure will give the part its final shape. </li><li>  Often already prepared parts are slightly starchy.  Such elements are easier to work with.  Make a paste from potato or corn starch.  Soak the part in consistency and iron it through a dry cloth.  The temperature of the iron should be kept to a minimum so that the fabric does not become brittle. </li><li>  Synthetic fabric is not starchy.  A weak gelatin solution is used.  Using a spray gun, spray parts and dry naturally. </li></ol><p>  When the fabric is prepared, you can begin the main work - creating a composition of textile elements. </p><h2>  Secrets of Technology </h2><p>  To make the applique from the fabric beautiful and accurate, you need to know some secrets.  Initially, a general sketch of the drawing is made on paper.  It is advisable already at this stage to visualize how many parts the fabric pattern will consist of.  Then a sketch-dubbing is done with the same markup of parts.  One of the specimens is cut into details on which the pattern will be made. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.mollyandmama.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="craft item formation" class="if uuid-2363586" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2363586.jpg"></div><p>  Attach paper blanks to the fabric from which the composition will be made, and circle each element with chalk.  Cut parts and attach to the base.  Those parts that will be directly attached to the base should be circled in chalk along the contour.  This determines the general position of the composition. </p><p>  Attach parts to the contour using safety pins to partially fix the position.  You can sew fabric elements to the base manually, using a sewing machine, stick with textile glue.  Overhead parts on the first layer are attached in the same way. </p><h2>  Types of textile applique techniques </h2><p>  Masters of textile applications do not define a specific classification.  The views are completely arbitrary and are determined not by the principle of creation, but by the visual type of work. </p><p>  Application can be: </p><ul><li>  Subject. </li><li>  Storyline. </li><li>  Decorative. </li></ul><p>  Regarding the color design, single-color, two-color and multi-color are distinguished. </p><p>  Especially popular are unconventional techniques for performing compositions.  They can be used not only in working with fabric, since more often this type of technique is used in working with other materials.  The fabric complicates the entire procedure with its characteristics. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="creating crafts on a sewing machine" class="if uuid-2363583" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2363583.jpg"></div><p>  Unconventional types of techniques: </p><ul><li>  Breakaway.  The composition is not obtained from all types of fabric.  It is necessary to choose a natural fabric, in which the edges will not crumble after tearing. </li><li>  Waybill.  Consists of several layers.  Each subsequent consists of smaller parts and takes up less space. </li><li>  Modular.  The whole image is made up of small elements of the same shape, but with different colors. </li><li>  Symmetric (geometric).  Each element must be symmetrical about its own midline. </li><li>  Tape.  Consists of several separate elements connected in a certain way. </li><li>  Silhouette  Preparation of complex shapes and silhouettes from the material. </li></ul><h2>  Patchwork technique </h2><p>  Recently, patchwork applique made of fabric has become especially popular.  It reminds grandmother's handicraft blanks.  Such works embody coziness and comfort.  The principle of the technique is simple. </p><p>  Multi-colored fabrics are selected, some of them should be printed with a small, but contrasting pattern.  It is important that they fit together.  A specific composition is created. </p><p>  The technique regarding the idea is determined by the creator himself - there are no restrictions on the future work.  It is important to comply with the proportions and not to do fabulous combinations regarding the contrasting design of the work. </p><h2>  Fabric applique on textile elements of home decor. </h2><p>  Compositions of textiles have become popular not only in school and kindergarten, but also in the field of fashion.  Many designers use applique in their collections.  A patchwork made of fabric on clothes can represent any picture. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.beeyoutifullife.com" data-author=": Cherie Marcel, "><img itemprop="image" alt="home appliance" class="if uuid-2363582" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2363582.jpg"></div><p>  Equally popular technique was in the decoration of home textiles.

It is worth preparing: </p><ul><li>  Cardboard sheet.  You can take white or color. </li><li>  Scissors. </li><li>  The cloth. </li><li>  PVA glue. </li><li>  Other finishing materials. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="wonderfuldiy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="simple children's compositions" class="if uuid-2363578" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2363578.jpg"></div><p>  Kroha should be invited to first perform simple applications, consisting of 2-3 elements of a simple form.  An interesting option would be an apple with a leaf on the handle.  Further, you can complicate the task by adding a worm that looks out of the apple.  Each time the picture is complicated. </p><p>  In the process, the parent will determine in what moments the child needs help.  The skills and abilities of babies depend on their age characteristics. </p><h2>  Options for children's compositions from textiles </h2><p>  Children's appliqu√©s made of fabric will be a fascinating activity for parents and crumbs.  To make a family hobby simple, interesting and exciting, it is worth following these recommendations: </p><ol><li>  Use natural cotton materials in the work.  They do not require complex preparation, they are easy to cut, practically do not shrink, they can be glued. </li><li>  It is worth choosing bright colors, additionally using decorative elements. </li><li>  Children really like to create compositions from the elements that they received as a result of the stroke of their body parts: palms, fingers, feet. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="kojo-designs.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="clothes decoration" class="if uuid-2363585" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2363585.jpg"></div><p>  The baby can independently make the application, using the help of adults only in a few moments.  The idea for creating a composition can be taken from any source: drawing on wallpaper, a picture in a book, an image from a postcard. </p><h2>  Volumetric compositions from textiles </h2><p>  To add effect to the picture, volume application from the fabric will help.  Make it very simple, but it looks much more realistic and attractive standard flat composition. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="picture with volumetric elements" class="if uuid-2363579" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2363579.jpg"></div><p>  To create the bulges will need additional material.  It can be ordinary cotton wool, synthetic winterizer, polystyrene balls.  Sometimes the remains of the fabric are used, but they have a heterogeneous structure, which will worsen the appearance of the product. </p><p>  In the process of attaching the element to the base between the surfaces one of the presented materials is laid.  The trick will be able to simplify the process - cotton, synthetic winterizer, foam should be laid at the moment when the part is practically attached to the base and a small loophole remains. </p><p>  Bulge can be obtained due to different texture, thickness and density of materials.  But in this case it will be insignificant. </p>
