    <h2>  Positioning </h2><p>  Initially, both of these modifications Zenfone 5 were positioned by the manufacturer as mid-range smartphones with excellent technical characteristics.  At the time of the release of these gadgets, such an approach was justified.  But now, after a year and a half after the start of sales, these smart phones have fallen into the niche of entry-level devices.  This is due to the start of sales of new gadgets with new generation central processors.  Accordingly, the price of these smartphones has significantly decreased. </p><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  A very, very modest configuration with this gadget as a solution to the once-average price range.  It includes such accessories and components except the smartphone itself and the built-in 2110 mAh battery: </p><ul><li>  An entry-level stereo headset with very low sound quality.  For more demanding sound quality in an external speaker system, owners are advised to immediately replace it with a better one. </li><li>  Typical interface cord for connecting to a computer and charging the battery. </li><li>  Charger with a current output of 1.35 A. </li><li>  A set of nozzles for headphones. </li><li>  A small brochure, which includes a user manual and, of course, a warranty card. </li></ul><p>  The back cover of the device is made of plastic, and in addition to purchase a high-quality case for Zenfone 5 will be useful.  This will further avoid possible damage to the case.  For the same reason, it is strongly recommended that you buy a protective film on the front panel of this unit.  Although it is protected by third-generation Gorilla Eye glass, it will also be useful.  Another important component that is not included in the package is an external flash drive.  In principle, an undemanding user will be able to work on this gadget without him, but in order to maximize his potential, you will have to additionally purchase this accessory. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  There are 8 different color options for this smartphone.  The most practical of these is the Asus Zenfone 5 Black.  In this design, fingerprints and dust on the surface of a smart phone are almost invisible.  In all other cases, you will have to clean the device much more often.  On the front panel of the device is a 5-inch display, which, as mentioned earlier, is protected by third-generation Gorilla Eye glass.  The control panel of their three buttons is displayed below it.  It is worth noting that they are not equipped with a backlight, and in the dark they will have to look for the first time by touch.  The manufacturer‚Äôs logo is located above the display.  Even higher is the front camera peephole, an event LED and a speaker.  On the right edge of the gadget are buttons for adjusting the volume of the device and its lock.  On the bottom of the smartphone there is a wired MicroUSB port and a small hole in the talking microphone.  On the upper side of the device there is a 3.5 mm speaker port and another small microphone hole, which ensures the suppression of external noise during a conversation.  The eyes of the main camera and its LED backlight are displayed on the back cover of the smartphone.  Another manufacturer‚Äôs logo and a loud speaker are also located here. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  CPU and its features </h2><p>  The Zenfone 5 phone can be built on various processor solutions: the Snapdragon 400 from Kualkom (modification A500KL) and the Atom CPU series from Intel (all other modifications of this gadget).  In the first case, it is a 4-core chipset, the computing modules of which in the maximum load mode are capable of overclocking to 1.2 GHz.  They are also built on the basis of architecture, codenamed "Cortex A7."  This is a time-tested solution that boasts a high level of reliability.  And with energy efficiency, he, too, is all right.  But performance is poor.  Of course, for most tasks this will be enough, but the most demanding toys on it will certainly not start. </p><p>  But in the second case, as noted earlier, <span>Intel Atom</span> solutions are used as a chip <span>.</span>  And we are immediately talking about three different processor modifications: Z2520, Z2560 and Z2580.  Their technical specifications are identical: 2 computing modules, which with the help of Hyper-Threading technology at the software level turn into 4 computing threads.  They are made on the basis of 32 nm technology, equipped with a 1 MB cache.  The only difference between the previously mentioned CPU models is the frequency formula.  For the Z2520, the operating frequency range is 0.3-1.2 GHz, for the Z2560 - 0.4-1.6 GHz and for the Z2580 - 0.533-2 GHz.  As a result, it can be noted that the latest CPU modification boasts the highest level of performance at a comparable level of energy consumption (it is recommended that potential buyers pay attention to it: at a higher level of performance, its price does not differ significantly with a similar organization of the memory subsystem).  Well, when choosing this model of smartphone, you need to check with the seller the model of the processor used in the gadget before buying. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Graphics adapter </h2><p>  Two models of graphic accelerators can be found in devices of this series.  In gadgets based on the Snapdragon 400 CPU, the Adreno 305 acts as a video card.  If the calculated chip from Intel is used, then the PowerVR SGX544MP2 graphic accelerator is already used.  The level of their productivity is comparable today.  To solve a wide range of everyday tasks, their hardware and software capabilities are quite enough.  But for the most demanding toys, this is not enough. </p><h2>  Touch screen </h2><p>  Zenfone 5 is equipped with a 5-inch touch screen.  Its resolution is 1280 x 720, and the matrix underlying it is made using the IPS technology.  Also, the developers did not forget about the protection of the display: almost the entire front panel of the gadget is covered with 3rd generation Gorilla Eye glass with an <span>oleophobic coating</span> applied over it <span>.</span>  To top it off, an air gap is completely absent between the touch panel and the matrix surface.  As a result, the quality of the image displayed on the display really does not cause any complaints, and the viewing angles on this device are as close as possible to 180 degrees. </p>

    <h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  A fairly high-quality main camera on the Asus Zenfone 5. It has an 8 megapixel sensor.  There is also a LED backlight system, which with an insufficient level of illumination still allows you to get high-quality images.  In addition to this, the camera implements autofocus, digital zoom and PixelMaster technologies.  As a result, the quality of the photos received on this gadget really does not cause any complaints.  This unit can record video in a resolution of 1920 x 1080. The image refresh rate will be 30 frames per second.  More modest technical parameters of the front camera.  Its sensor is based on a 2 megapixel sensor.  This is clearly not enough for a high-quality selfie, but it is enough for IP-telephony or video calls. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  A very confusing situation with the memory subsystem in Zenfone 5. An overview of the models on the market indicates the following technical parameters: </p><ul><li>  The amount of RAM can be 1 or 2 GB. </li><li>  The capacity of the built-in drive is of such sizes: 8 GB, 16 GB and 32 GB. </li><li>  All devices in this series have a slot for installing an external drive.  Its maximum capacity can be 64 GB. </li></ul><p>  The most interesting in terms of purchase looks like a device of this series with 2 GB of RAM and 32 GB of integrated drive.  In this case, you can do without even a memory card.  But its cost will be significantly higher.  Therefore, as a middle ground, you can choose a smartphone with 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of internal disk space.  This is also quite enough for comfortable work with a reasonable approach. </p>

    <h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The Zenfone 5 smartphone has a built-in 2110 mAh battery.  On the one hand, such a constructive solution allows to ensure high build quality of the device casing.  But at the same time, if the battery breaks down without a specialized center, replacing this accessory is quite difficult.  The indicated capacity of the integrated battery is enough for 1 day of average load.  If you further reduce the level of use of the device, it will turn out to stretch a maximum of 2 days.  Well, when playing or playing a video, you can count on 12 hours of battery life. </p><p>  A unique solution to the problems with autonomy of this gadget is to install an external battery.  But the battery in this smartphone is charging fast enough.  The battery capacity is 2110 mAh, the output current of the charger is 1.35 A. As a result, it turns out that it takes a little more than an hour and a half to charge.  This is a great indicator for such a 5-inch smart phone. </p><h2>  Data exchange </h2><p>  The Asus Zenfone 5 interface kit is as follows: </p><ul><li>  Full GSM and 3G support for devices with an Intel processor.  For solutions with the Snapdragon 400, LTE is also added to this list.  This is enough to exchange information with the World Wide Web, make calls and receive various messages (both multimedia and text). </li><li>  Also, the smartphone is equipped with Wi-Fi.  This is an important wireless interface with which you can download data from the Internet to an unlimited amount. </li><li>  It‚Äôs best to use bluetooth to connect a wireless headset or to exchange small amounts of data with similar smart phones.  This transmitter is also available in this model of smartphone. </li><li>  The device performs navigation functions using the GPS module. </li><li>  MicroUSB is indispensable in cases where it is necessary to synchronize the device with a PC or when charging an integrated battery. </li><li>  A 3.5-millimeter audio port allows you to output sound from a smartphone to an external speaker system. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Software </h2><p>  Initially, the 4th version of Android is preinstalled on this gadget.  But the first time you connect to the World Wide Web, Zenfone 5 firmware will automatically update to its 5th version.  Similar updates became available for download in April 2015.  Otherwise, the set of system software on this smartphone is standard.  There are typical clients for social networks (Facebook, Twitter).  Also, programmers did not forget about utilities from the search giant ("Chrome", "Jimail +", the mail client).  And finally, the presence of integrated mini-applications ("Calendar", "Contacts", "Calculator") should also be noted.  Everything else, the newly-made owner will have to be additionally installed on his new device. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  Depending on the technical parameters, the cost of Zenfone 5 changes significantly. The price of the most affordable modifications starts at $ 160.  For this money, you will get 1 GB of RAM, 8 GB of integrated disk space and a 4-module CPU from Qualkom.  But a more progressive modification of this device with 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of internal drive with a 2-core CPU from Intel costs $ 235.  Well, for the most advanced version of the gadget will have to pay even more - about 320 dollars. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  In essence, Zenfone 5 has only three significant drawbacks. Reviews highlight such disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  Small battery capacity.  This issue is solved by purchasing an additional external battery. </li><li>  Large body sizes, which are even larger than some models with a diagonal of 5.2 inches.  Alas, you have to get used to this minus. </li><li>  Low level of maximum screen brightness of 263 cd / m2.  This value will be clearly not enough for comfortable work on a bright sunny day. </li></ul><p>  But the advantages of this smartphone, users have noticed much more: </p><ul><li>  Productive processor. </li><li>  Updated and fresh software platform. </li><li>  The possibility of flexible device selection depending on the memory subsystem. </li><li>  Impeccable gadget build quality. </li></ul>
