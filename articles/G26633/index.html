The finished product is a dense material - felt. </p><p>  In wet felting, the necessary increase in the pattern of the product should be done, since the wool shrinks up to 40%. </p><p>  To obtain small voluminous objects, a ball of wool is crushed in the hands.

The wool layout is staggered: horizontally, then in the transverse direction.  It is necessary to control the thickness of the layer, in all areas it should be the same.  In addition, the shrinkage of the felt should be taken into account, increasing the initial thickness of the coat by 2‚Äì3 times. </li><li>  Moisten the decomposed wool from the spray bottle with water. </li><li>  The wetted workpiece should be covered with mesh material.  It is convenient to use a <span>mosquito net</span> for this purpose <span>.</span>  The layout is carefully moistened with soapy water through a mosquito net, avoiding the displacement of the pattern. </li><li>  Gently press the processed product with your hands to the oilcloth, achieving good impregnation of the base with soap and water, remove excess solution with a towel. </li><li>  The process of felting, namely, intensive smoothing and friction of each section.  Continue felting, carefully rubbing each section, gradually removing the mesh, turning the canvas. </li><li>  The canvas is considered ready if, when pulling it upward, the formation is completely removed without separating the strips. </li><li>  Rinse the resulting felt in cool water until the soapy foam is completely removed. </li><li>  Unfold and dry the canvas in a straightened horizontal state. </li></ul><p>  Wet felting is finished.  The product or canvas can be considered finished. </p>

    <h2>  Dry wool stall option </h2><p>  The essence of the method consists in tangling and compaction of wool fibers with special needles with notches.  Felting starts with treating the fibers with the thickest needle.  In the process of compaction of the felt fabric, the needle is replaced with a thinner one. </p><p>  Those who begin to roll the first product, you need to remember that the wool in the process changes in volume in the direction of reduction by almost three times.  Therefore, for felting, a beginner feller needs to take wool in a much larger volume. </p><p>  The difference between wet and dry felting consists in replacing the soap solution with special needles, which perform the procedure for stalling wool.  <span>Dry felting</span> from wool is not recommended for beginners: clothes and things require the use of a flat felt cloth.  Experienced craftswomen use this type of felting for the manufacture of voluminous accessories, jewelry and toys. </p><p>  Many craftswomen turned the felting into an opportunity to have in their wardrobe not only warm, cozy clothes, but also accessories for them.  In addition, for some, felting began to provide good income to the family budget. </p><h2>  Tools and accessories </h2><p>  The dry folding technique for wool fibers is unique and has its own characteristics.  For dry felting you will need special tools with which to perform the process of stalling wool fiber.  These include: </p>

Clothing, a master class of its manufacture - all this is described in detail by experienced fellers.  With their help, the manufacture of products of any complexity is available. </p><p>  Preliminary preparation is the basis of all work.  Before starting felting, you should make a sketch or pattern of the future product: </p><ul><li>  Wool, distributed according to the prepared pattern, it is often necessary to pierce a lot with a serrated needle for felting, achieving stalling and compaction of the material. </li><li>  The resulting felt fabric must be constantly rotated, achieving uniform density, repeatedly processing each section with a needle. </li><li>  In the process, you can add new pieces of wool, creating the planned composition and achieving its conformity to the pattern. </li></ul><p>  In the production of any things and toys you can combine dry and wet felting, adding trim elements such as lace, ruffles, beads, beads, braid and ribbons.  This creates additional opportunities for obtaining unique, creative items. </p>

    <h2>  Tips for beginners </h2><p>  Each product made of wool fiber has certain nuances that require additional refinement and correction.  In the process of operation, sometimes things need repair, so the craftswomen share their experience: </p><ul><li>  For products in the manufacture of which two technologies are combined, some rules should be applied: the semi-finished product must be absolutely dry.  This will avoid its deformation, rush and breaking. </li><li>  It is better to start felting with prefabricated fibers of a greater thickness: carding, combed tape.  Use fine wool to finish the product. </li><li>  A thin needle must be pierced very often, to a shallow depth.  Deep piercing will leave an ugly mark on the surface of the product, rare punctures will create tubercles on the surface of the felt. </li><li>  To replace hands in wet felting will help a <span>bamboo mat,</span> on which the blank is laid out.  The rug is twisted into a roll and rolled in different directions, achieving dense stalling of wool. </li><li>  In the arsenal of tools and accessories, towels will not be superfluous to collect excess soapy water. </li><li>  Plastic bags are required for additional protection of the work surface, as well as for use as spacers between the elements of the product.  This measure will avoid their adhesion to each other. </li></ul><p>  Felting is a very interesting, fascinating type of needlework, which is very popular today.  Unique, warm, comfortable clothes are very comfortable to wear, care for them does not require special procedures, since they practically do not get dirty.  A regular clothes brush is enough to clean it.  By washing and rinsing in cool water, more severe contaminants are easily removed. </p>
