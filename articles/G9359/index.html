  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to enable iPhone recovery mode?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The smartphone of the California brand Apple is a technological thoroughness multiplied by the absolute practicality of the device, and all this is raised to the degree of reliability.  Such a statement in favor of the aforementioned American company today is a kind of a priori in the industry of mobile devices.  But ... no matter how perfect the ‚Äúapple‚Äù phone may be, and without a kind of <span>airbag,</span> which can be considered the iPhone recovery mode, in a critical situation, the user will not be able to do by definition, since the iOS operating system is a system whose work is bound up with process - setting up the functionality.  You should learn about this option and how to use it, dear reader, from the material of the presented article. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúThe trouble came, from where they did not wait‚Äù: briefly about the causes of the problems with the iPhone </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to enable iPhone recovery mode?" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/619141.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Like any other computerized system, iOS is at risk of software failure, which may ultimately affect the partial or complete inoperability of the device as a whole.  Since the iPhone, first of all, is an individual means of communication, its functionality provides the ability to organize certain settings in accordance with the user's preferences: display brightness, font size, notification type and a number of other changes.  However, do not forget that the iPhone is a multi-functional mobile device that can interact with its owner through the installed software.  The recovery mode of the iPhone will become a popular tool in the event that the user performs an incorrect installation of an application or implements third-party software solutions (with active jailbreak), which ultimately negatively affects the full functionality of the device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  As a reference: the concepts of "upgrade" and "rollback" </h2><p>  The name "iPhone Recovery Mode" means both the implemented method of returning to the initial settings of the device, so to speak, to factory settings, and the algorithm for updating the operating environment by completely replacing system files.  In this case, the OS version can be left the same or upgraded to the current state.  The two points described above are fundamentally different.  Therefore, the user must independently decide which option is most appropriate in terms of implementation.  However, in order to determine which method is most rational, you should pay attention to the signs of a malfunction and only then use the iPhone recovery mode. </p><h2>  Analysis and Diagnostics </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="IPhone recovery mode" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/619140.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  So, first of all, you need to understand what exactly happened with the phone: </p><ol><li>  When the communication device is operating, systematic ‚Äúglitches‚Äù are observed. </li><li>  The phone ‚Äúfreezes‚Äù and does not respond at all to pressing the navigation keys. </li><li>  At the first stage of loading iOS, the logo simply ‚Äúhangs‚Äù, without obvious signs of OS activity. </li><li>  When you turn on the phone a <span>black screen</span> and nothing more ... </li><li>  The mobile device reboots spontaneously. </li><li>  The user is firmly convinced that the phone was not subjected to any mechanical influences, while the <span>touch panel</span> or one of the device‚Äôs devices stopped working: bluetooth, Wi-Fi or a camera. </li></ol><h2>  <strong>How to enable iPhone recovery mode</strong> : step-by-step instructions </h2><p>  Do not immediately resort to drastic measures, one of which is considered to be the direct process of flashing.  It is likely that an elementary ‚Äúreset‚Äù will become exactly that means of restoring the operability of the illuminated communication device.  Perhaps the activated ‚ÄúRecovery Mode‚Äù can cure a mobile ailment.  Start with simple solutions, and only when they are useless, move on to more serious iPhone reincarnation scenarios. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Step # 1: Banal reboot </h2>

The recovery action algorithm remains the same (see step 4).  However, in the DFU mode, the firmware process is most correct, since the smartphone‚Äôs memory is subjected to primary formatting and the operating system is installed in the cleaned area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe mobile drive. </p><ol><li>  Download the latest version of iOS from the official Apple Support site. </li><li>  Hold down the Shift key and click the Restore button. </li><li>  Specify the directory where the downloaded version of iOS is located. </li><li>  After a short firmware process, the user is given the opportunity to return the saved data (backup) to the updated device. </li><li>  If you do not have a backup, simply disconnect the phone from the computer and deactivate recovery mode. </li></ol>

    <p>  An iPhone 4 or Apple device of another modification cannot be flashed with a reduced version of iOS.  However, this restriction is purely official in nature, since today there are many ways in which the older (than the originally installed on the phone) system software, which, so to speak, has proved to be stable, can be installed on the iPhone without any further negative consequences.  By the way, <span>custom firmwares</span> are incredibly popular among owners of presentable Apple devices, as they can significantly expand the functionality of the "canned" features of the official version of iOS. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  So, before putting the iPhone into recovery mode, you need to be firmly confident in your actions and the correctness of the selected software repair algorithm.  Meanwhile, it may well be that the user uses the cloud version of the update - ‚ÄúiCloud‚Äù.  In this case, you need to charge the phone and be prepared for the fact that the recovery process will become somewhat protracted.  But there are no guarantees (when using this method) that everything will pass with due success, since often the speed of the Internet connection leaves much to be desired.  I wish you success in the implementation of the recovery process and stable operation of your iPhone device! </p>
