For summer options, choose models with an openwork, sirloin pattern, and for cold weather, options with a dense pattern are suitable. </p><p>  The advantage of crocheting is that any product holds its shape well.  It‚Äôs possible to sew the original sleeveless jacket out of motives by tying them with a wolf's step.  Let us consider in more detail the course of crochet on the example of several models for children and women. </p><h2>  <span>Crochet: tank tops, vests.</span>  Process features </h2><p>  Sleeveless jackets and vests are, rather, an additional accessory in clothing.  They are loved by children, men, women.  Openwork models allow you to create a new image, emphasizing femininity and softness, while warm-fitting models maintain a strict classical style. </p><p>  Sleeveless jackets and vests do not have sleeves, collars, can be buttons, ties, solid, fitted, loose.  In length, they vary from the line of the chest to the hips, the edges of the product can be rectangular, triangular, oval, zigzag.  There are changeling models.  Changing them up and down, you get a new image. </p><p>  Crochet sleeveless jackets goes according to the following plan: </p><ul><li>  First take measurements. </li><li>  Then make a pattern on paper. </li><li>  Choose a pattern. </li><li>  Calculate the number of loops. </li><li>  Knit details on the pattern. </li><li>  Combine all parts into a single whole. </li></ul><p>  Vests can be connected from individual motifs (squares, colors, circles) that are used to create napkins, or you can find a diagram in the magazine for your size. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet sleeveless jacket" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/590039.jpg" width="308"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Crochet Tank Top </h2><p>  For beginners, it‚Äôs best to learn how to knit things for babies.  Even if you don‚Äôt quite know how to read patterns or make patterns, take the tight-fitting blouse of the child as a basis.  Measure the baby's volume to determine the difference.  Pick up the threads (the store sells special hypoallergenic soft skeins for children), grab a hook and start knitting. </p><p>  Before: </p><ul><li>  Dial in the size of the sample (equal to half the volume) a chain of air loops (CLT). </li><li>  Pull back three lifting stitches (PP) and knit ordinary double crochet (CH) in each loop. </li><li>  To knit a new row, turn the work. </li><li>  Each row begins with three lifting loops. </li><li>  Periodically attach the part to the sample, if necessary, reduce the loop (knitting 2 CH together). </li><li>  Crochet sleeveless shirt is created without changes to the level of the armpits.  Having reached the armhole, from one edge, knit the connecting loops to the beginning of the armpit, type 3 PP and continue knitting with single crochet columns.  From the other end, just do not tie the same number of loops, turn the work over and continue the process. </li><li>  In the next row after starting knitting the armhole, thread the middle of the product.  This is the beginning of the cutout. </li><li>  Now the knitting will be as follows: from the side of the armhole the rows are even, and from the side of the neck a gradual decrease is made from each side to the shoulders.  Halves are knitted separately. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet vest" class="if" height="283" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/590037.jpg" width="274"></div></li></ul><h2>  How to create a back </h2><ul><li>  You gain equal to half the volume of the central heating system. </li><li>  Each row begins with lifting loops and knit with double crochet in each loop. </li><li>  You are now trying on the connected front.  Having reached the armhole, leave the desired number of loops from each edge, and continue knitting the back. </li><li>  About 5-7 centimeters before the end of the work, determine the middle of the back and the border of the shoulder with a thread.  Separately finish the halves. </li></ul><p>  Now try on.  Amass details, try on a vest for a child.  If necessary, remove all excess centimeters into the seam.  Stitch the sides of the front and back.  Further crochet sleeveless jackets involves tying several rows along the bottom of a vest, armhole and neck with a single crochet column.  If you work with colored threads or with different "bumps", "lumps", then you do not need to decorate the vest.  Do <span>applications of apple,</span> letter, etc.  (knit, sew from felt, buy ready-made decals).  Sew the decor to a sleeveless jacket. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Trapezoidal model </h2><p>  Sleeveless jacket consists of a dense and mesh pattern.  The upper part (like a topic) is connected by columns with and without crochets, and the lower part consists of a loin net.  Knitting begins with the measurement and drawing of patterns (back and two halves of the front).  First, translate the exact volumes onto the paper, and then draw smooth lines from the armhole on both sides, forming a trapezoid.  That is, the bottom is crocheted at the sleeveless jacket.  Pattern patterns will be as follows: </p><ol><li>  From the shoulder to the diaphragm level there is an alternation of rows of double crochet (two times) and single crochet (1 time). </li><li>  From the diaphragm line to the hips there is a mesh pattern consisting of arches of 4 air loops and <span>connecting posts.</span> </li><li>  The tying of the front, bottom, neck, armholes consists of single crochet and pico columns (a chain of three loops is drawn and inserted into the base). </li></ol><p>  This crochet sleeveless shirt for a girl begins with knitting a back.  Then halves of the front are applied to it.  Stitch seams, tie a vest.  Sew on buttons and decorative ornaments. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet tank top for girls" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/590041.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <h2>  Loin vest </h2><p>  Fillet pattern or mesh allow you to knit products very quickly.  The most original sleeveless jackets are obtained from colored yarn.  To begin, make a pattern of a vest (back and halves of the front).  For this, the following measurements are needed: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  sleeveless length; </li><li>  Waist; </li><li>  shoulder length; </li><li>  hips </li><li>  dimensions of the cutout (neck); </li><li>  breast volume </li><li>  armhole size. </li></ul><p>  You make a pattern strictly in size, then the sleeveless crochet will sit on the figure.  Now knit the center of the backrest.  Knit two or three centimeters in single crochet.  Such a strap goes at the bottom of the vest and on the sides of each part.  Only at the shelves in front of the neck and bottom of all parts, the bar is three centimeters, and on the other sides where the parts are attached, one and a half centimeters. </p><p>  "Elastic band" is necessary in order to keep the shape of the product.  Further from the bar, the whole pattern goes with a grid: </p><ul><li>  type 5 VP; </li><li>  skip two loops in a row; </li><li>  insert the hook into the third loop; </li><li>  knit two single crochet </li><li>  again, type the arch of 5 VP. </li></ul><h2>  Options filet sleeveless </h2><p>  The new row will consist of arches, it only starts from the middle of the previous chain, two double crochets are knitted and a new ‚Äúloop‚Äù is typed.  Always attach the knitted part to the pattern. </p><p>  Next, stitch all the details.  Tie a sleeveless jacket.  Create the tie with a single crochet (two to three centimeters wide) and sew to the halves of the front of the product.  Some craftswomen make a mesh pattern on the patterns, and then the details are tied with a bar.  For beginners, it is difficult, since you can stretch the product. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet sleeveless jackets" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/590061.jpg" width="374"></div>

    <p>  How else can you use a filet grid?  Knit the base of the air loops, alternate the <span>double crochet</span> (CH) and the air loops (CH, two loops, CH).  Bottom, neck, armhole knit pico (three loops in each loop of the chain). </p><p>  Next, knit leaves, flowers (you can separately on the petals and core), place them on a vest and sew them.  You can alternate patterns with a crochet: a strip of columns, a strip of mesh or a backrest to make solid columns, and before - a filet net with sewn floral motifs. </p><h2>  Office option </h2><p>  This is a figure-length sleeveless jacket up to the waist level.  It is worn over a blouse.  When selecting threads, pay attention to their color and quality.  Work begins with measurements and drawings of the pattern.  The crocheted sleeveless jacket consists of a front and a back (the neckline is shallow, round). </p><p>  Start knitting from the back.  You gain equal to half the volume of the waist of the central heating system.  Start the next row with the lifting stitches, knit three double crochet stitches, make two stitches, and go back to the stitches.  Pass a new row with single crochet.  Next, alternate rows with crochets, air loops and without them. </p><p>  At the level of the armhole, reduce the required number of loops, knit without changes to the level of the cut.  Mark the middle of the vest with a thread.  Knit shoulders separately.  So do before.  Then stitch the parts along the side and shoulder lines.  Go to the product strapping: </p><ol><li>  Single crochet. </li><li>  Alternating double crochet and two stitches. </li><li>  Alternating arches and two connecting loops. </li><li>  Half of the arch is knitted with connecting loops, and the other half - with double crochets. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet sleeveless vests" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/590042.jpg" width="417"></div></li></ol><h2>  One-piece tank top </h2><p>  Openwork sleeveless crochet sleeve knits immediately as a whole.  To do this, make the necessary measurements and a whole pattern of two halves of the front and back between them.  A continuous pattern of pineapples will go to the armpit line, and then a mesh pattern.  Then the sleeveless jacket is sewn in the shoulder lines and tied.  Consider the pineapple pattern first. </p><h2>  First row </h2><ul><li>  Gather a chain of loops equal to the volume of the waist. </li><li>  Start the row with the lifting loops.  In the same base, knit four columns with one crochet (you get half a pineapple). </li><li>  Gather one loop and attach it with a connecting column in the sixth loop of the previous row (PR). </li><li>  Then there are three arches.  Pick up three loops.  Connecting column enter the fourth loop of the PR. </li><li>  Knit four loops and insert the hook into the 5th loop of the PR. </li><li>  Then again comes the arch of three loops. </li><li>  Pick up the air loop (VP).  Skip five loops of PR and in the sixth loop you knit 9 crochet columns for pineapple.  Then repeat everything. </li></ul><p>  Turn over the work (this is a double-sided crochet sleeveless jacket).  Patterns begin and end with half a pineapple. </p><h2>  Second row </h2><ul><li>  Pineapple fits in the same double crochet (CH), just add 1 VP between them.  Get five columns. </li><li>  Do 1 VP and connect it to the OL column between the arches of 3 and 4 loops.  Then dial 2 CH, 1 loop, 2 CH (2 StN, 1VP, 2StN). </li><li>  Then again do 2 StN, 1 VP, 2 StN in the connecting column of the previous row between the arches of 4 and 3 loops.  Gather VP and proceed to knitting pineapple. </li></ul><h2>  Third row </h2><ul><li>  Pineapple begins with arches of three loops connected by a connecting column. </li><li>  Collect 3 loops, go to the loop separating the first element (2 StN, 1 VP, 2 StN), and knit 2 CH, make a loop. </li><li>  Knit another 2 CH, but insert the hook into the loop of the second motive (2 STN, 1 VP, 2 STN).  Gather 3 VP and go to knitting pineapple. </li></ul><p>  In fact, the above crochet patterns are represented by knitting a pineapple and branches from it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet sleeveless tank top" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/590064.jpg" width="452"></div>

A buttonhole is immediately knitted to it in the right places (an arch of air loops tied with connecting posts).  The bottom of the sleeveless jacket consists of rows of single crochet columns and the same elements with picot. </p><h2>  Openwork vest for jeans </h2><p>  This crochet sleeveless shirt for a teenage girl is knitted from square motifs.  Each of them consists of ten rows.  First take measurements and draw patterns.  Next, tie a pattern of motive.  Calculate how many whole squares are needed.  If there are extra centimeters, then scatter them on the strapping of sleeveless halves of the front, bottom, neck, armhole. </p><h2>  Square motive pattern </h2><ul><li>  Each row begins with three lifting loops (PP).  Next is a double crochet (CH), 9 VP, 2 CH.  Repeat thrice.  All rows end with a connecting loop. </li><li>  Close three loops in the ring. </li><li>  3 PP, 1 CH, 3 VP, 6 CH, 3 VP, 2 CH.
