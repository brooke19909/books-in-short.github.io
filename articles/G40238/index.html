    <h2>  Biography </h2><p>  Polosukhin Viktor Ivanovich was born on February 28, 1904 in the <span>Tomsk province.</span>  His parents were ordinary peasants.  In addition to Victor, the family had six children.  Therefore, the guy from childhood worked hard, helping parents.  In 1911, his father died suddenly.  After that, all children have to work along with adults in order to survive.  There was not even money for the funeral of the elder Polosukhin.  Then the family was helped by one of the exiled revolutionaries - Vladimir Obnorsky.  He gave the last money to Victor‚Äôs mother.  The young man did not forget this. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  When the October Revolution began, he joined the Komsomol detachment and was elected its head.  At the age of 16, he enlisted as a volunteer in the Red Army and bravely fights with bandits.  A year later, he was sent to an infantry training school.  Three years later, Polosukhin Viktor Ivanovich went to the Byelorussian SSR, where he was entrusted with a rifle platoon.  Then he enters the Bolshevik party.  In parallel with the service, he continues his studies. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the age of 28, he serves as a political instructor in the Volga Region. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Colonel Polosukhin Viktor Ivanovich" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1706298.jpg" width="286"></div>  Then he meets Olga Evlanova - his future wife.  A year later, they have a daughter.  Victor Polosukhin is continuously moving forward.  By the age of 38, he already commanded a division.  Its part was located in the Far East.  When the Japanese appeared in the area of <span>Lake Hassan,</span> his fighters were among the first to repel the invasion of the interventionists.  All soldiers behaved like heroes.

    <h2>  The beginning of World War II </h2><p>  When the war began, Polosukhin Viktor Ivanovich was still in the Far East.  At this point, he already held the rank of colonel and commanded the 32nd division.  In October 1941, the soldiers received an order to urgently go to Moscow.  Saying goodbye to the children and his wife, Victor leaves.  First, the soldiers entered the disposal of the Volkhov Front.  However, at this time, Kleist‚Äôs tanks stubbornly rushed to the capital, and the division sent to the city of Mozhaisk. </p><p>  The positions of the fighters are located on the <span>Borodino field</span> - in the very place where a hundred years earlier Kutuzov stopped Napoleon.  Polosukhin Viktor Ivanovich ordered to quickly prepare defensive lines.  A few days later, the German tank corps launched an offensive.  For five days, Soviet fighters desperately held the line.  Constant counterattacks and assaults, artillery fire, tank wedges - all this fell upon the soldiers who had only recently arrived at the front. </p><h2>  Feat </h2><p>  Colonel Polosukhin Viktor Ivanovich personally traveled all the advanced units.  In the hottest areas, he took command.  Where their ancestors held the defense of the capital in 1812, soldiers of the 32nd Division fought desperately to die in 1942. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mozhaisk city" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1706299.jpg" width="600"></div>  In five days of continuous fighting, they managed to destroy 117 tanks and 200 combat vehicles.

    <p>  By the end of January, the area turned into Pashendail fields pounded by shells.  The soldiers of the 32nd Division moved to a new line of defense.  Near the village of Ivanniki there was a threat of the environment, the consequences of which threatened the entire front.  Therefore, on February 18, Polosukhin‚Äôs soldiers went into reconnaissance in order to orient and plan further actions.  Scouts found a large concentration of enemy troops.  The colonel was personally present at the same time.  He stepped forward with binoculars to assess the situation himself.  Here, near the village of Ivanniki, he was hit by a fascist bullet. </p><p>  For military exploits, Victor Polosukhin was posthumously awarded the Order of the Red Banner. </p>
