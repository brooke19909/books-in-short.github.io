Natives of Scandinavia - participants in sea voyages</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Scandinavian Peninsula is a vast territory in the north of Europe.  Known in history as the homeland of the Vikings.  But Scandinavia became the place from which the <span>famous travelers</span> and the discoverers of the new time went on hikes. </p><h2>  Who are the Vikings? </h2><p>  Vikings are participants in sea voyages from Scandinavia.  Most scholars believe that it was the Vikings in Russia called the Vikings, and in Western Europe - the Normans.  They became famous in history as fearless sailors, pioneers of many lands.  They are also spoken of as cruel conquerors and pirates.  At the same time, the Vikings were also experienced traders. </p><h2>  Reasons for sea trips </h2><p>  The Viking marines set off for several reasons.  The first is the search for cultivable land, which is scarce in Northern Europe.  The development of new sites here has always been associated with the hard work of cleaning stones, uprooting trees and shrubs.  And naturally, they wanted to find more comfortable and fertile lands. </p>

    <p>  The second reason is trade.  The Vikings were the first to trade with the northern and southern peoples.  It is not in vain that the path "from the Varangians to the Greeks" has developed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  And the third reason is the conquest of fame and glory.  It was of great importance at the time when the elected princes - the konungs ruled.  In order to hold power in their hands, they had to become lucky miners, no matter through trade or robbery.  They needed to find good places to resettle their people, as well as protect them from attacks by both strangers and their "colleagues." </p><h2>  Viking age </h2><p>  The history of Scandinavia remembers the names of the famous Vikings.  These are the Hastings, which terrified France and Italy, Rollon - the first duke of Normandy, and others. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="title of charles the great participants in sea voyages from scandinavia" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23410/583569.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Even the title of Charlemagne did not frighten the warlike Normans.  Participants in sea voyages from Scandinavia regularly appeared off the coast of France, starting in 799.  Karl, who created the vast Frankish Empire, was seriously concerned about the Vikings.  On his orders, measures were taken to strengthen the coast.  In all seaports, as well as in the mouths of navigable rivers, patrol vessels were set up to warn of the appearance of the enemy.  Parking was built for military ships.  The entrances to many ports were blocked by chains. </p><p>  Subsequently, after the Viking‚Äôs destructive campaigns in Europe, the looting of Rouen and many other cities, it turned out that it was easier to give the Vikings land on the coast and make them protect these lands from sea raids.  This practice has proven to be more effective. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  In 966, the King of Norway, Harald Sinezuby, converted to Christianity.  Following him, his soldiers were baptized.  It was the Vikings-Christians who subsequently seized royal power in England, on the throne was Svein Viloborody.  And in 1130, the Norman Roger II sat on the throne of the Sicilian kingdom.  With the blessing of the Pope, he managed to unite the Viking possessions located in southern Italy and in Sicily. </p><p>  Duke William - a descendant of Norman Rollon - defeated the Anglo-Saxon King Harold II at the <span>Battle of Hastings.</span>  He became the monarch of England and is known as William the Conqueror. </p><p>  That's how the participants of sea voyages from Scandinavia gradually settled on the conquered land, became related to the local nobility, and even received royal power.  By the end of the 11th century, the Viking war campaigns had almost ceased. </p><h2>  Viking discoveries </h2><p>  But <span>the Viking era was</span> marked by great geographical discoveries.  First of all, this is the discovery of Greenland and the foundation of the first settlement in it by Eirik Ryzhim (Eirik Torvaldson).  Sent with his family from Norway, and then forced to flee Iceland under the threat of <span>blood feud,</span> he set off west across the Atlantic Ocean.  Having landed on an open stretch of the coast of the newly discovered island, <span>Eirik Ryzhiy</span> founded two settlements there.  He gave this site the name "Green Land", subsequently they began to call Greenland the whole island, despite the ice covering it. </p>

    <p>  Settlers established trade with their homeland.  They brought furs of polar bears, Arctic foxes, walrus fangs, <span>whale fat,</span> and vice versa - forest, grain, iron, and fabrics missing from Greenland. </p><p>  The sons of Eirik - Leif (nicknamed "Happy") and Thorvald - also come from Scandinavia, participants in sea voyages.  The discovery of America five centuries before Columbus is associated with their names. </p><p>  When Leif returned from Norway to Greenland, he fell into a storm.  A thoroughly battered ship approached the shore, and the sailors saw hills overgrown with wild grapes, fields of wild wheat.  That was in 999.  A land called Vinland, a country of grapes, attracted them by its warm climate, forest full of game, and fertile soil. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="trip to scandinavia" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23410/583587.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Not surprisingly, after returning to Greenland, they talked about the lands they saw.  Words about the new rich land became interesting for Torfinn Karlsefni, who in 1003 equipped an expedition to Vinland.  Having landed several times ashore on the current Labrador, Newfoundland Island, after one wintering they reached Vinland.  Here the Vikings met with locals.  Their second meeting ended in a clash.  In 1006, Karlsefni returned to Greenland. </p><p>  So the Vikings discovered America, but subsequently the way to Vinland was forgotten.  It took the Europeans half a millennium for Columbus to open the New World for them again. </p><h2>  "The calling of the Vikings" </h2><p>  According to most historians, the beginning of Russian statehood was also laid by the Vikings - the Vikings.  The Tale of Bygone Years tells us that to end the civil strife, representatives of the Slavic and Finnish tribes went on a campaign in Scandinavia, where they called on Rurik to reign. </p><p>  It is believed that Rurik came to Russia with his brothers Truvor and Sineus.  Subsequently, he began to reign alone, first in Staraya Ladoga, then founded Novgorod.  From him went the dynasty of the Rurikovich. </p><h2>  Participants of sea voyages from Scandinavia in modern times </h2><p>  The Viking spirit still lives in the hearts of the Scandinavians.  This is probably why there are so many Norwegian and Danish among the names of great travelers. </p><p>  The list can be opened with the name of Fridtjof Nansen, the famous polar traveler.  He is best known for his first trek through Greenland and an expedition to the North Pole, which ended in failure. </p><p>  Roald Amundsen is a great polar explorer, the man who discovered the South Pole, was the first to visit both poles of the globe (along with Oscar Adolf Wisting), who made more than one expedition in the Arctic and Antarctic waters. </p><p>  The famous <span>Tour Heyerdahl</span> is a worthy heir to the Vikings, who sailed across the oceans on ships, modeled on ancient means of navigation. </p><p>  Karsten Borchgrevink, who explored Antarctica, became the leader of the first wintering on the icy continent. </p><p>  Among Russian sailors there are also descendants of the Vikings.  <span>Vitus Bering,</span> who sailed through the strait separating Eurasia from North America, came from Denmark. </p><p>  These are just some of the names of sailors - people from Scandinavia, descendants of glorious sailors and conquerors. </p>
