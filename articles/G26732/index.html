In response, an SMS from Sberbank will need to check the recipient's data, namely his first name, middle name, and also the letter that the surname begins with.  The bank must send a code, which should be entered in the response SMS, and send it in confirmation of the operation.  The whole procedure takes less than one minute.  That is why this service will save a lot of time for both customers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="money on the phone with a bank card" class="if" height="232" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23734/1089014.jpg" width="600"></div>
