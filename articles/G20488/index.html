    <p>  She became a relatively inexpensive budget device.  Actually, it was they who demonstrated the ideal indicator of the ‚Äúprice-quality‚Äù ratio, setting the tone throughout the international arena and showing which standards should now be applied everywhere.  What characterized the devices of the South Korean manufacturer?  Firstly, an adequate price.  Secondly, the specifications are really relevant for the price.  This also includes criteria such as reliable assembly and high-quality manufacturing materials.  Perhaps these are the components that became the basis for the glory that the company gained a few years later.  Nevertheless, as it happens with many manufacturers, in the model range there were also devices that showed mistakes of engineers and designers, so to speak, dampened the reputation of the company.  Samsung J1 also became one of such devices, the reviews about which are not the best. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  ‚ÄúSamsung‚Äù gives slack? </h2>

    <p>  In recent years, more than a dozen experts have noted that the South Korean manufacturer is turning more and more towards new parameters, ignoring the fundamental principles that allowed the company to achieve such a truly crazy popularity.  Thus, the company is developing a new trend, namely that budget models with modest characteristics have an overestimated cost.  This is practically not justified by anything, only by the brand itself.  From the side it may look as if Samsung are simply trying to spend less, but earn more solely on its popularity.  The culmination of this story was the Samsung J1.  Reviews of this device confirm that it does not justify real costs. </p><h2>  Dimensions and usability </h2><p>  The phone lies in the hand quite conveniently.  The dimensions were clearly chosen by the designers of the company, which, in principle, is noticeable at the first tactile contact.  Language will not turn small to call a smartphone.  At the same time, it is not bulky.  Using the gadget with one hand will not be any difficulty.  If we talk about specific numbers, it is 129 millimeters in height, 68.2 in width, and also 8.9 in thickness.  In this case, the mass of the smartphone is approximately 120 grams.  To be precise, then 122. In any of the pockets, the device can perfectly hide.  For convenient use, there is one mechanical key located in the center, bottom on the front edge.  On the sides of it are standard touch controls.  Probably the build quality, ease of use and presentable appearance - this is the only thing that is ideal for this model. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The display of the device has a diagonal of 4.3 inches.  The screen resolution in this case is 480 by 800 pixels.  The device was created for the budget segment, as discussed earlier.  It is interesting that the manufacturer decided to manufacture the display matrix not according to IPS technology, but according to TFT technology.  It should be noted that the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãhigh enough for a device of this class.  She shows herself well in various lighting conditions.  Stock brightness to prevent fading of the picture in the sun is present, which is partly pleasing.  However, there are also disadvantages.  For example, there is no <span>light sensor</span> that would determine the level and change the backlight intensity.  Therefore, the user will have to carry out these operations manually, personally.  Few people save on such a component at present, but the South Korean developer decided to do this.  What can please in this area?  Perhaps the presence of various fonts that the owner of the phone can choose. </p><h2>  A bit about the series as a whole </h2>

    <p>  Even earlier, everyone thought that the J series (Samsung J1 is also included in it, reviews of which you can find at the end of the review) should have been presented to the general public as perhaps the most common and affordable.  However, this was only laid down in theory.  In practice, we have at least a different result from this.  It turned out that the Samsung Galaxy J1 SM J100F, reviews of which instantly spread around the international network, became much worse than the products from the Lumiya line, which is promoted by Microsoft.  Of course, comparing two different platforms with each other has always been something out of the ordinary and unacceptable, but in this case this means that the model was squared. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Speculation about the creation of the apparatus and modifications </h2>

    <p>  Sometimes it seems that not one person took part in the development of the device, but a real army of experts in the relevant field.  To believe that the budget series J was generally developed by a strictly limited contingent becomes almost impossible.  The fact is that this would automatically mean the absolute illegibility of the potential developer in the trends taking place in the field of mobile devices.  In practice, we get a relatively old, we can say, time-delayed product, ‚Äúdressed‚Äù and ‚Äúshod‚Äù in a beautiful wrapper designed to distract attention. </p><p>  In our case, we are dealing with a standard.  This is <span>Samsung Galaxy J1</span> LTE, reviews of which appeared on the network shortly after the start of sales.  But we are talking more about an anti-standard.  Because the South Korean manufacturer this time clearly demonstrated to the whole world how devices should not be developed and manufactured.  Well, or how you do not need to inflate the price of such devices.  It should be understood that the smartphone has a number of variations with changed characteristics.  For example, the Samsung J1 LTE variant, reviews of which are present in many forums, works much faster than its ‚Äúrelatives‚Äù.  This advantage is ensured through the use of a different platform, mainly. </p><h2>  Design </h2>

    <p>  The <span>Samsung Galaxy J1</span> smartphone <span>, reviews</span> of which you can find using the review, is similar to other devices of this manufacturer.  It guesses the standard design for many Samsung devices.  In appearance it is a rather tightly knocked down device.  Around the screen of the smartphone is a small border.  It automatically attracts the eye, forcing a closer look at the smartphone more closely, although it is not worth it.  Surely the reader remembers the words that this is a stale product in a beautiful package.  Nevertheless, aesthetics are in no way different from similar devices.  All the same typical standard ‚ÄúSamsung‚Äù.  In appearance, even the budget is not visible.  If we talk about color solutions, then there are three.  The first is white, the second is black, and the third, non-classic is blue. </p><h2>  Material quality </h2>

    <p>  According to this parameter, there can be no complaints about the Samsung Galaxy J1 SM J100F.  Reviews can tell that the materials are quite high quality, we can say that the assembly is also beyond praise.  Among many budget models, J1 stands out thanks to this parameter.  Yes, he does not completely cover the shortcomings, but he creates, one might say, partly a winning situation for the corresponding apparatus. </p><h2>  Facets and ends </h2>

    <p>  If we look at the left side of the device, then we can find the volume control key there.  It is called a swing.  It allows you to adjust the sound in multimedia applications, as well as change the sound mode of the smartphone itself.  Traditionally, the power management button occupies the right side.  It makes it possible to disconnect or turn on the device, as well as block it.  The bottom end contains a connector for synchronization with a personal computer.  This is a micro-USB jack.  On the opposite side there is a port for a 3.5 mm stereo headset.  Remove the cover.  There we will see the battery, as well as connectors for SIM cards.  There is also a slot for an external micro-SD format drive. </p><h2>  All the pros and cons </h2><p>  Let's try to go through all the points of the technical characteristics of the device in order to determine what grade can be awarded to the device.  Let's start with the design.  Here is an absolute plus.  Original, colorful, convenient and reliable.  In terms of appearance, materials and build quality, the device fully justifies the cost for which the South Korean manufacturer sells it.  Move on.  In second place we have a display.  The diagonal is 4.3 inches with a resolution of 480 by 800 pixels.  For such a diagonal, this is normal, but I would still like to see a larger screen.  At least 4.7 inches.  In terms of the budget segment, the TFT standard matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãnot bad, but in general it will not turn out to call it a qualitative language.  Three parameters closes the battery.  It is rated at 1850 milliamps per hour.  If you use your smartphone intensively, the charge will last for 6 hours. Not the best performance, is it?  Things would be even worse if the processor was more powerful.  By the way, let's talk about him.  Inside the smartphone are two cores operating at a clock frequency of 1.2 gigahertz.  To ensure multitasking, this is enough.  For undemanding games too.  However, the device will never pull the latest toys.  Performance tests, which use three-dimensional elements, just close, showing that its level is low.  The processor or 512 (total!) Megabytes of RAM is to blame for this, it is simply impossible to say.  Nevertheless, the fact remains.  Well, we will complete the analysis on camera.  The resolution of the front camera is 2 megapixels.  The main module - 5. Although in fact the photos taken by such a device do not show us this level.  And if the situation with the front camera is still more or less good, then there are big and significant claims to the main one.  As a result, it turns out that all the advantages in a smartphone are external in nature.  But the hardware, alas, is not happy. </p><h2>  <span>Samsung Galaxy J1</span> SM J100F Smartphone: customer reviews </h2><p>  What can people who purchased this phone model tell?  Many buyers noted that the technical characteristics of the model are so-so.  Neither the camera nor the size of the internal memory or the processor is impressive.  Standard tasks are performed at a good level, multitasking works well.  But still, Samsung offers not the same level for the appropriate money.  Currently, there are a huge number of models from other manufacturers on the smartphone market that beat J1 in almost all respects.  Moreover, their cost either differs slightly, or does not differ at all.  A good option to buy is only the Samsung Galaxy J1 SM J100F LTE.  Reviews about him suggest that the model compares favorably with the module, but overall there are no more advantages. </p>
