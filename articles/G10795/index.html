The realism of the flowers that are obtained will make any contemplator admire your creation.  Moreover, everything is not as complicated as it seems. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dmc-ap.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="needle and thread" class="if uuid-2381708" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78854/2381708.jpg"></div><h2>  French knot embroidery </h2><p>  French knots are a technique for embroidering with mouline thread or satin ribbons.  It is thanks to them that the picture looks voluminous and realistic, of course, it will bring aesthetic pleasure to the contemplator.  In many countries of the world, needlewomen use such knots in their work.  They are especially good for creating small details such as flower cores, eyes, buttons, hairpins and the like.  Depending on the selected thickness of the tape or thread, as well as on the number of turns, the size of the nodule varies. </p><div class="photo" data-original="homeofhomemadetreasures.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="embroidery with a hoop" class="if uuid-2381750" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78854/2381750.jpg"></div><p>  Learning a similar embroidery technique is easy enough.  If you are a beginner needlewoman (or needlewoman, now this is often found), then the information described below is intended specifically for you. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to learn to embroider French knots </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, the technique of embroidery with French knots is quite common and simple.  It will not be difficult to master it perfectly.  So, embroidery with French knots for beginners: </p><ol><li>  Take the hoop, the fabric on which you are going to embroider, a thimble, a comfortable needle, thread or ribbon (of your choice). </li><li>  Securely weave the hoop in the hoop so that in the process you are not distracted by adjusting or pulling it again.  Both hands should be free, not busy keeping dangling folds. </li><li>  Insert a thread (ribbon) into the needle, tie a knot at its end as you do when you are going to sew a thing.  A knot is needed so that the thread does not slip through the fabric, but is fixed. </li><li>  From the wrong side of the fabric we bring the needle to the front side. </li><li>  Pulling the thread as much as possible, wrap it around the needle in one direction (you can make one turn, or you can make several), then bring the needle to the wrong side as close to the first puncture. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="blog.redheart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="training scheme" class="if uuid-2381814" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78854/2381814.jpg"></div><p>  A fairly easy algorithm of actions, according to which you can easily learn to decorate your embroidery with lush knots. </p><p>  In order to see and understand the technique of embroidery, you can watch training videos. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="c5kIKvZ8BWM" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5kIKvZ8BWM" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/2/1/5/2/2152.jpg"></div><h2>  French knots as a way to decorate a picture </h2><p>  French knot embroidery technique is suitable for decorating the finished product.  And also as an independent way of embroidery.  Perhaps the question arises of how to make a French knot when embroidering with a cross.  Of course, you can simply, at the end of the element (i.e., the cross), bring the needle to the wrong side, and then, according to the scheme described above, make a knot.  However, it is best to decorate your product after completion of work.  In other words, embroider your canvas completely with a cross and then make French knots in the right places. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="volume letter" class="if uuid-2381874" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78854/2381874.jpg"></div><p>  However, knots can not only decorate finished products.  The technique is great for creating whole pictures.  It looks aesthetically pleasing, neat, voluminous and original. </p><p>  Embroidery truly becomes more lively, realistic.  You can embroider French knots with satin ribbons.  The algorithm of actions does not change, you just need to take a needle with a thicker eye. </p><h2>  Embroidery French knot: patterns </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Owl on a branch of French knot embroidery" class="if uuid-2384862" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24955/2384862.jpg"></div><p>  You can embroider with knots both according to the patterns invented by you independently, and according to ready-made patterns for cross-stitching.  The most common are embroidery patterns combining several techniques.  For example, as mentioned earlier, the main pattern is embroidered with a cross, and French knots only complement it, make it voluminous.  The combination of different techniques will add gloss to your work, and you yourself will earn respect among your colleagues. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="different techniques" class="if uuid-2382938" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78854/2382938.jpg"></div><p>  If you are a beginner, then do not immediately take up complex work, it is worth trying something simple, but beautiful.  For example, try to embroider a branch of lilac or a simple landscape.  In order not to be disappointed in needlework, fill your hand on simple elements, and in the future, take on the creation of masterpieces. </p>
