Surely you can‚Äôt draw conclusions about the shortcomings of this institution.  This information can be obtained from such negative reviews of travelers: </p><ul><li>  the rooms have long been in need of redecoration - a lot of scuffs and malfunctions; </li><li>  not the most practical solution - the lack of a wall between the residential part of the room and the bathroom; </li><li>  in the evenings, the rooms have very dim lighting (in addition, half of the bulbs do not work); </li><li>  maids are forgetful in the matter of replacing towels, as well as replenishing supplies of cosmetic accessories; </li><li>  a very modest choice of dishes for breakfast (of course, no one will remain hungry, but the meal does not deliver much pleasure); </li><li>  tasteless "rubber" pastries and a very small assortment of desserts (not even find elementary chocolate); </li><li>  the staff speaks and understands English very poorly, and therefore it is very difficult to explain and convey their request; </li><li>  the disgusting quality of tea and coffee at breakfast; </li><li>  the hotel is located away from the city, there are no decent catering establishments and large retail outlets nearby; </li><li>  in catering establishments there are very few fresh fruits, although in an exotic country they are abundant; </li><li>  Compared to previous years, the service at the hotel has become much more modest - it feels like management has begun to save on some points; </li><li>  sun loungers on the beach are very close to each other - this is inconvenient; </li><li>  the price tag in public catering facilities is somewhat overpriced (apparently this is due to the distance from the city and the lack of competition); </li><li>  very hard uncomfortable mattress on the bed - after sleep, the back hurts on it; </li><li>  old bedding, sometimes there are holes (although everything is perfectly clean); </li><li>  near the hotel there is a river along which motor boats move with great noise; </li><li>  the menu of catering establishments has almost no dishes for vegetarians. </li></ul>
