Disasters of this magnitude in the world have been extremely rare.  It was an international flight Paris - Leningrad - Moscow. </p><div class="photo" data-original="m.fishki.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="IL 62 Dalavia Airlines" class="if uuid-3211020" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109425/3211020.jpg"></div><h2>  The history of the disaster "IL-62" in 1972 </h2><p>  Regarding the landing in the Northern capital, there are two versions: </p><ol><li>  Sheremetyevo (Moscow) was closed due to weather conditions, the crew was sent to the Leningrad Shosseinaya airfield. </li><li>  Planned landing in Leningrad with a further domestic flight to Moscow, as those who bought a ticket to Moscow boarded the plane.  Also, a coffin with the ashes of composer A. Glazunov arrived in Leningrad from Paris on this flight. </li></ol><p>  Then the airliner flew to the capital, rising to a height of 9000 m. The crew kept in touch with the dispatcher in working order, took instructions according to the route.  At an altitude of 3700 m, Savelovo was passed and permission was received for a further decline.  Several times, the crew commander contacted the dispatch service to confirm the altitude, coordinates.  The last radio contact with the board was at a line altitude of 750 m. After that, the crew team did not communicate.  At an altitude of 400 m, the mark on the radar monitors disappeared. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The plane, turning, tilted to the right, crashed into the surface of the wing.  First, the wing console collapsed from the collision, then the nose of the fuselage collided with the ground.  The plane swept through the field for about 330 m and crashed into a forest belt, through which about 200 m slipped to complete destruction. All 174 people on board died. </p><p>  At that time, it was the largest plane crash in the world in terms of the number of victims.  Today, the crash of IL-6 2 of 1972 is the second largest in the world among those that happened with this aircraft model, and in Russia it is the second after the crash of Tu-154 in Omsk in the number of deaths. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vikond65.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nerskoe Lake, crash site" class="if uuid-3211014" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109425/3211014.jpg"></div><h2>  Investigation </h2><p>  According to experts, before the collision with the surface, all systems were in a functional state.  The weather factor could not cause the accident.  There were the usual indicators: </p><ul><li>  1,5 thousand m of horizontal visibility with light wind, air temperature +6 ¬∞ . </li><li>  The board is equipped with an autopilot system, which made it possible to carry out an approach approach automatically. </li></ul><p>  According to the flight recorder, for 34 seconds before the crash, the speed was 560 km / h, to the altitude of 740-600 m, maneuvering actions corresponded to the established flight rules and regulations.  Then, for an unknown reason, the crew did not take action to prevent a collision. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A number of irregularities were discovered in the dispatching work, inconsistency of the barometer data, which could not serve as a basis for the fall of the Il-62.  Disasters at these rates could have been avoided. </p><h2>  The alleged causes of the tragedy </h2><p>  There are several assumptions about the causes of the disaster: </p><ol><li>  For some reason, the normal mental and physical condition and the crew‚Äôs working capacity were disrupted. </li><li>  Partial failure in the control system, but, according to the black box, minor deviations of the elevator could not lead to a complete loss of control. </li></ol><p>  Consequently, it is impossible to draw accurate conclusions about the causes of one of the most large-scale catastrophes of IL-62 in the entire history of not only Russian, but also world air transportation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trend.az" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Accident IL 62 in Mashhad" class="if uuid-3211017" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109425/3211017.jpg"></div><h2>  Historical loss analysis </h2><p>  In total, 286 cars were designed, the very first crashed at the test stage.  According to statistics, the remaining causes of accidents with the crash of an aircraft of this model are as follows: </p><p>  1. 48% - the human factor (personnel errors).  Most of the accidents occurred due to a premature decline or ended up with the machine being outside the runway: </p><ul><li>  07/20/1975 in the Damascus region hit the ground "Il-62", the disaster could not be avoided due to the rapid decline. </li><li>  05/27/1977, Havana, in thick fog the car fell below the permissible level, hitting the power line, collided with the ground. </li><li>  07/01/1983, Labe, the liner crashed into a mountain. </li><li>  06/30/1990, Yakutsk, later error recognition, the plane jumped outside the runway, collapsed. </li><li>  November 21, 1990, the settlement of Magan (Yakutsk), the pilots were not ready to land in a snowy runway, the plane rolled into a ravine and collapsed. </li><li>  10.23.2002, Bishkek, error during take-off, the plane collided with a concrete fence. </li><li>  03/29/2006, Domodedovo (Moscow), got off the runway, fell apart into several parts. </li><li>  07.24.2009, Mashhad, landing at high speeds, collision with lights, a car crash from the runway, crashed into the fence of the airfield and the poles of power lines. </li></ul><p>  2. 42% - the reasons for the failure of aircraft systems: </p><ul><li>  03/14/1980, Warsaw, chassis problems, crew report on approaching the 2nd circle, electrical equipment was damaged, which led to a fall. </li><li>  July 6, 1982, Sheremetyevo, after taking off at 160 m, the 1st and then 2nd engine fire alarms went off, the crew decided to return to the airfield.  Despite following the instructions, the plane hit the surface. </li><li>  05/09/1987, the district of Warsaw, at an altitude of 8 thousand meters, the turbine collapsed, the fuselage and electrical systems were damaged.  At an altitude of about 1.5 thousand meters, control is lost, a collision with the surface occurred. </li><li>  04/20/2008, Santo Domingo, during the approach, the 2nd engine collapsed, damage to the wreckage of the fuel system and the 1st engine, fire.  Emergency landing completed. </li><li>  09/29/1982, Luxembourg, control system failure, the plane rolled out over the runway, burned out. </li><li>  07/17/1989, Berlin, due to poor controllability, the plane left the runway, there was a collision with an obstacle, it burned down. </li><li>  08/14/1972, Koenigswuster, after departure at an altitude of 8.9 thousand meters there was a problem with control, the crew began to decline, drained fuel, there was a fire in the tail section, a complete loss of control. </li></ul><p>  3. 5% - the impact of external factors: </p><ul><li>  09/03/1989, Havana, the plane fell into a downward stream of heavy rain, falling on residential buildings. </li><li>  10/13/1972, Sheremetyevo, due to bad weather conditions, there was a collision with the surface of the earth </li></ul><p>  4. 5% - the causes of incidents have not been established. </p><div class="photo" data-original="oruzhie.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cabin of pilots IL 62" class="if uuid-3211067" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109425/3211067.jpg"></div><p>  IL-62 met the criteria for flying over long distances, was created taking into account international standards of this class.  But tragedies still could not be avoided.  With the most severe losses, two IL-62 crashes occurred - a catastrophe near Moscow in 1972 (174 dead) and in 1987 near Warsaw (183 people). </p>
