    <p>  For a modern consumer, a mobile phone is the same as for a young lady of the 19th century a personal diary or for a hacker a <span>personal computer.</span>  The phone contains not only the necessary numbers, duty games, reminder texts, but also a host of other personal information.  Even the choice of appearance, design of the model can say a lot about the owner.  And even more so, when the phone rings, its owner wants not a simple signal to sound, but a favorite melody. </p><p>  Therefore, many mobile users are wondering how to install a ringtone on the iPhone.  You can immediately recommend using the AnyRing application. </p><p>  This development is quite new, it is available thanks to Cydia and allows you to select a musical composition from the library to set it to an incoming call as a signal or to a signal about receiving SMS.  So there is nothing easier than learning how to install your ringtone on your iPhone! </p><p>  <strong>Process technology</strong> </p><p>  And now a step-by-step instruction on how to set the ringtone on iPhone 4 and other models: </p><ol><li>  You need to decide which particular melody should play the role of a ringtone.  Please note that the signal sounds within thirty seconds.  Naturally, a full melody is much longer.  Therefore, it must be trimmed.  You can use any utility for this purpose, for example, mp3DirectCut.  Its interface is intuitive and designed for a novice user, and therefore it will not be difficult to understand it.  The received musical fragment should be kept. </li><li>  The next step before setting the melody on the iPhone is to save the saved fragment to the library section of the iPhone.  This is done through the iTunes program.  The file is transferred to the library, after a few seconds it appears there. </li><li>  Already from the library, the desired fragment of the melody is selected through the iTunes menu in the phone itself.  The file should be converted.  When the process is completed, the ‚ÄúRMB‚Äù option is selected, then the ‚ÄúShow in Explorer" option is selected.  A ready-made file is selected.  Then you should change its extension to m4r format. </li><li>  With the correct execution of all sequential actions, a picture should appear on the screen, which says "ring".  After that, the file can be moved to the ringtone section. </li></ol><p>  <strong>Other options</strong> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The above-described way to resolve the issue of how to set a melody on the iPhone is not the only one, although it should be worked out thoroughly, so that from time to time it is easy to change annoying rhythms to new ones selected from your own phone collection or downloaded from the Internet. </p><p>  Perhaps the most universal is the installation method through the iTunes application.  Like the previous one, it does not require much time and effort in order to master it. </p><p>  So, the iTunes application starts.  Next in the menu is the option ‚ÄúFile‚Äù, ‚ÄúAdd file to library‚Äù.  In this way, the melody of interest is attached to the collection in the folder of the corresponding name - ‚ÄúMusic‚Äù.  The file is highlighted.  Then in the ‚ÄúInformation‚Äù item are the parameters ‚ÄúStart‚Äù and ‚ÄúStop time‚Äù, they are marked.  Again, the fragment of the melody should last no more than 30 seconds - in this regard, the requirements are strict. </p><p>  The next step on the way to set the melody on the iPhone is the familiar process of converting and renaming the resulting file.  Pay attention to such details - the file name must be written in English letters, the size - no more than five hundred kilobytes.  If the result is not immediately right then you should rename and standardize the playing time. </p><p>  At the final stage, the iTunes application restarts, the received ringtone is added to the library, the synchronization process starts, and the new motive for the call is ready. </p><p>  When several music fragments are placed on calls in an iPhone, iTunes must be restarted after creating each new music file.  And melodies converted to ringtones cannot be moved, otherwise they will not be seen by the program and added. </p>
