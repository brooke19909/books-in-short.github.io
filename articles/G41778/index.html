    <p>  The ice room makes a special impression on adults and children.  Here you can take interesting photographs and appreciate the art of local artists.  And after the ice treat, no one will have any doubts about the reality of what is happening and the observed magic. </p><p>  Many guests of Terem Snegurochki like the fact that during his visit you can not only have fun, but also learn something interesting.  An interactive tour acquaints visitors with the beliefs of our ancestors, and exploring the collection of homemade fir trees will give a lot of inspiration and new ideas for children's creativity. </p><p>  The museum is also notable for the low cost of tickets.  Tickets for many similar attractions are several times more expensive.  Here, for the minimum price of the tour, you can get a lot of new impressions. </p><p>  Terem Snegurochka reviews are not always positive.  Many parents do not like modern technology in the exposition dedicated to the classic fairy tale.  However, according to the museum’s administration, a computer in the fabulous Terem today simply must be, and it would be strange if it weren’t.  After the tour, the children will definitely not have a question about how the Snow Maiden and Santa Claus manage to answer all letters.  After all, any first grader today knows that you can communicate on the Internet very quickly and conveniently. </p>
