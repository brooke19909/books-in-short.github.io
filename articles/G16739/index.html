In this case, it was not just a numismatist, but the <span>Roman deity</span> Janus, who sailed to the <span>Apennine peninsula</span> from the island of Crete and knocked out a coin in honor of the <span>god Saturn.</span>  It is not known, however, whether after that he collected coins further, and also where he kept them.  At the service of the current numismatists is a special classbook for coins, an album, turning over the transparent pages of which, one can consider both the obverse of the coins and their reverse. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Klyasser for coins" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11773/129523.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Often not all such albums released for sale satisfy the tastes of discerning numismatists, who therefore prefer to make an album for coins with their own hands.  One does not like the cover, especially if a picture or logo flaunts on it, which has nothing to do with numismatics proper.  Others blame the color of the substrate for the coins (they are convinced that the coin has the right to flaunt only on a black background or on crimson satin velvet a la Sberbank, and not so far from the truth.) The third is not satisfied with the inability to add all new sheets to the box as the collection expands ... In general, there are many complaints, and there is certainly a solution to the problem. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can make a very good album for coins with your own hands, and with a ready-made presentable cover and hemmed transparent sheets, much denser than regular files, from a business card holder.  A soldering iron, an iron ruler and a piece of thick paper or cardboard preliminarily lined for future cells are enough to ‚Äúsolder‚Äù the sheets to the size of the coins.  It is advisable to pre-train with a soldering iron, as the business card holder is already sewn tightly, and it is better to leave all the "pancakes lumpy" in the "draft".  Slots for coins are carefully made with a sharpened knife or a scalpel on a folded cardboard. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY coin album" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11773/129522.jpg" width="480"></div>

    <p>  But still, to realize the numismatist‚Äôs dream of constantly expanding the collection (which is one of its innermost meanings), an album for coins with their own hands, designed for fastening with a folder, will help.  Its convenience is also in the fact that you can independently set the cell size for a coin, but they come in different sizes.  For example, if 5 kopecks of 1961 coinage has a diameter of 25 mm, then the copper nickel of 1924 has 32 mm.  Not to mention coins of various denominations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Coin Sheets" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11773/129524.jpg" width="366"></div><br><br>  First you need to find simple files from the thickest plastic possible (for greater rigidity) - these are future sheets for coins.  Files are in A4 format, so it‚Äôs easy to draw squares of the required size on the same sheet of thick paper for future cells.  This sheet rests on the file, and another under the file;  the resulting "sandwich" is best fixed with paper clips.  By this time, the soldering iron included in the network should already have warmed up properly.  His sting needs to be drawn exactly along the drawn lines (2-3 times is desirable), to guarantee insurance with an iron or wooden ruler.  Before the actual work, it is advisable to practice;  you yourself will be surprised how quickly you learn to do everything perfectly right the first time.  In conclusion, it remains only to cut lines in the cells for inserting coins, after placing the precious collection, seal each section with transparent adhesive tape and hem the sheet into a folder.

    <p>  Alternatively, you can make all the cells in the files the same in size, but add the DIY album for coins with cardboard inserts with round windows for the diameter of the coins.  Inside, the cardboard bag is glued so that the coin freely enters and at the same time precisely "looks" into the window.  And the tongue on top makes it easy to pull it out of the sheet if necessary. </p><p>  Folders-folders are produced in different capacities, with a maximum of 100 files.  If each sheet is calculated on 16 coins, 1,600 copies are more than a decent collection.  Good luck replenishment, numismatists! </p>
