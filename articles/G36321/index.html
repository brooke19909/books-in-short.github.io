Models from China that are similar in their technical characteristics are sold much cheaper, so the company is simply forced to answer this not only with massive staff cuts, but also with lower prices for its lines. </p>

    <p>  One of these answers was the Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime.  The review of this smartphone, of course, is worth starting with the price: for the characteristics that the device offers, it is quite justified.  The average cost of the model range on the Internet market ranges from 10,000 rubles, which may already interest potential buyers. </p><p>  The company decided to save on the technical component of the display for the sake of the battery capacity and the smartphone‚Äôs camera.  The pixels and screen resolution, which could be equipped with a display, were transformed into a 5-megapixel front camera with a wide-angle format, which has already been recognized as one of the best in the segment of budget smartphones. </p><p>  <span>The Samsung Galaxy</span> Grand Prime SM and VE <span>rulers</span> are an excellent tool for both individual and group selfies, while having a camera viewing angle of 85 degrees, while the closest analogs can not boast of indicators greater than 70 ¬∞.  It is worth noting that the main camera of 8 megapixels also meets all the declared characteristics and is distinguished by high-quality shooting and visibility. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  As a result, the company launched a ‚Äúselfie phone‚Äù on the market with an impressive battery, attractive price, the new 64-bit processor from Snapdragon 410 series, which will allow not only surfing the Internet without problems, but also playing games. </p><p>  The display turned out to be of average quality: 5-inch with a resolution of 960x540 pixels.  The image may not be so clear, but the IPS-matrix provides high brightness and relatively good viewing angles. </p><p>  Generally speaking, the <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> Grand Prime smartphone is suitable for those people who need a hardy battery and high-quality selfie.  You can buy a line in white and gray, White and Gray, respectively. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  In appearance, the Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime VE model is easily identified as a representative of Samsung, even if it did not have a distinctive logo.  The line has a typical Samsung design and style: the side frame is made in silver, rounded edges, a classic speaker just above the logo and an oval button in the control place. </p>

    <p>  There is a slightly protruding lens on the back of the smartphone, a backlight is located to the left, and to the right of the camera is a speaker divided in two by a strip of plastic. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The power key and volume rocker are located on the sides of the device, there are also a headphone jack and micro-port for SD cards.  In general, the smartphone gives the impression of an attractive and solid gadget. </p><h2>  Dimensions </h2><p>  The device has the following dimensions: 145x72 mm with a thickness of 9 mm.  They are very similar to the Sony Xperia Z3.  But with a diagonal of five inches, the body seems too thin and too tall.  Nevertheless, the smartphone is convenient to hold in your hand. </p><p>  The material of the device is plastic, it is assembled quite qualitatively, which is typical for the company's products, in particular for the Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime VE.  Reviews about the device sound mostly in a positive way, and there were no serious flaws: nothing backlash, crunches and does not bend.  The case is collapsible, the cover under which the batteries and SIM slots are located is easily removable and also put in place.  You can remove the battery or replace the SIM card without problems, without fear of breaking anything. </p><h2>  Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime Series Screens </h2><p>  The review of the screen should begin with not the most pleasant moments, as the company clearly decided to save on it.  The resolution of the display is 960 by 540 pixels, as on an old mini-flagship, but with a smaller screen.  The density of dots per inch is very small - 220 ppi, and plus there are no light sensors, and at the same time an adjustable brightness. </p>

    <p>  The only thing that pleases is the lack of a TN-matrix in the Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime.  User reviews were still heard, and the line was equipped with an IPS analogue.  Although the display of the device does not have sufficient (by the standards of modern smartphones) clarity, viewing angles are very good. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Among the few advantages of the display, a rather high brightness of 400 cd / m2 can be noted, which allows you to work normally with the device in the daytime in the fresh air.  You should immediately warn that the display does not have <span>an oleophobic coating</span> or protective glass, so the screen ‚Äúcollects‚Äù fingerprints and small scratches.  Be careful and get a cover with an additional film. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The device is positioned by the company as a selfie device, which is facilitated by the main 8-megapixel and front 5-megapixel cameras, specially included by engineers in the Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime line.  The camera overview is within 85 degrees, which allows them to take high-quality atmospheric and panoramic images. </p>

    <p>  Opportunities and additional functions, coupled with a variety of modes for the camera abound.  The only thing that is missing, judging by the user reviews, is the image stabilization system, otherwise the line pleases with its capabilities and photo resolution (3264x2448).  Pictures are obtained of quite acceptable quality, deserving all praise. </p><p>  The maximum resolution for video formats is 1920 by 1080 pixels with a recording speed of 30 frames / second.  The camera has a tracking autofocus, coupled with a microphone records sound in stereo mode. </p><p>  The front row is designed not only for calls, but also for wide-angle selfies.  Separately, it is worth noting the group picture mode, where it is possible to create a mini-panorama where your entire company will fit. </p><h2>  the Internet </h2><p>  The built-in browsers from the Android and Chrome OS are quite convenient for web surfing.  If it is possible to purchase the Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime LTE, then browsing the Internet turns into a real pleasure.  The device‚Äôs connection is stable and does not cause any complaints from both specialists and ordinary users.  The gadget is equipped with dual-band Wi-Fi at 802.11 b / g / n and Bluetooth fourth version. </p><h2>  Multimedia </h2><p>  The company in its devices pays much attention to the multimedia capabilities of gadgets, but not in the case of the Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime.  The review showed that the smartphone loses most of the known video formats without prior conversion and subsequent optimization.  But the Grand Prime line could not cope with seemingly popular resolutions like MKV and MOV, and this is a rather big minus towards the device. </p><p>  With audio formats, everything, in principle, is standard: MP3, WMA, WAV and similar resolutions, the player lost without problems, but on the FLAC the device stumbled, it had to be launched by a third-party program. </p><h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  The smartphone is equipped with a lithium-ion battery with a comparatively good for its price capacity of 2600 mAh.  The device can work for almost seven hours with continuous playback of high-definition (HD) video with maximum brightness, almost like an ‚Äúapple‚Äù gadget of the sixth version. </p>

    <p>  Standard audio mode discharges your smartphone in about 80 hours.  A similar time showed the Galaxy S5.  General indicators of battery life with confidence indicate that the smartphone in its price category exceeds many analogs of the segment. </p><h2>  Modes and Charging </h2><p>  Additionally, we can mention the extreme energy saving mode, which is able to reach the device‚Äôs operating time up to one hour with a blinking battery.  So you can manage to not only finish an important conversation, but also run to the nearest outlet.  The charger included in the kit fills the battery from 220 volts in two and a few hours. </p>

    <p>  If you charge the battery from a computer, then a type 2.0 port will charge the phone in three and a half hours, and USB 3.0 will take no more than two hours.  Charging may not be as fast as with similar Sony smartphones, but the company immediately warned about this on a preview of the models. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  The Grand Prime line runs under the Android 4.4.4 operating system with the TochWiz proprietary interface, which has passed the test of time and is equipped with expensive devices.  Models can support the work of two SIM cards and have special features for people with hearing problems: monosounds, flash notifications, etc. </p><p>  All kinds of modes allow you to quickly control the phone, and extreme energy savings will make it possible to end the conversation and continue working with the device for a long time. </p><p>  The company listened to user reviews about its smartphones and did not ‚Äúclog‚Äù the line with pre-installed software, as a result of which the device became noticeably faster, as did the interface. </p><p>  Models of the Grand Prime series are worth the money, and they will perform all the functions that are inherent in modern smartphones, if not the ‚Äúfive‚Äù, then the solid ‚Äúfour‚Äù for sure.  The verdict is very positive - we recommend. </p>
