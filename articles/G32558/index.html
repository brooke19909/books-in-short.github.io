This city has many attractions: both ancient and newest.  The city is being rebuilt intensively, it hosts many international meetings at various levels. </p><h2>  Originally from the USSR </h2><p>  Often the main <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãof Tatarstan</span> is called the third capital of our country.  One of the most beautiful cities in modern Russia is Kazan.  Victory Park is in many settlements of the Russian Federation, it exists in this city.  Although it was laid during the Soviet era, it was relatively recently - in 1978. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kazan Victory Park" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/1023851.jpg" width="600"></div>  The very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a park was beautiful, and the city‚Äôs authorities allocated a place specifically for it - they didn‚Äôt demolish anything, they just drained the swamps.  The area occupied by the park is 50 ha.  After preparing the territory, the alleys were broken and trees were sent out in an amount corresponding to each day of the war - a total of 1,418 pieces.

    <h2>  Have time for the round date </h2><p>  The hard times that the country experienced and began to revive came.  The time has come to return to the projects begun and unfinished due to lack of funds for the construction projects.  All these difficult years, Kazan Victory Park was slowly improving, and in 1995 a museum was laid down and began to be built on its territory.  And then the trees have grown.  An exhibition of military equipment was organized.  And in 2005, to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the surrender of Nazi Germany, Victory Park was inaugurated. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  For 27 years, Kazan rebuilt Victory Park: statues and obelisks were erected, a museum was built.  As a result, many objects related to that great war were collected here. </p><h2>  Eternal Flame Memorial </h2><p>  And of course, as in many other parks dedicated to these events affecting every seven families, the <span>eternal flame</span> is his heart <span>.</span>  The memorial is located near one of the entrances to the park. </p><p>  It is surrounded by a pantheon, on the tablets of which the names of the inhabitants of Tatarstan, who gave their lives for their homeland, are depicted.  Among them are 200 Heroes of the Soviet Union and 29 Knights of the Order of Glory.  On the seven stela installed around the memorial, each of which is dedicated to one of the seven rifle divisions (they were created in Kazan), the names of the soldiers are immortalized.  It is clear that the memorial is the main scene of <span>the Victory Parades.</span>  All Kazan brings flowers here.  Victory Park on this day is especially transformed.  At the Eternal Flame, young residents of the capital of Tatarstan are on guard. </p><h2>  Stele and Open Air Museum </h2><p>  A little further, in the depths of the park, along the main alley, there is a 42-meter stela "Victory", which is crowned with a wreath of laurel leaves - a wreath of winners.  Decorates the beauty-stela Order of Victory. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Victory Park Kazan Address" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/1023853.jpg" width="600"></div>

In many cities in such parks, the most popular place is the open-air museum of military equipment.  But this museum is huge in Kazan - here, besides tanks, armored personnel carriers, howitzers and artillery pieces, there is the legendary Katyusha, airplanes, including the famous MiG.  In addition, there are helicopters, and the Luna-M missile system is also delivered here to eternal parking, but all the military equipment on display is in excellent condition.  And recently, on the Day of the Navy, a restored cabin was installed here from the K-403 Kazan submarine.  A bell was hung near the cabin, and it was decorated with the arms of the country and city.  You can imagine how much joy it gives the children the opportunity to climb into the cockpit or squeeze into the tank! </p><h2>  Place of worship </h2><p>  In order to form the necessary number of alleys, trees were planted in a certain way: it was originally planned that each of them would belong to a specific military branch.  There is also an alley of mothers, widows, women in general, whose fates were cut short by the war. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Victory Park Kazan reconstruction" class="if" height="371" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/1023872.jpg" width="595"></div>

    <p>  But Victory Park is not only a place of sorrow and worship of the great feat of the Soviet people, the inhabitants of Tatarstan.  Through the efforts of the authorities, it has become the favorite resting place of the townspeople, and this is the best memory of the victims. </p><h2>  Park ponds </h2><p>  There is always a lot of vacationers here, especially on Sundays.  The park has a beautiful artificial lake.  Citizens have a tradition of arranging radio-controlled ship competitions on its waters.  And the tradition has taken root so well that in 2006 the Russian Championship for racing radio-controlled boats was held on this lake.  Swimming in this lake is prohibited, but you can ride catamarans.  There is another reservoir in the park, it is located in the north-eastern part.  He is stocked and chosen by ducks. </p><h2>  Popular Cafe </h2><p>  This modern park has a lot of what are attractive city squares.  So, along the alleys you can ride a horse and a pony, there is a rental of various sports equipment.  And of course, there are a lot of cafes both in the park and near it.  ‚ÄúAt Victory Park‚Äù (Kazan, 36 Yamasheva Avenue) is just such a cozy place that is known to all residents of the city.  The advantages of the cafe ‚ÄúAt Victory Park‚Äù include excellent European, Russian and Tatar cuisine, there is a spacious summer terrace.  The institution is famous for fairly reasonable prices (average bill - 500 rubles). </p><h2>  Location and accessibility </h2><p>  As noted above, swamps were allotted for this memorial object.  Where is Victory Park (Kazan) located?  How to get to this place beloved by the townspeople?  The territory was allocated in the Novo-Savinovsky district of the city.  The facility is located where Bondarenko Street and Prospect, named after the first Tatar Bolshevik and publicist Khusain Yamashev, intersect.  By the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a metro line will be drawn here, and now the station closest to the park is Goat Village.  You can get to the park by buses No. 5, 28a, 33, 46, 49, 60 and the 13th trolleybus route.  Victory Park (Kazan) has the following address: Kazan, Yamasheva Avenue / Bondarenko Street. </p><h2>  Park restoration </h2><p>  The 70th anniversary of the Great Victory was very widely celebrated throughout the country.  Almost a year in the capital of Tatarstan, restoration work was carried out in such a cult place as Victory Park (Kazan).  The reconstruction was completed by May 9, 2015.  She touched not only the pantheon, where new names of warriors appeared, who were previously considered missing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cafe near Victory Park Kazan" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/1023873.jpg" width="600"></div>  The paving stones were replaced, the steps became granite, the slab under the Eternal Flame was made of solid granite.  In addition, the Victory stela and the colonnades were faced with new travertine tiles.  Work was carried out to improve the lighting of the park (in particular, a new highlight was installed on the stele), and completely military equipment was restored.  Flower beds were added around the perimeter of the memorial.  A beautiful English lawn appeared near the Avenue of Widows; now in a separate pavilion there is now an electronic book in memory of the victims.  A lot has been done to the 70th anniversary of the Victory.
