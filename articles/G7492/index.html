    <p>  Why is this southern beauty so attractive for such a huge flow of tourists?  Its main advantage as a tourist center is the ability to combine several types of tourism at once, namely: sightseeing, beach, active, culinary, eco and even extreme.  It is no secret to anyone that Spain has a rich historical and cultural heritage, and tourists vacationing at its resorts can diversify their holidays by visiting the nearby attractions.  And connoisseurs of new taste sensations can enjoy exotic dishes of local cuisine. </p><h2>  Spain Resorts </h2><p>  Each of the regions of Spain, regardless of where it is located (on the coast or inland), knows how to surprise its guests.  Nevertheless, the Mediterranean and Atlantic resorts still enjoy special popularity among tourists.  The golden beaches of Andalusia, Galicia, Catalonia, Canary and the Balearic Islands stretch for many thousands of kilometers and attract the eyes of travelers from all over the world.  And no one can accurately determine which one is the best, most beloved, most in demand ... Catalonia, however, is precisely that unique component of Spain that each of the country's guests wants to visit.  <span>Costa Brava, Costa Dorada, Costa del Maresme</span> - hotels in these resorts delight tourists with a wide variety of services, regardless of their categories.  In all hotels, without exception, guests are provided with high quality service.  Rest in budget "triples", for example, in the Reymar Malgrat 3 * hotel, is no worse than in hotels a category higher.  Well, the beaches are almost the same everywhere, the same clean and equipped.  Most of them were awarded with "blue flags", which, of course, is an indicator of the level of tourism development in this country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reymar playa malgrat 3" class="if" height="229" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/478060.jpg" width="379"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotels of Spain 3 stars </h2><p>  In Spanish hotels, regardless of the number of stars on their signs, the service is impeccable.  However, three-star hotels are more suitable for unpretentious tourists who just need the hotel to have all the necessary conditions for a normal stay: comfortable furniture, cleanliness, air conditioning, delicious cuisine, as well as the proximity of the beach.  They are going to spend most of the day outside the walls of the hotel: on the seashore or on excursions to numerous attractions.  So why should they pay extra money for some additional services that they simply don‚Äôt have time to use?  From this point of view, 3 * hotels are quite happy with them.  Here the price is affordable, and the service is at a high level.  By the way, the best 3 star hotels in Spain are in Catalonia.  The three leaders are headed by the Golden Playa Park 3 * Hotel (Salou / Costa Dorada), followed by the Olympic Palace, also in the resort of Salou, and of Raimar Malgrat in Malgart de Mar. </p><h2>  Spain, Costa Del Maresme </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spain costa del maresme" class="if" height="416" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/478054.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Costa del Maresme is a resort area on the northeast coast of Catalonia.  It is adjacent to the Costa Brava, stretching for as many as 38 kilometers, reaching the territory of Barcelona.  This, of course, is the biggest advantage and secret of the popularity of this resort.  A distinctive feature of its beaches is not golden, but silver sand.  They are washed by the waters of the <span>Balearic Sea.</span>  The infrastructure in these parts, as in all Spanish resorts, is more than developed.  The structure of the Costa del Maresme includes the resort villages of Montgate, Santa Susanna, Malgrat de Mar, which houses the Reymar Playa Malgrat 3 * hotel, Callela and others. The Montenegre i Corredor Nature Reserve is also located here (not to be confused with Montenegro ), which is one of the main natural attractions in all of Spain.  Especially in order to visit this original park with unique flora and fauna, tourists from neighboring resorts come to Costa del Maresme.  The map of the reserve is sold in many kiosks of the town.  Without it, tourists can get lost on the numerous paths of a giant park. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  In the north of the Costa del Maresme resort, the Pyrenees mountains rise, which protect it from the weather.  Due to this arrangement, the climate in this area is particularly mild (in summer the temperature does not rise above 30 degrees, and in winter does not drop below +10) and is favorable for a beach holiday most of the year.  And this area is famous for a wide variety of berries and fruits, for which it was nicknamed the "coast of fruits."  From orchards and strawberry plantations, crops are harvested three times a year. </p><h2>  Costa del Maresme Resort Hotels </h2><p>  Back in the last century, fishing villages were located on the site of this modern resort, but the wealthy residents of Barcelona chose its beaches for their chic climatic and natural conditions and began to build their summer residences here, and hotel brands followed suit.  Soon, the coast began to be decorated with beautiful high-rise buildings of hotels and restaurants.  Reymar Hotel Malgrat 3 * is one of the old residents in the resort.  It was built in 1969.  The <span>hotel</span> received its <span>3 stars</span> relatively recently, according to the modern classification system, but in those distant years on the entire coast it was hardly possible to find a hotel that could be compared with it in terms of service and internal arrangement.  As you already understood, this resort is one of the oldest on the entire Spanish coast, so hotels here are not the first "freshness", although they are regularly reconstructed.  In view of this, this resort is considered economical, and therefore popular among young people.  For example, in their reviews of the Reymar Malgrat 3 * hotel, tourists who are vacationing with families complain of the incessant noise from the show program, which lasts almost all night, while young people thank the administration for having fun.  However, this resort also has sanatorium hotels that offer tourists a wide range of medical procedures.  They are located at the source of hot mineral waters, thanks to which Malgrat de Mar and Santa Susanna are also considered <span>balneological resorts.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the best hotels of spain 3 stars" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/478053.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get to Malgrat de Mar (Costa del Maresme) </h2><p>  As noted above, this resort area is located near Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãso if you bought a tour to the Reymar Playa Malgrat 3 * hotel, then it is most convenient to fly to the capital of Catalonia.  Here, from Moscow and other cities of the Russian Federation regular flights are carried out, and in the summer, charter flights of several airlines at once (Aeroflot, Iberia, S7, etc.).  And from Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãa train leaves for all the resorts of Catalonia.  Ticket price - 2.7 euros.  However, many vacation packages include a transfer, and upon arrival at Barcelona Airport, tourists are met by employees of this travel agency and transported to the hotel by road. </p><h2>  Reymar Malgrat 3 * (Spain / Costa del Maresme): description </h2><p>  This comfortable hotel is 80 km from Barcelona Airport and 500 meters from the center of Malgrat.

    <h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  The Reymar Malgrat Hotel is one seven-story building with balconies, which was built in 1969.  The building was last reconstructed in 2005.  Thanks to this, the hotel acquired a more modern look and was able to provide tourists with a higher quality service.  The hotel has a total of 224 standard rooms, of which 192 are double (20 sq. Meters), designed for a maximum of 4 people, 28 are single (10 sq. Meters) and 4 are suitable for people with disabilities. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The hotel offers guests meals of the type "breakfast only", "half board" (dinner and breakfast) and <span>"full board"</span> (three meals a day).  Breakfasts are quite decent (eggs, jams, pastries, etc.), but dinner is worth all praise: seafood, 2-3 meat dishes, several original salads, fruits.  But for alcoholic beverages you will need to pay separately.  Nevertheless, vacationers, if desired, can eat outside the walls of the hotel.  There are many taverns and restaurants serving local and international cuisines on the promenade where the Reimar Hotel is located, and a 15-minute walk there is a supermarket where you can buy some non-perishable products. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spain hotels 3" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/478058.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Vacationers at the Reymar Malgrat 3 * hotel use the municipal beach, which is a stone's throw from the hotel.  This is a very clean and well-equipped beach, just for the equipment (umbrellas, sunbeds and mattresses) you need to pay every time, and not such a small amount.  However, this is Spain.  3 * hotels here practically do not have their own beaches, so many tourists prefer to sunbathe by the pools, comfortably sitting on sun loungers, and go to the sea only for swimming. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  While relaxing at the Reymar Hotel, tourists can either go on excursions on their own or contact the tour desk and entrust all the questions about organizing trips to the sights with the employees of the travel agency.  The first thing to visit while living on the coast of Malgart is, of course, Barcelona - a city that is known worldwide for the architectural masterpieces of the great Gaudi, an outstanding contemporary architect. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="costa del maresme hotels" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/478056.jpg" width="600"></div>  In addition to the original buildings, in the capital of Catalonia you can visit the oceanarium, the Singing Fountains Square, the Salvador Dali House Museum, etc. In addition, the travel agency will offer you a visit to the Spanish village, an old castle with a theatrical jousting tournament, and for lovers of culinary and ecotourism a trip will be organized to the Catalan outback - to the villages of Besalu and Rupit.  Here, tourists can enjoy simple rustic food: homemade cheese, dairy products, dishes from vegetables and fruits, collected personally, etc.
