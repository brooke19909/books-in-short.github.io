Every day on Russian roads, their number is increasing.  At the same time, each driver has a question about whether motorcycle insurance is needed.

    <h2>  Transport insurance </h2><p>  Since 2003, a law was passed in Russia, according to which motorists must purchase a compulsory insurance policy.  According to this law, a list of vehicles accepted for insurance was determined.  Today, the motorcycle is on the list of vehicles that are subject to insurance.  It turns out that motor third party liability insurance is required, and without it you can‚Äôt move on roads. </p>

This refusal is explained by the fact that motorcycle insurance is a loss-making type, and companies want to protect themselves from spending.

The maximum amount of payment upon the occurrence of an insured event is 400 thousand rubles for transport and 500 thousand for health.  Motorcycle insurance and insurance are no different from car insurance.  You will need to have a personal passport, documents for the vehicle, a driver‚Äôs license and a diagnostic card with you.  If you are not the owner of the motorcycle, then for registration you will need to provide the owner's passport (copy or original). </p><h2>  How to calculate motorcycle insurance </h2><p>  To determine the size of the <span>insurance premium</span> , basic and adjustment factors are used.  The base coefficient established in 2015 for category ‚ÄúA‚Äù vehicles is 867 rubles.  This basic coefficient is multiplied by correction factors, which depend on: the registration of the owner, the age and length of drivers who will be allowed to drive. </p>

According to the law, each driver receives a 5% discount per year for a trouble-free ride.  Every year the discount is added up and applied to lower the basic insurance premium.

    <p>  Only on the basis of the completed application, the representative of the insurance company will calculate the premium and draw up an MTPL agreement.  However, it is necessary to take into account the fact that motorcycle insurance is issued only after its inspection.  Therefore, before visiting the insurance company, the vehicle must be prepared and washed. </p><p>  Those who do not want to personally visit the insurance company, wait in line, show the motorcycle for inspection, can get an insurance contract via the Internet.  Starting July 1, 2015, online insurance for motor third party liability insurance is issued. </p><p>  Rosgosstrakh also offers its customers to purchase a policy through the World Wide Web without personally visiting the company's office.  This significantly saves time and allows you to solve the insurance issue in minutes.  How is the process of issuing an electronic CTP insurance form and how is it different from ordinary paper? </p><h2>  Registration of an electronic policy </h2><p>  To apply for a motorcycle <span>insurance policy</span> , you need to go to the company's official website and go through a simple registration form.  After registration, an access code will be sent to your personal mail, which you will need in the future when concluding the contract and will serve as an electronic signature. </p>

As soon as all the fields of the application are correctly filled in, you will need to confirm the accuracy of the information by entering the received secret code.  Further, the data will be automatically processed and motorcycle insurance is calculated and executed.  You can pay the contract by credit card or through an electronic wallet.  After payment, the OSAGO electronic form will be registered on the PCA website and will be sent by mail.  This form in appearance is no different from ordinary paper.

    <h2>  What is necessary for registration </h2><p>  The list of documents required for the purchase of an electronic policy is no different from the documents required to conclude a contract at the office of the insurance company.  You will need a passport, a document for a motorcycle, a driver‚Äôs license, a diagnostic card (if the vehicle is older than 3 years old) and the received electronic key. </p><p>  When motorcycle insurance is issued, Rosgosstrakh additionally offers to conclude life insurance.  This type of insurance is very relevant among motorcyclists, as they are subject to great injuries. </p><h2>  How to show insurance to the traffic police officer </h2><p>  If you purchased a regular CTP policy at the office of an insurance company, then simply submitting a form and personal documents is enough.  In the event that the motorcycle insurance is electronic, it is enough to show the form in electronic form: on a mobile device or tablet. </p>

    <p>  It should be noted that motorcycle insurance is issued for a period of 3 months to a year.  Each motorist, before leaving on the road, must purchase a compulsory insurance contract for a convenient period for him.  For violations of the law, not only penalties are provided, which are many times higher than the cost of insurance for a motorcycle, but also a refusal to pay when an insured event occurs. </p>
