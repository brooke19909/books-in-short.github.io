  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How computer simulation is performed</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Computer modeling is widely used in various fields of science and technology, gradually replacing real experiments and experiments.  It has become so firmly entrenched in our lives that it is already quite difficult to imagine a situation when you have to abandon this way of studying the real world.  This phenomenon is explained quite easily: with the help of this process it is possible to achieve significant results in the shortest possible time, allowing you to penetrate into that area of ​​reality that is not achievable for a person. </p><p>  Computer <span>information modeling</span> allows you to create a model on a computer that, with some assumption, has the properties of a real object or process, and the study is conducted on this created model.  To conduct surveys, it is necessary to accurately understand why they are being carried out, what is their purpose, what exactly properties, sides of the object under study are of interest to you.  Only in this case can one be sure of a positive result. </p><p>  Like any other process, computer modeling is built on certain principles, among which the following can be distinguished: </p><p>  · The principle of information sufficiency.  If there is insufficient information about the real process or object, it is most likely that it will not be possible to conduct research using this method; </p><p>  · The principle of feasibility.  The created model should allow achieving the goals set for the researcher; </p><p>  · The principle of multiplicity of models, which is based on the fact that in order to study all the properties of a real object, it is necessary to develop several models, since it is not possible to combine all real properties in one; </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  · Principle of aggregation.  In this case, a complex object is represented as separate blocks that can be rebuilt in a certain way; </p><p>  · The principle of paratmerization, which allows the parameters of a particular subsystem to be replaced by numerical values, which reducing the volume and duration of the simulation, also reduces the adequacy of the resulting model.  Therefore, the application of this principle should be fully justified. </p><p>  Computer simulation should be performed in a specific, strictly defined sequence.  At the first stage, the goal is determined, after which the <span>conceptual model is</span> developed <span>.</span>  Then, the formalization of the model is performed, allowing its software implementation.  After that, you can start planning the model experiments and implement the previously drawn <span>up experiment plan.</span>  After all the previous points are completed, it will be possible to analyze and interpret the results. </p><p>  Recently, computer simulation of physical processes is performed using various <span>application programs.</span>  You can find a large number of works performed in Matlab.  Such studies allow us to study all kinds of physical processes that in reality a person will not be able to observe. </p><p>  Computer modeling is widely used in industry.  With its help, new products are developed, new machines are designed, their working conditions are set and virtual tests are carried out.  If the compiled model has a sufficient degree of adequacy, it can be argued that the results of real tests will be similar to virtual ones.  In addition to studying the properties of a particular system, on the computer you can develop the appearance of the finished product, set its parameters.  This minimizes the amount of marriage that can result from inaccurate engineering calculations. </p>
