  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Andorra Hotels</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In recent years, in our country there has been a real boom in the development of <span>skiing.</span>  In almost every city there are impromptu ski slopes, on which you can get the necessary skills in the descent, or at least learn how to confidently stand skiing.  Of course, every real skier wants to visit a good ski resort at least once a year. </p><p>  In any trip, you can save by reducing the cost of rental housing.  Tours to Andorra are no exception, and Andorra hotels provide ample opportunities for this. </p><p>  As an example, consider the pros and cons of several hotels in Andorra. </p><p>  Andorra hotels vary in comfort and price. </p><p>  For example, the three-star Espel Hotel is 200 meters from a shopping center. </p><p>  The positive characteristics of this hotel include a good combination of reasonable prices with good service.  The rooms are designed for two and four guests.  Each of them has a bathroom, TV, telephone and heating.  An extra bed can be added if desired.  The hotel provides breakfast and dinner.  The menu you choose yourself.  In the evening, you can play billiards at the hotel, or <span>relax</span> in the restaurant. </p><p>  The disadvantages of the hotel include the lack of opportunities for meaningful leisure directly at the hotel.  There is no nanny <span>for children, a</span> safe is located at the receptionist, you can also order lunch in your room.  In order to get to the lift, you have to spend about fifteen minutes. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you are interested in Andorra hotels for families with children, you can stay at the four star Andorra Center Hotel. </p><p>  The advantages of the hotel include the fact that the rooms here have at least two rooms.  You can stay in each of them together or four.  Children under twelve years old accompanied by two adults stay free.  Each room has a bathroom, shower, toilet, hairdryer, satellite TV and telephone.  Beds can be double or single.  You can eat in the <span>restaurant.</span>  You need to choose the <span>menu</span> yourself.  Special meals can be ordered for children. </p><p>  The hotel has a cinema, billiards, a children's room, a nanny, a ski storage room, a safe, car parking is provided. </p><p>  The disadvantage of the hotel should be considered the lack of safes in the rooms, the inconvenient location of the hotel relative to the ski lifts, and a somewhat unpresentable appearance. </p><p>  If you like luxury and comfort, five-star Andorra hotels are at your service, for example, the Sport Hotel, located in a protected area, surrounded by fluffy fir trees. </p><p>  First, we list its advantages.  Even the exterior of the hotel resembles a fairytale castle, only modern.  Each room has access to the terrace, which offers a magnificent snowy landscape.  Here you will be greeted by a courteous and very helpful staff, and for your stay you will be offered apartments consisting of several rooms.  Sharing is not provided at this hotel. </p><p>  You can dine in the restaurant, or in the room, it all depends on your desires.  The hotel has a swimming pool, spa, billiards and gym. </p><p>  The disadvantage is that paying for the service will be expensive.  This hotel has high prices. </p><p>  Another example of a hotel in Andorra is the two star Hotel Soldeu. </p><p>  Its advantage is considered to be that it is a cheap vacation option, similar in principle to the organization of living in a student hostel.  Here you can save a lot of money not only on the cost of living, but also on food.  Each room has an <span>electric stove,</span> fridge, kettle and kitchenware.  Such living conditions are especially popular with tourists from our country. </p><p>  The disadvantage is that the service is practically absent here.  There is no cafe or restaurant, a safe is not provided, and leisure is organized by guests at their discretion. </p><p>  As you can see, in Andorra you can spend a vacation for tourists with different levels of income and at the same time have a good rest. </p><p>  Hotel reviews of Andorra are always positive.  All tourists unanimously note the high level of comfort and special comfort of the rooms. </p>
