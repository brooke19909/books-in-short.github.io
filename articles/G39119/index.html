Regulatory standards</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In every society there are many different rules of behavior - regulators of relations between its members.  Even in the early stages of the development of mankind, that is, in the primitive communal system, interactions between people were regulated through a system of mononorms.  These included various rituals, myths, customs, taboos, vows, etc. It was with their help that the so-called regulatory function was carried out in society.  With the development of mankind, mononorms have been replaced by more advanced regulators, which are divided into three main groups, namely: </p><ul><li>  social; </li><li>  technical; </li><li>  spontaneous. </li></ul>

    <p>  By the way, the third, that is, spontaneous, stand out only in legal literature.  The rest of the article will focus only on <span>social regulators,</span> that is, norms that contribute to streamlining the behavior of all members of society in various areas of their life.  There may be legal, moral, cultural regulatory standards.  Read about each of these species later in the article. </p><h2>  Social regulation </h2><p>  In society, the behavior of people in relation to each other is due to a certain impact on the part of society itself.  This is <span>social regulation.</span>  It is customary to divide it into casual and normative, while the former does not affect the whole society, as in normative regulation, but on a specific person or group. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How is social regulation implemented?  For this, special techniques have been developed in society.  They are regulatory standards.  First of all, law refers to them.  This is a system of formally defined rules of behavior binding on all members of society.  Another type of regulatory norms is <span>custom, these</span> are the rules of behavior that develop over time and are based on the experience of a fairly large group of people.  Moreover, they are performed without any coercion, that is, voluntarily or by force of habit. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="regulatory standards" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12967/1364173.jpg" width="600"></div>  The next type of regulatory framework is morality.  This is a set of rules of conduct based on the ideas of good and bad, good and evil, right and wrong, etc. They exist in the minds of society and are supported by public opinion, that is, measures of public condemnation.

    <p>  Morality is personal (internal conviction of an individual) and social - accepted by most members of society.  Regulatory function is also carried out through religious norms.  These are the rules of conduct that are based on belief in the supernatural.  They are supported by the hope of a prosperous life or fear of punishment, punishment in the other world. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How was the regulatory function carried out in the primitive world? </h2><p>  Spells, myths, customs, taboos, rituals, vows, vows, etc. - all these are forms of normative regulation of the behavior of ancient people.  Through myths and traditions, information about necessary or forbidden behavior was transmitted to them.  These are stories about good and evil, and in them, as a rule, the behavior of some is presented as a feat and serves as a subject to follow. </p><p>  Customs - this is information about the life of previous generations, which is cognitive in nature and transmitted from older to younger.  As for the rituals, these are specific actions that are symbolic and voluntary, in view of the habits, performed by people in a certain order. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="regulatory uud" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1363982.jpg" width="477"></div>

    <h2>  What gave the emergence of states to humanity? </h2><p>  The beginning of the history of human civilization is considered to be the formation of primary communities of people, which in their organization resembled the organization of animals (flock, herd, etc.).  With the advent of the first states, significant changes took place in people's lives: the regulatory function of the state, its mechanisms were largely different from those that existed in the primitive system.  Of course, she continued to contain the already existing social relations, but her main goal was not only their control, but also intensive development. </p><p>  The regulatory function carried out by the state includes social, economic, cultural and interstate functions.  This means that it is aimed both at organizing social production (economy), and at creating the necessary conditions for the formation and development of a full-fledged personality in society, as well as at the emergence of interstate interactions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="types and functions of communication" class="if" height="385" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1363981.jpg" width="580"></div>

    <h2>  An understanding of state regulatory mechanisms </h2><p>  The rest of the article will focus on legal, moral, cultural and religious norms, through which the regulatory function in society is carried out.  Each of these species has its own specifics.  First of all, I want to reveal the essence of the legal settlement.  By this concept it is necessary to understand the impact aimed at social relations and aimed at streamlining them through such specific means as regulatory rules of law.  They determine the legal and subjective duties and rights of entities, as well as the conditions for their operation and occurrence.  Each of these norms affects the consciousness and will of a person and with their help controls his behavior.  In a word, the regulatory function of law is carried out through common norms for all.  They come in several forms: </p><ul><li>  Obligatory, that is, those that require citizens to perform certain positive actions. </li><li>  Prohibitory, these are the rules that indicate the inadmissibility of some acts. </li><li>  Eligible.  They assign a person the right to carry out certain actions that determine the scope of his authority. </li></ul><p>  However, each of the norms can be formulated in any of these three qualities.  And it depends on certain circumstances.  Some regulatory norms of law combine several properties of the above qualities at once.  So, for example, the initiation of a criminal case can be considered both as an obligation and as a right of the person conducting the investigation.  The main thing is to correctly analyze the conditions of a particular act. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="state regulatory function" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1363977.jpg" width="405"></div>

    <p>  The first of two varieties of legal regulations, that is, prohibiting and binding, are mandatory.  This means that they do not allow any derogations.  But the norms of the third kind, authorizing, in most cases relate to dispositive, and allow the behavior of the addressee of the norm agreed with the partner.  By the way, for the same reasons one can distinguish other <span>types of legal norms,</span> namely optional and recommendatory. </p><p>  There are also situational, considering the addressee in accordance with a particular situation, and alternative, providing the opportunity to choose from several options indicated in the normative act.  The regulatory <span>function of law is</span> also carried out through incentive norms.  Their main feature is that they have a positive impact on people's behavior through incentive measures, sanctions.  In a word, contrary to the view of many, <span>legal norms</span> can be not only a whip, but also a carrot. </p><h2>  Stages of Legal Settlement </h2><p>  Like any system, legal regulation is divided into elements and stages.  The latter include the awareness of the need to create rules of law, then the process of creating these rules goes on, the third stage is the emergence of duties and rights of specific entities, and the last is practice, that is, the implementation of subjective rights and legal duties.  As for the elements, they correspond to the above stages and are: </p><ul><li>  norms of law; </li><li>  the content of the rule of conduct itself; </li><li>  establishing a measure of responsibility (legal) for violation of certain rules; </li><li>  legal relations (arising on the basis of existing legal norms and their real effect); </li><li>  acts of the implementation of legal duties and rights. </li></ul><h2>  Morality and its regulatory function </h2><p>  An important role in the formation and development of individual and social consciousness is played by the educational function, which is carried out through moral standards.  When a person masters moral experience, moral qualities, feelings, habits, the ability to self-discipline and self-education are formed in his mind through methods of upbringing and belief in his mind, then the regulatory function of morality certainly acts here.  It is carried out through the rules of etiquette existing in society, communication, etc. By the way, the latter is one of the most important mechanisms of moral regulation. </p><p>  Communication performs a communicative function, which is a symbolic system of morality and it is thanks to it that information was transmitted at the very early stages of human development.  In a word, the regulatory function of morality is primarily carried out in a communicative way.  Thanks to him, truly human relations are formed between members of society.  Communication is necessary for people not only to transmit this or that useful information, but also to receive a mass of positive emotions, pleasure from this communication itself.  If people have the rules of communication, then this allows you to make communication more pleasant and humane. </p><h2>  Types and functions of communication </h2><p>  Man is a social being.  He lives in conditions of interaction with people.  Without communication, social communication is impossible.  It is a specific form of interaction between people, and its social meaning consists in the transfer of universal human experience and forms of culture from one generation to another.  The child begins to speak and becomes a conscious person only in the process of communication with adults, experienced people.  Without this, he will not have the formation of the human psyche and consciousness.  Surely everyone remembers the character of the book Kipling Mowgli, who, once in a wolf pack, remains at the animal level. </p><p>  What types and functions of communication exist?  Firstly, it is the communicative side, which is the exchange of information between people;  secondly, it is an interactive side that contributes to the coordination and organization of interhuman interactions;  thirdly, this is the perceptual side, which helps partners to establish trusting relationships and achieve mutual understanding with each other.  And it is through communication that learning takes place. </p><p><strong></strong></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="regulatory function of morality" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1363976.jpg" width="467"></div>

    <h2>  Regulatory universal learning activities </h2><p>  In order for a person to grow out of a child who is able to enter into healthy interpersonal relationships and interact with his environment, he must learn to be a member of society from infancy.  Naturally, he gets his first knowledge in the family, then falls into the children's team (kindergarten, school), where regulatory UUD (universal educational activities) are applied.  Later in the article we will try to reveal their essence and understand what they are. </p><p>  This term in its broadest meaning means the ability to learn, self-develop, and improve through the conscious appropriation of new knowledge and social experience.  But in the narrow sense, UUD is a set of skills and methods of action of a student that help him independently learn new knowledge, master unfamiliar skills, as well as correctly organize this process.  In a word, regulatory UUD provide correction and regulation of educational activities.  These include: </p><ul><li>  goal setting; </li><li>  planning; </li><li>  forecasting; </li><li>  correction; </li><li>  assessment; </li><li>  self-regulation, etc. </li></ul><p>  Regulatory actions are those knowledge and skills that students must fully master by the end of school. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="regulatory function of law" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1363978.jpg" width="406"></div>

    <h2>  Religion and Morality </h2><p>  In this section, we continue to familiarize ourselves with the mechanisms of social regulation.  This time we will talk about religion and its regulatory function.  First, imagine how this concept is interpreted scientifically.  Religion is a public institution, which occupies an important place in society, its structure.  It acts as one of the forms of public consciousness and expresses certain ideas with the help of which the relations of members of society with each other are regulated.  These ideas exist in the form of a system of peculiar patterns of behavior and norms that arise in the form of God's commandments.  In a word, believers, observing divine precepts, refrain from committing various misconducts and atrocities, because they are driven by fear of imminent punishment, as well as the belief that all of their actions are monitored by a "watchful eye." </p><p>  The regulatory function of religion is based on special norms of social behavior that affect even the most intimate areas of people's lives, for example, nutrition and sexual relations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="regulatory action is" class="if" height="469" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1363980.jpg" width="520"></div>

    <h2>  Culture as one of the mechanisms of social regulation </h2><p>  Culture is what distinguishes man from animals.  Unlike their smaller brothers, people not only adapt to their environment, but purposefully change it.  As a result of these transformations, various ideas, symbols and values ‚Äã‚Äãarise - the so-called artificial world, which opposes the world of naturalness, that is, nature.  These values ‚Äã‚Äãare transmitted from generation to generation exclusively through the processes of upbringing and education.  This means that culture, like <span>law and morality,</span> also plays an important role in the process of regulating social relations. </p><p>  The regulatory function of culture is to form patterns of behavior through the influence of ideals, cultural norms and values, as well as patterns of behavior.  In a word, culture draws around a person and society as a whole the framework within which people should act.  Through culture, relations between family members, the school team, between employees of the enterprise, etc. are regulated. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In this article, we tried to uncover the meaning of what constitutes the regulatory function of the state.  As already noted, this is an activity that is aimed at developing existing economic, legal and social relations. </p>
