In order to answer this question, you should take a look at the political map of the region.  In the first half of the XVIII century.  BC.  Mesopotamia was a number of cities that often competed with each other.  Hammurabi united these states into a single whole, stopped civil strife and chose Babylon as his capital.  In order to centralize his power, he adopts his own set of rules and norms.  This is the history of the laws of Hammurabi, but what is their essence?

Their violation was considered a crime against the deity, so it was punished very severely.  Hammurabi's law was to give Babylonia peace, justice and prosperity.  The articles are compiled in casuistic form, that is, they describe not general norms, but concrete cases from life. </p><p>  The Hammurabi Act affirmed the division of society into full and partial.  They responded differently for the same crimes.  The state used slave labor, and the dependent person was completely subordinate to the will of his master.  However, the slave could have his own farm, family, and even enter into civil law transactions.  The Hammurabi law contributed to the formation of the institution of private property, but it also regulated civil and family relations, heredity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the laws of the Babylonian king Hammurabi" class="if" height="432" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/305156.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The criminal policy of the Babylonian state was also interesting.  Hammurabi wanted to eradicate evil, he fought against criminals, atheists and villains.  His laws called for retribution, for punishment, which was equal to the damage done.  The principle, ‚Äúeye for eye, tooth for tooth,‚Äù which is later found in the Bible, came from here.  In addition, intimidation, a system of fines and a public court were used as a relic of the tribal system, and mitigating circumstances were taken into account. </p><p>  Although the lawyer Hammurabi has been used for a rather short time, his influence on the development of the <span>legal culture of the</span> world is invaluable. </p>
