Ilios Hotel (Halkidiki, Crete) - photos, prices and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Greece is one of the most amazing countries where they sacredly keep their great past, live brightly and beautifully in the present and carefully take care of the future.  Every corner of this land is beautiful, from Halkidiki in the north to Crete in the south.  And everywhere the tourism business is well developed.  Hotels in Greece for every taste, from simple, cheap ‚Äúkopecks‚Äù to chic, but expensive ‚Äúfours‚Äù and ‚Äúfives‚Äù.  Three-star hotels occupy an intermediate position.  The prices are quite affordable, the service and living conditions are at a fairly high level.  That is why hotels with 3 stars are so popular. Ilios Hotel, which will be discussed in this article, is translated from Greek as ‚Äúsunny‚Äù.  The beautiful name is fully consistent with the atmosphere of kindness and light that guests feel there.  The only caveat - in Greece there are three hotels with the same name: in Crete, in Halkidiki and in Kos. </p><h2>  Halkidiki: how to get there </h2><p>  Greek Mr. Halkidiki is very easy to find on the map, because it looks like a trident located in the north-eastern region of the country and directed from land to the <span>Aegean Sea.</span>  There is even a myth that Poseidon was angry with the titans Athos and Seaton, who quarreled over the mermaid. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="3 Ilios Hotel" class="if" height="289" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/478842.jpg" width="433"></div>  He threw his trident in them and split the earth.  There was one peninsula in that place, it became 3. Ilios Hotel is located on Kassandra in the village of Kriopigi, whose name literally means "very cold key", in the sense of a spring.  The other two are Athos and Sithonia.  Thessaloniki is 90 km from the village of Kriopigi, and 10 km less to the international airport.  Air traffic between Russia and Greece is well established.  Wim Avia and Aegean Airlines fly to Thessaloniki.  Flights are both direct and with transfers in some European countries.  There are also flights from Ukraine operated by Aerosvit.  From the airport, the hotel can be reached by bus or taxi.

One of them is new, the second is a bit older.  Also on the territory there is a spacious pool with sunbeds and umbrellas around, a bar, a restaurant, free WI-FI, free parking and a small but amazingly beautiful garden with evergreen trees and shrubs. </p><p>  The staff at Ilios Hotel Kriopigi 3 (Halkidiki) is a family: Vagelis husband, Denis wife, their son Yorgos, a couple of maids, a gardener and a cook.  They all try very hard to please every guest, always friendly, always ready to solve any problem.  They don‚Äôt speak Russian, but speak English fluently.  The village of Kriopigi is located on a picturesque hill.  Hotel Ilios is also located on a hill, which can be somewhat inconvenient for vacationers who find it difficult to overcome the ups and downs.  Room price per night varies depending on the season, but averages 40-50 euros. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2>

    <p>  The 3-star Ilios Hotel is a so-called studio hotel, which means that the rooms have a small kitchen with a set of dishes and electric stoves.  This is convenient for families with children, because you can always cook for your baby, there are a lot of grocery stores near the hotel.  True, in the old kitchen building there is not everywhere, which must be checked with a tour operator.  But each room has a balcony or terrace with the necessary set of plastic furniture.  The view from the windows is unusually picturesque.  It opens either to the garden or to the sea and surroundings.  Each room at Ilios Hotel Kriopigi 3 stars is equipped with a refrigerator, safe, TV, hairdryer, toilet, wash basin and shower.  Cleaning is done every day, linen and towels are changed every three days. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Most tourists buy tours to Ilios Hotel Kriopigi 3 on a half-board basis, which includes breakfast and dinner, or only breakfast.  A tour is cheaper without dinner, but this option in this case is not entirely convenient for those who are not going to rent a car.  The hotel is located on a hillside, so every day after dinner in the village you will either have to climb or walk by taxi or take a taxi.  Half Board is preferred.  Breakfast at the hotel is held according to the European buffet system.  Their menu is constant, but all products are fresh and of high quality.  Tourists are offered: granola, cereal, milk, cheese, sausage (ham), scrambled eggs or boiled eggs, butter, jam, honey, coffee, tea, juice.  Dinners are held at the restaurant.  The chef at the hotel is a master of his craft, so all the dishes are amazing to taste.  The menu includes meat, fish, vegetable dishes of Greek and European cuisines, salads.  On the side dish - pasta, rice or french fries.  Plus, the chef treats himself to an ouzo.  Lunch can be ordered at the hotel's restaurant throughout the day. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  The beach is about a 10-15 minute leisurely walk downhill from Ilios Hotel 3. Halkidiki is considered the most environmentally friendly resort in the country.  Here all year round the eye is pleased with the abundance of greenery, and pine trees descend from the hills almost to the sea itself.  The beaches of Kriopigi are no exception.  In a narrow strip, they stretch along the coast for several kilometers, on one side framed by a forest, and on the other, caressed by sea waves.  There is almost no wind here, and the sun does not cause trouble, since in the afternoon hours a pleasant shade falls on the beach. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Sunset in the sea is good here, the bottom is sandy with small pebbles.  Sun beds and umbrellas are always available.  As such, there are no hotels on the first line in Kriopigi, only a small campsite.  Toilets and changing cabins are his property, but other tourists are also allowed to use them.  Pine trees bordering the beach give vacationers a delightful aroma, and birds in the branches of trees entertain with cheerful twittering.  On the beach, you can really relax not only with your body, but also with your soul, completely forgetting about all worldly problems.  And up the hill there is a cozy tavern with an open terrace, sitting on which with a cup of coffee it is pleasant to admire the sea views.  You can go down to the beach not only on foot, but also on the small train that leaves from the Kriopigi Beach Hotel. </p><h2>  Hersonissos: how to get there </h2><p>  The second Ilios Hotel 3 stars is located on the island of Crete in the center of the wonderful town of Hersonissos, on the lands of the ancient Minoans.  It is about 25 km from the capital city of Heraklion, where the airport and the large seaport are located.

    <h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  Ilios Hotel 3 (Hersonissos) offers 73 standard rooms for 1, 2 or 3 people.  There are balconies starting from the second floor.  The rooms overlooking the road are very noisy.  The rooms are quite spacious in size (up to 18 sq. M.), The design is modest.  The furniture in them is the most necessary, but solid.  The bathroom has a toilet, washbasin and shower.  Of the equipment presented TV, refrigerator, telephone, internet, hairdryer.  Tourists staying here leave about the same reviews about the rooms.  Ilios Hotel 3 evokes the most pleasant emotions, as the rooms are always clean and tidy.  Cleaning and linen change is carried out daily, the view from the windows (2nd floor and above) is fantastic, but there are also complaints.  A big minus is a paid air conditioning (7 euros per day) or a fan (3 euros).  The rooms, especially on the sunny side, are very hot, and not everyone has the opportunity to pay such money daily.  The second minus is a short curtain in the shower, which is why after bathing on the floor there is always a lot of water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ilios Hotel 3 Halkidiki" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/478812.jpg" width="362"></div>
