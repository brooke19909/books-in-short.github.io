Sberbank details for transfer to the card</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Most owners of bank cards from Sberbank and other banking institutions do not even suspect that their plastic card, which they use daily, has their own bank account.  Of course, if you use the card only for everyday payments when purchasing various goods and services, then you do not need to know this information, since you do not need to enter it anywhere.  But in some cases, when you need to receive a money transfer to a card, the sender may require you to give the full details of Sberbank for transfer to the card. </p>

    <p>  Then the client is faced with the need to find out the <span>personal account of</span> his card.  Money will come precisely to this account, since it is not always possible to transfer funds directly from card to card, and if money needs to be received from any enterprise, then it is simply impossible to do so.  Customers involuntarily have a question about how to transfer money to a Sberbank card.  Bank card details can be found in several ways, which will be discussed in more detail below. </p><h2>  Before you clarify! </h2><p>  Before resorting to any way to clarify the details of the card, see if the operation that you decide to perform requires additional information about your card.  For example, if you need to <span>transfer money</span> from your card to a Sberbank card of another person, then for this you only need the number of the latter.  A similar operation can be performed through an ATM, Internet banking system or a mobile bank. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  If you use MasterCard MoneySend and Visa Money Transfer systems for a money transfer, then it will be enough to indicate the number of the plastic card here.  In fact, the <span>details of a bank</span> card can be considered the exact address of the card account, with which all banking operations are performed.  They include the following information: </p><ul><li>  full name of the banking institution; </li><li>  Bank TIN number; </li><li>  BIC; </li><li>  PPC number of a banking institution; </li><li>  bank correspondent account; </li><li>  plastic card number (indicated on the front side); </li><li>  <span>personal account</span> number <span>(account</span> to which the card is linked); </li><li>  Sberbank branch number, which is indicated on the card. </li></ul><h2>  Method 1. In the banking service agreement </h2><p>  Any relations with a banking institution are fixed by the contract, and issuing a bank card is no exception.  If you still have the agreement on card support issued by Sberbank, you can find the details for transferring to the card in it. </p><p>  If the employer issued the debit card to you as part of the <span>salary project,</span> you will receive an envelope with it, which will contain information about the personal account assigned to the card and the PIN code. </p><h2>  Method 2. Call the hotline </h2><p>  Sberbank details for transferring money to a card can be clarified by calling the bank's contact center.  During the conversation with the operator, you will need to give your full name, date of birth and the code word that you set when concluding the contract for receiving the card.  If you do not remember the code word, then you will be asked to dictate the passport data. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition, if you have information about the card number and the structural unit of Sberbank where the card was issued, this will significantly speed up the process of obtaining the necessary information.  When recording details under the dictation of the operator, you need to be extremely careful.  If you make a mistake by at least one digit, the money may go to another client of the bank or return back to the sender minus the commission of Sberbank. </p>

    <h2>  Method 3. Visit the office </h2><p>  You can get the necessary information by coming directly to Sberbank.  Bank details will be printed to you by the bank employees.  This is considered the most reliable way to clarify information. </p><p>  But what should you do if you forget in which Sberbank office you received a plastic card?  Or if you are geographically located in another region of Russia, but do you need a translation now?  Unfortunately, not every branch of Sberbank of Russia OJSC will be able to give details for payment related to your card.  This is due to the unusual structure of the bank.  It consists of several territorial banks, which in turn are divided into regional branches.  And specialists working in a particular department own the information within their unit.  Therefore, in such cases, we recommend using the services of the bank's call center or in other ways, which will be described below. </p>

    <h2>  Method 4. Via ATM or self-service terminals </h2><p>  Now Sberbank details for transfer to the card allows you to print through an ATM or information and payment terminals.  A personal account will also be indicated on the check. </p><p>  The process of obtaining details in this way is very simple - insert the card into the ATM, find the ‚ÄúRegional payments‚Äù section, then select ‚ÄúInformation‚Äù, then ‚ÄúPrint card details‚Äù. </p><h2>  Method 5. Through the system of "Internet banking" </h2><p>  This is also a very fast and reliable way to find out the details of Sberbank for transferring to a card.  But it assumes access to the Internet.  To connect to the Sberbank Online system, you can contact the system itself or register in it through an ATM. </p><p>  So, how can I use the Internet banking system to find out the details of accounts for transferring Sberbank payments?  First you need to log in by entering your username and password.  Next, we need the ‚ÄúMaps‚Äù section, where we find the ‚ÄúMap Information‚Äù tab.  There will be all the necessary information.  We press only the "Print" button - and the details are in your hands. </p><p>  But it is worth noting that in this way it is sometimes not possible to find out the card account.  You will ask why?  What are the reasons: </p><ul><li>  if the card is a credit card, then Sberbank does not provide such information on it; </li><li>  in order for the card information to be displayed in the system, you must have a banking agreement with Sberbank, so if the card was received from the employer as part of a salary project, the field where the account should be indicated will be empty. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank details for transfer to the card" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32473/779080.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Method 6. On the official website </h2><p>  All necessary bank details can be found on the official website of Sberbank OJSC.  Details for transferring to the card can be found by clicking on the link "About the Bank", then we are interested in the tab "Information about the bank", there you will find the details of the bank branch in which the card was received. </p>
