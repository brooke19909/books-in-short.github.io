Well, we will begin, as usual, with a short introduction, which will make it clear what is the history of the origin of the device, as well as what positioning it has in the international arena of mobile phones. </p><h2>  Introduction </h2><p>  <span>Lenovo Vibe X2</span> (reviews about it can be found different) was developed as a continuation of the first model under the name, respectively, Vibe X. The same, in turn, is nothing short of an improved hit K900.  It should be noted that both of these smartphones liked a wide audience.  The K900 became famous for its exceptionally metal case, while the second became affordable due to its low price.  Indeed, you must admit that now it is very difficult to find a device on the smartphone market that will stand out against its competitors with Full HD resolution and at the same time cost less than ten thousand rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Lenovo Vibe <span>X2 LTE:</span> reviews and specifications </h2><p>  The smartphone supports work in the GSM bands, as well as UMTS.  As mentioned earlier, the LTE module is integrated into the device, allowing the exchange of a wide variety of information through the fourth generation cellular network.  Access to the international network is ensured through the use of 3 and 4G standards, and EDGE and GPRS may also be involved.

    <h2>  Display </h2><p>  The matrix of the screen is made using IPS technology.  What does this mean?  This type of matrix provides fairly good viewing angles without significant loss of color reproduction.  Since we are talking about this parameter, we note that the phone displays up to 16 million shades and colors on the screen.  The diagonal of the display is five inches with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels.  This means that the picture on the screen is displayed in Full HD quality.  The capacitive touch screen supports the processing of several simultaneous touches due to the presence and operation of the ‚ÄúMulti-touch‚Äù function. </p>

    <h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  The resolution of the main module is thirteen megapixels.  In this case, the size of images and photographs taken on it will be 4128 x 3096 pixels.  Built-in auto focus function on the subject.  A little away from the lens is a flash of the LED type, which makes it possible to use the camera in low light conditions and even in its complete absence. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Video recording is carried out in Full HD quality, that is, the resolution will be 1920 x 1080 pixels.  The frame rate will be equal to thirty frames per second.  There is a front camera, which produces, by the way, not the worst pictures.  But it is understandable, what could one expect from a module equipped with five megapixels?  Good selfies, and more!  By the way, the camera of the Lenovo Vibe X2 Gold looks very nice, the reviews only confirm this. </p>

In this volume, you can place photos and pictures, video clips and films, as well as audio recordings and electronic books.  In general, everything that the owner of the smartphone only wishes.  The volume of ‚ÄúRAM‚Äù is 2048 megabytes.  Let's not forget that a certain percentage from there (as well as from long-term memory) is taken by the operating system.  Nevertheless, this is more than enough to ensure smooth operation of the OS and software.  And in multitasking mode, we are unlikely to encounter friezes and lags. </p>

    <h2>  Multimedia </h2><p>  Opportunities in this area should not particularly surprise the Internet audience.  In principle, the feature set is standard for a smartphone.  There is, as you might guess, an audio and video player, as well as an analog radio.  To use it, you will need to use a wired headset or <span>computer headphones.</span>  Thus, these accessories will act as an antenna.  A 3.5 mm standard jack is provided for connection.  Ringtones are set ringtones, songs and ringtones in MP3 format. </p><h2>  Operating system and SIM cards </h2><p>  The device has an OS of the Android family.  Its version is 4.4 KitKat.  By the way, the Lenovo Vibe X2 White phone looks very nice.  You can find reviews about the device (regardless of its color) in our review today, at the end of the article itself.  You can put only one SIM card in the device, which must be processed in advance according to the MicroSIM standard. </p><h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  The Lenovo Vibe X2 Gold LTE, reviews of which focus on the attractive appearance of the device, as well as in devices of a different color, have the same lithium-ion type battery.  It is designed for a capacity of 2300 milliamps per hour.  The Chinese manufacturer assures its potential customers that the battery will withstand at least 20 hours of continuous talking.  At the same time, battery life in fourth-generation networks will be only 11.5 hours. </p><h2>  Dimensions </h2><p>  The device is presented in the classic candy bar form factor.  In <span>three-</span> dimensional <span>space, the</span> dimensions of the smartphone are 140.2 (in height), 68.6 (in width), and also 7.27 (in thickness) millimeters.  At the same time, the mass of the smartphone does not exceed 120 grams.  Good performance.  You could even say that they are good enough. </p><h2>  Lenovo Vibe X2 smartphone: customer reviews </h2><p>  What can tell us the reviews of the owners of this phone model?  The first thing to note is the quality of signal reception and transmission.  It is rather evaluated positively than neutral.  Suddenly, the cellular network does not disappear, as for the wireless module.  Wi-Fi is powerful enough that it cannot but please.  Slightly above average the volume of the main speaker.  There is a certain volume margin, which again can be written down in the advantages of the device.  If the melody is chosen successfully, then together with the vibrating alert it will not allow you to miss a single voice call.  Even in a fairly noisy environment. </p><p>  Now the cost of the device is in the range of seventeen thousand rubles.  It's not so small, but the smartphone offers us strong hardware, good performance and a cool design!  A definite plus is the presence of an LTE module.  He is not at all superfluous, but only fully complements the existing picture. </p><p>  Perhaps the only significant drawback is that the smartphone does not have a slot for installing an external drive.  However, thirty-two gigabytes are enough for almost every user, no matter how demanding. </p>
