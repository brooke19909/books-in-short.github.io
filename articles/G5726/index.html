Small phones with buttons have long been replaced by multimedia smartphones with the function of detecting their device in case of loss or theft.

One of them is the <span>Samsung Galaxy S5.</span>  Customer reviews about him are not always unambiguous. </p>

    <h2>  <strong>The main differences in the Galaxy</strong> <strong>S</strong> <strong>5 and S5 Mini</strong> </h2><p>  If we compare the <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> S5 and Samsung Galaxy S5 mini, the review will show the following: despite the fact that the second model inherited the main characteristics from the flagship, the sizes of these devices remain the biggest difference.  Looking at these two devices, we see absolutely identical cases, a back cover in a hole, the same colors.  But the <span>Samsung Galaxy S5 mini has</span> a 0.6-inch smaller screen. </p>

    <h2>  Advantages of Samsung Galaxy </h2><p>  For some people, however, this phone is a better choice than its outdated version.  Many people prefer this device mainly because the Samsung Galaxy S5 has only positive feedback about the size, unlike other modifications (5.1-inch display diagonal). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is very conveniently located in the palm of your hand.  The device can be worn as you like.  Problems with placing it in trousers or handbags also do not arise. </p><p>  This is a compact phone with excellent performance and sufficient battery life.  In addition, it is quite comfortable to use Internet services and typing. </p><p>  Conducting a further review of the Samsung Galaxy S5, it should be noted that it is reliably protected from dust and water: the bottom end well covers important connectors.  He proved the water resistance inherited from the flagship Samsung S4, showed excellent results at a depth of one meter.  The device under water not only did not leak, but also successfully continued to work.  The creators of the phone achieved this result by equipping the back cover of the device with inconspicuous rubber inserts.  But to conduct such experiments with the phone yourself is not worth it. </p><p>  The functions located on the sides of the panels are also very convenient: screen unlock, light sensor, etc. </p>

    <p>  Needless to say, the clarity of the screen if the manufacturers of the Samsung Galaxy S5 model improved the fingerprint scanner.  This function works simply with a bang, and the large sizes only added convenience to the phone unlock.  Thus, reading can now be done with one hand and right on the go, with just one Houm button. </p><p>  Galaxy desktop pleasantly surprised with a new interface.  With its help, it has become much more convenient to manage widgets, folders and other applications. <br>  A separate screen also appeared, in the literal translation ‚ÄúMy Journal‚Äù.  It is convenient in that here you can download not only information from any sources, but also notifications.  Unlike other telephone modifications, such a feature of the Samsung Galaxy S5 model has only enthusiastic reviews, since there is no need to constantly dial the address of any site. </p><h2>  Energy Saving and Battery </h2><p>  The phone has a Li-Ion battery, a capacity of 2800 mAh.  As for the energy-saving mode, it allows you to use the phone for almost two days, while actively using calls and Internet services.  Therefore, "Samsung Galaxy S5" reviews on this occasion gathered very comforting. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  An undoubted advantage in the S5 piggy bank is that in the settings there are two additional energy saving modes, and for them the quick start button is even displayed.  One of them is a mode in which the background work of applications is limited and only gray colors of the screen are turned on. </p>

    <p>  When you enable this feature, you can use the phone to the full, even watch the video, but it will be in gray.  Thus, the device will last 10% of the battery for another 2 hours with active use. </p><p>  The second mode is the maximum limit on energy consumption, it turns on on a 15% battery and also activates a gray color.  But this function limits almost everything on your phone: communications, lists of running applications and all background processes.  You can only call and send SMS, but with it, the phone will last a whole day. </p><p>  In view of these energy-saving features, we can confidently say that such a step was an excellent solution to problems with saving battery power of the Samsung Galaxy S5.  Reviews about energy saving still remain mixed.  There is only one reason: when the battery charge remains about 10%, the ‚Äúsophisticated‚Äù flagship turns into a regular mobile phone. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  What about a modern phone without a camera?  In this unit, it is 8 megapixel with LED flash and auto focus.  But there is nothing more to say here, the camera as a camera, with good photo quality for the device. </p>

    <h2>  A little about the performance of the Galaxy S5 </h2><p>  The Samsung Galaxy S5 16 GB performance, of course, higher than that of the smaller brother, but the Galaxy S5 with a RAM of 1.5 GB based on a quad-core processor with a frequency of 1.4 GHz - this difference is almost not felt, especially if you need a phone for work.  With all this, you can equip your S5 with a 64 GB memory card. </p><h2>  Communicative opportunities </h2><p>  The Samsung Galaxy S5 includes support for Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, S Beam, Wi-Fi Direct, a USB connection, and even an infrared port.  Consider each of these pleasures separately: </p><ul><li>  Bluetooth 4.0  When transferring files from your device to others, Wi-Fi technology is connected to the ‚Äúbluetooth‚Äù, the creators of the phone thus achieved a file transfer speed of about 12 Mbit / s. </li></ul><p>  It should also be noted that Bluetooth supports a large number of profiles: Headset, Handsfree, Serial Port, Dial Up Networking, etc., and also there are no problems when connecting headsets. </p><ul><li>  USB connection USB version 3 with a connection speed of approximately 50 Mb / s.  Also, when you connect the phone using the cord to the computer, the device starts charging. </li></ul><p>  Also, as the Samsung Galaxy S5 reviews say, one of the advantages is that the phone can be connected to the TV using an HDMI cable by inserting it into the USB port on the phone. </p><ul><li>  Wi-Fi adheres to the 802.11 standard.  Wi-Fi is also endowed with the ability to remember and automatically connect to already known networks, and also contains the ability to connect to a router with just one touch. </li></ul><p>  This phone also has additional functions, for example, a connection setup wizard, which starts working with weak or completely disappearing signals. </p><ul><li>  Wi-Fi Direct is essentially a protocol for replacing the Bluetooth feature.  To use this mode, you need to select the Wi-Fi Direct section in the Wi-Fi settings, and the phone will begin to search for nearby devices.  When you activate a connection with the device found, you can view and transfer files located on it. </li><li>  S Beam - This innovative technology is designed to quickly transfer large files.  With it, you can transfer a file of several GB in just a couple of minutes. </li><li>  Infrared port - this old man serves to communicate with and control various household appliances.  It is automatically configured and works with almost any equipment that has such a function. </li></ul><h2>  Software Features </h2><p>  There is nothing much to say in this section, just look at the Galaxy S5, a review of which will show that it is completely copied in the software from its previous counterpart.  Even the programs and features of the Android platform version 4.4.2 themselves are an exact copy of the Samsung Galaxy S5 16Gb. </p>

    <h2>  <strong>Customer reviews</strong> </h2><p>  <span>Samsung Galaxy S5</span> customer <span>reviews</span> , mainly collected only positive.  A powerful argument in his favor is also compactness: 142 x 72.5-8.1 mm. </p><p>  The difference in weight with the previous analogue is as much as 25 grams more, but this can not be called a problem, since, in principle, the phone remained quite light. </p><p>  The quality of communication, ringer volume and vibration sensitivity of the Samsung Galaxy S5 model, as well as other models produced by the company, at an excellent level, is difficult to surprise here.  As for the ringer volume and vibration sensitivity, here is also more than attractive. </p><p>  The high cost of the device sometimes causes the indignation of potential customers, so there are negative reviews from Samsung Galaxy S5.  The price of it is about 19,990 rubles.  But what did you want - new devices, especially of such quality, cannot be cheap. </p><p>  If these are lightweight options, they are sold at a discount of up to 30% and have an absolutely identical case and design with their original model, somewhat simplified features, but all the utilities, including the zest, are preserved. </p><p>  In general, the phone turned out to be very, very good, which is confirmed by the Samsung Galaxy S5 user reviews that leave no doubt about the company's product.  In addition, such a model will be extremely convenient for lovers of small phones, combining all the strengths of the flagship. </p>
