Some of them are so small that they are missing on many maps.  However, it is interesting to find out such facts about the capital as the shortest and longest, narrowest and widest, oldest and newest streets. </p><h2>  Venetsianova street </h2><p>  Today it is undoubtedly the shortest <span>street in Moscow.</span>  It is located in the village of Sokol in the <span>Northern Administrative District,</span> and its length is only 48 meters.  There are only 2 private houses on this street, so it can be called the shortest street in terms of the number of houses. </p>

    <p>  Since the Falcon was built as a <span>village of artists,</span> the streets got their names by the names of famous Russian painters.  So, our heroine received the name of A.G. Venetsianov and is adjacent to the streets named after Surikov and Levitan.  Initially, in the 20s of the last century, this street was an isthmus between neighboring longer ones, and had a small park.  But in 1937 the artist A. M. Gerasimov built his house in his place.  This building disconnected the passage and made the street deadlock, shortening it more than twice.  It is noteworthy that during the years of World War II it was here that the line of defensive fortifications ran. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  We also note the fact that Venetsianova Street is not only the shortest street in Moscow, it ranks fourth among the shortest streets in the whole world.  By the way, in third place is 40 meter Sibstroiput street in Novosibirsk.  The first two positions of this peculiar rating outside the streets in the cities of Scotland and England. </p><h2>  Lazy </h2><p>  This street is a little longer than the previous one, totals 160 meters.  But until 1920 she had no competitors, and today many local historians, not recognizing Venetsianov as a full-fledged street, believe that the shortest street in Moscow is Lenivka.  It got its name from the nearby Lazy Torzh.  But he got his name due to the fact that the trade was conducted not from the shelves, but directly from the carts.  True, there is also the Lenivka River, currently flowing through an underground collector.  Perhaps because of her the street got its name. </p>

    <p>  Today, this shortest street in Moscow is a quiet place with expensive and prestigious housing.  It is located between Volkhonka and the <span>Kremlin embankment.</span>  In several buildings are located today‚Äôs fashionable barbershop, mini-hotel, gallery, a couple of cafes and shops. </p><h2>  Prokudinsky Lane </h2><p>  If we take into account not only streets, but also other topographic objects, then among the lanes there are competitors to Lenivka.  This, for example, Prokudinsky Lane in the Presnensky <span>district of Moscow.</span>  Until the 19th century, he was Nameless, but later received the name of the landlord Prokudin. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Today, only 100 residential buildings with administrative premises are located at 100 meters of the alley; these are shops, hairdressers and small offices. </p><h2>  Lubok Lane </h2><p>  Another contender is the 58-meter Lubochny Lane.  We can say that this is the shortest street in Moscow in the center with urban development. </p>

    <p>  It is located not far from the Novokuznetskaya metro station between Bolotnaya street and Sadovnicheskaya embankment, at the same time between the Small Moskvoretsky bridge and the bridge called Chugunny.  Once upon a time there was also a floating bridge, the moving parts of which were interconnected by ropes made of bast, that is, bast ropes.  This gave the lane the name Lubochny. </p><p>  By the way, by the number of houses this lane can be considered a leader - it has only one building.  At Lubochny Lane, 2, is a 6-storey administrative building. </p><h2>  Daev Lane </h2><p>  It can hardly be called the shortest in the literal sense of the word (after all, the length of the alley is as much as half a kilometer), but we can assume that this is the shortest street in Moscow by name.  It has only 4 letters, while other streets of Moscow have names of at least 5 letters. </p>

    <p>  Daev Lane is located in the Central District between Sretenka and Sakharov Avenue.  Over its long history, Lane has repeatedly changed the names given to it in honor of prominent figures of one time or another.  The modern name was given to him by the landlord and a major official of the 19th century, Peter Daev. </p><p>  Knowing such unusual facts as the shortest street in Moscow, you can always show off erudition or extraordinary information that is interesting in any company. </p>
