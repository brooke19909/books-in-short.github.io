  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make light music at home</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Light music from a garland is bright, effective, beautiful and fashionable.  Such home-made decoration can be applied anywhere.  It can be the highlight of your holiday, especially parties at a disco, it doesn‚Äôt matter, at home or in a bar.  And on the rear window of the car, such a decoration will look amazing.  This article provides guidance on how to independently make light music from a Christmas garland without any special costs. </p><p>  Now it‚Äôs very popular to do it yourself.  A thing done on your own will cost much less than a thing bought in a store, since you only purchase supplies.  Moreover, in addition to saving money, you get a unique thing that you will proudly show to family and friends </p><h2>  Light Music Scheme </h2><p>  It is difficult, but possible, to assemble a unique design with your own hands. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ledno.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="light music scheme" class="if uuid-2358935" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64377/2358935.jpg"></div><p>  The figure shows a diagram of how to make light music with your own hands.  The circuit works with three different lights.  The power of the spotlights can reach up to 100 watts.  Guided by this scheme, you can easily assemble the installation. </p><p>  Consider the main thing in this scheme.  The main input is used to connect directly to the amplifier.  To make a connection, remove one of the speaker wires and connect the wire from the light music.  You can also connect in parallel without disconnecting the wires from the speaker. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  With this connection, the maximum effect is achieved: the LEDs will work in the same beat as the music.  At the same time, the VT1 or VL1 lamp will blink on the HF, and the other two, respectively, on the MF and LF. </p><p>  Tip.  In order for the lamps or spotlights to work with maximum heat and not to burn the thyristors, the mains voltage is regulated using diodes.  It is they who convert the value of the voltage from alternating to pulsating.  If after reading the article you have a burning desire to make light music, we recommend that you read first several books on electrophysics, because thanks to the knowledge about electricity, you can make the most of electronic components. </p><p>  Here you can use a transformer from a single-program radio point. </p><p>  Tip.  For further actions, prepare an insulated casing in advance and be careful because the parts may be energized. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.telegraph.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself light music" class="if uuid-2358925" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64377/2358925.jpg"></div><p>  As bulbs, you can use Christmas tree garlands fastened with electrical tape. </p><p>  Then, using an adapter, we connect the bulbs to the car radio.  Instead of a wire, take a twisted pair of shielded cable, because it is completely protected from interference. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Build homemade light music </h2><p>  Getting to the assembly. </p><ol><li>  Take a few Christmas garlands.  They should be no longer than 1-2 meters. </li><li>  Prepare a special twisted-pair Internet cable. </li><li>  Use wires to connect the adapter to the LEDs. </li><li>  We turn on the audio player, and already in it we find the ‚Äúflash zone‚Äù function, which is responsible for setting up the light music. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.idjnow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself music" class="if uuid-2358927" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64377/2358927.jpg"></div><p>  Note.  Some car radios have the ability to connect to the Internet.  If you have one, download any of the player applications, for example, ALMP2 or KMPlayer.  It remains to launch the player, and it will convert the frequency spectrum of the music track into an array of data.  By the way, if you are wondering how to make light music, but your budget is more than one thousand rubles, then we recommend purchasing various single-board computers, thanks to which everything can be implemented at the program level. </p><p>  Let's see how it works.  The array is processed and sent via a USB port to a twisted pair cable.  The impulses of the music track pass through the channels to the garlands, and they begin to flash.  Done, enjoy the LED light music. </p><p>  Still light-music installation can be done using plexiglass, which has clear advantages.  With its low weight, it has good light transmission, and this is exactly what we need. </p><h2>  Essential Light Music Components </h2><p>  Like another electronic device, light music also consists of many components that, when combined, form an electronic target, and by opening and closing some elements, we control the entire process of flashing LEDs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.telegraph.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself light music" class="if uuid-2358930" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64377/2358930.jpg"></div><p>  For our project we will need the following electronic components: </p><ol><li>  Powered by a 12 volt adapter, or a Krona battery. </li><li>  Any wire, preferably thin and copper. </li><li>  You also need a transistor, for example, KT817. </li><li>  Glue gun. </li><li>  LEDs, if there is RBG, then it is better to use them. </li><li>  Solid factory glass. </li><li>  Fine sandpaper for polishing. </li><li>  Electric wire. </li></ol><p>  Execution algorithm. </p><p>  Let's start with the box.  Mark up his scheme on paper. </p><p>  Instructions for creating records: </p><ol><li>  We transfer the picture to plexiglass and cut it out. </li><li>  We drill 2 holes in one of the plates (one of them will be intended for power supply, and the other for the headphone cable). </li><li>  Using fine skins, we gently matte plexiglass. </li><li>  In the same way we skin the lenses of LEDs. </li><li>  We fix the case using a glue gun. </li><li>  We assemble, as shown in this diagram. </li><li>  We pass our prepared wire into the hole drilled from the back. </li><li>  We insert the power connector there and fix it with a glue gun. </li></ol><p>  The foundation is ready.  You can make such boxes as many as you like.  Now you need to connect our pre-prepared bulbs.  It turned out beautifully, and most importantly - the lights blink merrily to the beat of the music. </p><h2>  Beginner Tip </h2><p>  If you are wondering how to make light music from an old garland, then note that the garland itself is connected to a 220 volt network, and this is the voltage with which it is quite possible to kill an adult, not to mention a schoolboy.  Follow all safety precautions, namely: </p><ol><li>  Do not touch the <span>bare wires</span> connected to the network. </li><li>  Watch the integrity of the wire, if this is a problem, it is better to spend the extra 100 rubles and buy a high-quality wire. </li><li>  When working with transistors, thyristors, capacitors, be careful in use, because if they are connected to a larger current than expected, then the explosion of the element is inevitable. </li></ol><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  We hope that you found the article useful on how to make light music, because it is from such pleasant trifles that our life consists.  We also recommend delving into the topic of programming, since in the modern world many needlework projects use various microcontrollers that can simplify the process of creating and setting up several hundred times. </p>
