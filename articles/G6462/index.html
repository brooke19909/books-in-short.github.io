    <p>  In the summer, the city hosts an interesting festival dedicated to the work of William Shakespeare.  At this time, the most interesting and unusual classical theater productions are staged here, many professional groups from around the world gather. </p><h2>  Night life </h2><p>  The city has an abundance of nightclubs and an exciting nightlife.  Clubs and pubs are places where you can have a wonderful time in your free time and have a wonderful rest. </p><h2>  Kitchen </h2><p>  The British have always revered the traditions that have been formed over the centuries.  This is especially true for food.  Remembering the <span>traditional English</span> cuisine, one can not help but talk about sweet and unsweetened puddings served with meat dishes or as a dessert.  The most favorite among the British is Christmas pudding.  It is made on the basis of a mixture of such interesting ingredients as lard, bread crumbs, flour, raisins, sugar, eggs and with the indispensable addition of various spices.  Before serving, this pudding is completely watered with rum, ignited and set on a table blazing. </p><p>  Almost all popular types of meat are present in the dishes of England: beef, veal, lamb, pork.  Perhaps this is the only country where the roasted bull thigh was elevated to the rank of food of aristocrats.  The method of its preparation is also curious: the meat is baked whole with blood, or steaks are made from it and fried in a skillet.  Usually it is not fried until fully cooked.  Gravy, pickles, baked vegetables and a variety of sauces are served with meat dishes.  Distributed in the country is a rather unusual mint sauce, which is a well-brewed mixture of finely chopped sheets of mint, water, sugar and wine vinegar. </p><p>  Favorite traditional national <span>dishes of the English</span> people are roast beef and steak.  A real roast beef should be juicy and pink inside, and on top covered with a crisp.  Also famous here are dishes such as lamb leg, pork pies, kidney pate and tenderloin. </p><p>  Of seafood, English citizens prefer lobster and squid. </p><p>  Among drinks, tea has become very common.  Interestingly, each time period has its own tea variety and centuries-old tea drinking traditions.  Milk and various sweets are served with tea.  You can‚Äôt help but try the English pastries - biscuits, muffins and rolls with saffron. </p><h2>  Transport features </h2>
