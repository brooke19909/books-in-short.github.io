If so, then this article is for you.  Now we will tell you all the most important and interesting about this country. </p><p>  The kingdom of Morocco is spread in northwestern Africa, the photo of which you see in our article.  This is an eastern country with an ancient history and rich cultural heritage. </p><h2>  Features of Morocco, holidays, photo of beaches </h2><p>  Morocco is dominated by a constitutional monarchy.  The king and the bicameral parliament represent the legislature.  The official language is Arabic, but its dialects can be found in mountain settlements.  Nevertheless, French is sometimes heard on the streets of the cities, less often English and Spanish.  The state religion is Islam.  And only a small part of the population (about 1%) professes Judaism and Orthodoxy.  The local currency is Moroccan Dirham.  It cannot be converted and exported from the country. </p>

    <p>  The exchange of dirhams occurs only within the country with the help of banks and points located in hotels, some restaurants and airports.  The exchange rate is controlled by the state, so that its price is stable and the same in all countries.  In addition to cash, you can pay with credit cards or <span>American Express checks.</span>  And only private merchants prefer cash. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The geographical position of Morocco is very successful for tourism.  On the one hand, the state is washed by the waves of the Mediterranean Sea, on the other hand, by the waters of the Atlantic Ocean.  The southeastern border runs along <span>the Sahara desert.</span>  The only state with which Morocco has a common border is Algeria.  In the center of the country are three mountain systems - Antiatlas, Middle and High Atlas.  The largest rivers descend from their peaks - Cebu, Muluya, Umm al-Rbia and Tensift, which flow into the Mediterranean Sea and the <span>Atlantic Ocean.</span> </p><p>  Morocco, the photo of which you see in our article, is a real paradise for tourists.  The mild climate of the Mediterranean coast is perfect for beach lovers.  At the same time, the climate of the territory washed by the waters of the Atlantic Ocean is influenced by the cool masses that came from the north.  And yet, nothing stops fans of swimming.  Tourists who wish to ski can relax in the country's mountain resorts. </p><h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  If you want to visit Marroco (you have already seen photos of the country's beaches more than once), then you will need to find a hotel.  Now we‚Äôll talk about these local hotels.  There are many of them in the country.  For every taste and budget.  From two-star hotels to five-star hotels of large international chains.  Hotels with two or three stars are located about a kilometer from the beaches, four- and five-star - not far from the sea.  Some of them have their own beaches and are located almost on the shore.  In addition, each hotel has its own saltwater pool, spas and fitness centers.  Most often, hotels and hotels offer half board.  But if you wish, you can find all-inclusive service. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Small hotels in the country are divided into several types.  This riad is a small guest house, auberge is an inn and g√Ætesd'√©tape is a roadside inn or inn.  Riad and auberge are most often found in cities with historical sites.  These are old houses, converted into private hotels for several people.  G√Ætesd'√©tape - Inns for extreme tourists.  Most often found in the mountains.  These are small hotels with amenities and necessary equipment, and in the desert there are tent towns where there is electricity, a shower and a <span>field kitchen.</span>  Very often in small hotels, hot water is either absent or served in the room for a fee.  This should be considered for those who love the convenience of traveling. </p><h2>  Morocco Attractions </h2><p>  Photos of these amazing places fascinate foreign citizens.  If you decide to visit this country for the first time, then you, like most tourists, will have many questions. </p><p>  Having decided on the <span>type of vacation</span> and the hotel in Morocco, you can start viewing photos of attractions in order to choose places that are worth visiting. </p><p>  The capital of Morocco - Rabat - is a picturesque city, surrounded by greenery of parks and gardens, which contains amazing and rare plants from around the world.  History buffs simply need to visit the old Kasba Udaya fortress.  No less interesting will be excursions around the Shell fortress and its necropolis, the Royal Palace, a visit to the Hassan tower, the Church of the Resurrection of Christ, the Cathedral of St. Peter and the Mausoleum of Mohammed V. </p>

    <p>  There are many museums in the capital that will be interesting to both children and adults.  The Archaeological Museum of Antiquities and the National Museum of Crafts, Museums of Moroccan and Folk Art are an incomplete list of all the cultural sites of Rabat.  Nine kilometers from the capital is the National Zoo.  And on the opposite bank of the Bu-Regreg River lies the ancient city of Sale, where thousands of Muslim believers make pilgrimages. </p><h2>  Casablanca </h2><p>  The largest <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãin Morocco, the</span> photo of which you see in front of you, is considered to be Casablanca - the "sea capital".  Here is the main port and the business center of the country is located - many banks and offices of large international companies.  This city is full of contrasts.  Secular and vibrant nightlife get along well with the most ancient oriental traditions. </p>

    <p>  Buildings of banks and offices in the center and historical sites in Medina - the old district of the city.  Tourists are invited to visit the Shlekh Mosque, the Great <span>Mosque of Hassan II (the second</span> largest in the world), the Church of St. John, the Cathedral, the Habu Bazaar Quarter.  The city has two picturesque parks - Isesco and the Arab League.  The keen interest of tourists is the luxurious residence of the Pasha Mahakma du Pasha, which is located in the "new Medina".  Ruin lovers should visit the remains of the ancient city of Anfa.  And you can relax from excursions in the resort of Ain Diab, which is not far from Casablanca. </p><h2>  Marrakesh </h2><p>  This is one of the ancient cities of Morocco, a photo of which you have already seen more than once.  And without his visit, acquaintance with the country would be incomplete.  The city is located at the foot of the <span>Atlas Mountains,</span> and everything in it resembles a fairy tale from the book "A Thousand and One Nights."  The narrow streets loop between the houses and necessarily go to the central square - Jem al-Fna with the Koutoubia mosque. </p><p>  Wandering through the labyrinth of cramped alleys, tourists will surely meet many local sights with beautiful names on their way - Kasbah Mosque (Golden Apples Mosque), Bahia Palace ("Palace of the Beauty"), near which is the largest fountain of Marrakesh - Muasin, the ruins of El Badi Palace ("Incomparable").  And this is not all historical and cultural monuments.  It is worth visiting the Ben-Yusuf mosque and madrassah, the Yusuf bin Tashfin Museum, which founded the city, the tombs of the Saadi dynasty, the gates of Bab-Agvenau.  In memory of the beautiful city in the local markets, which are famous throughout the country, you can buy souvenirs and spices. </p>

    <p>  Do not ignore Fez and Meknes.  These are cities with a rich history.  Not far from them are preserved the ancient ruins of the city of Volubilis, built by the Romans.  In it you can see part of the Roman Capitol, the Forum, the basilica and the Arc de Triomphe, built in honor of the emperor Caracalla.  Surprisingly preserved baths and dwellings.  Of interest are the surviving parts of the "House of Orpheus" and the "House of Venus." </p><h2>  Agadir </h2><p>  If you look at the photo of Morocco, Agadir you can also see.  This is the best resort in the country, which is famous for its beaches with white sand and mild climate.  For tourists who want to enjoy the sand dunes of the largest Sahara desert in the world, jeep safari tours or exotic camel rides are organized. </p>
