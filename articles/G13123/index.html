Today, several residential complexes are being built in these areas, which are of interest to many potential buyers.  This, in principle, is not surprising, since the Devyatkino metro station is next to them, which is a definite plus.  In addition, despite the fact that the village is considered the territory of the Leningrad region, it is located literally on the border with St. Petersburg.  That is, in fact, this is already a metropolis in which apartments are sold at a lower, "provincial" cost.  What can not but rejoice in view of the high cost of the urban square meter. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lc greenland" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1294162.jpg"></div>

    <p>  One of these <span>residential complexes being</span> built in this region is the LCD GreenLandia (St. Petersburg). </p><h2>  About the developer </h2><p>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating LCD GreenLandia belongs to Setl City, which has a reputation in the real estate market not only as a reliable but also as an original developer.  Using the latest technologies and a creative approach in the design and construction process, SK creates a truly comfortable and modern living environment for the residents of St. Petersburg.  Setl City, being an active and reliable developer, currently develops more than six million square meters of housing in the metropolis and its environs.  Having in its assets a huge number of projects, the company delivers each object on time.  Due to the extremely high reputation of the developer, each potential client can be calm for the transparency of the transaction and the quality of the housing purchased. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lc greenland greenlandia" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1294165.jpg" width="600"></div>

In total, it is planned to develop more than 30 hectares of territory.  It is planned to build 17 multi-story buildings.  Since the project is large-scale, construction will be carried out in seven phases.  At present, 11 houses have been commissioned, in the second half of 2016 it is planned to commission several buildings of the sixth stage.  The end of construction is the end of 2017.  All work is carried out in strict accordance with the available schedule, there are no lags, the commissioned facilities were also commissioned on time. </p><h2>  About the complex </h2><p>  As already mentioned, it will include 17 different-story buildings, the facades of which are decorated in the style of street art.  The unusual approach to the appearance of the houses is quite in the style of the builder, which differs in this respect by its great originality.  The houses are located at a considerable distance from each other, which, as evidenced by the LCD GreenLandia reviews, is extremely popular with residents.  In total, it is planned to lease more than ten and a half thousand apartments.  You can purchase in a <span>residential complex</span> as small-sized studios and odnushki, as well as more spacious 2-3-room apartments.  Housing belongs to the comfort class.  Due to the sophistication of forms, originality of decoration and its high quality, this complex promises to become one of the most beautiful LCD areas. </p><p>  All the first floors of the houses will be given for commercial real estate. </p><h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  Vsevolozhsk district is considered one of the most prosperous in terms of environmental conditions.  There are no large industrial enterprises, but there are many forests and ponds.  Moreover, the construction is carried out on the territory of the former state farm, which was engaged only in agricultural activities.  So, there are practically no sources contributing to environmental pollution in this region.  In addition, the developer also plans to carry out massive work on landscaping the complex and landscaping nearby land, equipping it with park areas and places for recreation.  The plans even include the creation of an apple orchard, so that residents of Greenlandia residential complex will be able to enjoy clean air from the windows of their apartments without any problems. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lc greenland reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1294167.jpg" width="600"></div>

Only in already <span>handed over houses in</span> some places small shops work, and in some yards vegetable tents function.  In the near future, two gardens should be opened, which will be located on the first floors of the buildings.  The developer promises to put into operation along with the last house and the school building.  A medical center will also open here. </p><p>  In the meantime, residents of Greenlandia residential complex have to use the services of infrastructure facilities in the village of Murino, the metro Devyatkino and nearby, already commissioned and landscaped similar complexes.  In principle, the metro can be reached by car in 5 minutes, and next to it you can find supermarkets, shopping centers, pharmacies, and restaurants.  In Murino there is a garden and a school, there is a bathhouse, and there is a <span>sports complex.</span>  There are also enough shops, and quite large ones.  If necessary, you can go to Vsevolozhsk (20 minutes by bus). </p><h2>  Transport connection </h2><p>  The main plus of the transport infrastructure of the Greenlandia residential complex is the metro.  Minibuses and buses go to Devyatkino almost every 5 minutes, the journey takes about ten minutes, and the stop is next to the houses.  Murino has a bus station and a railway station.  Two hundred meters from the Greenlandia residential complex there is a roundabout exit, where you can drive to the city center within half an hour or drive to the Leningrad Region highways. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lc greenland prices" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1294170.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Floor plans </h2><p>  In Greenlandia residential complex, you can purchase both standard 1-2-3-room apartments, as well as studios and Euroformat living quarters.  In general, the choice of layouts is quite diverse.  Apartments vary both in size and in the arrangement of rooms.  All planning decisions differ in functionality and tremendous ergonomics.  In all studios, by the way, separate bathrooms are provided, which is considered a rather rare occurrence in apartments of this format.  In addition, they are all quite spacious.  The smallest living space of such a plan has an area of ‚Äã‚Äãat least 25 "squares".  All apartments have either a glazed loggia or a balcony.  There are living quarters with a spacious kitchen - more than 20 square meters, and so-called euro-apartments are also offered, in which the kitchen is combined with the dining room.  You can also purchase a three-ruble note, in which the guest room occupies about 20 "squares" of the total <span>living area.</span>  As for the latter, it averages from 25 to 80 squares. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lc greenland spb" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1294177.jpg"></div>

    <p>  All apartments are <span>fully finished.</span> </p><h2>  What will the owners find in the purchased accommodation? </h2><p>  What is suggested by the developer of apartments in Greenlandia residential complex?  The fact that every owner can celebrate a housewarming immediately after receiving the keys.  The premises are fully renovated.  All communications were conducted and connected, electricity, water, gas and heating meters were installed, the ceilings were painted and the walls were glued with light wallpaper.  The developer used a laminate as a floor covering.  Installed metal entrance and veneered interior doors.  The loggias are not only glazed, but also equipped with underfloor heating.  In the bathrooms and the kitchen on the floor and on the walls is ceramic tile. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lc greenland greenlandia reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1294180.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  LCD GreenLandia: apartment prices </h2><p>  So, how much will all this splendor cost?  We have already mentioned that housing belongs to the comfort class.  However, the houses are located outside of St. Petersburg, so they offer apartments not at the city, but at a more sparing regional cost.  Of course, you cannot call them absolutely accessible, nevertheless they are not transcendental either. </p><p>  So, for example, a studio will cost the buyer about 2,250,000 - 3,000,000 rubles.  For a one-room apartment will have to pay from three to four million.  A two-room apartment costs on average a little more than 4 million, but there are euro-format apartments, which will cost almost six million rubles.  For three rubles will have to pay from 5,200,000 to 6,650,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Opinion of tenants and potential buyers </h2><p>  What do the reviews of those who are already living in the complex or just considering it as an acceptable option for buying an apartment say about GreenLandia residential complex?  Opinions are different, but there is no particular negative.  People are not completely satisfied with the fact that there are no corresponding number of shops near the houses.  However, this is the fate of almost all new buildings.  Over time, everything will work out, after the construction is completed, commercial premises will be commissioned, in which pharmacies, bank branches, consumer services, and many other infrastructure facilities will be equipped. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lc greenland finish" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1294182.jpg" width="600"></div>

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <p></p>
    <p>  People also do not like the fact that the developer is not sufficiently concerned about the issue of security.  I would like to see tenants on duty around the clock on the streets of the quarter, but so far they have been offered only surveillance cameras at the porches.  Some people are surprised by the strange layout of two-bedroom apartments, which have small-sized rooms and are reminiscent of two in size.  However, there is nothing to be surprised at.  The developer company provided each potential client with the opportunity to choose, while taking into account the fact that for individuals it is more important not the area, but the number of rooms, albeit small ones.  So such apartments are in demand and find their buyer.  I would like to see tenants more schools in their quarter, and not one, as the company offers. </p><p>  But everything is literally delighted with the playgrounds equipped by the developer.  Spacious, equipped with all kinds of slides, swings, surprisingly beautiful, they are undoubtedly an ornament of all yards. </p><p>  No one has any complaints about the quality of the finish and the deadlines, everything is in order.  Pleases everyone and the proximity of the metro station.  As for housing prices, people consider them quite acceptable.  So, in general, GreenLandia residential complex is a worthy place to buy an apartment here. </p>
