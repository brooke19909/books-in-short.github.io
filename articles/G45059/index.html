    <p>  What does a hotel complex guest need?  Of course, a spacious room;  best of all - one bedroom.  It's nice when the furniture is new, and white furniture has a special charm.  It is also not bad when using a full set of working and modern household appliances, including satellite TV, air conditioning, a minibar, a telephone, a hairdryer, and using a safe are free, that is, included in the price of the tour.  It is such comfort that the hotel considered in this article offers its guests. <br>  It happens that a tourist moves into a room that he does not like for any of the objective or subjective criteria.  For example, I didn’t like the bathroom or I would like a more picturesque landscape to open from the windows.  In this case, immediately upon arrival it is better not to “endure and grieve”, spoiling the impression of a vacation, but immediately contact the administrator.  At Rainbow, they will always meet such requests. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Service </h2><p>  The hotel staff is responsive, kind and cheerful.  Every morning the hotel grounds are carefully cleaned.  Wi-Fi is fast and stable.  This hotel was lucky with the manager.  Hassan (his name is) has a special hotel education, speaks Russian.  You can contact him with requests.  He also organizes mini-festivities for the guests of the hotel. </p><p>  The hotel has a laundry, currency exchange.  There are tables for playing table tennis. </p><p>  Bonus Rainbow Castle 3 * is a good hotel complex for spa treatments with a Turkish bath, sauna.  Hotel guests highly appreciate the effectiveness of the healing massage course from the masseurs Marina and Ibrahim (they served the spa guests who signed up for them this year). </p><h2>  Children's Infrastructure </h2><p>  Perhaps the children's infrastructure is the main know-how that distinguishes the Rainbow Castle Hotel 3 * (Turkey) among other "triples".  The reviews indicate the conscientious work of children's animators. </p>

Generally speaking, from the hotel to the nearest Fantasy beach, go 5-7 minutes.  It is very suitable for bathing children.  Resorts can use a special underground passage with a ramp to go to it across the road. <br>  Based on the recommendations of colleagues who have already rested here, it is advisable for newly arrived beach people to visit the hotel hammam on the day of arrival.  Open pores and cleansed, refreshed skin will be more ready for the healing effects of the local climate.  Also, on the day of arrival (it’s not worth pulling), be sure to purchase a sunblock, they do not sell such an effective house.  In doing so, pay close attention to the SPF sun protection index.  It should be selected in the range of 50-70.

    <p>  The beaches in the vicinity of the city are all sandy, cleanly furnished, equipped with sunbeds and umbrellas.  Municipal beaches are always free, on public you should pay for a sun lounger and umbrella.  The west coast of the city is more crowded, more lively, and its beaches are more comfortable.  There are many restaurants, bars and cafes.  With them there are small paid private beaches, the entrance to which costs $ 2, however, having bought ice cream for the same price, the spa man rests on them for free. <br>  However, on the beaches of Side there is no surplus of holidaymakers, as in Kemer, therefore, Side's popularity has been growing recently. </p><p>  The east coast relative to the museum city is more relaxed.  Wild beaches are almost deserted.  The water is clear, the sand is clean, the entrance to the sea is smooth.  Rest here is calm, not for everybody. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Reading reviews of the Rainbow Castle Hotel 3 * (Side) hotel, you will find out the nuances and problems of Turkish catering in hotels.  Inflation, on the one hand, raises food prices;  and the high competition of hotels reduces the price of tours.  The crisis severely limited the menu of culinary technologists.  The restaurant cannot buy lobster, salmon, etc. for the funds received from the sale of economy tours. Therefore, the main dishes in Turkish treshki hotels are prepared mainly from chicken and turkey. A lot of the attractiveness of dishes for tourists depends on the art of the chef chef.  In this sense, the hotel complex under consideration was lucky.  It is surprising, for example, how many (and what!) Dishes he makes from chicken.  Unconditional hit and specialty is chicken with poppy seeds. </p>

At this time, prices for fur coats, leather, etc.  maximum and the buyer is quite difficult to negotiate a discount.  The fact is that these months account for the maximum vacation of Europeans. </p><p>  What Side stores are the most rated among buyers of economy tours?  Obviously, those where there is no need to bore tediously: what Turkey is so famous for.  Rainbow Castle Hotel 3 * is an excellent launching pad for shopping.  Its guests on the first position in the ranking of trade institutions identified the LC Waikiki shopping center, located 7 kilometers from Side, in the city of Manavgat. <br>  There the prices are fixed.  The first floor sells women's clothing and shoes, the second - male, the third - children's.  The goods are high-quality and inexpensive: the price of t-shirts - from 160 rubles., Sweaters and jeans - from 330 rubles.  Many women dream of purchasing original gold jewelry in Turkey.  A good choice is Cadaro Side Jewelery, located on Side Colonnade.  If you liked the product, call the director, because only he has the authority to determine the size of the discount. </p>

    <p>  On Ataturk Boulevard (Side) there is a good leather and fur store Side Leder.  You should bargain here.  In this case, sometimes it is possible to halve the price. </p><p>  To buy souvenirs, tourists visit the local eastern bazaar.  Here you can bargain plenty, because the original price offered is usually inflated by sellers in 2 -2.5 times. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Having a rest here once, as a rule, they wish to relax in the Rainbow Castle 3 * the next season.  Reviews about it indicate the real level of service 3+.  Advantageous location, good living conditions, tasty and healthy food, and, of course, the emerald-clean gentle Mediterranean Sea with comfortable sandy beaches.  The hotel is really good. </p><p>  However, it is characterized by the common problem of all hotels in Turkey: at the end of the holiday season, when the flow of tourists is poor and few people rest in the hotel, the range of their meals is objectively reduced in proportion to how the income of hotel complexes decreases. </p><p>  If you evaluate objectively, then the Rainbow 3 * hotel is a vivid example of the fact that there are still cases in the hotel business when the "troika" located in the heart of the resort looks preferable to the "five", which is out of the way.  This kind of review about the Rainbow Castle Hotel 3 * hotel in Turkey (Side) is not uncommon. </p>
