Although money is such a symbol in this city that sometimes it seems, it has its own currency, which is most valued by locals.  This currency is emotions. </p><p>  Residents of this city are able to receive emotions from various things.  You can easily get gastronomic ecstasy, as in a restaurant that is among the ten best restaurants in the world, where guests will be treated to a million incredible dishes or pour sake with pieces of gold, or in a local cafe with Lebanese cuisine, where they eat food hot to the madness.  Here you can ride a horse in the desert or ski in the artificially created city of snow and winter! </p><p>  But one thing in this city remains unchanged - it is the service and class of hotels.  The article selects the best 5 star Dubai hotels for tourists not with space earnings, but for those who love and know how to earn money. </p><h2>  Grosvenor House Hotel and Apartments </h2><p>  The brilliant twin towers are an instantly recognizable landmark of Dubai.  A 5 star hotel with a beach, which is a 5-minute walk, also within walking distance is a golf club, a shopping center and many restaurants. </p><p>  The hotel has 14 bars and restaurants, which have a huge variety of dishes.

This is perhaps the best 5-star hotel in Dubai proposed in this article.  The hotel is located on the island of Jumeirah Bay. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel is 158,000 square meters.  m. This is the first among the Bvlgari hotels in scale and in the presence of its own yacht club and marina.  The complex has both villas with a pool and apartments with views of the Persian Gulf.  A private beach, indoor and outdoor pools, a spa center, which is often mentioned in good guest reviews, a fitness center and a very stylish beauty salon, are also prepared for guests. </p><p>  Spacious rooms create the right mood while relaxing.  The room can comfortably accommodate both 2 and 3 guests.  King or 2 Queen Beds, optional.  Standard room from 54 square meters.  m </p><p>  There are 6 restaurants and cafes on site.

The charm of the hotel in its panoramic view of the bay of the island of <span>Palm Jumeirah</span> on the one hand and the extensive gardens that surround the resort on all sides, on the other. </p><p>  Water sports such as sailing, windsurfing or water skiing are popular on the beach. </p><p>  Very spacious rooms that are equipped with cutting edge technology and great design.  Each room is provided either with a personal courtyard or with a balcony on the sea, at the request of the guest.  The room has a king size bed and a chic marble bathroom. </p><p>  The hotel has 8 restaurants, where guests will be offered a varied and very tasty, world cuisine.  The main Celebrities restaurant offers guests upscale classic cuisine, as well as gourmets - Indian, Asian, local cuisine, dishes prepared by first-class chefs.  For a bite to eat, both the beach and the hotel will offer grilled dishes. </p><p>  The hotel offers additional services to its guests. </p><ul><li>  First-class or business-class travelers are provided with a free shuttle service to the hotel and airport. </li><li>  Guests can visit the nearby Atlantis Hotel Waterpark. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.oneandonlyresorts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dubai resort" class="if uuid-2541859" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85776/2541859.jpg"></div><h2>  Armani Hotel Dubai </h2><p>  The only hotel that is not on the first coastline, but I want to mention it, is the Armani Hotel.  It was located in the famous <span>Burj Khalifa tower</span> and occupied 11 floors there.  For those who want to shop, take a walk around the city or use a car, for such tourists this is a great option for living. </p><p>  The design of the hotel was completely designed by the Armani fashion house, refinement and style are felt even in the most insignificant, at first glance, details.  The rooms are quite spacious, the standard room is 70 m <sup>2</sup> with its own living room.  This is one of the largest standard rooms in hotels of this level.  King size bed, 40-inch TV, iPod docking station and coffee-friendly nuance - all rooms have a small private coffee machine.  The design was thought out by Giorgio Armani, so it is not surprising that not a single detail was missed. </p><p>  Armani Hotel has the opportunity to taste dishes from almost all corners of the globe.  First-class dishes from different countries.  This is traditional for the hotel dishes of Italy and the Mediterranean coast, and India, rich in culinary delights, will also delight guests and it will be possible to order dishes of Japan.  The hotel has 7 branded restaurants, the food is top notch. </p><div class="photo" data-original="shnick.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Armani Hotel Dubai" class="if uuid-2541991" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85776/2541991.jpg"></div><p>  I would like to hope that the proposed hotels will leave a lasting impression on you and make your stay as comfortable as possible.  Luxury is the calling card of the country, and the safe location there, a kind, is the key to success. </p>
