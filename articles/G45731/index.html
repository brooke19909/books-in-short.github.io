    <h2>  First battles at the front </h2><p>  Lavrinenkov, an instructor pilot, was at the height of the Battle of Stalingrad at the front.  In August 1942, he opened a combat account.  In the first month alone, Vladimir Dmitrievich shot down sixteen German planes.  In October 1942, he was transferred to the Odessa Ninth Fighter Guard Aviation Regiment of the eighth Southwestern Army.  He fought near Rostov-on-Don and Bataisk. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Front glory </h2><p>  In the ninth guards air regiment, Vladimir Dmitrievich received his personal call sign "Falcon."  And his plane was numbered by date of birth - "17".  In a short time, Sokol-17 became known at the front to everyone.  The second half of December 1942 was very tense.  Pilots flew almost every day, making several sorties per day. </p><h2>  Born in a shirt </h2><p>  On one of those December tense days, Vladimir Dmitrievich Lavrinenkov participated in the interception of German bombers.  There were four people in the group.  Vladimir Dmitrievich, seeing enemy planes, launched an attack.  His starboard side was touched by a turret line.  Most of the skin was opened.  His colleague Bondarenko finished off the enemy, and the follower, Budanov, covered and mentally supported Vladimir Dmitrievich until the landing.  Although it was almost impossible, still Lavrinenkov was able to land the plane.  Interestingly, Vladimir Dmitrievich was able to solve enemy tactics.  Basically, he came out of battle without damage and a winner.  Even when new planes arrived in the regiment, Lavrinenkov remained to fly on his ‚Äúveteran‚Äù. </p>

    <h2>  In captivity </h2><p>  In August 1943, by order of Major General Khryukin, fighter Lavrinenkov flew out with a group of pilots to intercept the German FW-189.  Vladimir Dmitrievich discovered an enemy scout and began his pursuit.  He touched the tail of the German tail.  As a result, both aircraft began to fall.  Lavrinenkova saved the parachute.  But he landed right in the hands of the enemy and was captured. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The escape </h2><p>  When he was captured, he did not have any documents with him and could not identify him.  But two factors played a cruel joke.  The first is a food certificate, where his last name was indicated.  And the second - the Germans had an album and newspaper clippings with photographs of Soviet pilots and their exploits.  So Lavrinenkov was declassified.  Unlocking was useless.  And he surrounded himself with a wall of deep silence.  The Germans sent Vladimir Dmitrievich for interrogation in Berlin. </p><p>  They drove him along with another prisoner, with whom they subsequently became very friendly.  The guards did not take their eyes off them, but when there was little to the end of the road, they relaxed somewhat.  This was used by Vladimir Dmitrievich with a friend.  They jumped out of the train, which was rushing at full speed.  They were chased, shot, but the bullets flew past.  They were able to hide. </p>

There they waited for the approach of the Red Army troops, simultaneously participating in all operations and battles.  In one of them, a friend died, with whom Lavrinenkov escaped.  For him it was a very heavy loss.  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe village of Khotsky, many Germans concentrated.  The partisans managed to defeat this "hornet's nest" and rescue the prisoners. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Return to heaven </h2><p>  After the partisan detachment, Vladimir Dmitrievich returned to the regiment.

    <h2>  Lavrinenkov as a leader </h2><p>  Vladimir Dmitrievich was very disciplined and organized.  Seldom retreated from his plans.  People never pulled in vain and did not bring nervousness to the work of the team.  This leadership style has borne fruit.  Work of any complexity was rhythmic, clear.  Thanks to good organization, people could calmly focus and achieve the best results. </p><p>  Vladimir Dmitrievich skillfully selected the staff, trusted them and did not take care of anyone.  I was always ready to take responsibility.  This gave subordinates confidence.  The war left its mark on many.  Including Vladimir Dmitrievich.  But even after the operation, he did not make any exceptions for himself.  He supervised the development of exercises, took part in them, traveled to training grounds and, together with the chiefs of staff and troops, conducted classes in a new form - air defense.  Modesty and career growth were surprisingly combined in Lavrinenkov.  He was so skillfully able to control himself that this rare ability grew into the art of leading thousands of troops. </p>
