    <p>  <strong>On North</strong> </p><p>  But if someone is seriously interested in the question of where the White Sea is, then it is best to go in search of it from the Yaroslavl station in Moscow.  This sea is not so big in size.  Of all the seas washing the territory of Russia, only Azov is smaller in area.  But in its significance for Russia it is by no means the last.  It would not be an exaggeration to say that Russian civilization began on its shores.  To this day, it has a certain spiritual dimension in the Russian national consciousness.  If a person is looking for something more in life than photographing himself, his beloved, against the backdrop of the internationally recognized tourist attractions of the warm seas, then he should go here, finding out where the White Sea is. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the white sea" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/233318.jpg" width="497"></div>  Russian history is still alive here.  It froze in the stone of ancient Orthodox monasteries and ancient examples of traditional wooden architecture.  Many of the works of ancient builders are staggering to this day, especially when it turns out that they were built without a single nail.  In the history of Russia, this region is also special because it never knew serfdom and the corresponding slave consciousness.  And the Mongol-Tatar invasion, these places also did not know.  In particular, this is also why Northern Russia is somewhat different from other Russia.  In general, there are so many reasons to find out where the White Sea is.

But only six of these islands became truly famous in Russian history, and then from the middle of the fifteenth century, when the first monks appeared on them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="islands of the white sea" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/233546.jpg" width="600"></div>  It was these ancient hermits that the first hermitages were founded.  Thanks to these people, the White Sea, where the Solovetsky Monastery is located, has become a kind of pilgrimage center for believers throughout the Orthodox world.  The complex of the Solovetsky Monastery was erected by the work of many generations of monks for several centuries.  But he gained his sad fame in the twentieth century, when the monastery was turned by the Bolsheviks into the first <span>concentration camp.</span>  The bloody <span>Stalinist repressions</span> began from here <span>,</span> and many Russian people found their death on the Solovetsky Islands.  But today the <span>Solovetsky Monastery has been</span> restored to its original status, many churches and historical buildings have been restored or are being restored.  <span>The Solovetsky Islands</span> are again a place where both Orthodox believers and ordinary tourists seek.
