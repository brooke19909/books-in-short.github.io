  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How All Inclusive Hotels Work</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Most often, the term "all inclusive" refers to <span>the food system</span> for vacationers, which the hotel provides them.  But this concept is much broader.  Usually on the territory of hotels there are many other "free" entertainment and services, the payment of which is already included in the price.  The most common and popular such system in Turkey, where all-inclusive hotels make up the majority of those located on the sea coast. </p><p>  This system is most convenient for tourists who spend most of their vacation on the hotel territory, and at the same time try to adhere to the regime without skipping breakfast, lunch and dinner.  When you go on an excursion, usually the cost of food and drinks is already included in the cost of the trip, but the assortment of food there will be much smaller than in your hotel.  Throughout the rest, all-inclusive hotels offer their customers three meals a day in the form of a self-service <span>buffet</span> , where everyone can choose their own dishes to their taste.  This system holds breakfast, lunch and dinner.  For tourists there are no restrictions on the amount of food, the only thing that is not allowed is to take food from the restaurant with you.  However, this is done to a greater extent in order to maintain the cleanliness of the rooms and hotel grounds. </p><p>  The food time is several hours and therefore do not be afraid that you may not be in time.  The amount of food is also sufficient to feed all visitors to the restaurant.  The range and variety of dishes on offer depends mainly on the category of <span>hotel.</span>  <span>Reviews of</span> all-inclusive <span>hotels</span> show that the best five-star hotels have several banquet tables with each meal change.  These tables are bursting with an abundance of food prepared for every taste according to various recipes.  Such hotels often spend days devoted to a particular cuisine, it can be <span>Turkish dishes,</span> I can be fish dishes or a huge <span>ice cream cake.</span>  But all these gastronomic delights do not replace, but go in addition to the usual assortment of food. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A good quality of food and a choice of dishes are presented even by inexpensive three-star all-inclusive hotels, and in five stars a real feast of the stomach comes with a meal.  If you follow your figure, then you will have a pretty hard time at the sight of all this abundance.  It will be necessary to overcome the temptation to try the offered goodies and sweets.  Separately, it is worth staying at the spirits.  Usually, when buying a voucher, everything included in the travel agency immediately warns that it is better to purchase them on the way to the duty-free shop, since local drinks are, to put it mildly, not the best quality.  Other drinks: water, juices, wine and beer, if they are not bottled from vending machines, are of quite decent quality. </p><p>  If you have a minibar in your room and you will drink the drinks in it, you will have to pay for them separately.  It is much better to bring the free drinks you need from a restaurant or bar yourself.  It should also be noted that some all-inclusive hotels set a time limit for free drinks, for example, after 11 or 12 pm you will have to pay.  If you purchased drinks not at the hotel, but in another place, then you need to take into account that some hotels may prohibit bringing them to the territory, so it is better to find out in advance.  The all-inclusive system will be inconvenient for tourists who are not going to spend the whole day at the hotel, but will only spend the night there.  In this case, it will be much more profitable to buy a tour in which only breakfast (minimum option) or breakfast and dinner is paid.  But keep in mind that with such methods of nutrition, drinks will always have to be paid separately.  However, you will no longer be attached to your hotel, but you can eat in any cafes and restaurants, the lack of which in resort places is not observed. </p>
