    <p>  The route was created after his death.  The trail is named after the great figure of medicine because he was one of the first to evaluate and talk about the healing effects of the lands of the Southern Coast of Crimea on human health.  The unique aromas of the needles of the local forests, clean mountain air have a powerful healing effect on the body. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The man here is healed not only by the body, but also by the soul.  And this is the key to a quick cure from many ailments.  S.P. Botkin was one of the first to preach healing by the power of the earth.  Today, thanks to him, everyone can feel the power that nature has. </p><h2>  General information </h2><p>  The Shtangeevskaya and Botkinsky trails, as well as the Taraktashskaya and Stavrikaiskaya roads are part of a series of recreational facilities (photo below) that are located in Yalta from its Ai-Petrinskaya part to the outskirts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Botkin trail route" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/1246057.jpg" width="333"></div>  They pass side by side or may even be a continuation of each other.

    <p>  The Botkin Trail is allotted part of the route, which lasts from Camping "Glade of Fairy Tales", which is located near the Yalta Zoo, to Uchan-Su Waterfall.  However, it only reaches Mount Stavri-Kaya.  This trail does not reach the waterfall.  Before him, the traveler passes already the Stangeevsky path.  This is one of the convenient routes.  Signs are placed along the road, there are benches for rest. </p><h2>  How to get to the start of the route? </h2><p>  Arriving in Yalta, you can get to the start of the route by bus or minibus.  Suitable are those that drive along the South Coast highway.  The Botkin Trail, the route of which begins with Glade of Tales, is located not far from here.  There is a stop of the same name. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  From Yalta there is transport on the upper road.  Buses coming to Miskhor, Simeiz, Alupka are suitable.  If you plan to go from the bus station in Yalta, you must choose bus 26 or 27. They also pass the Glade of fairy tales.  In the city from the cinema "Spartak" there is a direct minibus to camping at number 24. </p><p>  Coming out at the bus stop, you must pass the road, which passes at an acute angle from the highway.  She rises up to the Yalta Zoo.  You will need to walk about 500 m, and then you can see the turn on the left.  This road leads to the zoo. </p><p>  You must go straight without turning to the side.  After 400 m, a sign appears with the name of the trail.  Even if you pass it, then there will be an inscription that will direct travelers in the opposite direction. </p><h2>  A brief description of the first part of the route </h2><p>  The Botkin Trail in Yalta, the total length of which is 4.6 km, is conditionally divided into two stages.  In order not to get confused on the road, it is necessary to consider the schematic route of each part of the path.  This will help you understand where to go next, what lies ahead. </p><p>  In the first part of the path, the traveler should cross the bridge over the Ai-Dimitri brook.  Then the road will lead to a gorge called Burilla-Dere.  After half an hour of walking at an average pace, a person gets to the Lower Yauzlar waterfall.  Here you will need to cross the Yavluz River. </p><p>  After the bridge, turn left.  If you go right, you can get into the canyon.  Next begins the climb up.  Here you will meet another bridge.  This is Upper Yauzlar.  Between these two waterfalls there is a good observation deck.  It is located on Mount Stavri Kaya.  Both Yauzlars are the origins of Yavluz.  Next begins the second part of the path. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The second section of the trail </h2><p>  After the upper waterfall Yauzlar, the next stage of the journey begins.  It is heavier than the previous one.  A more steep climb in this place is characterized by the Botkin Trail.  How to get to it was discussed above.  But it is also necessary to study the features of the subsequent path. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Botkin trail in Crimea" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/1246058.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  From this moment the road leads to the rock of Stavri-Kaya.  There are two options for passing the route.  The first of them involves climbing a rocky serpentine.  This path is longer, but takes less power. </p><p>  If there is no desire to gradually climb up the winding path, you can go directly.  However, you should immediately prepare for the fact that you will need more strength.  The path leads to the observation deck.  A spring brook runs nearby. </p><p>  Next awaits the end point of the path.  The top of Stavri Kaya Mountain completes the Botkin Trail.  This is a schematic route.  All his beauty can not be described in words.  You need to see everything with your own eyes in order to feel all the surrounding beauty. </p><h2>  The beginning of the trail </h2><p>  The Botkin trail, the route of which begins near the camping "Glade of fairy tales", is waiting for its travelers.  Under the old gas pipes, two roads will be visible.  The left one leads to the trail, and the right one goes to the campsite.  The desired path will be asphalt.  This site is called the new Botkin path in the Crimea (photo is presented below). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Botkin Trail in Yalta" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/1246060.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  On the right, the traveler will see a high curb.  He goes into the fence separating the path from the campsite.  Next will be the gate.  They need to be left on a narrow path.  A little further there will be a plan of the area.  It shows all the routes passing here. </p><p>  Going further, you can see the railing and steps.  They descend to the bridge.  When travelers cross the ravine, they will take a few steps to the rock.  This is a pointer.  From it you need to turn right.  After that, the climb begins. </p><h2>  The healing qualities of the trail </h2><p>  The Botkin Trail (Crimea), the photo of which is presented below, passes through a coniferous forest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Botkin Trail Crimea photo" class="if" height="268" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/1246070.jpg" width="400"></div>  Fir cones are scattered on the road.  The air here is unusually clean, light.  I want to breathe deeply.

    <p>  This is a good prevention of upper respiratory tract diseases.  Air is enriched with negatively charged ions.  The smallest essential particles of oil that the needles give out give the atmosphere a wonderful smell. </p><p>  The forest releases phytoncides into the environment, which dramatically reduce the number of pathogenic microorganisms.  Inhaling the healing ether, a person cleanses his body from many pathogenic microbes and bacteria. </p><p>  It is simply necessary to go here to people suffering from chronic colds, inflammation of the upper respiratory tract.  Having followed the shady paths of this trail, on the stones of which lizards are warming, and various birds sing among the branches of the conifer, you can recharge with health, good mood for the whole year. </p><h2>  Continuing the way </h2><p>  After passing the first climb, the traveler can admire the beauties of the Yauzlar waterfall.  A bridge leads across the river.  He descends into the canyon.  Having passed Lower Yauzlar, travelers again rise up. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Botkin Trail photo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/1246072.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The Botkin path in Yalta on this stretch of the path has a gentle rise.  Having passed a little wide road, tourists can see the upper waterfall.  Having crossed a small bridge, it is necessary to prepare for the most difficult stage of the journey.  It leads to the rock of Stavri-Kai. </p><p>  This is a pretty steep climb up.  But the road in this place is well trodden.  In some places branches are visible.  These are road cuts.  But walking them, a traveler spends a lot of energy.  These tracks go up steeply.  Walking along the serpentine of a flatter path, you can save power. </p><p>  On the corners there are benches for rest.  The trail is well looked after.  There are no debris, branches or other objects that make it difficult to climb. </p><h2>  Mount Stavri Kaya </h2><p>  In twisting turns, the Botkin path in the Crimea in half an hour will lead to the top of the Stavri-Kaya mountain.  Translated, its name sounds like "Cross Rock".  It is interesting to look at the beauty of the southern coast of Crimea from it. </p><p>  The height of the mountain above sea level reaches 690 m. Its top is flat, has no fences.  Therefore, it‚Äôs better not to get to the edge.  The possibility of collapse is not excluded, because the rock is affected by wind and precipitation. </p><p>  The southern slope of Stavri-Kai is interesting for climbers.  He's almost completely sheer.  An ancient cave was discovered on this side.  She was visited by people in ancient times.  There are traces of their stay. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Botkin trail in Yalta" class="if" height="447" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/1246071.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The view from the cliff to the city, the sea, the forest and the mountains is fascinating.  This climb is worth the effort.  There will be many impressions of the view from the height of the mountain. </p><h2>  Legend of Stavri Kaya Mountain </h2><p>  There is one interesting legend about the rock of Stavri Kaya.  In ancient times, the strongest man named Taurus lived in these lands.  He alone could overcome the huge bears of the local forests. </p><p>  But once the hunter forgot his ax at home, and he had to fight the beast with his bare hands.  Having won, Taurus, however, was seriously wounded.  When he returned home, his strength was almost exhausted.  Taurus faded away every day.  Silently he went to the seashore and listened to how the beat of his heart was becoming more and more muffled. </p><p>  Taurus mother was seriously ill.  On her deathbed, she told her son that she would not die if he put a stone cross on the rock of Stavri-Kai.  Even in those days, the now-famous Botkin Trail was famous for its healing properties. </p><p>  Taurus did not want to fulfill the will of his mother, thinking that he was too weak for this matter.  Mother stroked his head and repeated her request.  Could not refuse her son.  He went up the mountain and in the morning at the top of it stood a stone cross. </p><p>  Returning home, Taurus did not find his mother alive, but felt that his strength returned to him after climbing the mountain.  So a wise woman helped her son regain health and power.  Now everyone can gain strength on the road. </p><h2>  Return trip </h2><p>  Having been on the rock of Stavri-Kaya, you need to choose the next path.  Here, if you stand with your back to the sea, you can see 3 trails.  To the right is the path by which the traveler came here.  This is the Botkin Trail.  You can return to its starting point on it.  However, there is a more interesting option. </p><p>  Ahead and left is the Stangeevsky trail.  She goes down to the beautiful Wuchang-Su waterfall.  The Stavrikai Trail is directly located.  This is the longest way among all.  But he will lead directly to Yalta. </p><p>  Running to the cliff along the Botkin trail can be reached in 3 hours.  If you walk, this time doubles.  Most often, travelers choose the Stangeevsky path.  It is unusually picturesque and much shorter than the Stavrikai road. </p><p>  Having reached the waterfall along the Stangeevskaya trail, you can climb a plateau.  The <span>Taraktash trail</span> leads here <span>.</span>  Tired travelers can go down to the restaurant at the waterfall and leave for Yalta from here. </p><p>  Whatever path was chosen further, the impressions of the path to them.  S.P. Botkin will leave a lot and will have a beneficial effect on well-being.  The earth and the unique local air heal the soul and body. </p><p>  Having considered the route that the Botkin Trail offers its visitors, you can set off on your own.  It will lead to new experiences and give good health, strength for the next year. </p>
