How to transfer money through Sberbank ATM?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the greatest banks in Russia and Europe is the Russian Sberbank.  This is a Russian commercial bank belonging to an international financial group.  The bank provides a large number of services.  It is universal.  In 2009, the share of Russian Sberbank in the private deposit market reached 50.5%.  Its debt portfolio contained more than 30% of all loans issued in the country.  The central office of the Russian Sberbank is located in Moscow. </p><h2>  New rules for receiving cash at ATMs </h2><p>  How much money can I withdraw at a <span>Sberbank ATM?</span>  Starting November 15, 2013, a new cash withdrawal provision is in force.  On average, the limit on receiving funds is reduced four times.  Each type of card has its own limit. </p><p>  If you own <span>Visa Electron</span> or Maestro cards, then ATMs will issue you no more than fifty thousand rubles per day.  By the way, with these cards it is not always possible to pay abroad and on the Internet.  And how much money can I withdraw at a Sberbank ATM from Visa Classic and MasterCard Standard cards?  You can get only eighty thousand a day and 2.5 million a month. </p>

    <p>  With the help of the new rules, Sberbank is trying to accustom its customers to cashless payments.  The custom to line up near the terminals on payday has remained for a long time.  People are used to standing in line for pay at the cash desk.  Almost all developed countries have a daily cash withdrawal limit.  This rule is also applied by other Russian banks.  But Sberbank has reduced the limit.  We now know how much money can be withdrawn from an Sberbank ATM: from fifty to eighty thousand a day.  According to experts, most banks can repeat a similar example. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to use an ATM? </h2><p>  Would you like to withdraw money from Sberbank ATM?  Someone already knows how to do this, but someone has never used such equipment.  It should be noted that ATM software may sometimes change.  Therefore, you only need to further understand the general principles of working with this unit.  In most cases, they are identical to the principles of a computer user.  The most important is formulated as follows: look with all your eyes!  That is, you need to carefully look at the terminal screen.  After all, instructions appear on it.  You must read them carefully.  That‚Äôs the whole secret! </p>

    <p>  So, how to withdraw money through an ATM?  First you need to learn how to insert a card.  The place where it is inserted, you can peep at customers standing in line in front of you.  As a rule, the card is kept with the magnetic stripe down.  If a chip is mounted in the card, in the form of a yellow square, then it should be in front. </p><h2>  Choosing a dialogue language and more </h2><p>  How to choose a dialogue language?  Look for the top line of SELECT LANGUAGE on the terminal screen.  You should pay attention to it.  This line translates as ‚ÄúLANGUAGE SELECTION‚Äù.  By clicking on the button located to the left of this phrase, you will select ‚ÄúRUSSIAN‚Äù language. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In order to check your account balance, you just need to find the inscription ‚ÄúBALANCE ON ACCOUNT‚Äù.  It is located on the right side. </p><p>  Now it's time to remember the PIN code, or the so-called password.  You should know that it is forbidden to disclose the password to unauthorized persons.  On the left of the screen, find the four XXX crosses.  Feel free to click on the number keys located below the monitor.  Only four secret numbers.  After you have dialed the numbers, press the ‚ÄúEnter‚Äù key.  You will see her on the right.  If before pressing this key you find that you entered the wrong code, click on the ‚ÄúRESET‚Äù button.  And type everything all over again, slowly and accurately. </p>

    <p>  Attention: if you enter the PIN code incorrectly three times, your card will be blocked!  The button on the left will display the rest of your funds on the screen, and using the button on the right you can print it. </p><h2>  Cash withdrawal </h2><p>  Getting cash is the most crucial moment.  Click on the top button located opposite the phrase "EXTRA CASH."  If the ATM does not give out money, you can click on ‚ÄúRETURN CARD‚Äù.  In the case of the issuance of banknotes, the following bills are offered: </p><ul><li>  100 rubles; </li><li>  <span>500 rubles</span> ; </li><li>  1000 rubles; </li><li>  2000 rubles; </li><li>  4000 rubles; </li><li>  5000 rubles. </li></ul><p>  Well, have you calculated how much money can be withdrawn from an Sberbank ATM?  Feel free to press the button.  But sometimes the ‚ÄúOTHER AMOUNT‚Äù button is required.  Now enter the required amount.  In case of incorrect entry, there is always a RESET button at hand.  Do not forget about her.  But if you want to withdraw from the account 226 rubles 44 kopecks, then this is unlikely to work out for you.  Firstly, the ATM does not issue coins, and secondly, you can only get an amount that is a multiple of one hundred rubles.  Next, the machine will prompt you again to enter the PIN code.  You already know how to do it. </p><p>  The phrase ‚ÄúTAKE YOUR CARD‚Äù will appear - take it away!  Then they will write ‚ÄúTAKE MONEY‚Äù - take it away immediately!  After that, the ATM will ask if you want to continue working.  If you wish, click ‚ÄúYES‚Äù.  If you do not wish, press "NO". </p><h2>  Some more valuable tips </h2><p>  When dialing a PIN code you can‚Äôt rush!  You are given only three attempts.  And if you have exhausted them, you can no longer use the card.  That's why sometimes you can not withdraw money from ATMs.  By the way, you can change the PIN code.  This is done through the terminal menu.  You just need to find the ‚ÄúCHANGE PIN CODE‚Äù department.  If it is not available, contact the bank branch. </p>

    <p>  Hurry to pick up your card when the terminal issues it.  It must be removed within 25 seconds, otherwise the ATM will hold the card.  And don't forget your check.  If there is a technical malfunction in the machine, contact the bank branch. </p><h2>  Other ATMs </h2><p>  And how to withdraw money from another ATM?  The terms of use here are not very diverse.  It is like a bicycle: if you know how to ride your own, then you can ride the neighbor.  In fact, with a card from one institution, you can withdraw cash through the terminal of another.  However, often you will be asked to pay an additional commission.  Its size is completely different.  Therefore, carefully read the inscriptions on the ATM screen. </p><h2>  How to transfer funds through the terminal? </h2><p>  Would you like to send money from one card to another?  You will need the account of the recipient.  Insert your card into the terminal slot and enter the PIN code.  Next, select the ‚ÄúMONEY TRANSFERS‚Äù service on the screen.  Reading the system hints, dial the card number to which you want to transfer funds, and the amount.  Now it remains to confirm the transaction and receive a check. </p>
