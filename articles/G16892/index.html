    <h2>  To whom to say thanks for the vacuum cleaner </h2><p>  Everyone knows that the Oriflame company sells robot vacuum cleaners of the 525707 series. But the aforementioned company is known as the largest distributor of cosmetics and some related products.  What does electrical engineering have to do with it?  Let's make it clear.  The fact is that Oriflame is the customer of this series of products.  That is, she does not produce them, but only buys and sells them.  Move on.  If you carefully study the labels on the packaging of the vacuum cleaner 525707, you can find out that this product is delivered to Oriflame, whose official office is located in Moscow, not directly from the manufacturer, but through another company called Trade Express LLC.  Its main office is located in the city of Pushkin, Leningrad Region.  Manufactures vacuum cleaners - 525707 series robots by Sharp Crown Development, located in China.  For 8 years, it has been exporting similar products to different countries of the world.  But the Sharp brand, as you know, is the largest Japanese corporation producing the most advanced electrical equipment, and vacuum cleaners are robots as well.  As a result, it turns out that Oriflame robot vacuum cleaners 525707, reviews of which are so enthusiastic, are made in China, but using Japanese technology.  In Russia, they are purchased by Trade Express LLC.  She resells them to Oriflame, and already further this technology falls into the hands of consumers.  Here is such a long journey that this intellectual unit takes before it takes refuge in your apartment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="robot vacuum cleaner Price" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/2168608.jpg"></div>

At the top there is a Start button.  While working in a circle, red and blue lights are lit.  The lid of the vacuum cleaner is opened by lightly pressing the special latch.

Two are basic and two are spare. </li><li>  Plastic panel. </li><li>  The container with the filter. </li><li>  Cleaning brush. </li><li>  Three rags. </li><li>  Charger. </li><li>  Base for recharging. </li><li>  Remote Control. </li><li>  User's manual. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="robot vacuum cleaner Oriflame" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/2168670.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  Principle of operation </h2><p>  The technical characteristics of the Oriflame 525707 robot vacuum cleaner are as follows: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Powered by a rechargeable battery, which makes it possible to move in any direction at any distance. </li><li>  Charges from the network. </li><li>  The duration of continuous operation is 50 minutes, provided that the battery is charged for at least 4 hours. </li><li>  It can ride straight, turn, follow in a circle, along obstacles, move along complex trajectories. </li></ul><h2>  Instruction manual </h2><p>  In their reviews, absolutely all respondents note that using this unit is extremely simple.  Instructions for the robot vacuum cleaner 525707 from "Oriflame" reports that you just need to turn it on.  Then the car will do everything herself.  Naturally, for it to work, its battery must be charged.  If you want the vacuum cleaner to clean both carpets and parquet, it is better not to install brushes.  With them, it works well only on smooth surfaces.  As you fill, you need to empty the container.  It is very simple to take out and install.  If necessary, it can be cleaned with a special brush, but if the garbage is dry, just shake it out. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="525707 robot vacuum cleaner Oriflame description" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/2168676.jpg"></div>

    <p>  To clean the floors from the bottom of the case, you need to fix the panel, and on it - the wet rag included in the kit.  But customers in their reviews report that the robot vacuum cleaner does not do very well with this function, since the rag does not hold well on the panel. </p><h2>  Operational Features </h2><p>  According to reviews, the Oriflame robot vacuum cleaner 525707 performs excellent cleaning of the apartment, if you do not take into account the small nuances.  So, due to its round shape, it does not collect garbage well in the corners of the room.  Under the furniture, this machine can only work if it has enough space there.  Another feature - the vacuum cleaner does not know how to overcome thresholds.  That is, from one room to another it needs to be transferred.  Buyers also note that although the unit belongs to the category of ‚Äúintelligent‚Äù, it does not know how to distinguish the nature of pollution, that is, it can easily drive through, for example, a sweet puddle from spilled compote and stretch it over the entire area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe room.  And the last: the included robot vacuum cleaner makes a noise that is standard for equipment for this purpose. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="525707 Robot vacuum cleaner Oriflame specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/2168555.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Prices </h2><p>  Above, we have already described what a long way the mechanism under consideration travels from the manufacturer to the final owner.  Despite the fact that different organizations become its owners during the movements, and each makes its own wrapping up, the price of the 525707 robot vacuum cleaner is quite affordable.  If you are not a representative of Oriflame, you can purchase this product for 6990 rubles.  If you work in a company, the price may decrease to a symbolic 300 rubles, and in some cases (as a promotion) a vacuum cleaner can be presented to you for free.  To get a discount, you need to be a member of the Oriflame company yourself, plus persuade another 12 people to become representatives.  If you at the same time gain 150 or more points every month from the sale of company goods, then you get a vacuum cleaner as a gift.  But even if you could not find those who want to join Oriflame, but you yourself became a member of the company, you get a discount of about 20%.  For you, a robot vacuum cleaner will cost 5700 rubles. </p><h2>  What are the guarantees for the Oriflame robot vacuum cleaner 525707 </h2><p>  Of course, having a robot at home, even in the guise of a small vacuum cleaner, is interesting, prestigious and to some extent beneficial.  Owners of such a car have more free time, since cleaning the apartment takes only a few minutes.  But how reliable is this wonderful technique?  Representatives of "Oriflame" assure that every person who paid money is guaranteed to receive their own vacuum cleaner.  They also assure that so far there have been no cases of its return or breakdowns.  If suddenly this happens within 1 year from the date of purchase, you need to contact the representative from whom the goods were purchased. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="525707 robot vacuum cleaner Oriflame instruction" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/2168693.jpg"></div>  But before that, it is advisable to try to figure out why the 525707 Oriflame robot vacuum cleaner stopped working.  Repair may not be difficult if your electronic assistant does not turn on or does not absorb dust for the following reasons:

    <ul><li>  They forgot to empty the container, and the garbage filled its entire volume. </li><li>  The battery is not charged. </li><li>  Sensors are clogged (dusty). </li><li>  Some guides broke (they are plastic, therefore not very durable).  In order for the vacuum cleaner to work again, they just need to be fastened with high-quality glue. </li></ul><h2>  DIY repair </h2><p>  Clogged sensors are the most difficult nuisance that you can fix yourself.  If the problem is in them, the robot vacuum cleaner will turn on, but will stop working correctly (it will start spinning in one place, for no reason to change the direction of movement).  No need to panic right away.  Try to disassemble the case (unscrew the screw with a screwdriver) and carefully clean the inside of your car with a normal vacuum cleaner. </p><p>  Theoretically, more serious problems can happen with a robot vacuum cleaner, for example, such: </p><ul><li>  Dust clogged with sensors in wheels (not in rollers). </li><li>  Breakage of teeth in plastic gears installed inside the housing. </li><li>  Battery failure. </li></ul><p>  If something like this happened, it is better to take the vacuum cleaner to a service center for the repair of electrical equipment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="525707 robot vacuum cleaner Oriflame repair" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/2168578.jpg"></div>
