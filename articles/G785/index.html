    <h2>  Parade in Moscow on November 7 </h2><p>  During the years of the Soviet Union, this date was considered festive, because on this day the next anniversary of the Great October Revolution was celebrated with great fanfare.  Among the celebrations, a special place was occupied by demonstrations of workers in all cities of the country and a military parade in Moscow. </p><p>  November 7th is no longer a day off.  However, since 2005, this date has been proclaimed the Day of Military Glory of Russia, in memory of the famous parade held on Red Square in 1941, from where military convoys went to the front to defend the capital in a deadly battle with the enemy. </p><p>  This year will mark the 75th anniversary of this event.  In memory of him, a parade will be held in Moscow in which, according to tradition, soldiers and officers in the uniform of the Second World War will take part.  Obviously, only a few lucky ones will be able to admire the solemn procession with their own eyes, directly on Red Square.  However, there are several places in the city where you can also look at military columns and passing vehicles.  The most convenient from this point of view are Tverskaya Street, Manezhnaya Square, Vasilyevsky Descent, <span>Borovitskaya Square,</span> Vozdvizhenka and Triumfalnaya Square.  In addition, you can remove for a couple of hours a balcony in the center of Moscow, for example, on Makhovaya.  As for fans of air shows, it is best to watch this part of the parade from the Sparrow Hills. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
