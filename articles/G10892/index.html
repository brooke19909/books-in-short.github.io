    <p>  The MTS tablet, the price of which is 1990 rubles, is <span>Irbis TX07.</span>  It has average performance compared to all modern gadgets.  Nevertheless, this device is really happy.  The screen size is 7 inches, and the screen size is 1024 by 600 pixels.  So watching videos on such a gadget is not very convenient, but working with the Internet and books is quite. </p><p>  The operating system is, according to users, outdated - Android 2.2.  But this does not prevent the device from working efficiently at such a low price.  RAM is only 512 MB, and built-in (for data) - 4 GB.  There is the ability to connect flash cards up to 32 GB.  For a student, for study, this is ideal.  So many parents and users who have already purchased Irbis think so.  As you can see, the MTS tablet for 1990 has received good specifications and reviews.  But this is only one model.  What about the rest of the offers? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Oysters </h2><p>  For example, about Oysters.  This manufacturer also participates in an action that allows you to purchase a tablet from MTS in just 1990. It is worth paying attention to a model called Oysters T74ER.  After all, many claim that this gadget is worthy of attention. </p>

    <p>  The thing is that you get the Android 4.4 KitKat operating system, a 7-inch screen, 512 MB of RAM, as well as 4 GB of internal space at a reduced price.  According to users, Oysters T74ER is perfect for those who prefer to work with a tablet rather than play on it.  There is a front camera of 0.3 megapixels.  If the MTS tablet, the price of which is only 1990 rubles, is endowed with these characteristics, then this is simply wonderful. </p><p>  Unlike Irbis, user opinions about the model are much better.  Most likely, this is due to the updated operating system.  The Oysters T74ER (MTS tablet for 1990) features and reviews in general demonstrates exactly the same as Irbis, but for some reason it seems that this particular tablet will be needed by the student.  Especially if you want the child to be able to work on the gadget and play.  So this model is also worthy of attention. </p><h2>  Supra </h2><p>  Another option that can be offered is the <span>Supra M741.</span>  This tablet also falls under the action of MTS.  And strangely enough, he is not much different from his predecessors. </p>

    <p>  All the same 7 inches diagonally, 512 MB of RAM, ‚Äúyour own‚Äù space of 4 GB, but you can insert a memory card up to 32 GB.  Capacitive touch screen, the ability to connect to Wi-Fi and 3G-networks, as well as the Android 4.4 KitKat operating system.  In principle, which model to choose is your decision. </p><p>  Users note that the Supra M741 (MTS tablet for 1990) has normal characteristics.  And the reviews are also encouraging.  As has been repeatedly noted, this device is better suited for games than for work.  A wonderful gift to a first grader from parents.  And there is no need to worry that the child will only play, but you can not think about how to entertain and organize the student‚Äôs leisure. </p><h2>  Device issues </h2><p>  Despite the fact that all the listed tablet models that participate in the promotion from MTS differ in creators, they are similar in their problems and characteristics.  And everyone has some not the best words about these devices. </p>

    <p>  For example, quite often, buyers complain that touch-screens fail on all promotional tablets for 1990 rubles.  That is, after some time they begin to junk.  Unpleasant, but you can fix the situation.  It is enough to carry out screen calibration once a month. </p><p>  Resolution and diagonal are also not very pleasing to everyone.  But overall, this is not such a problem.  Indeed, for the proposed price tag, you are unlikely to find something better.  Any MTS tablet for 1990 features and reviews shows similar.  In terms of quality, they are generally on top.  But the requests for tablets are different for everyone.  And therefore, do not complain about the small diagonal and resolution.  Remember that we are not dealing with gaming gadgets at all. </p><h2>  Surprise </h2><p>  Another point that should be considered before joining the action is that the purchased tablets will be equipped with the Sim Lock system.  What it is?  We can say this - gadgets will only work with SIM cards from MTS.  If you try to insert a card of another operator, then this will not give any result. </p><p>  So if you are not a supporter of MTS, it is better to think a few times whether it is worth participating.  Although the offers of this operator are usually attractive, nevertheless they do not suit some.  In case of doubt, it is better not to take risks and wait for this kind of shares from another organization. </p>
