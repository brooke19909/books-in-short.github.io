  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Slavic tribes as a single people</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The peoples inhabiting large areas of Central and Eastern Europe, Siberia, Central Asia, the <span>Balkan Peninsula,</span> speak languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat have similarities in sound composition and grammatical structure.  It is this similarity that is an important manifestation of their kinship. </p><p>  All these peoples are considered Slavic.  Depending on the language class, it is customary to distinguish 3 groups: East Slavic, West Slavic and South Slavic. </p><p>  To the East Slavic category it is customary to include Ukrainian, Belarusian and Russian languages. </p><p>  To the West Slavic - Macedonian, Bulgarian, Slovenian, Serbo-Croatian. </p><p>  To the West Slavic - Slovak, Czech, Polish, Upper and Lower Luzhitsky. </p><p>  All Slavic tribes had a linguistic similarity, so we can judge that in ancient times there was a single tribe or several large groups that gave rise to the Slavic nation. </p><p>  The first mention of a single settlement belongs to ancient writers (the first century AD).  However, <span>archaeological excavations</span> allow us to talk about more ancient people.  According to fossils, it can be judged that the Slavic tribes occupied the territory of Eastern Europe for many millennia BC.  However, for some reason, a single people had to look for new land to live in. </p><p>  The resettlement of the Slavic tribes occurred during the era of the "great migration of peoples."  This was mainly due to a change in the socio-economic conditions of life. </p><p>  During this period, a new tool for cultivating the land arose, so it became possible to cultivate the land as a separate family, and not as a whole community.  In addition, continuous population growth required the expansion of land for food production.  Frequent wars prompted Slavic tribes to seize new, cultivated and fertile lands.  Therefore, during the military victories, some of the united people remained in the occupied territory. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>East Slavic</span> tribes are the most numerous group of Slavs. </p><p>  These include: </p><p>  - Vyatichi.  Settled along the upper and middle reaches of the Oka.  It was this tribe that retained its identity longer than others.  For a long time they did not have princes, the public spirit was characterized by democracy and self-government; </p><p>  - Dregovici.  Settled between the <span>Western Dvina</span> and Pripyat.  The name comes from the word "Dregva", which means "marshland."  On the territory of this tribe the Turovo-Pinsk principality was formed; </p><p>  - Krivichi.  Settled along the banks of the Dnieper, Volga, Western Dvina.  The name comes from the word ‚Äúwing‚Äù, ie  "Blood related."  The center of this tribe was the city of Polotsk.  The last leader of the Krivichy was Rogvolod, who, along with his sons, was killed by Prince Vladimir of Novgorod.  After this incident, Vladimir married Rogvolod‚Äôs daughter, thereby uniting Novgorod and Polotsk; </p><p>  - Radimichi - a tribe that lived between the Desna and Dnieper rivers; </p><p>  - tivertsy.  They lived off the Black Sea coast between the Danube and the Dnieper.  Their main occupation was agriculture; </p><p>  - Croats.  We lived on the banks <span>of the San River.</span>  They were called white Croats.  Engaged in cattle breeding; </p><p>  - the villagers.  They occupied the territory of modern Krakow.  After the conquest of the glades were included in Poland; </p><p>  - Luzhchans.  They lived on the territory of Lower and Upper Puddle, on the territory of modern Germany.  Today, the Lusatian Serbs (descendants of the Ludic residents) are among the national minorities of the Federal Republic; </p><p>  - Slovenia.  They lived in the basin of <span>Lake Ilmen</span> and the Mologa currents.  Slovenia made up a significant part of the Novgorod population; </p><p>  - convictions.  They lived along the Southern Bug and the lower reaches of the Dnieper.  This tribe for a long time struggled for its independence with Kievan Rus, but was forced to join its structure. </p><p>  Thus, Slavic tribes are an important ethnic group, play a significant role in the history of Europe and the formation of modern states. </p>
