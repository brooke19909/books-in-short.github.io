They were created to take care of life, to improve personal and social life.  The Slavs made such dolls before important holidays, for example, on the <span>day of Ivan Kupal</span> or for seeing off Maslenitsa.  They were also a valuable gift for a wedding or the birth of a child.  Charm dolls accompanied our ancestors all their lives, from the cradle to the deathbed. </p><h2>  The meaning of amulets </h2><p>  The ancient Slavs did not have everything that fills our lives now.  They could not watch TV or go online, call someone and ask how they were doing.  They lived according to natural laws, obeying the cyclical flow. </p><p>  Agriculture played an important role in their lives, therefore, the climatic conditions were also important for them.  Seeing off the winter, the time of sowing the fields, gathering a new crop - for all these vital stages for our ancestors, special ceremonial dolls were created.  Each had its own purpose, its own meaning.  Some dolls were burnt, hoping to cleanse themselves, others were filled with cereals and displayed in a prominent place in the hut to bring wealth and abundance. </p><h2>  Why amulets do not have faces </h2><p>  Each such traditional chrysalis was faceless.  Usually needlewomen made a face simply out of a white rag.  So they sought to leave the object inanimate, so that unkind forces could not enter it.  The main purpose of such a talisman is to bring health, prosperity and joy to its owner. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Charm dolls were a real miracle: without arms and legs, without a marked face, created from just a few rags, they were still alive.  Each doll had its own character, it was diverse, could cry and laugh. </p>

    <p>  The ancient amulet doll was to become the protector of its master, save him from misfortunes and evil forces, protect him from illnesses.  The needlewomen made them without the use of needles and scissors.  It was impossible to cut pieces of fabric, it was only allowed to tear them.  From this, another name for the dolls is "rvanka". </p><h2>  Wedding </h2><p>  At all times, the wedding was a bright event that was remembered for a lifetime.  The energy of love of young people was fascinating and inspiring.  Our ancestors respected wedding ceremonies.  They had their own elements of jewelry, charms and traditions.  The Slavs made many dolls for this day.  All of them had their own significance and were made exclusively for the well-being of the future family. </p>

    <p>  The mother of the bride sewed a special doll - "Maternal blessing."  It was important to make this amulet secretly from the young.  When the wedding ceremony was going on, the parent took out a large doll made, to the hem of which two more small dolls were sewn: male and female figures.  These two dolls came off the large and passed on to a young family.  The newlyweds had to keep a gift so that their family had prosperity and childbearing.  <span>A large doll</span> remained in the parental home; it helped the mother survive the separation from her daughter. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Sometimes an ash doll was handed over to a young family.  She was considered a symbol of the family, multiplied and protected the offspring. </p><p>  Slavs cared about the well-being of the future family.  When the wedding train departed from the bride‚Äôs house to the groom‚Äôs house, where the young ones were supposed to live, two dolls were hung under the arm of a horse harness.  These were the fake bride and groom, which angry people looked at first.  Thus, unkind looks did not concern the young. </p>

    <p>  They used white, red and other bright flaps of fabric, scraps of multi-colored threads.  At the heart of the doll was either a thin sliver or a splinter.  Typically, the stick was no more than 1.5 cm wide and 25-30 cm long. Any tree other than aspen and alder was suitable.  Our ancestors believed that these trees are associated with evil spirits, so we tried to stay away from them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Value </h2><p>  ‚ÄúLovebirds‚Äù - a doll-amulet, symbolizing a strong union of young people.

    <p>  So, how to make a doll ‚ÄúLovebirds‚Äù with your own hands?  The following materials will be required: </p><ul><li>  a flap of tissue measuring 20 by 20 cm; </li><li>  filler (synthetic winterizer is suitable); </li><li>  spool of red thread. </li></ul><p>  It is important not to use sharp objects.  Therefore, no scissors and needles.  Everything is done by hand.  You can‚Äôt cut the fabric for the doll, just gently tear off the desired piece from the canvas.  Remember that you cannot cut the thread.  During the manufacture of the doll "Lovebirds", it must be continuous. </p><p>  Bend the flap horizontally.  Mentally divide the resulting rectangle into two squares.  You can use the iron and iron the bend to make it easier to find the middle. </p><h2>  First doll </h2><p>  Work must begin with the left square.  It makes the first doll - female.  There is an opinion that such traditions originated in the time of matriarchy.  You have the opportunity to do otherwise. </p><p>  Take a little filler and make a head-knot in the middle of the left square, wrap it with a thread.  Make sure there is enough fabric left to make your hand.  You can‚Äôt break the thread. </p><p>  At the next stage, you need to form a doll shape.  We start with the hand.  Thread the fabric from neck to palm, then go back.  Determine where the waist should be, and thread the skirt.  In the finished doll, the thread is crosswise fixed on the chest.  The woman is ready. </p><h2>  Second doll </h2><p>  Thread the common arm of the pupae.  The right square of the fabric has remained unused for now.  A male doll will be formed from it. </p><p>  We start with the head.  Take about the same amount of filler and form a head-knot, fasten everything with a thread.  A start.  The thread is crosswise fixed on the chest of a male doll. </p><p>  The next step is to form his legs.  Everything is done using the same thread.  When the legs are done, go back up and make a hand to this guy.  Wrap the remaining piece of fabric and return to the head. </p><p>  Before us are almost completed dolls "Lovebirds".  The thread must be brought to the middle of the common hand of the figures, then it should be cut off.  Be sure to leave a piece of thread long enough to make an eyelet out of it.  In the future, such a doll can be suspended.  She will guard family happiness. </p>
