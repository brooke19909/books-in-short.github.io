    <p>  The Karkam Combo 2 video recorder works through a fast AIT 8427D processor coupled with a responsive OmniVision 2710 series sensor. The gadget can record high-definition video in Full HD standard at 30 frames / sec.  Viewing angles are quite tolerable, diagonally 160 degrees.  If necessary, the device can be turned to the driver’s window. </p><p>  The detector built into the gadget will help to detect almost all known radars like Strelka, Cordon, Avtodoriya, I-Robot, etc. Let’s try to understand thoroughly what the Karkam Combo 2 video recorder is: reviews, prices, technical capabilities and expert opinions regarding the purchase and operation will be discussed below. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The device comes in an interesting, beautiful and fairly dense box.  It should be noted separately that “Karkama” is the only model that has such a dense packaging and excellent box design. </p>

    <p>  On the right side of the gadget are a microSD card slot, a reset button and a power button.  On the left side are connectors for connecting Karkam Combo 2 to a PC and power, and there is also an interface for a video cable.  At the top of the device is a groove for attaching the holder. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The gadget weighs about 100 grams with dimensions of 85 x 61 x 55 mm.  If you compare "Combo 2" with devices of past generations, it immediately becomes noticeable that the weight of the device has significantly decreased (from 185 to 100 g).  Owners of the DVR immediately appreciated this innovation in their reviews, noting that the lighter device is better held on the glass and is perfectly adjustable on the original bracket "Karkam Combo 2". </p><h2>  Customization </h2><p>  All work with the gadget occurs through a 2.4-inch screen through four function buttons that are located directly below it.  In order to get to the menu, you must press the button of the same name.  Here is the initial setup of the device along with the radar part.  The main menu is divided into six categories: “Radar”, “Video Recording”, “Images”, “Playback”, “Instrumentation” and “System Settings”. </p>

    <p>  Working with the menu should not cause any problems - everything is in Russian, without specific terms, you can always return to the default settings, especially since there is an instruction in the kit where everything is described in detail. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The only thing that has confused many users, judging by the numerous reviews, is the “Color” item in the radar settings menu, which is also found in the “Video Recording” section.  According to the user manual, this element is responsible for the saturation of the video gamut, and why it is duplicated in this way is not entirely clear. </p><p>  In the video recording mode, you can increase or decrease the speaker volume with the Up, Down, and OK buttons.  The microphone is also regulated there, the screen lock and access to files are configured.  You can change the value of exposure compensation exclusively through the main menu, alas, there are no specially provided keys for this. </p><p>  In the “Tools” section, you can get detailed information about the status of the SD card (how much space is occupied and free. Moreover, for each individual video format (Full HD, VGA, HD30, HD60) the approximate remaining memory time in hours is displayed. This additional function was positively appreciated by many users in their reviews. </p><h2>  Fixation </h2><p>  "Karkam Combo 2" is mounted on the windshield using a bracket, the mechanism of which is quite simple.  The main elements of the mounting mechanism: </p><ul><li>  swivel joint; </li><li>  gadget fastener for double-sided tape; </li><li>  vacuum suction cup for glass. </li></ul><p>  The swivel joint or assembly allows the remaining elements to be <span>fastened together</span> by means of a <span>bolted connection,</span> which is subsequently easily inserted into the groove located on the upper part of the device. </p>

    <p>  The hinge allows you to adjust the device, for example, you can direct the gadget's eye towards the driver’s glass, which is very convenient in certain situations. </p><p>  The gadget has different types of mounting on the car glass: using tape and a vacuum suction cup.  If the device is used stationary and you do not plan to remove it, then the best option would be to fix it on a <span>double-sided tape</span> with a bracket.  In the case when there is a frequent need to rearrange the DVR from place to place, for example, in another car, it is better to use the branded vacuum suction cup "Karkam Combo 2". </p><p>  The review showed that the presence of a variety of mounting mechanisms is a significant plus in the operation of the gadget, but many users complain about the swivel assembly, which must be twisted each time to change the bracket, and this is not always convenient. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Complete with "Karkam Combo 2" there is a convenient adapter that allows you to charge the device through a car cigarette lighter (operating voltage 12-24 V) giving a nominal value of 5 V and a power of 2 A. </p><p>  The adapter case is equipped with an LED that indicates a voltage supply, and a switch to open the power circuit is convenient when you need to stop charging without removing the adapter from the cigarette lighter. </p><h2>  GPS (GLONASS) </h2><p>  The Karkam Combo 2 DVR (firmware 0001.0000.1000 / Branch: 20150312) is equipped with a built-in GLONASS module.  The gadget catches the incoming signal quite quickly.  After the device is idle for about 12 hours, the response takes about one minute, and a “hot” start lasts no more than 15 seconds. </p>

    <p>  Thanks to the GLONASS receiver, the DVR is fully synchronized in time, the vehicle speed is recorded.  A specific stamp of vehicle speed is superimposed on the video.  Using the GPS module, the informer works, which, in turn, allows you to provide the owner with information from the databases of nearby speed cameras in advance. </p><h2>  Radar </h2><p>  Depending on the area where you are located, the radar can be specifically configured by selecting the "Track" or "City" mode.  Owner reviews of “Karkam Combo 2” note that switching these two functions is not very convenient, since this can only be done through the main menu, and I would really like to have separate buttons for frequently used modes. </p>

    <p>  Deep tuning of the radar part will help to change the sensitivity of the detector itself; for this, the values ​​“Low”, “Medium” and “High” are used.  It upsets the lack of the ability to maintain the sensitivity of the radar for a separate mode, because when you exit the track and return to the city, the detector needs to be reconfigured. </p><p>  During the tests, the detector proved to be very worthy, informing the driver in advance about approaching the <span>speed measurement</span> cameras and the radar of traffic police inspectors.  For example, the Strelka complex, widespread in our territory, was detected by Combo 2 at a distance of 1.2 kilometers. </p><h2>  Video quality </h2><p>  The gadget is equipped with a relatively powerful processor AIT 8427D and matrix OV2710.  As a result, the output is <span>AVI</span> video <span>files</span> with a resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels (Full HD).  The average video recording speed is 30 frames per second with a maximum bitrate of 14.8 Mbps. </p><p>  The duration of the video and fragments can be set independently with the following scatter: 1/3/5/10 minutes.  Loop recording is disabled, the file size in a standard format with a duration of one minute varies within 100 megabytes. </p><p>  On separate frames (freeze-frames) taken in the daytime, you can easily identify the numbers of passing cars, but you can’t see the small details and see a clear picture, alas.  Sometimes, at the time of the difference in lighting, there are noticeable gaps in the recording, but in general the overall picture is very good - without artifacts, third-party interference and any other noise. </p><p>  It is more difficult to identify the numbers of passing cars at night, but at a low speed it will not be difficult to read the information.  The overall quality of the shooting allows you to fully understand the current situation on the road and consider all the participants in the movement. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  The average price for a Karkam Combo 2 video recorder ranges from 9–11 thousand rubles.  The gadget is worth the money and will be a good helper on the road, especially since numerous reviews in a positive way confirm the quality and suitability of the device. </p>
