    <p>  It remains to make a huge bow with ears on the head, and we can assume that the mouse costume for the girl is made with her own hands. </p><p>  But you can create a mouse image differently.  For such a fancy dress, you will need a <span>gray dress</span> (you choose the style to your liking), tights, knee-high socks or socks, round mouse ears on the rim (or you can sew a special ‚Äúeared‚Äù hat) and, of course, you should draw a mustache, nose on the child‚Äôs face.  Makeup can successfully replace a half mask. </p><p>  If you are thinking of a mouse from the fairy tale "Terem-Teremok" or "Thumbelina", then it will be appropriate to put a beautiful apron on the dress on top and throw a bright shawl on your shoulders.  And the character from the fairy tale ‚ÄúTurnip‚Äù may even be in a tracksuit - it‚Äôs more convenient to help the ‚Äúowners‚Äù pull the root crop out. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Instructions for making skirts for the mouse Minnie Mouse </h2><p>  It may seem incredible to someone, but sometimes a modern girl does not have this item in her wardrobe.

    <p>  For sewing, a bright red or pink fabric, best with pea colors, is suitable. </p><ul><li>  For a skirt, a rectangle is cut with a width equal to the length of the product.  The long side of the rectangle can be arbitrary.  But the bigger it is, the more magnificent the skirt will be. </li><li>  Having folded the rectangle in half across the front part inward, they cut it together, turning it into a ring. </li><li>  One edge of this ring is cut so that the bottom of the product is not frizzy.  You can sew lace or a satin ribbon frill over it with a sewing seam. </li><li>  The other edge is also cut, but so that a drawstring for an elastic band or lace is obtained.  It is worth considering that you need to make a small hole in the line so that subsequently you can stretch an elastic band or lace inside the drawstring. </li></ul><h2>  Sundress for the suit "Gray mouse" </h2><p>  If mom is a jack of all trades, there is a reason to sew a luxurious outfit for a girl who decided to be a gray mouse at the celebration (not in the sense of imperceptible, but in the sense of the most elegant and attractive). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For such a suit, you need a velvet gray fabric (another, but fleecy, will do).  Sundress is made with a "two-story" frill.  Although you can make it a "three-story" - it depends on the mood and creative intent of the craftswoman. </p>

    <p>  The upper edge of the first frill in volume coincides with the size of the girl‚Äôs chest under the armpits.  A second frill is attached to its lower edge, which has already been pre-picked up with a hint for splendor. </p><p>  Wide straps are sewn to the upper edge of the resulting "two-story" skirt, on which a sundress will be held. </p><p>  Under this luxurious robe you can wear a beautiful blouse with magnificent sleeves.  For greater resemblance to the character, you can sew on the back a long and thin tail.  And, of course, it is worth taking care of the mask or ears for a cute mouse. </p><h2>  Gray Mouse Costume Shoes </h2><p>  Of course, you can completely do with ordinary sandals, white socks or plain tights.  But how beautiful the girl will look if her shoes hide under frills sewn to match the sundress fabric! </p><p>  Sew such ruffles in the same way as a skirt with an elastic band, only in miniature.  Put these "mini-skirts" on the ankles so that they cover up sandals or sneakers.  Believe me, a girl with such an attribute will look more presentable than in ordinary shoes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Ears for Minnie Mouse </h2><p>  The main part, which is part of the mouse costume for the girl, is a do-it-yourself rim on the head.  Ears are attached to it, between which there is a huge bow. </p>

    <p>  There are several options for this part. </p><ol><li>  You can replace the bow with a wreath of artificial flowers. </li><li>  Ears can be either black or a different color, you can take fabric even with polka dots. </li><li>  The presence of only one bow is allowed.  The lack of ears is understandable if the bow is black.  But the key point here is still their size. </li></ol><h2>  Instructions for the manufacture of protruding ears </h2><p>  Since making a mouse costume at home can be quite simple even without special skills, just picking out things that are suitable in color from the wardrobe, you should stop at one of the important accessories without which the outfit will not be finished.  These, of course, are ears!  Make them easy. </p><ul><li>  It is enough to cut out two circles from cardboard, which will correspond in size to the size of future ears. </li><li>  4 parts are cut from the fabric, which are equal to cardboard patterns with allowances for seams. </li><li>  Carefully tuck the edge of the fabric inward and fasten with a bast. </li><li>  On cardboard circles lay the details of the fabric with the sides facing out, take it. </li><li>  With a <span>machine seam</span> , ears are sewn along the edge.  You can even line over cardboard templates. </li><li>  The broom is removed. </li></ul><p>  The ears are ready.  They are attached to the rim or cap made of cloth with glue or thread. </p><h2>  Fabric hat for mouse </h2><p>  The baby will look charming if she does not wear a <span>headband with ears</span> on her head <span>,</span> but a sewn hat.  Such an attribute is more practical: the cap does not fly off, does not put pressure on the head.  Therefore, this option is best for little girls. </p><p>  The hat can be sewn without any patterns.  Simply measure the volume of the head and the height of the cap.  The head circumference should be divided into six and a wedge pattern should be constructed on the eye - each one from the drawing course probably remembers what the ball looks like. </p><p>  When cutting, make standard increases on the sides - 0.7 cm - and from the bottom 1.5 cm. Six identical parts are cut out - wedges. </p><p>  Ears can also be drawn by eye.  The ears are stitched first.  A cardboard is inserted into them.  When stitching wedges, the ears should be sewn in.  Of course, it is necessary to measure in such a way that they are arranged symmetrically. </p><p>  At the bottom, so that the cap does not fall off, an ordinary linen elastic can be sewn.  The edge itself must be hemmed.  But you can also attach ribbons that the child will tie under the chin. </p><h2>  Cardboard half mask </h2><p>  If there is very little time to prepare the costume, then you can go the easiest way.  In order to make a mouse costume for a girl with her own hands in the shortest possible time, it is enough to dress her in a beautiful dress and put a half mask on her head. </p>

    <p>  If with the choice of a dress the question is solved quickly enough, then a cardboard mask of a mouse is made and even faster.  The pattern given here is transferred to cardboard, cut with scissors.  In the side semicircles located between the cheeks and temples, holes are pierced, into which they then stretch a twine, tape or regular elastic. </p><h2>  Mouse mask made of wool or fabric </h2><p>  There is a creative option to create a masterpiece if the girl‚Äôs mother or grandmother is a skilled craftswoman who knows how to crochet.  After all, she can easily make a mask of wool.  It is enough to crochet a part according to the proposed cardboard model, and tie laces to it from the sides - this is the head of the original mouse mask! </p>

    <p>  And if you stick or sew a cloth with a pile on a cardboard template, then such an accessory cannot go unnoticed.  In this way, you can make not only <span>children's carnival costumes,</span> but also accessories for adult masquerades. </p><h2>  3D mouse mask for a girl </h2><p>  If you have enough time, you can conjure a little over the carnival costume.  So, an interesting option would be to make a more complex mask, for example a three-dimensional one.  To do this, there are ways to make this part of the costume from papier-m√¢ch√© or using gauze soaked in gypsum mortar. </p><p>  Pieces of paper or cloth are applied to a dummy molded from plasticine or cool dough, which fits on a table.  The bottom layer in contact with the template is moistened with vegetable oil, glycerin or water so that the dried form can be easily removed.  Then the mask is painted with any colors.  Lastly, laces are attached to it from the sides to hold it on the face. </p>

But you can sew such an accessory in a rather creative way. </p><ul><li>  Ears sewn from fleecy fabric are fastened to the hair band, which inside hold shape thanks to cardboard patterns. </li><li>  In the middle of the rim, a strip of tissue is fixed, which drops down through the forehead and nose. </li><li>  In the place where the strip reaches the nose, you need to glue the cover from the bottle of hairspray or a cup from a women's swimsuit to the wrong side of it. </li><li>  The edges of the fabric should be gently tucked in and sheathed or glued. </li><li>  Now it remains only to paint the tip of the nozzle with paint or sew (glue) the black round round of cloth or cardboard. </li></ul><h2>  Mickey Mouse Costume </h2><p>  And the boys love a fun cartoon character - a brave and resourceful little mouse.  Therefore, often on New Year's morning performances such children's carnival costumes are required for boys. </p>

    <p>  Actually, the main attributes in this outfit are: </p><ul><li>  a cap with round big protruding ears; </li><li>  red pants with two large white buttons; </li><li>  a black jacket or jacket of the same color, worn on a white shirt; </li><li>  butterfly on my neck. </li></ul><p>  To make pants, you will need a red fabric.  But directly the <span>pattern of the</span> mouse <span>costume is</span> not needed.  In this case, any one is suitable for which you can cut out details for panties or trousers. </p><h2>  How to make buttons for a Mickey Mouse outfit </h2><p>  If it is difficult to find large white buttons, you can make them yourself. </p><ul><li>  It is enough to cut two circles of the right size out of cardboard. </li><li>  Having laid them on a white cloth, you should circle the cardboard templates. </li><li>  You will need to cut it out not along the drawn line, but stepping back a little. </li><li>  Holding the cardboard pressed to the fabric, with the needle and thread collect the edge of the fabric circle with a <span>seam ‚Äúforward needle‚Äù,</span> or, as the seamstresses say, on a living thread.  Then the thread is pulled together and fixed. </li></ul><p>  These fake buttons can be sewn to the pants with large, bright cross-stitch patterns.  Although it‚Äôs also possible to put them on glue.  But in some cases it makes sense to get along with simple cardboard circles that will imitate buttons. </p><h2>  Knitted carnival costume "Mouse" </h2><p>  Kids in homemade fancy dress look charming!  A children's knitted mouse costume made of wool will be a wonderful New Year's gift for a child from a loving grandmother or godmother.  But it‚Äôs not difficult to complete it! </p>
