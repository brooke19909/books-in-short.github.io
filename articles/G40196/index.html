    <h2>  Geographical position </h2><p>  <span>The United Arab Emirates</span> is located in the southeast of the Arabian Peninsula.  The country borders with Oman, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.  The state unites 7 sovereign emirates, each of which has its own ruler and laws, but in foreign policy they appear as a single country with the supreme emir.  The capital of the state is the city of Abu Dhabi.  The total area of ​​the UAE is 80 thousand square meters.  km  The coastline over 600 km long is washed by the waters of the Persian and Oman gulfs.  The coastal territories are low, rugged by a large number of bays and caves.  Most of the country is occupied by the Rub al-Khali desert.  This is the largest sandy area in the world.  Most settlements are concentrated near the coast; inland, living conditions are too harsh.  There are several oases in the desert that allow travelers to cross these burning lands without hindrance.  There are mountains in the Emirates: in the east lies the Hajar ridge, the peaks of which reach 1.5 km.  The state lives mainly due to oil production, which has a rich bottom near the coast of the country.  But fresh water in these places is in great short supply.  Arriving in the Emirates in October, you can find one of the most favorable weather periods. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Country history </h2><p>  Going to the Emirates in October is not only due to the beaches, but also in order to get acquainted with the history and culture of the country.  The UAE is a fairly young state; it appears only in 1971.  But the indigenous people have long lived on these lands.  Since the 7th century, small principalities have united in the Arab caliphate, which built the state on the principles of Islam.  But later the state loses power, territories fall under the protectorate of Oman, and from the 18th century an irreconcilable struggle begins on these lands between local princes and the British company East India Company, which sought to ensure the safe passage of English ships in the Persian Gulf and wanted to establish the rule of the queen on the lands of the Arabs.  Britain succeeded, and in 1820 British domination was established over the country.  English military bases were built on this territory, and the British representative was in charge.  For 150 years, the British ruled here, but they managed to preserve the existing way of life and religion.  However, the growth of national identity led to a wave of protests against British rule and gradually the British began to lose ground until, until 1971, they had withdrawn their last troops.  So the new state of the United Arab Emirates appears.  A significant increase in oil prices allowed the country to quickly achieve stable well-being for its residents and begin to develop tourism, trade, culture and urban development. </p>
