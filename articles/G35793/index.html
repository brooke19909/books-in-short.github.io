Someone has balls hanging on the branches of a forest beauty, while others have bows.  You can make them out of paper or ribbons.  Such decoration will create a real festive atmosphere.  You can tie a bow in several ways.  It all depends on its purpose.  After all, a bow can be attached to the ball, just hang on the legs of a spruce or decorate the top of the tree with it.  However, not so many materials are required.  So how to make bows on the Christmas tree? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY bows on the Christmas tree" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/731340.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What is needed </h2><p>  To make bows on a <span>Christmas tree with your own hands,</span> you need to prepare all the tools and materials in advance.  You will need: </p><ol><li>  Glue. </li><li>  Scissors. </li><li>  <span>Floristic wire.</span> </li><li>  Tape. </li></ol><h2>  The tape must be selected correctly. </h2><p>  Before you buy a tape, you should decide on its texture and color.  It‚Äôs best to choose a material that matches the tone of the balls.  As for quality, you can use the standard option - satin ribbons.  Of course, for many beginners this fabric may seem too slippery.  Therefore, to make bows on the Christmas tree with your own hands, you can use a rougher material.  If there is no skill in needlework at all, then you can take special ribbons, along the edges of which a wire is laid.  They keep their shape perfectly and do not slip. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If the ribbon is well tied in a fairly strong knot, then from it you can easily make bows on the tree with your own hands.  It is worth noting that from some types of material it is very difficult to create an ornament without the use of threads, needles and wire. </p><p>  If you wish, you can experiment a little and try to combine several types of fabric in one bow.  In addition, tapes of various widths can be used.  This will create more original and beautiful do-it-yourself bows on the Christmas tree. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Christmas tree bows made of ribbon" class="if" height="427" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/731338.jpg" width="570"></div>

    <h2>  The easiest way </h2><p>  This is the simplest method that allows you to create jewelry without using additional funds.  The main thing is to remember that it takes a lot of ribbon to make one bow.  After all, he does not stick, but is tied.  It is the knots that spend more material, rather than the loops. </p><p>  First you need to cut a piece of tape of the required length.  It is worth making sure that such an amount of material is definitely enough.  Better, of course, to make a small <span>margin.</span>  <span>This</span> will make <span>it</span> easier to tie a bow.  You also need to leave beautiful ponytails. </p><p>  Lay the ribbon on the table.  Both ends of the fabric should be pulled to the center, and then lay them on top of each other.  The result should be beautiful loops and two ponytails.  If necessary, bow details can be adjusted.  To make beautiful bows on a Christmas tree from a ribbon, you need the loops to be the same size.  Now you can start tying.  Cross the loops of the future bow, laying on the right left.  It is worth being careful and attentive.  Around the right loop you need to draw the left and pass it into the loop that forms in the center.  Now you can tighten it tight. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the end, you should definitely fix all the loops and ponytails in order to eliminate symmetry breaking.  That's all, the bow is ready! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make bows on the tree" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/731342.jpg" width="556"></div>

    <h2>  Metal wire decoration </h2><p>  You can make bows for a Christmas tree from a ribbon using various devices.  Products, for example, with wire are ideal not only for decorating a New Year‚Äôs beauty, but also for decorating a room, bouquets of flowers, wreaths and, of course, gifts. </p><p>  To make such a bow, you need to cut a piece of ribbon as described in the previous method.  After this, the material must be decomposed on a smooth and even surface.  The ends of the ribbon should be pulled to the center of the future bow, laying them on top of each other.  The fabric should be held in the center, otherwise the symmetry will be broken.  Exactly in the middle, you need to wrap the bow with wire.  You can hide this part with the same tape.  Just wrap the middle.  To do this, you can use material of the same shade or play in contrast.  This is optional.  It is worthwhile to fix the tape with glue or just sew it on. </p><p>  If necessary, the hinges and tails can be corrected.  This will give the decoration a neat look.  That's all.  Thus, you can create multi-colored Christmas bows on the Christmas tree. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Christmas bows on the Christmas tree" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/731349.jpg" width="556"></div>

    <h2>  How to make a double bow </h2><p>  Such a product can be used for decorating rooms, decorating forest beauties and gifts.  Making double bows on a Christmas tree from a ribbon is very simple.  First of all, cut a piece of material.  It is worth remembering that such products require more tape.  After that, fold the first pair of loops as described in the previous method.  In this case, the tape should be held.  Now you can fold the second pair.  If you are a beginner, you can ask someone for help. </p><p>  In this way you can make a very magnificent bow.  It all depends on the number of loops.  For starters, it's better to try creating a simple and double. </p><p>  When the loops are folded, cut off all excess tape.  The center of the jewelry should be tied with wire or sewn with a thread and a needle of the corresponding color.  This will hold the hinges together.  If a wire is used for the connection, then it is enough to simply wrap it around the center.  Then it can be covered with tape.  The thread must first be wound around the center, and then flashed with it all layers of fabric.  In the end, you must definitely tie a knot. </p><p>  A piece of tape can hide the attachment points.  It should be fixed with glue.  The result is an original bow on the Christmas tree.  The master class is now complete.  Finished jewelry can be hung on a forest beauty. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tree with bows photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/731738.jpg" width="333"></div>

    <h2>  Flower decoration </h2><p>  Such bows look like one big and <span>beautiful flower.</span>  They can also be used to decorate New Year's beauties, gifts and wreaths.  The Christmas tree with bows looks amazing.  Photos will convince you of this.  Take the tape and cut a piece.  Measure out exactly 115 centimeters.  The first loop needs to be made of only 20 centimeters.  Grip this part of the bow between your fingers.  After this, you need to make another same loop on the left side of the finished one.  Keep individual parts of the bow in the center.  Now it‚Äôs worth making the same loop, but on the right.  That's not all.  In the same way, you need to make up to five pairs of loops on each side to get a magnificent decoration.  The bow must be fixed.  To do this, wrap the wire around its center and tighten it as tight as possible.  After that, you can remove all unnecessary. </p><p>  To hide the wire, you can wrap the center with a piece of tape, carefully gluing it.  The decoration loops must be straightened.  They should be fluffy.  As a result, the product will become like a flower. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bow on christmas tree master class" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/731744.jpg" width="516"></div>

    <h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Now you know how to make Christmas tree bows from a regular ribbon.  When choosing glue for the manufacture of such jewelry, it is worthwhile to conduct a small test.  It is enough to drip a little on a small piece of tape.  If the glue appeared on the reverse side, then you should not use it. </p>
