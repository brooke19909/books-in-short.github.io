These are not the same expensive devices with no less expensive maintenance, which could only be used in the dark.  Today, the projector allows you to view photos and videos, it can easily replace a TV or personal computer screen.  And the price of models that support Full HD resolution is equal to the cost of 40-inch television sets.  It's time to take advantage of this technology and become the proud owner of a home theater with a truly gigantic screen with a 300-inch diagonal, which is about <span>7.62 m.</span> </p><h2>  Picture </h2><p>  The main parameter for choosing a projector is image quality.  But how to do this if the much-needed assessment of several models of an expensive device cannot be made due to the lack of a viewing room? </p><p>  You can evaluate the image quality of projectors by the following parameters: </p><ul><li>  imaging technology; </li><li>  matrix size and resolution; </li><li>  contrast; </li><li>  brightness; </li><li>  focal length. </li></ul><p>  First of all, image quality depends on projection technology.  Three technologies are currently used: DLP, LCD and LCOS. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="projectors led" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/1116345.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  DLP </h2><p>  DLP (Digital Light Processing) uses a matrix of tilt-changing micromirrors that direct light into focusing lenses.  Staining a beam of light occurs in different ways.  Some manufacturers use a rapidly rotating three-color wheel.  At the same time, the eye sees alternating monochrome images, which may affect some people, and also creates a rainbow effect that interferes with viewing.  Others apply three micromirror arrays for each color separately (3DLP technology).  Projectors using 3DLP technology are among the best, but also the most expensive projectors. </p><h2>  LCD </h2><p>  LCD technology (Liquid Crystal Display) uses three liquid crystal matrices to form the red, green, and blue components of the video signal.  The light flux of a <span>metal halide lamp</span> passing through a prism or sequence of dichroic filters passing one part of the spectrum and reflecting the other is divided into three components.  Each is directed through its own LCD-matrix, which, by changing the flow of light passing through each pixel, creates a single-color image.  The combination of the three components produces a multi-color projection.  Among the disadvantages of this technology is the low contrast of the image (due to the fact that the crystal transmits light when closed, and the matrix bandwidth does not exceed 7%). </p><h2>  LCOS </h2><p>  LCOS (Eng. Liquid Crystal on Silicon) is based on the previous two.  But the light does not pass through the liquid crystal matrix, but is reflected by liquid crystals on silicone.  Thanks to this, a high-quality image is obtained without the disadvantages of DLP and LCD technologies.  In addition, it becomes possible to increase the density of pixels and achieve high resolution images.  But the price of LCOS projectors is quite high, which so far limits their use by movie theaters and large presentation rooms. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  LED </h2><p>  LED technology (Eng. Light-Emitting Diode, LED) for creating an image uses one of the above technologies with the difference that the light source is an LED matrix.  At the same time, there is no need to replace lamps, energy consumption is reduced.  The guaranteed life of the <span>LED matrix</span> is 25 thousand hours.  The disadvantage is the low luminous flux not exceeding 2000 lumens. </p><p>  The laser projector is equipped with a group of laser diodes in primary colors.  Less expensive are hybrid laser-LED projectors, which combine a blue diode laser, a green fluorescent element and <span>red LEDs</span> to achieve high image brightness <span>.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="led projectors" class="if" height="364" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/1116346.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Resolution </h2><p>  Resolution is determined by the number of pixels.  For a high-quality image, these parameters of the video projector and source must match.  You can play a signal with a different resolution, but the image will be distorted by compression algorithms. </p><p>  Popular resolutions are 1280 x 768 WXGA, 1280 x 720 HD, 1920 x 1080 Full HD, 1920 x 1200 WUXGA. </p><h2>  Brightness </h2><p>  Luminous flux is measured in lumens.  Projectors with a brightness of 2000-3000 lumens are used in classrooms and small conference rooms.  Luminous flux of 3000-4500 lumens is suitable for large conference halls.  The brightness of the image in this case is sufficient so as not to darken the room.  Superbright projectors with more than 4,500 lumens are used at concerts, in nightclubs, churches, etc. The cheapest and smallest portable projectors with a luminous flux of less than 2000 lumens require full or partial dimming of the room. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Contrast </h2><p>  The ratio of the highest and lowest brightness of the screen is called the contrast of the projector.  For example, a contrast ratio of 10,000: 1 indicates that the brightness of white is 10,000 times that of black.  In a darkened room, contrast is leveled by third-party light sources and inferior in importance to the projector's light output. </p><h2>  Lens </h2><p>  Video projectors can be equipped with lenses with the ability to manually or automatically change the <span>focal length.</span>  This is necessary to resize the image without moving the projector itself. </p><p>  Also, the lens is characterized by the ratio of the distance to the screen to its size.  Projectors are telephoto (2‚Äì8: 1), standard (1-2) and short-focus (less than 1). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="led home projectors" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/1116350.jpg" width="474"></div>

    <h2>  Features of LED projectors </h2><ul><li>  Indoor use requires blackout for maximum clarity and brightness. </li><li>  Devices with a luminous flux of up to 300 lumens are designed for a screen width of 0.2 m, and more than 500 lumens - up to 3 m. </li><li>  Suitable for mobile home theater.  They are not a full replacement for projectors with metal halide lamps. </li><li>  Portability is achieved by the presence of an external power supply, the ability to connect wirelessly. </li><li>  Models with a high luminous flux are characterized by a high noise level, therefore they are suitable for use in public places. </li><li>  Energy consumption is minimal. </li></ul><h2>  LED Projector: Overview of Popular Models </h2><p>  Every day new models of projectors appear on the market, the light source in which are LEDs.  Below we consider only those LED projectors, reviews of which were positive.  So, let's begin. </p><p>  ViewSonic PLED-W800 Mini LED Projector is a handheld device designed for business presentations, as they say, ‚Äúon the go‚Äù.  But, according to consumers, the power of the light flux allows it to be used at home. </p><p>  ViewSonic, a California-based company, has specialized in projection equipment since the late 1980s.  And a few years ago, she became the pioneer of a new line of mini-LED projectors with the PLED-W500 model.  Now available models W200, W600 and W800. </p><p>  The numbers in the model name correspond to the power of the luminous flux in lumens.  On paper, a comparison with the power of metal halide lamps, which exceeds 2,000 lumens, does not speak in favor of the LED projector, but in practice, judging by customer reviews, the device illuminates the screen brighter than one would expect.  The portable device is capable of delivering PowerPoint presentations, giving an 80-inch HD 1280 x 720 image at a distance of 2.5 m with brightness that does not require dimming the room.  However, to watch movies, you will need to close the curtains and turn on the Movie mode, which will give the image a more natural color.  The compactness of the device required sacrificing a change in focal length.  But there is a mount for mounting on a tripod.  If the projector is tilted relative to the screen, the image will be automatically corrected. </p>

An example is the Digital Galaxy DG-757 and Fugetek FG-637.  According to consumers, with the declared brightness of 2800 and 2000 lumens, the real one turned out to be less than 140 and 90 lumens, respectively.
