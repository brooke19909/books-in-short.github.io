    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  To begin with, it‚Äôs worthwhile to understand what type of tariff plan we‚Äôll be dealing with.  After all, the operator somehow names all his products, describes them.  And this "brief retelling" of the conditions helps to determine whether the proposal suits us or not. </p><p>  For Smart Nonstop ("MTS") the description can be given as simple as possible - it is nothing more than a tariff that gives unlimited possibilities.  Unlimited calls and the Internet - this is exactly what the company focuses on with this tariff plan.  What conditions are there?  Is this really a profitable offer that will interest subscribers? </p><h2>  Calls within the region </h2><p>  The first thing Smart Nonstop ("MTS") receives reviews from numerous customers is the cost of outgoing calls within the city and region.  In other words, within the home region.  This is an important point that worries many. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In this plan, subscribers are satisfied.  After all, when you connect Smart Nonstop, you will receive 400 free minutes of conversation within Russia.  After that, the cost for MTS numbers in your home region will be 0 rubles.  That is free.  But the rest of the mobile operators will have to spend a little.  Subscribers claim that the cost is negligible.  The way it is.  Only 1.5 rubles per minute. </p><h2>  All around Russia </h2><p>  In addition, the <span>MTS tariff Smart</span> Nonstop also offers its subscribers rather favorable calling conditions within Russia.  And of course, customers leave positive opinions about the terms of the promotion. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smart nonstop pay description" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1119304.jpg"></div>

    <p>  As already mentioned, with this tariff plan you get 400 free minutes of conversation.  You can spend them on local calls, or on nationwide.  After which the cost of calls appears, but insignificant. </p><p>  Surprisingly, the conditions for talking in Russia do not differ much from local negotiations.  That is, call MTS for free and as much as you like, and you will have to spend 3 rubles per minute on other operators.  More than in the case of local calls, but still quite profitable.  This alignment is extremely pleasing to subscribers.  Now you can always stay in touch. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Around the world </h2><p>  The Smart Nonstop tariff also receives reviews from MTS subscribers for the cost of calls outside the country.  Of course, such a need arises not at all and not constantly.  But there are times when you have to make calls to other countries.  And the more favorable the conditions, the more subscribers are predisposed to a particular tariff plan. </p><p>  In our case, there are no particular complaints from clients in this regard.  The thing is that in the CIS countries calls will cost 29 rubles per minute, in Europe - 49. Not so much, if you think about it.  And if you need to call to other, more distant countries, you will have to pay 70 rubles per minute.  In principle, a rather favorable offer, given the fact that calls outside the country are extremely rare.  In general, customers are satisfied with Smart Nonstop's terms. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smart nonstop pay how to connect" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1119303.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Messages </h2><p>  The next point is the cost of outgoing messages.  Calling is, of course, good.  But sometimes they are not enough to keep in touch.  Therefore, users write messages. </p><p>  In this regard, Smart Nonstop ("MTS") reviews also earns quite positive.  After all, the first 400 messages (SMS) will be absolutely free.  This condition applies to both local and national shipments.  Exactly the same conditions apply to MMS - 400 units per month are absolutely free throughout Russia. </p><p>  If you exceed this limit, you will have to pay a little.  Inside your home region, the cost will be 1.5 rubles, and in Russia - 3.8.  International letters cost 5.25 rubles apiece.  And MMS (all) will cost 6.5.  Such conditions are extremely pleasing to buyers. </p><h2>  the Internet </h2><p>  Smart Nonstop ("MTS") also earns reviews for its Internet.  For a modern subscriber, this moment has become extremely important.  Especially for children and students.  The first 10 gigabytes of traffic per month (from 7:00 to 1:00) will be provided for free.  After that, you will have to pay about 10 rubles for 1 MB of data. </p><p>  In addition, you can connect yourself additional Internet packages.  But not more than 15 pieces per month.  One package will cost 100 rubles.  It is designed for 1 GB of traffic.  Basically, nothing special Smart Nonstop offers.  Subscribers are not disappointed, but are not enthralled by such conditions.  Many competitors often work in a similar fashion.  However, if you use the Internet for purely business purposes, then 10 GB per month is enough for you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pay smart nonstop tariff reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1119302.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  A spoon of tar </h2><p>  True, there is one point for which Smart Nonstop ("MTS") reviews are not particularly good.  This is the presence of a subscription fee on the tariff plan.  All the favorable conditions that the company offers will cost you 500 rubles.  That is, for the money you get: </p><ul><li>  400 free minutes of conversation; </li><li>  400 SMS; </li><li>  400 MMS; </li><li>  10 GB of Internet traffic. </li></ul><p>  Once the limit is exceeded, you will have to pay extra.  In principle, if you are not particularly sociable, then this will be more than enough.  And then for 500 rubles a month you can use absolutely all operator services.  Excluding international calls.  In this scenario, the reviews are encouraging.  But for active subscribers, such a proposal, although it seems profitable, but still the <span>monthly fee</span> does not suit them. </p><h2>  Connection </h2><p>  Let's say we were satisfied with Smart Nonstop ("MTS").  How to connect it?  There are several options for the development of events.  The first is the transition to new conditions.  To do this, your phone should have enough funds to pay a monthly fee for the month.  But in general, the transition is free.  Dial the combination * 111 * 1027 #, and then press the call button.  Wait for a message about the result of the operation - and all problems are resolved. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tariff pay smart nonstop" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1119301.jpg" width="600"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  In addition, there is another option for resolving the issue.  For example, you can buy a new SIM card with the Smart Nonstop number and tariff plan.  Of course, this service is already worth something.  For Smart Nonstop you have to pay about 520 rubles.  Such a price tag is set in Moscow and the region.  You should find out more accurate information in this regard at the MTS offices in your city.  Buy, insert the SIM card into the phone and use.  Nothing complicated! </p>
