    <p>  The formation of the cuisine of this part of Turkey was largely influenced by the traditions of the Mediterranean.  Therefore, here you can taste an incredible amount of seafood and different types of fish. </p><p>  The main destination in Side is a beach holiday.  However, the area attracts another category of guests - fans of excursion tourism, since the resort has an incredible number of ruins of ancient structures.  No wonder, because the city was founded by the ancient Greeks.  Evidence of their stay can be called a small cape, on which fragments of walls, an amphitheater, temples, baths, a market square and much more have been preserved. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Getting to Side is easy.  The nearest airport is Antalya.  Air traffic connects it with many Russian cities.  Travel time is 3.5 hours, and the ticket price is from $ 250.  You can find cheaper options, but the flight will be long (5.5-18 hours) due to transfers in Istanbul and Ankara. </p><p>  From Antalya to Side is only an hour away by car.  If you drive on your own, then at the exit from the terminals you can use the services of taxi drivers who are on duty there around the clock.  On average, a trip to the Royal Dragon Hotel will cost 270-300 Turkish liras.  In order to save money, you should take a walk to the bus station located near the airport.  From here ply dolmushi - shuttle buses.  The cost of the trip in this case will be from 20 to 30 Turkish liras. </p>

Here, guests will be offered free umbrellas, sun loungers and towels (deposit). </p>

    <p>  Special attention should be paid to the sea coast.  Due to the fact that the beach is the property of the hotel, its territory is ennobled and cleaned.  Among the features include the free provision of the necessary attributes for relaxation and round-the-clock protection.  The only drawback: the lack of rescuers. </p><p>  Despite the fact that there were no complaints about the cleanliness of the sea, many tourists prefer to swim in the indoor pool, in which the water is heated to the optimum temperature in the cool season. </p><h2>  All beloved All inclusive </h2><p>  The all inclusive system has been a success among Russians for many years.  Agree, this is a great chance to spend your vacation without even thinking about everyday issues.
