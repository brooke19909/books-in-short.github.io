    <h2>  Guest reviews </h2><p>  According to tourists, the Aqua Fantasy Hotel is simply fantastic, there are lots of options for entertainment, a rich and complete vacation is guaranteed.  Of course, you should not spend all your free time on the territory, you should definitely go to Kusadasi - a beautiful and big city.  From the airport to the hotel brought by bus, settle very quickly. </p><p>  As in any good hotel, the local staff is well prepared to communicate with vacationers from different countries.  However, there are not many Russian tourists here, so without knowledge of the English language it will be difficult.  If you have any questions, you can feel free to contact the administrators who are happy to be useful and provide a service.  The rooms are clean and spacious, cleaned well.  Animators work all day, and vacationers are always in a good mood.  In the pools, the water is clean, for small and adult bathing places are located separately.  If you need to leave your kids in a kids club or on the playground, then you don’t have to worry about their safety - someone from the staff is always looking after the children. </p><p>  Great reviews on the food level at the Aqua Fantasy Hotel, which really deserves the highest praise.  A varied and tasty menu according to the All enclusive system, in addition, several restaurants, bars ... It is difficult to stay hungry.  On the territory there are vending machines with cold drinks, coffee and tea and plain water, which also did not go unnoticed by guests. </p><p>  There are shops where you can pay in cash.  True, as tourists notice, the prices here are quite high.  We accept MasterCard and Visa, which is also very convenient. </p>
