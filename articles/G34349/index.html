    <h2>  Popularity </h2><p>  This hotel is more likely to be of a ‚Äúclassic‚Äù than an economy class level, as evidenced by the fact that at least the Italians have chosen it (there are 60 percent of them).  Some of them come here to rest for several years in a row.  In general, you yourself will be able to appreciate its interiors, the quality and appearance of furniture, plumbing and household appliances. </p><p>  The fairly compact hotel complex is a five-story building with a cozy sitting area, located three hundred steps from the sea.  It is noticeable that the <span>architectural project</span> initially provided for the resort specialization of the building.  Therefore, the development around it involved the use and improvement of 1150 m <sup>2 of the</sup> surrounding territory for infrastructure. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel building </h2><p>  Santa Marina Deluxe 4 * was built in 2005.  Its then exterior with rectangular contours of a standard building corresponded to the architectural style of the 20th century, the so-called functionalism.  This style itself was created for the "lowercase" development of city blocks with the ends of buildings in the direction of the street. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="santa marina deluxe 4 turkey" class="if" height="234" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/520587.jpg" width="600"></div>  The hotel was thoroughly renovated in 2009.  Outwardly, its facade has changed, it has become more harmonious due to the appearance of a stylish visor on the columns.  The "resort" look was given to it by the symmetrical arrangement of lawns with royal palms, and the originally equipped roof added club features.  To paint the facade of the hotel building, a pastel yellow color scheme was successfully chosen ... However, the most significant modernization of Santa Marina Deluxe 4 * affected the reception area, restaurant and public area.  Reviews of vacationers after major repairs are unanimous about him - this is a small and cozy family-run hotel.

They also have a minibar and a safe for a fee. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Staying visitors at the hotel is accompanied by a good beach holiday.  Although the hotel does not have its own beach, the urban one, located 300 meters away, is comfortable, convenient and well-maintained.  The cost of a deck chair is 5 lira (or $ 2.5). </p><p>  The sea in the water area near the hotel is very clean (visible to great depths), almost always calm and warm, like milk.  Undoubtedly, this is one of the decisive factors in the popularity of Santa Marina Deluxe Hotel 4 *. </p><p>  One should also not trust the promotion of advertising about the ‚Äúsandiness‚Äù of the beach.  There is simply no sand here.  There are pebbles.  Very, very fine, almost like sand.

There is no killer ostentatious advertising assortment typical of six-star hotels.  But it‚Äôs simply impossible to refuse several alternative dishes for each item presented in the menu.  The food is always fresh, prepared with a soul.  Vacationers about such a catering organization in a hotel respond: ‚ÄúAt home!‚Äù

There are always several types of salads, two or three types of baking, two or three types of fruits. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  To visit Turkey and not take excursion tours is the height of frivolity.  After all, this is a historical land, and also not deprived of natural unique objects.  Objects of modern resort infrastructure also attract tourists Santa Marina Deluxe 4 * (Antalya).  Their reviews, at least, are mentioned by visited water parks, restaurants, shopping centers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel santa marina deluxe 4" class="if" height="362" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/520590.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  However, to the spa guests considering their excursion program in the Land of the Star and the Crescent, we recommend imagining it as Asia Minor (as it was once called).  This country was ruled by both slaveholding Rome and Orthodox Byzantium.  Its tourist sites are known in the world, and excursions to them are in demand. </p><p>  We also recommend that you do not buy guided tours from travel agencies.  After all, their work in this case is to ‚Äúvparit‚Äù (you simply can‚Äôt find another word here) for a holiday-maker a tour at a double price.  The increase in their salary depends on this.  However, the fact remains: the <span>market price of</span> excursions, set at the price level from professional bureaus, is approximately doubled. </p><p>  Therefore, it is better to contact decent, well-known reviews of tour agencies.  What to choose?  We give only the names: Pammukale, Cappadocia, Ich-Kale, Side (ancient Roman agora), Green Canyon, Dalmatash Grotto, Demre Mira-Kekkova. </p><h2>  Shopping at Dipo Shopping Center </h2>

There is a bus stop nearby.  From here, spa travelers, paying 2 lira per ticket, go shopping in large shopping centers.  The most popular shopping center "Dipo" among vacationers in Santa Marina Deluxe 4 *.  A photo of part of this huge stock market located along the Antalya-Alanya highway is presented below.  Here are discounts and promotions year-round.  Prices are one and a half to two times lower than in Moscow.  At first, the compatriots who came for shopping were taken aback by the abundance of brands represented.

Peerless branded baby clothes can be purchased at reasonable prices at the Waikiki store. </p><p>  The proximity to Antalya - an international shopping center, characterized by high quality products and their relatively low prices, attracts lovers of leisure and shopping in Santa Marina Deluxe 4 * (Turkey). </p><p>  Reviews of the guests of this hotel about visiting shopping centers indicate the possibility of realizing truly grandiose shopping for them here. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  There is no universal model of an ideal hotel for relaxation.  The spirit of the party, the noisy animation, is important for others, the more relaxed aura of the hotel complex is sweeter for others.  Some need foamy discos until late at night, while others need enough sea, sun and a beach.  Some see the point in eating during their holidays in restaurants with a menu of hundreds of dishes.  For others, this aspect is not so important, but it is quite enough to regularly cook a limited number of quality dishes according to the ‚Äúat home‚Äù principle. </p><p>  For some, the hypertrophied infrastructure of the hotel complex is important, allowing you to have a good time, having spent your entire vacation near the hotel pool bar, not showing your own initiative and expecting ‚Äúsomething new‚Äù only from animators and guides;  for others, the constant spirit of the planned excursion tour and collecting impressions is important. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="santa marina deluxe 4 turkey reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/520592.jpg" width="537"></div>

    <p>  Calm, high-quality and quite decent guesthouse guarantees its guests the hotel Santa Marina Deluxe 4 * (Antalya, Turkey).  Reviews also indicate that it is an ideal platform for all kinds of sightseeing tours initiated by vacationers themselves.  An important factor is that it is located almost in Antalya itself. </p><p>  Unlike Kemer, where there are many Russians, where you can often hear Russian, and the range of products, frankly, is limited, Antalya is really abroad.
