    <p>  Thus, this hotel is located quite close to the airport in Alanya Gazipasa.  From the air transport hub in Antalya to the hotel, tourists will have to get at least 2 hours.  The distance between this airport and Alanya is about 100 km.  Vacationers who have made hotel reservations on their own are likely to have to travel by intercity bus.  Such a trip would cost about $ 12. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  General description of the hotel </h2><p>  Hotel Alara Hotel 4 * (Turkey, Alanya) began to accept tourists who came to rest in Incekum for a long time.

That is, unlike city hotels, it has its own territory.  The yard area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe complex is large - 10 thousand m <sup>2</sup> .  They respond about the hotel territory to its guests very well.  A very beautiful, well-landscaped courtyard is, of course, one of the main advantages of Alara Hotel 4 * (Turkey, Alanya).  And the photos, which can be seen in the article, confirm this fully.  In addition, its employees clean the territory of the complex very carefully.  So many tropical plants have been planted in the courtyard of this hotel that it even resembles a mini-botanical garden. </p>

    <p>  On the websites of tour operators, you can often read information that the Alara Hotel 4 * hotel (Turkey, Alanya) is suitable for both young people and couples or senior vacationers.  But judging by the reviews of tourists who have already visited this hotel, this is not entirely true.  According to the majority of vacationers, young people at this hotel will simply have nothing to do.  In fact, this complex is still better suited for tourists from 40 or even 60. There are not so many entertainments for guests here.  And the Incekum village itself is visited mainly by lovers of measured beach holidays.  Those who are looking for various kinds of entertainment in Turkey should rent a hotel directly in Alanya.  This city is quite rightly considered to be a youth resort.  There really is where to have fun. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The apartments in this hotel are rented mainly by Germans and Russians.  Of course, very rich people would consider this complex not too convenient.  However, for tourists of average wealth, judging by the reviews, it fits very well. </p><h2>  Similar hotel </h2><p>  Gathering information about Alara Hotel before a trip to Turkey, vacationers who have rented rooms here should be a closer look.  The fact is that in Alanya there is another hotel with a similar name - My Sea Hotels Alara.  It is also a fairly comfortable four-star hotel, providing tourists with comfortable rooms.  However, <span>My Sea Hotels Alara 4 *</span> (Alanya) is located in Turkey not in Incekum, but in the village of Okurcalar.  This hotel has a larger area than Alara Hotel.  Yes, and it works in a slightly different way.  This concerns, for example, hotel catering. </p><p>  Partnership agreements are concluded with Mysea Hotel Alara 4 * (Turkey, Alanya) almost the same tour operators as with Alara Hotel.  Therefore, confusing these hotels is really very simple. </p>

    <h2>  The main beach of the hotel </h2><p>  There are practically no shortcomings in terms of room comfort or the quality of the service provided at the Alara Hotel 4 * hotel (Turkey, Alanya).  The beach of this hotel has earned not just good, but really rave reviews from tourists.  The coastline opposite the hotel is covered by very small, soft and almost perfectly clean sand.  Entrance to the sea on the hotel beach is very convenient.  This is noted by many tourists who have ever stayed at the Alara Hotel. </p><p>  Swimming at the hotel's beach is thus very convenient.  But Alara Hotel 4 * (Alanya, Turkey) earned good reviews not only for its clean sand and convenient entry into the water.  Many travelers also relate to the advantages of the hotel‚Äôs beach that sun loungers and umbrellas can be used absolutely free.  Moreover, these accessories are usually enough for all residents.  Beach towels are also provided for guests in this complex.  This vacationer, of course, is also considered a plus hotel.  Towels can be taken if necessary at the hotel reception. </p><h2>  Small beaches </h2><p>  In addition to the main one, guests of the Alara Hotel 4 * hotel (Turkey, Alanya, Incekum) can also visit two small picturesque beaches located nearby.  The sea and sand are just as clean.  However, resting on these beaches, parents should take a closer look at the children.  The fact is that on the rocks that are on the coast in this place, special algae grows, upon contact with which a burn is formed on the skin. </p><h2>  Useful advice </h2><p>  In addition to shampoo, some tourists recommend our compatriots who have booked rooms at Alara Hotel 4 * (Turkey, Alanya, Incekum) to bring along some kind of allergy remedy.  There are no mosquitoes in this hotel.  The facts of food poisoning at the hotel have also never been recorded.  An allergic reaction in the form of a rash in the first days after check-in, as some travelers note, occurs in many hotel guests.  This is explained, apparently, by an excess of ultraviolet radiation and the composition of local water. </p><h2>  Shopping near the hotel </h2><p>  Of course, in the immediate vicinity of the Alara Hotel 4 * (Turkey, Alanya), there are many shops of different specializations.  There are also several markets in Inzekum.  However, many tourists note that, unfortunately, almost only consumer goods are sold in village retail outlets.  When shopping, most vacationers recommend that beginners go to Alanya.  In this town there are actually very good shops of different specializations. </p>
