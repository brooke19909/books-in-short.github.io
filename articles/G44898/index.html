    <h2>  Larnaca </h2><p>  Flamingo Beach Hotel 3 * is located in the city, which archaeologists consider the oldest in Cyprus.  Although in general this resort is not much different from the rest of the island's villages - the old center, green outskirts with coastal hotels, a promenade and countless restaurants where everyone boasts a catch and has its own secrets of how to cook fish in such a way that you lick your fingers.  This is a budget resort where people come with not very big money.  In addition, healing sand and shallow sea attract families with children here.  The most famous monument of Larnaca is the <span>temple of St. Lazarus,</span> where, according to legend, he was buried.  And the city itself is named after a friend of Jesus Christ.  At least that's what one of the translations of the name Larnaca says.  From other architectural monuments in the city center, you can see the ancient ruins of ancient Greek sanctuaries and the ancient Byzantine church.  The favorite place for walking - both among local residents and tourists - is the Embankment of Date Palms.  It stretched from the city center almost to the airport itself.  The hotels here are inexpensive, mainly ‚Äúkopecks‚Äù and ‚Äúthree rubles‚Äù, many apartments, and prices are quite low. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Flamingo beach hotel 3 Larnaca" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1014408.jpg" width="500"></div>

There is a small pond with turtles.  Tourists noted a beautiful lounge with many comfortable sofas.  You can sunbathe on the terrace around the rooftop pool.  In one building (white) - standard rooms, in the other (pink) - apartments.  This section of the hotel is named for Mackenzie.

A little further - a picturesque port with yachts.  To the center of Larnaca - about half an hour on foot along the promenade. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Flamingo beach hotel 3 cyprus" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1014409.jpg" width="500"></div>
