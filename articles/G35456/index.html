In May this year, the World Cup was held in Minsk, which was attended by tens of thousands of fans.  Of course, the Chinese could not leave this event unnoticed and built their "Beijing" in the center of Minsk. </p><p>  Formally, the opening of the hotel was timed to coincide with a significant event in the world of football.  But 5 stars on the facade emphasize its high level and make status obvious. </p><h2>  Where is Beijing </h2><p>  The Beijing Hotel in Minsk (address: 36 Krasnoarmeyskaya St.) is located in one of the elite neighborhoods of the Belarusian capital.  This is where many government offices are located, including the president‚Äôs residence, theaters and museums. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beijing Hotel in Minsk" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34006/849287.jpg" width="600"></div>  The huge old park makes the air especially clean, and instead of the incessant city noise, the Beijing Hotel in Minsk enjoys birdsong.  Walking in the green area along the embankment of the Svisloch River serves as a wonderful relaxation after a busy day.
