    <h2>  For children </h2><p>  Although the hotel is considered youthful and noisy, many Russians and Europeans come here with their children.  And not in vain, because for the little guests excellent conditions were created at Asdem Park Hotel 4 *.

For example, fifteen kilometers from Kemer, the ancient city of Olympos once flourished.  According to legend, it was here that the gods lived.  The city is located very high from sea level.  Here, tourists can see the classical theater and the remains of baths, laid out in very beautiful mosaics, as well as an old temple. </p><p>  In addition, not far from Kemer is another ancient city - Kekova, located on the island of the same name.  Once there was a major earthquake, as a result, the city almost sank.  Therefore, tourists can visit it only by sea.  The excursion is carried out on boats, from which you can see the most unusual artifacts.  For lovers of underwater exploration, the northern side of this island, on which Roman pirates often stayed, will be interesting.  Here, tourists often discover the most unexpected and unusual gizmos. </p><p>  The cost of the tour depends on which tour operator or agency in which it was purchased.  For example, a boat trip with a local guide costs an average of forty-five dollars.  At the same time, many vacationers prefer to buy sightseeing tours in an office located in the main building of Asdem Park Hotel 4 * (Kemer). </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The vast majority of Russians who visited this hotel are satisfied with their choice.  First of all, they liked the convenient location: a stone's throw from the sea and close to many shops and restaurants.  Tourists also say a lot of positive words about the work of the staff, who politely and prudently solves all the problems that arise.  Check-in is very fast, room cleaning is neat and unobtrusive when guests go down to the restaurant. </p><p>  As for nutrition, it, judging by the reviews, is quite varied and tasty.  Lots of salads and fruits, meat and fish.  Some tourists separately thank the cooks for the excellent food, but there are also those who complain about the heat in the restaurant. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Asdem park turkey" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/724935.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Many reviews mention Turkish Night, a holiday that can be obtained without leaving the hotel.  Everything on this day is very beautifully decorated, tables are set up on the street, there is a concert program with a disco.  Those who are not vacationing in Kemer for the first time say that such entertainment in other hotels can be obtained only for a fee, whereas in Asdem Park Hotel 4 * it is free. </p><p>  The sea on this coast is clean, there are always a lot of swimmers on the beach, however, a deck chair can be found at any time of the day.  The nature around is simply amazing, although the hotel is located in the city center.  Around the mountains and greenery: sitting on the balconies, you can admire all this beauty forever. </p>
