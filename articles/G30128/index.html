The easiest way, of course, is to go to the store and buy what you need.  However, it happens that suddenly on sale there is no desired model.  There are all kinds of masks: a wolf, a bear, a hare, and a spider-man, but there is no turtle mask needed.  Or just a little money and you have to save.  Or you want to make such an exclusive and original costume that no one will have! </p><p>  In these cases, there is no other way out than <span>to make a mask with your own hands.</span>  But this, in fact, is completely and uncomplicated!  But it is very entertaining and interesting.  Moreover, the baby will certainly take an active part in this matter, which will make it possible to become even a little closer to him: nothing brings people closer than joint labor impulses. </p><p>  There are many tutorials on how to make a mask.  The simplest of them is a mask-cap or mask-crown.  A corona mask needs cardboard, scissors, paints and an elastic band to hold it.  The muzzle of the desired animal or fantastic creature is depicted on cardboard, cut out, and an elastic band is sewn along its edges.  This mask is worn on the <span>forehead above the</span> eyes, like a crown. </p><p>  Now you can briefly tell how to make a mask-cap.  It should be sewn from fabric.  To do this, you will need special patterns, a filler such as chopped foam rubber, buttons for the eyes.  This mask has the shape of the upper part of the animal‚Äôs head, ending just in the mouth section: the <span>upper jaw</span> is part of the masquerade headgear, but the lower one is not.  After stitching the main parts, the filler should be very tightly filled into the nose (upper jaw) so that it is straight and does not sag, sew on the ears, eyes and nose pipette.  It is proposed to make the teeth out of white shoe insoles: it looks scary, but the child cannot hurt anyone with soft fangs. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But some craftsmen offer materials that tell you how to make a paper mask.  Rather, not even completely from paper, but from papier-m√¢ch√©, which is already made from it.  To do this, adults need to prepare a lot of old newspapers or other unnecessary paper trash, scissors, a brush and paper glue, although you can also use a flour or starch paste.  Still need material for fashioning the shape of the mask: plasticine, dough or clay.  After the mask dries, it will need to be painted with paints, or you can even cover it with furniture varnish - then it can serve for a very, very long time. </p><p>  We prepare the necessary form on the table from the material for modeling.  Then we cut the paper in uneven pieces from 2 to 4 square meters.  cm area.  It can be triangles, squares, rhombuses and even hexagons - the shape of the pieces does not matter.  The first and second layer of paper scraps, which must be arbitrarily laid on the mold, should be moistened with water so that they do not stick to the molding material. </p><p>  Next, the paper needs to be coated with adhesive and glued with its shape, carefully pressing the paper to it so that there are no voids, creases and irregularities.  Pieces should go on each other, but distributed over the entire surface evenly.  When the thickness of the mask reaches at least 5 mm, you can stop making papier-m√¢ch√© by making the last row of white paper. </p><p>  Now the mask should dry well.  After that, it is separated from the mold, the non-sticky scraps of the first two rows are removed, a hole for the eyes, mouth and breathing is cut or trimmed with a sharp knife or scalpel, holes are drilled at the edges to fix gum or ribbons in them. </p><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear to you how to make a papier-m√¢ch√© mask.  It remains only to paint it, varnish it and paste into the holes of a ribbon or elastic band to hold the mask on the face. </p>
