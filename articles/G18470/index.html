    <p>  Under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, <span>after World War I, Germany was</span> forbidden to have a full-fledged army with heavy weapons.  The number of troops should not exceed 100 thousand land employees and 15 thousand sailors.  These armed forces were called the Reichsfer, that is, the imperial forces. </p><p>  It was on the basis of these defense forces that the Wehrmacht was created.  This was made possible through the <span>introduction of universal military service.</span>  Thus, the terms of the Treaty of Versailles were violated.  The total number of ground forces was soon 500 thousand people and was growing steadily. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Organizational structure </h2><p>  The Wehrmacht is the so-called rate of the Fuhrer.

    <p>  The Wehrmacht form had its own standards, but during the war deviations from them were considered normal.  Some inconsistencies were even reflected in special orders.  Often, soldiers independently changed their uniforms, following their own taste and fashion trends. </p><p>  The presence in the troops of foreign units also influenced the deviation from the standard uniform.  When sewing, they all used different materials and fabrics, the texture and color of which significantly changed the tone.  For example, the gray color of the shape of 1939 and 1945 differs significantly: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  1939 - gray-blue cloth; </li><li>  1940 - gray-green; </li><li>  1941 - stone gray; </li><li>  1944 - taupe. </li></ul><p>  Despite the fact that the officers had to purchase uniforms on their own, they were allocated money for this.  Therefore, all military uniforms were considered the property of the Reich.  Soldiers and officers were required to be responsible for its safety.  To do this, they were given a darn kit and shoe polish. </p>

    <p>  As the main materials for sewing forms used gabardine, teak, artificial and natural silk, cotton and wool.  The officers had the opportunity to order uniforms from a comfortable and high-quality fabric.  Their uniforms were often fitted and slightly lined with cotton on their shoulders.  Patches and insignias were handmade. </p><p>  The uniform was produced at seven enterprises located in Berlin, Munich, Erfurt, Vienna, Hanover, Koenigsberg, and Stettin.  From these cities, the Wehrmacht army received uniforms.  The uniform was stamped with the name of the city and year of manufacture.  For example, the stamp ‚ÄúM 44‚Äù means that the mold was made in Munich in 1944. </p><h2>  Hats </h2>

    <p>  The shape of the Wehrmacht includes hats.  These include <span>caps, caps,</span> steel helmets, berets. </p><p>  Caps along with a cockade were sewn on one continuous T-shaped base.  Then insignia were attached to them. </p><p>  Berets were used by tankers.  The hats had a pillow made of thick rubber, which was lined with black wool fabric.  Inside, they were stitched with leather and had an elastic base.  A wreath with oak leaves and an eagle with a swastika were embroidered on a beret.  After 1941, this headgear was canceled.  Wehrmacht troops stopped using berets. </p><p>  The caps were made with a hard cockade, complemented by a edging from a woven cord, buttons, and emblems of distinction.  There were caps for all military ranks, and separately for senior officials. </p><p>  The steel helmet had a standard shape, although in different years its design underwent minor changes.  His main task was to shelter the head, neck, shoulders from fragments of shells, shrapnel, bouncing stones.  Until 1935, the helmets of the 1916 model were used in the Wehrmacht.  Later, a smaller and smaller specimen was introduced, which made it more practical.  By 1940, a new version was released, and since 1943 helmets began to be issued without emblems, gray. </p>
