Based on the reviews and ratings of travelers, a rating of the most beloved and most popular beaches for bathers in Spain was compiled.  It includes the following recreational areas: </p><ul><li>  Nerja. </li><li>  Sitges. </li><li>  Santander. </li><li>  Costa Brava. </li><li>  Benidorm. </li><li>  Corralejo. </li><li>  Marbella </li><li>  Tenerife </li><li>  Tarifa </li><li>  Ibiza </li><li>  Maspalomas. </li><li>  Majorca. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.nerjatoday.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nerja Beach" class="if uuid-2395925" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45514/2395925.jpg"></div><p>  All of them are located in the picturesque areas of the Mediterranean Sea.  Most of them have been awarded the international Blue Flag sign.  This is a guarantee of safety and cleanliness of the water area.  All official beaches of Spain are free.  But you need to pay for the rental of sunbeds and umbrellas. </p><h2>  Nerja </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.spain-holiday.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Water area of ‚Äã‚ÄãNerja" class="if uuid-2395926" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45514/2395926.jpg"></div><p>  The resort beach stretches from the famous village of Costa del Sol to the touristy coast of sunny Malaga.  The main attraction of Nerja is the mountain range, which reliably protects it from the winds.  A hundred years ago, this place was an ordinary fishing village.  Today Nerja tops the list of the best beaches in Spain.  The coastline is over eight kilometers long. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Travelers believe this is a great place to relax on the Mediterranean with children.  Parents of kids choose Del Salon.  According to them, the sand in this part of the coast is clean, and the sea is shallow and warm.  The bottom is flat, and the depth increases gradually.  For children, play areas are equipped, rides work.  If you believe the reviews, then this beach in Spain is the most quiet and democratic.  The nearest hotels are a five minute walk.  Eateries and family cafes are a stone's throw away. </p><h2>  Sitges </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.hotelcalipolis.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sitges Beach" class="if uuid-2395924" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45514/2395924.jpg"></div><p>  This part of the Mediterranean coast is regularly included in the list of the <span>best beaches in Spain.</span>  It is located in the <span>vicinity of Barcelona.</span>  It is visited not only by visitors, but also by residents of the nearest suburbs of the metropolis.  People come here to meet friends or just have a meal during the lunch break. </p><p>  Sitges coast is divided into seventeen recreational areas.  Some beaches are long and wide.  Others occupy cozy bays.  Still others are hidden from prying eyes by lush tropical vegetation. </p><h2>  View from the outside </h2><p>  Calling Sitges one of the best beaches in Spain, travelers pay attention to the following points: </p><ul><li>  clean and warm sea; </li><li>  lack of high waves; </li><li>  proximity to public transport; </li><li>  developed infrastructure; </li><li>  the availability of rescue services; </li><li>  reasonable prices. </li></ul><p>  Cons too.  Speaking of shortcomings, tourists usually mention areas in which nudists sunbathe.  They are not indicated in any way.  Those who are resting for the first time in this part of the country's coast often find themselves in an awkward position.  The chaotic piling up of hotels and first-line hotels annoys many more. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Santander </h2><div class="photo" data-original="gotravelaz.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Santander Beach" class="if uuid-2395928" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45514/2395928.jpg"></div><p>  The resort is often included in Spain's list of beaches for children.  Its coast is long and wide.  Therefore, every tourist will find a place to taste.  Like other recreational areas of the Mediterranean Sea, Santander consists of a series of beaches.  The most famous and popular is Magdalena.  It gathers youth companies and vacationers from nearby hotels. </p><h2>  First impression </h2><p>  Travelers who find themselves in Magdalen at the height of the high season, the beach seems too noisy.  He reminds them of an anthill.  But it is worth to move away from Magdalena, as tourists find themselves on the spacious and quiet beach of Virgen Del Mar. </p><p>  It is located in a bay with amazingly clear water of azure hue.  This part of the coast is isolated from noisy tourist recreation.  Judging by the reviews of tourists about the beaches of Spain, in comparison with Magdalena and neighboring Playa Sardinero, it has several advantages: </p><ul><li>  beautiful views; </li><li>  scenic sunsets; </li><li>  plenty of free space; </li><li>  lack of intrusive service; </li><li>  cheaper sun loungers and umbrellas; </li><li>  clean sand. </li></ul><p>  Young people do not like the close proximity with young children running along the beach of Virge del Mar.  Therefore, party-goer companies prefer Playa Sardinero, which is always fun and crowded. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Costa Brava </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.itaka.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Costa Brava Beach" class="if uuid-2395922" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45514/2395922.jpg"></div><p>  This resort has the cleanest beaches in Spain.  Nearby lies the national border.  Behind it begins the territory of France.  The Costa Brava is famous for its many attractions and historical monuments.  Tossa de Mar is considered the most colorful in the region.  It is also the best white sand beach in Spain. </p><p>  Fans of nightly entertainment and fashionable discos go to Lloret de Mar.  Coastal bars are open around the clock. </p><h2>  Pros and cons </h2><p>  According to tourists, this place has a lot of advantages: </p><ul><li>  proximity to major resorts and Barcelona; </li><li>  excellent transport accessibility; </li><li>  availability of all necessary beach infrastructure facilities; </li><li>  landscape variety; </li><li>  clean and calm sea. </li></ul><p>  Among the shortcomings, vacationers distinguish crowded people at the height of the high season.  As well as the high cost of food in coastal restaurants.  Pay attention to the lack of a sufficient number of attractions for young children.  Water in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãLloret de Mar, according to vacationers, is often dirty.  Food packages, plastic bottles and other garbage float in it.  On wild beaches fishing nets are scattered, fish is lying around.  Large boulders and sharp stones are found. </p><h2>  Benidorm </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.shearings.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Benidorm Beach" class="if uuid-2395927" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45514/2395927.jpg"></div><p>  This place is located on the coast of the fashionable resort of Costa Blanca.  It is popular with locals and visiting Europeans.  Therefore, it is constantly included in various ratings of beaches in Spain.  Benidorm consists of two large recreational areas.  Its territory is divided between Pontiente and Levante.  The first is popular with families with small children.  The second is chosen by lovers of beach parties. </p><h2>  Love at first sight </h2><p>  There are practically no negative reviews about Benidorm.  And here are hundreds of enthusiastic comments.  Travelers love the local beaches and the nature reserve surrounding them.  The coast is indented by cozy lagoons with crystal clear water.  Therefore, Benidorm is rightfully considered the most beautiful <span>beach in Spain.</span> </p><p>  At the same time, the resort is not isolated from neighboring towns.  The entertainment infrastructure is on top.  Five minutes from the beach is a huge shopping center.  Tourists recommend local boutiques.  According to them, in such stores you can find rare designer items at very reasonable prices. </p><h2>  Corralejo </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.corralejo.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Corralejo Beach" class="if uuid-2395923" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45514/2395923.jpg"></div><p>  This recreational area owes its name to the city of the same name, spread along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea.  It is located in the north of Fuerteventur.  This is the second largest land area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Canary Archipelago.  His calling card is the camp of surfers.  In this part of Spain, the winds raise high and raised waves that attract thousands of water sports fans. </p><h2>  Tourists comments </h2><p>  According to travelers, this part of the island is not suitable for a safe holiday with young children.  The beaches are wide and clean, but the sea often storms.  Even in clear weather, the wind constantly blows, gusts of which reach ten meters per second.  Therefore, it is almost always cool in the morning and evening.  Water warms up slowly, and its depth increases sharply. </p><p>  But active and athletic youth finds a lot of advantages for themselves on Corralejo: </p><ul><li>  lack of idle travelers; </li><li>  ideal conditions for surfing; </li><li>  low and affordable housing prices, equipment rental; </li><li>  an abundance of surf schools. </li></ul><h2>  Marbella </h2><p>  The history of the resort dates back centuries.  The beach is located five minutes walk from the central streets of the city.  The coast of Marbella is a modern, equipped with all necessary recreational area.  There are lifeguard towers, playgrounds, showers and toilets, bars and taverns. </p><p>  All resort life is focused on Playa de Alicat.  It is famous for its impeccably white sand, reminiscent of the finest powder.  Fans of nightlife flock to the other end of the coast of Marbella, on Nikki Beach. </p><h2>  Optimal choice </h2><p>  According to our compatriots, Marbella is a great place for those who are in Spain for the first time.  The local beach is clean and well maintained.  There are always empty seats on it, which cannot be said about the outskirts of Barcelona.  Parents with children feel calm and relaxed.  Tourists speak well of local medical facilities.  In some clinics, the staff speaks Russian. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, Marbella welcome travelers from Russia.  The beach attracts with thoughtful infrastructure and affordable prices.  The sea in this part of the coast of Spain is almost always clean, and the water is clear.  If you wish, you can easily find a secluded lagoon.  Families and large companies do just that.  On the beach, nothing prevents relaxation. </p><p>  Tourists consider the disadvantages of Marbella not the best transport accessibility, monotony of entertainment, a small selection of stores selling clothes of world brands. </p><h2>  Tenerife </h2><p>  Perhaps the most popular, but controversial resort.  Some travelers fall in love with its beaches at first sight.  Others leave its coast without regret.  High prices scare away budget travelers.  And the level of service often does not correspond to the declared cost of services. </p><p>  Russians talk about dirty sand, which, according to them, is no different from what is in Anapa.  Others complain of a restless and cold sea even in the midst of summer.  The third was disappointed in vaunted fishing in open waters. </p><p>  True, if one rejects bad thoughts and does not expect too much from this beach, then summer vacations will certainly succeed. </p>
