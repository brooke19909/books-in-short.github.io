According to the surviving sources, episodic military operations with alternating success between the Oirats (Jungars) and the Kazakhs began to occur in the second half of the 15th century.  The motivation for the invasion of both sides was the forced profit.  At the turn of the 16-17th centuries, pressure from the Dzungarian nomads began to increase.  The Kazakh rulers managed to inflict a number of defeats on the Oirats and establish temporary political control over some tribes. </p><h2>  Deterioration of Kazakh-Dzungarian relations at the beginning of the 17th century </h2><p>  Due to the numerous white spots of history, it is not possible to determine the exact dates of the beginning and end of the Kazakh-Dzungarian war.  According to some reports, the Jungars made one of the first serious campaigns in Central Asia and the lands of Kazakhstan in 1599-1605 with an attack on Khorezm.  The subsequent failure did not stop the militant tribes, and soon they became subordinate to the Senior Zhuz.  Under the circumstances, part of the Kyrgyz and Kazakh rulers was forced to admit their dependence on the Oirat feudal lords. </p><p>  It should be noted that, on the one hand, the hard domestic political struggle of the region played a significant role in the defeat of the Kazakhs, and on the other hand, the complication of relations between the khans Yesim and Imamkuli (Bukhara khanate).  Therefore, they could not provide decent resistance.  But in the late 1920s, Khan Yesim managed to inflict serious defeats on the Oirats and force them to peace.  Over the next few years, the superiority of forces was invariably on the side of the Kazakhs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the 30s of the 17th century, the beginning of a new stage of Kazakh-Dzungarian relations was marked.  A group of Dzungarian tribes (Choros, Hoyts, Derbets) led by Khara-Khula, and later his son Batur, begin an open confrontation with the Kazakh Khanate in the east. </p><div class="photo" data-original="chinggistrip.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="causes of the Kazakh-Dzungarian war" class="if uuid-2473085" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63354/2473085.jpg"></div><h2>  The reasons for the Kazakh-Dzungarian war </h2><p>  The formation of the Dzungarian state (1635) and the victories of the Oirat troops in Mongolia, Kazakhstan and East Turkestan raise the profile of Batur and make its stake an important political center in Central Asia.  After 1640, the focus of foreign policy of the united Oirat tribes was especially directed towards the Kazakh steppes. </p><p>  The main causes of the Oyrat wars of conquest in Kazakhstan: </p><ol><li>  Control of trade routes connecting Dzungaria with Russia and Central Asian states. </li><li>  Expansion and strengthening of the northern borders of the Khanate. </li><li>  Endless pasture land. </li><li>  Increased taxable population. </li><li>  Trade and craft cents of <span>southeastern Kazakhstan.</span> </li><li>  Slave trade. </li></ol><p>  The years of the Kazakh-Dzungarian wars in some publications are often represented as bloody and harsh, and Kazakhs and Dzungars are presented as sworn enemies.  But in fairness, it should be noted that the relationship between them was not always in a state of confrontation.  There were periods of peaceful and friendly coexistence of these peoples, when mutually beneficial trade was conducted, and marriages were concluded.  In the family tree of many Kazakhs, you can find Dzungarian ancestors. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  First battles </h2><p>  The first battles of the Kazakh-Dzungarian war were extremely unsuccessful for the Kazakhs.  Unstable central authority, tribal and clan fragmentation, weak economic ties, the desire of the feudal lords for independence.  While the jungars acted more efficiently: a relatively high degree of development of statehood, a ramified numerous apparatus, material and human resources. </p><p>  The enterprising and energetic Dzhangir (the son of the Kazakh khan Yessim) tried to lead the fight against the invaders (1635), but was defeated and captured.  Freed a year later, he forms an alliance with the Kyrgyz and becomes one of the most implacable opponents of the Oirats.  The whole history of his reign is marked by the struggle against enemy occupation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="astanatimes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Battle of Orbulak" class="if uuid-2473095" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63354/2473095.jpg"></div><h2>  Orbulak battle </h2><p>  In the winter of 1643, a handful of Kazakhs led by Dzhangir put up strong resistance to the 50,000-strong army of the Dzungars led by Batur.  According to written sources, the military detachment of the Kazakh khan of 600 people was divided into two groups, 300 dzhigits took upon themselves the main attack of the enemy cavalry, the other 300, together with the khan, were ambushed. </p><p>  The terrain and firearms gave an advantage to the fighters of Dzhangir, the Oirats were subjected to massive shelling and disoriented in the setting, which had a psychological effect on their military spirit.  Soon reinforcements approached the Kazakhs - the 20,000th army of the Kyrgyz.  Enemies were defeated.  The next campaign against the Kazakhs was undertaken by the Dzungar Khan in 1646, but despite the expected slaughter, peace negotiations took place in it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In the course of further constant clashes, the Dzhungars managed to secure a small part of the Seven Rivers, which laid the foundation for the territorial seizure of Kazakhstani lands. </p><div class="photo" data-original="civilization-history-n.tumblr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kazakh-Jungar war" class="if uuid-2473158" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63354/2473158.jpg"></div><h2>  From raids to captures </h2><p>  The formation of the Dzungar Khanate led to a significant increase in pressure on the Kazakhs and Kyrgyz.  Ordinary predatory raids gave way to territorial seizures of land in Kazakhstan.  The uncoordinated actions of the Kazakh, Kyrgyz and Bukhara rulers allowed the enemy to usurp a number of Kazakh uluses (possessions). </p><p>  In the early 1680s, the Dzungarian Khan Galdan (son of Batur) with a large army launched a large-scale invasion of South Kazakhstan and Semirechye.  According to documents, as a result of the battles, nine cities were captured.  And in 1698, Tsevan Rabdan (Galdan's nephew), becoming the head of the 40,000th army, made a devastating campaign against the nomads of the Elder Zhuz. </p><p>  The nature of the invasion of this period of the Kazakh-Dzungarian war was fundamentally different from all previous ones.  The invaders tried to thoroughly gain a foothold in the lands of Kazakhstan and Central Asia and collect tribute from the cities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pictame.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="folk heroes" class="if uuid-2473142" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63354/2473142.jpg"></div><h2>  Unity Kurultai </h2><p>  Dzungarian invasions began to increasingly threaten the independent existence of Kazakhstan.  In the face of danger, the Kazakh feudal lords tried on for a while and began to look for ways to protect themselves from a common enemy.  In 1710, a unifying kurultai (congress) was held in Karakum where representatives of three zhuzes decided the main question: to rise to fight the enemy or to ask for peace.  The inspired speech of Bogenbai Batyr sparked hope among those present, and they took an oath to protect their lands and each other to the last drop of blood.  It was decided to form a militia. </p><p>  The congress held by the Kazakhs played a huge role in the war with the Dzungaria: the role of the masses and prominent batyrs is growing.  Until 1718, the Kazakh Khanate managed to restrain the onslaught of the conquerors. </p><p>  A separate point is worth noting the true heroes of the participants in the Kazakh-Dzungar war, about whom later the people will compose legends, songs and poems: Kanzygaly Bogenbai, Shakshak Zhanibek, Bayan Batyr, Karakerey Kabanbai, Shapyrashty Nauryzbai, Alban Rayymbek and many others. </p><h2>  Defeat at Ayaguse </h2><p>  In the documentary evidence there is mention of yet another battle of the Kazakh-Dzungarian war, but due to the scarcity of information, historians were able to come to a consensus about the full picture of this clash.  It is known that in 1717 30 thousand Kazakh militias entered into a three-day battle with a small detachment of the Dzungars near the Ayaguz River, for control of the Sary-Arka and Irtysh.  Despite the numerical superiority, the Kazakh army was squeezed in the bend of the river between two enemy units and suffered heavy losses. </p><p>  Analyzing this battle, the researchers conclude that the wrong battle tactics, uncoordinated actions of the commanding staff, the fragmentation and carelessness of the commanders themselves led to the inglorious defeat of the Kazakhstan militias. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rottentomatoes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="years of great disaster" class="if uuid-2474225" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63354/2474225.jpg"></div><h2>  Years of Great Disaster (1723-1727) </h2><p>  In the spring of 1723, after the armistice with the Qing Empire, the Oirat feudal lords attacked Kazakhstan and Central Asia with new power.  The first affected areas were Zhetysu and Irtysh.  The enemies chose the moment when the Kazakhs were still in winter camps and could not organize the proper resistance.  The Dzungarian invaders, sweeping away any obstacles in their path, quickly moved inland.  They did not spare anyone, leaving behind a devastation, fires and piles of dead bodies.  People throwing property and cattle, were forced to flee to the west and within the borders of the Central Asian khanates. </p><p>  The Kazakh-Dzungarian war of this period greatly paralyzed the economic life of Central Asia: trampled crops, numerous refugees, devastated cities (Fergana, Bukhara, Samarkand) and villages.  But the difficult time did not break the will of the people, who found the strength to organize resistance, stop and expel the enemy invaders from their native land. </p><h2>  Bulantin battle </h2><p>  The result of the congress held by representatives of the Kazakh zhuzes in 1726 was the organization of a unified national militia under the command of Abulkhair, the khan of the Younger zhuz.  The strategic goal was to liberate the north-eastern regions of Kazakhstan.  The allied units of the Karakalpaks and the Kirghiz came to the aid of the militia. </p><p>  In 1727 (in some sources, 1728), a significant battle took place between the rivers Bulanty and Bileuty, in the vicinity of the Alatau Mountains.  Kazakh troops, luring the enemy deep into the steppe, dramatically changed the course of the battle.  Turning around, they launched a counterattack and delivered a series of crushing blows, which threw the invaders to flight.  On rough terrain, the remnants of the enemy army were defeated.  This is one of the battles of the Kazakh-Dzungarian war, which played an important role in history. </p><p>  The victory at the Bulanta River strengthened the morale of the Kazakhs and dispelled the myth of the invincibility of the enemy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="juharizsuzsanna.blog.hu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="battle of Anracay" class="if uuid-2473188" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63354/2473188.jpg"></div><h2>  Anracay Decisive Battle </h2><p>  In December 1729, in the southeast of Lake Balkhash, a key battle of the Kazakh-Dzungarian war of the 17-18 centuries took place, which determined the further fate of Kazakhstan.  At stake were large areas of Kazakh lands: the Syr Darya, Arys, Alatau, Sarysu, Talas, Chu, and the northern Balkhash region. </p><p>  The hostilities of the warring parties were stretched over 200 kilometers and lasted for 40 days, representing the battles of individual units, countless fights and intercepts of the same strategic places.  During the battles, the jungars were driven out to the mountains of Anrakai, where the final battle took place.  The Dzungar army was defeated. </p><p>  Despite a resounding victory, the internal feuds of Kazakh feudal lords, renewed with renewed vigor, weakened the people's militia.  The Oirat army managed to make another series of raids from 1739 to 1741, until the struggle for the throne and power in Dzungaria itself began.  And in 1758, due to the invasion of the Qing army (1755), the once powerful empire of the Dzungars lay in ruins. </p><h2>  The role of Russia between the "steppe wolves" </h2><p>  Until the end of the 17th century, Moscow perceived Dzungaria as a potential enemy and among the Central Asian khans was looking for supporters.  But after the emerging threat in the Far East from the Manchurian invaders, Russia begins to consider Dzungaria as a potential ally, entering into trade relations and deals with it.  External neutrality does not prevent her from benefiting and replenishing the treasury with imperials from the Kazakh-Dzungarian war. </p><p>  Thus, the position of the Russian state in relation to two nomadic peoples was not consistent and was contradictory.  On the one hand, she was interested in the existence of the Oirat state as a counterweight to the Qing Empire, on the other, she was afraid of the strengthening of the Dzungars due to the subjugation or absorption of the Kazakhs.  Acceptance of Russian citizenship by some Kazakh rulers determines the further political course of Russia in the steppe. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="results of the Kazakh-Dzungarian war" class="if uuid-2473088" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63354/2473088.jpg"></div><h2>  The results of the Kazakh-Dzungarian war </h2><p>  By the middle of the 18th century, the <span>Dzungar Khanate</span> had lost its influence in Kazakhstan and Central Asia.  His position in the foreign political arena, as well as internal affairs, began to deteriorate. </p><p>  By 1746, the Senior Zhuz, having overthrown the burden of taxes of the Oirat feudal lords, was helping the Central Asian militias in the fight against the Oirat terror.  Losing their positions in the conquered spaces, the Oirats developed vigorous diplomatic activity in order to obtain military support from the Kazakh rulers of the Younger and <span>Middle Zhuz</span> in clashes with Kokand.  But no pressure and intimidation changed the situation.  The wars with the Kokand bekst and subsequent defeats significantly undermined the forces of Dzungaria and contributed to the fall of this state. </p><p>  It is not necessary to judge who won the Kazakh-Jungar war.  Defending their land, the Kazakh people, along with the Kyrgyz, Uzbeks and Karakalpaks, waged a difficult liberation struggle for freedom and independence. </p>
