Prior to this, the company has already released two excellent flagships.  <span>Philips W737</span> can be attributed to the middle price category.  This model is suitable for people who need a minimum of using a smartphone. </p><p>  In general, Philips focuses on the manufacture of "centenarians."  Each phone can compete with popular flagships in autonomy.  In theory, everything is somewhat different, the fact is that all the devices of this company lack optimization.  Despite the excellent battery, an unbalanced system is spending too much energy.  We‚Äôll look at what success developers have achieved with the <span>Philips Xenium W737.</span> </p><h2>  Included </h2><p>  Smartphone equipment is not particularly generous.  In addition to the instructions, there is only a charger represented by a power supply and a USB cable. </p><h2>  Giant </h2><p>  Phones <span>Philips Xenium W737 cannot</span> be confused with other models.  These are metal heavyweights that have an interesting design.  The dimensions of the smartphone turned out impressive: its weight is already 172 grams.  Case thickness 9.9 mm.  These dimensions are too large, given that the display diagonal is only 4.3 inches.  The mass of the model will not appeal to a few, although some users still joyfully spoke about the impressive size, comparing the device with a metal bar. </p>

    <p>  The smartphone is presented in a single color - dark blue.  There are no more options, which, perhaps, only conservatives will like.  Such a classic "dialer". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Body elements </h2><p>  The front is a 4.3-inch display.  Above him is a spoken speaker, an unusual vertical shape.  There are two sensors right there: proximity and light.  Well, as usual, the front camera.  Under the display are three touch buttons of the <span>Philips Xenium W737 phone.</span>  <span>Reviews</span> about them are not always positive.  The fact is that their location has changed, and it is unusual for those who previously used other phone models. </p><p>  At the top end there is a place for headphones and a lock / power button.  On the right side of the volume rocker, which is represented by two separate buttons.  On the left side there is a lever that is responsible for energy conservation.  The bottom end occupied the charger connector and the main microphone. </p><p>  The back panel turned out to be slightly smaller than the front of the smartphone, that is, the device came out trapezoidal.  The main camera is located behind, a flash nearby, and on the other hand, a speaker.  The middle of the back panel is decorated with a logo.  Interestingly, the phone is presented as a monopod, but still a small compartment on the rear panel can be found.  It occupies a third of the cover and, unlike the entire body, is made of plastic. </p>

    <p>  If you open this "lid", you can find inside two slots for SIM cards and one for a memory card.  By the way, while Philips Xenium W737 is automatically turned off. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Use </h2><p>  <span>Use this</span> device comfortably.  Although there are also dissatisfied.  The fact is that the metal is quite slippery, the body does not have any roughness.  Therefore, dropping the device is easy.  Moreover, it seems that since it is made of metal, nothing will happen to it even after a fall. </p><p>  In practice, the situation is different.  Users who drop the Philips W737 leave unflattering reviews.  The fact is that even if nothing happened to the case, the speakers or the flash could fail.  Such problems are not an isolated case, so you should be careful when using this gadget. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, the Philips W737 smartphone equipped with a 4.3-inch screen.  The resolution is only 540x960 pixels, but for such a budget phone this is a normal indicator.  In addition, comparing this smartphone with its past "brothers", it is worth noting that its density is the highest - 256 PPI. </p><p>  A TFT matrix was used for the display, but the owners are so impressed with the color rendering that they indicate similarity with AMOLED.  The sensor is sensitive and can respond to five simultaneous touches. </p><p>  The viewing angle of the screen is tolerable.  Color reproduction is good, but with maximum tilt, inversion and slight distortion are noticeable.  Also, the screen loses its color and becomes dull.  But brightness is a big problem.  In the sun, it barely saves the maximum level, so you have to cover the screen with your hand to find at least the call button. </p>

    <h2>  "Inside" </h2><p>  Phone Philips W737 equipped with a new processor.  Previous models came out under the leadership of MediaTek.  The novelty appeared with the excellent Qualcomm MSM8625 chipset.  The processor has two cores that operate at a frequency of 1.2 GHz.  They didn‚Äôt come up with anything for the graphics chipset, here it‚Äôs the same Adreno 203. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In principle, this ‚Äúfilling‚Äù is quite enough for daily tasks.  The only problem with this is with RAM, there are only 768 MB.  There is also not much internal memory, 1 GB for software, the remaining 2 GB for personal data.  At the present time, of course, this is not enough, so microSD support is very useful. </p><p>  Philips W737 works with Android 4.0.4.  The operating system without any frills.  In addition to Google applications, there is nothing more in the smartphone.  This is not to say that the gadget is ‚Äúflying‚Äù.  You can‚Äôt actively work with such budget hardware.  Also, the smartphone can not be overloaded, it is not multitasking.  When you open more than 3 applications, the phone ‚Äúlingers‚Äù and ‚Äútwitches‚Äù a little. </p><h2>  Use </h2><p>  The <span>Philips Xenium W737 smartphone</span> has a nice interface.  From the lock screen, you can immediately go to the camera menu or to applications.  The status bar shows standard notifications: battery charge, two SIM cards, time, etc. The ‚ÄúShutter‚Äù is greatly simplified.  There were only notifications on it. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="philips xenium w737 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1423578.jpg"></div>

    <p>  On the main screen, you can put widgets and shortcuts of software.  Of the standard add-ons, everything here refers to Android.  The menu is divided into three zones.  In the first - applications, in the second - widgets, in the third - a software store. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Philips Xenium W737 has mediocre camera specifications.  The main one is 5 megapixels, and the front one is only 0.3 megapixels.  Obviously, such indicators will not give good results.  In addition, it turned out that all existing manual settings change only the format and size of the image.  The rest of the photos come out ordinary.  The flash here is not very strong, so you can not count on night shots.  There is no front camera, taking a selfie will be uncomfortable, the same is with video calls. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  Philips W737 has a moderate battery performance.  Its capacity is 2400 mAh.  With continuous conversations, it‚Äôs enough for almost 11 hours.  Surfing the Internet will take about 9 hours.  The manufacturer also said that continuous video playback can be carried out for 360 minutes, in fact, the smartphone lived a little less than 5 hours.  Despite the fact that the model is not a game, it still pulls some entertaining software.  Continuous gaming will last about 3 hours. </p><p>  If we talk about normal daily use, the device can last up to 2 days without recharging.  User reviews about autonomy were different.  Of course, it all depends on the use of the gadget.  But on average, with fairly active use, it lasts for a day. </p><h2>  "The keeper" </h2><p>  Do not forget that the phone has an option that allows you to save the charge for the longest amount of time.  It is known that the main ‚Äúdevourer‚Äù of interest is the Internet, so the function ensures that its work is optimized, and in case of uselessness is completely interrupted. </p><p>  For those people who do not need the Internet, you can simply use the lever on the left side.  The power saving mode is turned on, and the phone "lives" for more than a week without recharging.  Of course, such options are available now in most gadgets, but the fact that it can be activated / deactivated without entering the smartphone‚Äôs menu is very convenient. </p>

    <h2>  Work with pictures </h2><p>  The gallery in the smartphone is ordinary.  From here you can manage photos and videos.  But you should be prepared for the fact that the work in this application is a bit slow.  Sometimes there is some slowdown, although it remains invisible to those who did not have a smartphone more powerful. </p><p>  All pictures and photos are grouped into categories.  They can be moved and transferred immediately from the menu.  It is also possible to use the built-in photo editor.  But the variety of effects here is scarce. </p><p>  If you are a fan of watching movies or TV shows, then most likely you will have to download a third-party video player, since the built-in here plays a limited number of formats, which are now less and less used. </p><h2>  Music lovers </h2><p>  The phone integrates a wonderful music player.  He distributes music in several groups.  Thus, you can find all the tracks of one artist or included in one album.  The music collection displays the name of the song, its artist and other information.  The album cover is also displayed. </p>

    <p>  The equalizer is normal.  Here, in addition to ready-made modes, you can manually adjust the sound of music.  But it is worth noting, since the model is budgetary, the external speaker does not have pronounced lower frequencies.  Sound may not seem good to everyone. </p><h2>  Work organization </h2><p>  The calendar in the smartphone is traditional, from Google.  It can be configured as a whole month, and to distribute things for a week or a day.  It is possible to configure alerts, set a specific signal and time.  For a specific event, you can select the name, year, term, place and repeat. </p><p>  The watch software is also practically unchanged for Android.  Here, as in all other phones, you can set several alarms at once, which could be triggered at the indicated frequency. </p><p>  The calculator can also be standard, with minimal options, or you can flip the screen, then its functionality will expand.  Other calculation methods will become available. </p><p>  It is also convenient that there is a standard application for working with documents.  It is very convenient and simple.  Thanks to it, you can open not only documents in the .doc format, but also files of other office programs. </p><p>  Not everyone will like the browser in the <span>Philips W737</span> .  Nevertheless, it is convenient and stable.  The only thing that you can still observe braking and freezing. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Now this model is three years old.  Only real conservatives will like the phone, since with the current changes you can buy a smartphone with the same technical characteristics, but with a more attractive design. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone philips w737" class="if" height="245" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34178/1424806.jpg" width="545"></div>

    <p>  Philips Xenium W737 entered the market with a price of 10 thousand rubles.  Now, for this price, many Chinese manufacturers have released their gadgets with <span>fingerprint scanners</span> and better cameras. </p><p>  The main advantage of this model is survival.  The case is very strong, large.  The phone feels good in the hand, it is weighty, and therefore it is almost impossible to accidentally drop it.  He copes with everyday tasks with a bang.  If you use it only as a ‚Äúdialer‚Äù, it will last more than a week without recharging. </p>
