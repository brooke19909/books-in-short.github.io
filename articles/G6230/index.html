This review introduces new and better alternatives on the Android and Windows platforms, as well as budget models and devices that are ideal for children. </p><h2>  Search for the ideal </h2><p>  Experts recommend choosing a tablet for parameters that are not inferior to those listed below. </p><ul><li>  High definition screen.  Displays with a resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels (1080p) have become common everywhere except for the cheapest tablets.  High-end models are equipped with high-definition screens.  For example, Apple iPad Pro 9.7 display resolution is 2048x1536 pixels. </li><li>  Support for multi-touch gestures.  The best tablets distinguish up to 10 touches at the same time, which ensures high responsiveness of the on-screen keyboard. </li><li>  The maximum amount of data storage.  Applications, music, and especially video, can quickly absorb flash memory.  Some cheap models come with 8 GB of ROM, but according to experts w3bsit3-dns.com, choosing a tablet with 32 GB is more preferable if you plan to use it frequently.  You also need to make sure you have an SD card slot so that you can expand the memory if necessary. </li><li>  Good connectivity.  As a rule, tablets are equipped with a built-in Wi-Fi module.  Most models also support Bluetooth.  Some devices come in versions with mobile broadband, but you will have to pay extra for this feature, as well as for data transfer. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fire hd 8" class="if uuid-2405588" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2405588.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Support for the necessary software.  Apple and Google have huge app stores.  In addition, users can use third-party app stores such as Amazon.com, although this process is not always easy.  Microsoft also offers thousands of programs in its Windows Store, although by a wide margin it lags behind other platforms.  However, Windows 10-based tablets can run all standard PC applications, which is not available on iOS or Android. </li></ul><h2>  Matching individual preferences </h2><p>  In order to make a choice of a tablet, you need to decide on a number of questions.  Will it be used for business or entertainment?  While there are many productivity-enhancing apps for tablets, regardless of platform, most owners use them for games, multimedia, and simple tasks like browsing the web and email.  Those who plan to type a lot of text should invest in a wireless keyboard, because using a virtual one is pretty tedious.  The tablets on which the full version of the Windows 10 operating system is installed have an advantage - they allow you to use any software running on this OS. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What is the optimal screen size?  It is set by the size of the display diagonally.  Choosing an 8-inch tablet will be successful for those who use it mostly in crowded public transport, reaching the place of work and back.  Models with a larger diagonal are not always convenient, but they offer a better overview and are easy to use.  They are also best suited for playing games and watching movies. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.techadvisor.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 8" class="if uuid-2405600" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2405600.jpg"></div><p>  Does the tablet support the necessary applications?  ITunes and Google Play stores provide a huge selection of software, but this does not mean that a particular program is available for both platforms.  This is best clarified before purchase. </p><p>  Is it necessary to connect to a cellular network?  According to experts, no.  Tablets can have both a Wi-Fi connection and a connection through a mobile operator.  But it is much more profitable to use only Wi-Fi, and away from the network to use the Internet connection of the smartphone.  However, when choosing a tablet, you need to make sure that the phone and the provider support this feature. </p><p>  What is the required degree of OS control?  The Apple iPad doesn't offer many customization options, but iOS has a great interface.  Google Android allows you to install widgets, keyboards and have multiple home screens, but this can confuse the user as each tablet becomes unique.  Windows combines these approaches with a customizable yet simple interface. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Tablet types </h2><p>  The Apple iPad, like the iPhone, runs on the Apple iOS operating system.  The tablet has an excellent interface, but its settings are inferior to Android or Windows.  The iTunes store offers the largest library of applications, and this advantage is even more noticeable when it comes to programs optimized for working with a larger screen than a smartphone. </p><p>  Android devices are very diverse, as it is an open operating system, and manufacturers can modify it to fit their requirements.  Some go to extremes by creating unrecognizable interfaces and offer their own app store.  Amazon Fire tablets are perhaps the most famous example of this type of device.  They have a smaller app store than Google Play, which in turn is inferior to iTunes.  Android devices are usually cheaper than the Apple iPad.  A good model can be purchased for less than 12 thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.imore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Apple iPad Air 2" class="if uuid-2405598" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2405598.jpg"></div><p>  Parents who are looking for a gift for a child are faced with the need to choose a high-performance tablet that would restrict access to the dark side of the Internet.  Many ‚Äúchildren's‚Äù devices run on a significantly modified version of Android, which ensures the safety of the ‚Äúplayground‚Äù.  Theoretically, it prevents access to the part of the Internet that parents consider objectionable. </p><p>  IOS and Android tablets can be used to work.  But if such an application is a top priority, it may make sense to purchase a Windows device.  It differs by more powerful processors (usually Intel Atom) and can run any program for a PC.  There is also an app store, but it's smaller than Apple or Google. </p><h2>  Choose a tablet by size </h2><p>  Users can access models with different screen sizes, from 7 ‚Äùto 20‚Äù or more.  They can be divided into two categories.  Tablets with a diagonal of 9 ‚Äùor more are considered large, the rest are small.  9‚Äì10-inch tablets are ideal for watching high-definition movies on the couch or in a comfortable chair.  Devices with smaller screens are usually cheaper and ideal for reading in bed and more practical in public transport. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.inquisitr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Stylus for iPad Pro 9.7" class="if uuid-2405595" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2405595.jpg"></div><h2>  Apple iPad Pro 9.7 </h2><p>  This tablet is a cut above other competitors.  Experts and users unanimously claim that the iPad Pro 9.7 is the best device of this type that you can buy.  It is distinguished by an almost perfect balance of power and mobility.  Although some may prefer a 13 ‚Äùscreen model, experts recommend choosing a 10-inch tablet, which is more convenient to use.  In size, it is almost identical to the iPad Air 2, but differs in the best display, sound, camera and powerful processor with no less battery life (10 hours).  IPad Pro models, unlike others, support the Apple Pencil stylus. </p><p>  If the iPad Pro seems too expensive, you should consider buying the cheapest iPad.  They all work better than most Android tablets. </p><p>  Apple supports its iPad with a one-year warranty, but they rarely break.  According to experts, only 6% of them undergo repairs during the first two years of operation. </p><h2>  Best Android tablets </h2><p>  For those who don‚Äôt have enough money to buy Apple devices, until recently, the Nvidia Shield K1 was the best choice.  Originally developed for gaming, the K1 has proven to be the best Android tablet.  Unlike most other models, it uses a clean version of the OS without adware or unnecessary software.  According to user reviews, the <span>Nvidia Shield</span> K1 was distinguished by the ability to quickly browse the web and the uninterrupted display of movies on an 8 ‚Äùscreen.  K1 could broadcast games to a TV and received an image of a game running on a PC with a graphics card. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nvidia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="NVIDIA SHIELD tablet K1" class="if uuid-2405586" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2405586.jpg"></div><h2>  Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 8 </h2><p>  According to experts, this tablet leaves almost the same impression as the iPad.  The model features an ultra-slim body and a clear 8 ‚Äùscreen.  There is also a version with a large 9.7 ‚Äùdisplay that looks like an iPad Air.  Owners like the Galaxy Tab S2, but it lags behind the iPad Air 2 both in speed and battery life. </p><h2>  The best budget models </h2><p>  The network has a large selection of Chinese tablets, which cost less than 6 thousand rubles.  Unfortunately, most of them are disappointing.  Amazon Fire HD 8 is one of very few exceptions.  It is durable, fast, easy to use, but it has a big drawback. </p><p>  Technically, Amazon Fire tablets run on Android OS, but their users do not have official access to Google Play (although, like in many other cases, there are ways to get around this limitation, but they will have to be searched for on their own).  Instead, all purchases are made in the Amazon app store, whose offer is very limited (for example, there is no Microsoft Office). </p><p>  Nevertheless, critics point out that Fire's target audience simply wants to have a tablet for browsing the web, movies, and also for games.  And Fire HD 8 does a great job of this.  In addition, if you have already purchased Amazon content, the tablet makes it easy to access it and, of course, buy more. </p><p>  Those who used the iPad before will still feel that this model is a step back, but at the price of the cheapest Apple model, you can buy 3 of these tablets.  Fire HD 8 has a pretty good 8 ‚Äùscreen and good speakers, a solid battery life, and allows you to talk with a virtual assistant Alex (version of Siri).  The battery charges for ages (6 hours), and the camera is mediocre.  But in general, despite small flaws, it is impossible to find a tablet with similar functions and performance at the same price. </p><h2>  Amazon fire </h2><p>  This is an even more budget tablet choice.  It provides the same features as its older brother Fire HD 8, and costs only 3 thousand rubles.  Although this is not the best choice of a tablet with a 7-inch screen, but it is the most budget option. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fire Kids Edition Tablet" class="if uuid-2405589" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2405589.jpg"></div><h2>  Amazon Fire Kids Edition </h2><p>  The tablet comes with a thick, soft rubber bumper and a 2-year warranty, according to which the manufacturer promises to replace the device without further questions if it stops working or breaks. </p><p>  Kids Edition costs more than regular Fire, because it has more functionality.  In addition to a rugged enclosure and a long warranty, Kids Edition provides a safe gaming environment.  Parents can create up to 4 separate profiles for children and adults, specifying in advance what content may be available to each of them.  Internet profiles and app purchases are disabled on children's profiles, and parents can set time limits for various activities, such as games or watching videos. </p><p>  It also provides a one-year free service at Amazon FreeTime Unlimited.  The service is intended for children from 3 to 12 years of age, who offers unlimited access to games, educational applications, books, television shows and films that are appropriate for their age, including from Disney, Nickelodeon, PBS, etc. After this period, you will be charged for using the service monthly fee. </p><p>  No other tablet for children can compare with this model - Amazon Fire Kids Edition is called the best by many special publications and users. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Microsoft Surface Pro 4" class="if uuid-2405603" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2405603.jpg"></div><h2>  Surface Pro 4 </h2><p>  Today, every Microsoft tablet or convertible laptop runs on the full version of the Windows 10 operating system. A clear favorite in this category is the 12-inch Surface Pro 4. The manufacturer offers it as a full replacement for the laptop.  The basic version comes with an Intel Core m3 processor, 128 GB of ROM and 4 GB of RAM, and the most productive model is equipped with an Intel Core i7 CPU, 512 GB of permanent and 16 GB of RAM. </p><p>  Users and experts rate this choice of a tablet on Windows positively.  They find the Surface Pro 4 powerful, fast and elegant with a wonderfully responsive touchscreen.  The keyboard is sold separately and increases the price of the device by 7.5 thousand rubles.  In addition, Surface Pro 4 has a one-year warranty.  However, when choosing a Microsoft tablet, you should remember that every fifth of them breaks during the first two years of work. </p>
