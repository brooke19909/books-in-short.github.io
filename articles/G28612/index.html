And I want to note it in a special way.  An excellent gift option will be spring bouquets.  It‚Äôs not so difficult to create them yourself.  The main thing is the availability of materials, imagination and a bit of free time. </p><h2>  What to make of? </h2><p>  The most fertile material for crafts of such a plan can be called corrugated paper, or crepe.  It is not only easy to fold and cut, but also allows you to create a wide variety of forms. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself spring bouquets" class="if" height="348" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/749602.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Volume gives the flowers the opportunity in some places to stretch the corrugation.  Petals are obtained with natural bends and bulges. </p><p>  Spring bouquets made by yourself from corrugated paper are noticeably distinguished also due to its subtlety.  The same flowers from office sheets look coarse and sloppy even with perfect precision working with them. </p><p>  You can buy crepe paper in any stationery store.  It is better to give preference to the thicker version.  From thin paper, it is quite difficult for beginners to create. </p><h2>  Color options </h2><p>  At home, you can create a spring bouquet with your own hands even with your children.  But first you need to decide what kind of bouquet is needed. </p><p>  Primarily in the spring in honor of primroses.  But creating them is not easy unless you have certain skills.  Therefore, you can beat the spring theme in daisies, gerberas and carnations.  The main thing here is to choose the gentle pastel shades of the paper itself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Bouquets, the basis of which is made on living branches, also look beautiful.  Withstanding the proportion of flowers, the craftswomen get gorgeous blooming apple trees, cherries, sakura. </p><p>  Well, of course, do not forget about roses.  There are several ways to create them.  But each of them allows you to get as close as possible to the natural version of the flower.  Thus, <span>do-it-yourself spring</span> bouquets should always be done when there is a reason and mood for this. </p><h2>  The simplest of the simplest </h2><p>  We recommend starting the production of flowers from the simplest colors.  These are chrysanthemums and carnations.  The technologies for their manufacture are different, but the level of complexity is approximately similar. </p><p>  In order to have a spring bouquet in the house, made up of crepe chrysanthemums with your own hands, you need to cut a strip of the desired width across the roll.  We fold along the corrugation with its accordion.  The more strips you get, the better.  Next, fold the accordion in half and give the shape to the petals: on the one hand, cut the edge in a semicircle, and on the other, cut out small notches, trying not to cut the accordion completely.  In places of the recesses, we bind the workpiece with a dense thread.  Then it‚Äôs up to the small thing - to form a voluminous flower from the petals and plant it not on the stem-base. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  We make cloves from the same strip.  Just wrap it on a wooden base with the bottom edge.  The top of the strip can be stretched a little to add more splendor to the flower.  This is not a complicated craft at all.  A spring bouquet, made with your own hands of such flowers, will delight everyone who sees it. </p><h2>  Solid ribbon of petals </h2><p>  Creating <span>flowers from corrugated paper is</span> easier if you do not cut each petal separately, but create a ribbon from them.  This method is based on the principle of clove assembly.  Only in it the petals are not cut, but only a little stretched. </p><p>  A ribbon of petals looks like this: several of them are interconnected approximately in the middle.  They are made all the same accordion, but they are not folded in half, and they are cut along the workpiece in the shape of a petal, without cutting quite a bit on the sides. </p><p>  Next, you need to give them a form.  The central part is stretched in one direction, as if creating a small pocket, and the top of the petal is twisted in the same direction.  It turns out an excellent blank for a rose, which is then wound on a stem base.  Later, ready-made spring bouquets, made by the whole family with their own hands, are assembled from them. </p><h2>  Snowdrops and tulips </h2><p>  Primroses are truly festive flowers.  Such spring bouquets with their own hands in kindergarten can be created by kids as a gift for March Eighth or <span>Mother's Day.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  The technology for making petals is simple.  We cut narrow and long strips along the corrugation.  Fold it exactly in the middle, turn it 360 degrees at the bend point, and fold both parts together.  The place of rotation will be the top of the petal.  We straighten it and stretch it a bit, making it convex. </p><p>  The finished flower is assembled very simply: 1 petal is wound onto the base with a thread, overlapping a second one and completing the third crown.  It is necessary to calculate the width of the overlap so that it is 3 petals that create the finished flower.  At the end we wind the stem with green paper and wind a leaf of the same color a long leaf or two, depending on the idea. </p><h2>  Delicate crocuses </h2><p>  Here we have already learned how to make the simplest spring bouquets with our own hands.  You can try to create something more complex.  For example, take tender crocuses from crepe. </p><p>  For work, you need paper in purple, green and pale yellow.  Cut a strip of yellow paper and cut it into several narrow stripes, which are twisted into a tube.  It is important not to cut them to the end, but leave them as a ribbon of petals.  It will be stamens. </p><p>  From purple paper, cut oval petals.  We twist them a little along the edge, creating a dense outer frame.  From green paper in the same way we make long leaves. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself spring bouquets of corrugated paper" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/749597.jpg" width="453"></div>

    <p>  We collect flowers on a flexible <span>floristic wire.</span>  First we wrap stamens on it and fix it.  Then we attach the petals.  Each following should find a little on the previous.  For one flower, use 5 petals.  Wrap the stem with green paper and glue the leaf.  It remains only to form a ready-made bouquet and present. </p><h2>  Apple tree color </h2><p>  There is another interesting craft.  Do-it-yourself spring bouquet is mounted on a natural twig.  This is actually not a bouquet, but an imitation of a flowering tree.  Its implementation requires a certain skill and skills. </p><p>  The job description looks like this.  We select the base branch on which the maximum number of small knots.  These will be the places on which the flowers are attached. </p><p>  Making them is very similar to crocuses.  Only the shape of the petals is rounder at the top, and the crown itself is more ragged. </p><p>  The main thing here is to withstand the plausible form of a flower and leaves.  Everything else is a matter of technology.  Flowers are collected separately.  First stamens, then petals.  Then with glue they are attached to the branch. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself spring bouquets in kindergarten" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/749598.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <p>  One or three flowering branches will delight you for more than one month, because the advantage of such bouquets is that they do not fade and do not crumble. </p><h2>  Bouquets with a surprise </h2><p>  You can do not quite ordinary spring bouquets <span>with your own hands.</span>  <span>Photos of</span> such masterpieces will be the property of a family photo album, and a surprise hidden in a flower will delight the person to whom this bouquet is intended. </p><p>  The secret of this gift lies in the fact that candies are used as the core.  Sweetness is first attached to the stamens.  In this case, it is very important not to damage its factory packaging. </p><p>  When the core is firmly fixed, a flower gathers around it.  You can use the simplest methods.  The main thing is to do it with the soul. </p><p>  If it is not possible to collect a neat flower, you can try to attach candy on the stem, creating a sweet bunch.  She will be the highlight of the composition. </p><p>  For such purposes, it is better to take sweets with a bright and colorful wrapper.  Or you can wrap them with beautiful wrapping paper.  In this case, success is guaranteed. </p>

    <h2>  Reason for creativity </h2><p>  You can create spring <span>flowers from corrugated paper</span> for any reason.  To do this, it is not necessary to wait for the holiday. </p><p>  Children 5-8 years old will be happy to help mothers in this exciting undertaking.
