Therefore, the tourism business is not so easy to undermine.  Even if Egypt begins to appear in the roundup, don‚Äôt worry and boldly go on vacation.  No political upheaval will affect the two main resorts of the country: Hurghada and Sharm El Sheikh.  Here we are a little and decided on <span>where to relax</span> in Egypt.  These two cities are separated by the Red Sea, and each has its own characteristics, including climatic ones.  Do not forget that over the past 50 years, resorts have grown and now represent entire clusters of villages, stretching along the coast for 100 or more kilometers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to relax in Egypt" class="if" height="318" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/236999.jpg" width="565"></div>

    <p>  Every vacation we plan, based on our financial capabilities.  And in this sense, the question of when is the best time to relax in Egypt plays a key role.  Since the price of tickets is very dependent on the season.  The most favorable climatic characteristics are April-May and October-November.  There is still no suffocating heat, and the water has already managed to warm up (or has not yet cooled down).  Also, prices soar fabulously during the holidays: starting from Catholic to <span>Orthodox Christmas.</span>  It is also expensive during the period of March 8, for the <span>May weekend.</span>  The fall in prices is observed in early December (until the 20th day), in January-February.  In summer, you can also buy quite affordable packages, since Egypt and Turkey are competing with the Mediterranean countries.  And not everyone can withstand the African heat.  The hottest month in the <span>resorts of Egypt</span> is September. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to relax in Egypt" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/237000.jpg" width="600"></div>  Based on what time you plan to come, you should choose where it is better to relax in Egypt.  The coast of Hurghada is too open to the winds, and the sea is shallow.  Therefore, December (when the water still stores summer heat), as well as the summer months and September (when the breeze from the sea softens the heat) will be optimal for relaxation here.  Sharm El Sheikh, protected from the north by the mountains, will give winter vacationers quite comfortable temperature indicators of water and air.  But we should not forget that this resort is considered the most fashionable, and the prices here are not very much and fall out of season.

In January, when sandstorms fly from the desert, Domina Bay is quiet and calm.  And in Safaga almost always a fresh wind blows, which is why this resort is a favorite place for windsurfers.  An important role in choosing where to relax in Egypt is played by the beaches.  In Sharm el-Sheikh, they are mostly pebble, and in Hurghada - pure snow-white or golden sand.  However, before deciding on a particular hotel, you should study the visitor‚Äôs feedback on entering the sea: not everywhere the coast is clear of sharp stones and corals, but in some places it‚Äôs very far to go to the depths.

    <p>  Everyone has a different concept of a successful vacation, and our preferences should also be considered when deciding where to relax in Egypt.  Fans of diving and snorkeling will love the resorts of Sharm el-Sheikh, since there are more beautiful coral reefs than there, anywhere else in the world.  Especially popular among divers is the resort of El Quseir.  For relaxing with young children, Makadi is best suited.  But for those who like to "hang out" to the question of where it is better to relax in Egypt, there is only one answer: in the central hotels of Hurghada or Sharm El Sheikh.  But what if you planned a rich excursion program?  Then a more convenient launching pad for trips is Hurghada. </p>
