About 80 thousand tourists a year come here on average.  They are attracted by the amazing combination of lakes, stone, ice and the combination of underground tunnels into one large maze.  This is an incredible beauty that will not leave anyone without impressions.  Not only Russians, but also thousands of people from other countries seek to see a miracle.  The cave stretched for 5.7 km.  The excursion path is 1.5 km.

Those who love history also have a place to go.  130 km from Perm is an ethnographic park that will leave an unforgettable experience.  Here you can observe how the peasants lived hundreds of years ago.  The <span>open-air museum</span> features buildings that have survived from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  You can see houses, forges, shops for trade and much more.  The most interesting thing is that a tourist can touch everything with his own hands, feel on himself how people lived many years ago.  Near the museum flows <span>the Chusovaya River,</span> near which you can relax with the whole family, have a picnic, go fishing, and swim. </p><h2>  Adovo Lake and Monastery on White Mountain </h2><p>  There are many legends about different reservoirs of the Perm Territory.  However, Adovo Lake is considered the most popular.  It is located where the watershed of the tributaries of the left side of the modern Kama passes now.  The area around the lake is swampy.  In its shape, a bird's eye resembles an egg.  About 3.68 square meters.  km covers its area, and the depth is approximately 5-6 meters.  Surprisingly, the water in it is extremely clear, although the shores are very low and viscous.  Near Kungur is a monastery of extraordinary beauty on the <span>White Mountain.</span>  For Orthodox people this is a special place.  By the way, the mountain is called so because the snow that has fallen here lies for a long time and almost never melts.  It was on this hill that the St. Nicholas Monastery was erected. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="stone city photo" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/440028.jpg" width="500"></div>

On its shore is located Glyadenovskaya mountain.  If you climb to its top, you can watch the beautiful view - from here open spaces for several kilometers.  You can see the river Mulyanka, and Kama, and the picturesque <span>nature of the Urals.</span> </p><h2>  Stone Town (Perm) </h2><p>  Over the past few decades, this place is considered a favorite destination for tourists.  It is easy to get here by transport, which is why people often come in whole groups for the weekend.  Stone Town is the modern name of this place.  Previously, it was called differently - Devil's hillfort.  This place is truly mesmerizing.  Throughout the territory there are many stones.  But they are very harmoniously combined, form compositions from streets, passages.  So, it seems that you are in a real city.  It seems that all this was built on purpose: all these streets, avenues, squares.  The stone city is so confused that it looks like a maze, so you need to be careful if you came here for the first time.  The symbols of this place are turtles, rats, seals and others.  This is due to the fact that some combinations of stones resemble the images of these animals. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="natural attractions of the Perm region" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/440024.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  History of occurrence </h2><p>  Of course, there are many legends about this place.  It is believed that once instead of joining stones there was a beautiful city where people of unearthly kindness lived, everything always blossomed, culture developed.  The king had a daughter who did not see anything, since she was blind.  Only she could not appreciate the beauty that surrounds her.  An evil sorcerer came to the rescue.  He invited the king to cure the child, and he, without hesitation for a long time, agreed.  At that moment, when the sight was returned to the heiress, the whole city turned into stone, so the princess had no choice but to enjoy the beauty of the stone.  Of course, the legend very beautifully describes the history of creation, but scientists are in no hurry to agree with it.  It is believed that it was on the site of stone houses and streets that the river used to flow.  The power of water has pierced such sculptures.  As a result, a city was formed.  It consists of quartz fine-grained sandstone and Lower Carboniferous.  The stone city is located at an altitude of 526 m (the peak of the Rudyansky Spoya).  The entire rock mass is strewn with different cracks, which reach up to 12 meters in depth.  The unusual <span>natural complex of the</span> Ural Mountains is the result of natural elements.  Water, glacier, wind, the change of geological eras - all this contributed to the creation of a unique landscape.  If you climb to the top of the Stone Town, you can observe the beauty of the taiga of the Urals. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of the Perm region" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/440023.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Items </h2><p>  The whole stone complex is divided into the Big City and Small Town.  The distance between them is about 200-300 meters.  It is difficult to find the Small Town; there is only an inconspicuous path that leads to it.  It consists of four remnants, which are also surprisingly beautiful.  Leaky Stone and Slit are particularly attractive. </p><h2>  Visit Features </h2><p>  A large number of tourists coming to the Perm Territory visit the Stone Town in late August or early autumn.  This time is considered the peak of the influx of people.  This is due to the fact that in the fall, when different colorful palettes fill the nature, Stone Town (photo presented in the article) is unusually beautiful.  Particularly frequent guests here are climbers.  The Stone Town hosts a large number of athletes annually.  Climbing competitions are often held here - after all, all the conditions for their holding are created.  Competitions are usually held in the summer.  At the same time, festivals are organized.  Among the natural scenery are performances, performances.  In general, you can spend a good time in the Stone Town all year round.  Many tourists stay here overnight in tents.  However, going to the Stone Town, you need to stock up on water, since there are no sources nearby.  By the way, if you wish, you can also visit <span>Usvinsky Pillars,</span> which are located on the Usva River, and the caves of Sukhoi Log.  They are no less attractive than Stone Town.  Excursions to these places are usually on foot, since it is very difficult to get directly to the complex by car or bus. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="stone city perm" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/440022.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  How to get to this amazing place </h2><p>  The stone city is located about 200 kilometers from Perm.  Getting here is very easy.  First you need to go to the Perm-Kizel highway and move to the village of Usva.  Further it will remain to drive quite a bit before the sign "Stone Town" appears.  It is installed near the turn to the village of Yubileiny.  The main thing is not to drive the right turn onto the dirt road.  As we have said, driving a car will be problematic.  Therefore, the rest of the way you need to walk (1 km).  For cars there is a special parking.  Of course, public transport can also be used to get to Stone Town.  But in this way it is not very convenient to get to the right road, since all buses / trains go to the village of Usva.  You will have to change planes in Chusovoy and then go on foot to Yubileiny, first about a kilometer from Usva along the road towards Kizel, then 5 kilometers to Yubileiny.  The only minibus that travels to the village leaves every day at about 2 p.m.  But you will have to go back under your own power or go along the way, since the necessary transport runs only in the morning. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Perm region stone city" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/440021.jpg" width="334"></div>
