No matter how wild it may sound, people still beat others, calling themselves a "civilized society."  Some countries continue to beat children in schools for their pranks and misconduct.  Even in our Slavic states, some schools still use a kind of ‚Äúpunishment with rods‚Äù - teachers slap the hands of disobedient or guilty students with a ruler.  Moreover, none of them thinks about whether such education is right.  None of the teachers suspects that their behavior violates the rights of the child and the law.

    <p>  At all times, punishment with rods was one of the types of punishment for criminal offenses, which in our time is usually called "less serious" and "moderate."  These are such as <span>petty hooliganism,</span> resistance to arrest, petty theft, loan default, and many others, for which it was too cruel to go to jail, but you just had to disgrace a person.  This was done mainly publicly. </p><p>  In parish and Sunday schools, corporal punishment is also used, namely the very punishment with the rods described above.  This applies to both children coming to an educational institution and adults, such as singers or accountants.  Only in this case does it qualify not at all as a punishment for a criminal offense, but rather as lynching a helpless person.  However sad it may be, it is, and it is a fact.  They can be punished in this way with a blessing in the parish, for example, for systematic lateness.  This is considered quite normal, although it looks wild for a normal person. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="women's punishment" class="if" height="283" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14597/159524.jpg" width="440"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In eastern countries, women are punished with rods, for example, for disobedience, for disobedience to her husband, etc. As far back as the century before last, in 1807, a "work house" was created in Amsterdam, where they brought girls who led an indecent lifestyle, drank alcohol without measure, engaged in profligacy, did not want to be decent young ladies, dishonoring the female half of humanity.  They were kept in these institutions from one year to correction, worked there, lived according to the prison regime, wore special dresses.  From time to time they were flogged for prevention, thinking that they were corrected in this way. </p><p>  In Hungary, to this day the punishment with rods is official.  In ancient times, in this country, landowners simply considered it their duty to prescribe 25 lashes to their peasants, who took this as the great disposition of the owner to their person.  And the girls saw the true hero in that worker who withstood the flogging.  The peasants tried to behave as quietly as possible, not to make a single sound, taking the punishment with rods. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Punishment Stories" class="if" height="322" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14597/162701.jpg" width="468"></div>  Tales of such a hero did not fall silent if he accepted this (it is not clear only for what) quietly and silently.

    <p>  Whatever it was, but this type of punishment is the real savagery of modern society.  People who call themselves "civilized" simply do not have the right to spoil someone else's body, to spoil it with scars.  Physical bullying should not have a place in our world.  You can punish people with work, loneliness, exile, money - it will be much more humane and civilized.  Soon, everyone will refuse this <span>type of punishment</span> in favor of kindness and humanity. </p>
