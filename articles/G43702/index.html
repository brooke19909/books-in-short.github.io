Photos and reviews of tourists.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Cape Martyan is one of the few places on the <span>southern coast of Crimea</span> where you can fully enjoy the unique nature of the peninsula.  This territory, fortunately, is still free from continuous cottage development and recreational infrastructure.  How to get here, what's interesting to see?  About this - in our article. </p><h2>  Cape Martyan (Crimea): geography and natural conditions </h2><p>  The cape is located on the <span>southern coast of Crimea,</span> near the city of Yalta.  It was formed as a result of lengthy geological processes and neotectonic movements, as a result of which part of the Nikitsky mountain range broke away and descended in the form of fragments to the sea.  So, in fact, Cape Martyan appeared on the map of Crimea. </p><p>  This territory is very strongly divided by beams and ravines.  The cape massif in places abruptly breaks off to the Black Sea, forming picturesque rocky cliffs up to 150 meters high. </p>

    <p>  The climate of this territory is drier and warmer than in the neighboring city (meaning Yalta).  The nature of the reserve is unique and very valuable, since the primary landscapes of the southern coast of the peninsula are preserved here.  The cape is reliably protected from the cold northerly winds by the main ridge of the Crimean mountains, so sharp temperature drops are not observed here.  The soil on the cape is represented by brown soils typical of the subtropic zone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The history and modernity of the reserve </h2><p>  Cape Martyan (Crimea) became a nature reserve in February 1973.  When it was created, three main goals were pursued, first of all: </p><ol><li>  Preservation of the natural landscape of the cape. </li><li>  Protection of rare species of plants and animals on the territory. </li><li>  Conducting scientific work and research. </li></ol><p>  It should be noted that Cape Martyan is the only nature reserve in Crimea that does not have its legal status (including accounts, seals and directors).  After all, he, in fact, is only a department of the Nikitsky Botanical Garden. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the modernity of the protected area is fraught with numerous violations.  So, garden workers and other unidentified persons illegally rest on the beaches of Cape Martyan.  There have been recorded cases of tree felling, mussel fishing, and bonfire breeding, which is strictly prohibited in the reserves.  In addition, the lack of protection contributes to the fact that boats and yachts of vacationers calmly enter the reserved water area. </p><p>  Numerous excursions in Crimea actively invite tourists and vacationers to visit this unusual corner of the Crimean nature.  The reserve, by the way, is one of the smallest in Europe.  Its area is only 240 hectares. </p><h2>  Cape Martyan: how to get there? </h2><p>  The easiest way to get to Cape Martyan is from the village of Nikita.  You can get there by bus number 34 or number 29.  You need to get off at the Meteorological Station. </p>

    <p>  It is worth noting that to visit the reserve it is recommended to purchase a special ticket at the box office of the Nikitsky Botanical Garden.  Excursions in the Crimea will always be more enjoyable if they do not violate the laws.  Then there will be no problems with local foresters either.  Moving through the reserve is allowed only within the ecological path.  Camping, camps or bonfires are also impossible, of course. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In general, the reserves of Yalta, including Martyan, will be happy to meet any tourist and guest of the peninsula. </p><h2>  Flora and fauna of the reserve </h2><p>  Within the protected area, there are 540 species of plants, 38 of which are Red Book.  It is very difficult to imagine how all this diversity of flora fit on a small piece of land of 240 hectares!  It‚Äôs definitely not without some magic! </p>

    <p>  The most exotic plant in the reserve can be called small-fruited strawberries.  Popularly, he is better known as "shameless."  Such a nickname is no coincidence.  In summer, the plant throws off a brownish coarse bark, exposing the soft pink "skin".  Small-fruited strawberries - the only wild evergreen tree in Crimea.  All the rest (including laurel and magnolias) were brought to the peninsula during this or that period of history. </p><p>  The reserve boasts another natural treasure.  We are talking about a whole grove of juniper high, which has been preserved on the slopes of the coastal massif.  Similar juniper groves in the Crimea can be counted on the fingers.  Already only for this fact, Cape Martyan was worthy to become a reserve. </p><p>  The fauna of the reserve is over a thousand different species of animals.  Of these, 18 species of mammals, 150 species of birds, 70 species of fish and seven hundred (!) Species of insects.  It is worth noting that about half of the entire avifauna of Crimea nests on Cape Martyan. </p>

    <p>  The animals listed in the Red Book also live in the reserve.  This <span>snake is yellow-bellied</span> and leopard, the Crimean gecko, and other species. </p><h2>  Reviews on Cape Martian </h2><p>  Reviews of tourists about this place are only positive.  One of the guests of the reserve surprisingly accurately noted that, getting on Cape Martyan, it seems that you have acquired wings. </p><p>  In the reserve you can wander along wild trails, walk along the pebbles of deserted beaches, admire the stone chaos and beautiful rocky ledges.  Many people like to just sit on the beach and watch the oncoming waves.  For lovers of antiquity there is also a surprise here.  The remains of the Ruskofil-Kale fortress dating back to the 13th century have been preserved on the territory of the reserve. </p><p>  Cape Martian Nature Reserve is a great place to watch dolphins.  In its water area, these marine inhabitants appear often.  Tourists also love the local Valley of Ghosts - picturesque piles of stone sculptures located in the middle of a protected forest. </p>

    <p>  Tourists warn that mobile communications are often not caught within the cape.  True, there is no need for it when the goal is complete unity with nature. </p><h2>  Finally... </h2><p>  Not a single ecological route for traveling around the Crimea can ignore this reserve.  A very small piece of land is striking in the diversity of the plant world.  And the panorama of the coastline of the peninsula, which opens from the cape, is worthy of the brush of the greatest artists! </p><p>  Therefore, if you are a lover of traveling independently in the Crimea, be sure to visit the unique reserve on Cape Martyan. </p>
