    <h2>  Dimensions and Weight </h2><p>  The first thing that many people pay attention to is the size of the phone.  It's no secret that it is now accepted that large models are better than small ones.  In some situations, this is true.  But, as practice shows, using a bulky smartphone is not always convenient.  "Sony Xperia C3" reviews in this regard gets pretty good. </p><p>  After all, this model is really large.  It is 156 millimeters in length, 79 in width and 7.9 in thickness.  To some extent, we are dealing with a <span>thin smartphone.</span>  But it weighs quite a lot.  As much as 150 grams.  As practice shows, this is a very large indicator.  After all, on average, the weight of a modern phone ranges from 130 to 140 grams.  But the ‚ÄúSony‚Äù has a slight advantage.  As customers say, you always feel your smartphone in your pocket or bag.  It is heavy, which means it‚Äôs difficult to lose it.  Nevertheless, it is worth considering - a child with such a device will not be very convenient to handle.  Although children are now adapting to the size of tablets and mobile phones extremely quickly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Display </h2><p>  <span>"Sony Xperia C3</span> Dual" gets quite good reviews and regarding its screen.

For example, many pay attention to the processor of the device and its operating system.  Without these indicators it is very difficult to imagine what kind of phone will be in front of us.  "Sony Xperia C3" reviews in this regard gets quite good.  But why? </p><p>  The thing is that this particular smartphone model is equipped with a very good processor.  It has 4 cores, each with 1.2 GHz power.  This is an extremely high rate for a modern phone.  Yes, you can search for 8 cores, but often it‚Äôs just extra power, which only gives a huge margin on the device.  As practice shows, the Sony Xperia C3 has a processor that is quite suitable to receive gaming status.  So, it will be powerful and reliable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony Xperia S3 dual phone reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/972234.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Sony Xperia C3 Dual also receives feedback on the installed operating system.  This time we will have to deal with the already familiar and familiar ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù.  Yes, that's just the new version - 4.4.  Perhaps you do not have to worry over time with updates and downloading some additional files to ensure the speed and good operation of the phone system.  The only drawback that sometimes confuses buyers is that very soon assembly of version 5.1 will become popular.  So far, there are few applications and games on it, so you can not think about updating.  But in a couple of years this process will have to be carried out.  So far, you can choose "Sony Xperia C3" quietly.  According to the manufacturer, there should not be a problem with updating to version 5.1. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  RAM </h2><p>  But not everything is so good with our phone.  "Sony <span>Xperia C3"</span> owner <span>reviews</span> in this regard gets mixed.  Yes, many of them more reflect some advantages of the model, but sometimes flaws are also mentioned.  For example, not all customers like the proposed amount of RAM.  It is only 1 GB.  This is enough for a business phone.  But here as a game - not enough. </p><p>  In general, most modern phones contain from 2 to 4 GB of RAM.  This is enough to comfortably launch content.  But 1 GB is not enough.  This means that you will not succeed in launching modern innovations in the gaming industry.  Even considering that the processor of the Sony Xperia S3 smartphone is extremely powerful.  This fact repels many.  But, as practice shows, RAM is enough for entertainment and work here.  The main thing is not to overdo it with games.  Otherwise, 1 GB of RAM is a normal indicator of the performance of a powerful smartphone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony xperia c3 reviews mint" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/972233.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Built place </h2><p>  Reviews on the phone "Sony Xperia C3 Dual" - is not uncommon.  And rarely does anyone lose sight of such a fact as the availability of free space on a smartphone.  Perhaps all the owners of the model are talking about this feature.  The reviews here, to be honest, are not the best.  After all, there is not enough free space.  Only 8 GB.  And at the same time it is worth considering that after the purchase we will have access to about 6.5-7 gigabytes.  The rest is occupied by the operating system and other telephone resources. </p><p>  Smartphone "Sony Xperia C3" reviews, as you see, receive is not always good.  In principle, 7 GB is enough for work.  But if you want to have fun (play games, surf the Internet, watch movies and so on), then this space is very small.  Sometimes the lack of space makes you abandon the phone.  But fortunately, Sony Xperia C3 gets good customer reviews in terms of expanding free space. </p><h2>  Memory card </h2><p>  We are talking about the possibility of connecting a special memory card to the device.  The thing is that many modern smartphones do not have such an opportunity.  But often they are initially offered more internal memory - from 16 to 32 GB.  And then, buyers refuse such models. </p><p>  The Sony Xperia C3 phone receives extremely positive reviews in this regard because you can additionally connect a MicroSD card (the most popular format) up to 128 GB in size.  But according to customers, it‚Äôs best to choose 64 GB.  In this case, you can completely fill the memory card with information.  But in cases with 128 GB of space on the card you will have to leave about 2-3 GB empty.  Otherwise, you will begin to experience various crashes and malfunctions of the operating system.  And this is not a very pleasant phenomenon. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony xperia c3 specifications reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/972232.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  It is also worth mentioning such a small but very important point, as the device‚Äôs camera.  It is with regard to this issue that huge disputes erupt between the owners.  So it‚Äôs impossible to say what exactly the Sony Xperia S3 receives.  Mint, black or other colors of the phone - it does not matter, this is not about that now.  Rather, they are mixed, mixed. </p><p>  The thing is that in this model there are two cameras.  The first is frontal.  Needed for selfie and video calls.  She shoots with 5 megapixel quality.  Most buyers claim that this is a very good indicator.  But not everyone is happy with the rear camera.  It allows you to receive images with a quality of 8 megapixels.  According to the owners, many analogues can offer better cameras.  But if you take into account the price of the device, then for the most part the owners will agree that this characteristic of the smartphone is worthy of attention. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  As you can see, the Sony Xperia S3 smartphone doesn‚Äôt receive the most ideal reviews.  But not terrible.  True, many complaints about this model are related to the battery.  The whole problem is that here it is fixed.  So, if something happens, changing it will be extremely difficult. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony Xperia C3 Owner Reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/972231.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In addition, the owners are not impressed with the operating time of the device.  The decent battery capacity is 2,500 mAh.  However, the battery runs out extremely quickly.  In standby mode, the smartphone can spend 3 weeks, with minor use - 14 days, and in cases of active use - only 2 days.  Fortunately, the device charges quickly.  So you have to constantly monitor the remaining battery power.  If you learn to do this, then you will not have any problems with the battery. </p><h2>  Price tag </h2><p>  Now we know what Sony Xperia C3 features are.  We also reviewed the reviews.  But only most opinions change when potential buyers find out about the price of the device.  She, clients assure, is not so big - about 15,000 rubles. </p><p>  In general, modern analog phones cost owners from 18-20 thousand.  So the price tag on ‚ÄúSony‚Äù pleases a lot of people.  Yes, sometimes you can find something more powerful for the same amount.  But it can take a lot of time.  Sometimes the resources that Sony Xperia C3 offers are enough.  And, as practice has shown, the price / quality ratio in this model is just perfect.  So, do not give up the smartphone because of its small flaws.  All phones have them. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  So it's time to take stock of our talk today.  We learned what the Sony Xperia S3 smartphone is.  In addition, we now know the reviews about this product, as well as its characteristics and price.  But the logical question remained - is it worth using such a smartphone.  It is difficult to answer it, because each potential owner has his own requests for characteristics. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone sony iksperia s3 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/972230.jpg"></div>
