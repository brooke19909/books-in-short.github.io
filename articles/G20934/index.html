    <h2>  The appearance of the green zone </h2><p>  Frunze Park (Evpatoria) has existed for a century.  Earlier, on the site of the complex was the summer residence of Mlinarich, an employee of the shipping industry.  The landowner began the construction of his estate in 1914. Around the site were planted many trees (olives, several species of conifers, etc.), acacia bushes and a rose garden and flower beds.  In the adjoining public garden, Mlynaric erected several Greek statues. </p><p>  In 1917, the landowner left Crimea with the White Guards.  For ten years, no one looked after the estate and the square.  But in 1926 the landscaping of the park was continued.  Many sculptures by that time became worthless, part of the vegetation died.  Therefore, new plants were planted, decor elements and beautiful benches were installed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="park frunze evpatoria address" class="if" height="484" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1571555.jpg" width="600"></div>

This square attracted the attention of Emperor Alexander I. But the green zone was still far from the status of ‚Äúpark‚Äù.  After the Civil War, it was decided to build orphanages on the site of the landowner's estate.  Then a fountain and a pool were installed. </p><p>  The land around the sanatorium was landscaped.  Benches, arbors and sidewalks appeared.  Over time, marble statues were erected and artificial grottoes were built.  The sanatorium was preserved during the Second World War.  After the war, rides were set up in Frunze Park. </p><p>  Later, youth platforms appeared: roller, rock and skatedromes.  A place was allocated for paintball and a bowling alley.  Then came the amazing ‚ÄúTown of Fairy Tales‚Äù.  As a result, a huge recreation complex has grown on the landowner's estate. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="park named after frunze evpatoria" class="if" height="433" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1571554.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Mineral pump room </h2><p>  The history of the park is inextricably linked with the pump room, which contains mineral water.  It was fed up from deep underground wells.

You can try the mineral drink absolutely free. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Children's entertainment </h2><p>  Frunze <span>Central Park</span> (Yevpatoriya) has its own range of attractions.
