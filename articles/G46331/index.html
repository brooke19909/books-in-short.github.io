The ideal choice for such tourists is comfortable, budget, close to the center and the sea.  And besides, Hersonissos is the youth capital of Crete!  So lovers to walk and have fun in nightlife should go here. </p><p>  The sea is nearby, the beach is clean because it is that the bottom of the sea is not sandy.  Pebbles and pebbles.  The entrance to the water is through stone slabs.  Throughout the day, guests of the beach are offered free cool water in glasses. </p><p>  People who have been here claim that this is a great place for those who want to have fun.  Very close to the hotel is a club called Palm Beach.  The best parties are held on Fridays and Saturdays.  Different music sounds, even Russian.  The club is large, modern, they serve not only alcohol, but also hookahs.  A little further there is Star Beach, where at 16:00 <span>foamy parties</span> are held daily <span>.</span>  The entrance is free. </p><p>  In Hersonissos it is noisy, and in the evening life is just beginning, but nothing will stop a good sleep if you close the door to the balcony or windows and turn on the air conditioning. </p><p>  In general, if you want to have fun and spend time in a good hotel with a decent level of service, paying a small amount of money, definitely worth going here. </p>
