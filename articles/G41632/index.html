Indeed, one of the most tangible disadvantages of tours in this direction, judging by the reviews, is a long, and therefore expensive, flight. </p><h2>  Vacation in Vietnam </h2>

    <p>  Today's Vietnam, in contrast to the recent social past, is the temple complexes of unknown ancient civilizations, the natural beauty of numerous national parks, as well as amazingly delicious food, which necessarily contains diet rice and fresh seafood.  In addition, another advantage of the Russia-Vietnam direction is that our fellow citizens can remain on the territory of this Asian state without a visa for fifteen days. </p><p>  Separately, I want to say about the rest on the shore of the South China Sea.  Here, according to many, the cheapest diving in the world and a truly abundance of underwater inhabitants.  Most tourists choose tours here precisely because of the sea of ​​Vietnam, which is not always and not everywhere blue, but it is always warm. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The capital of beach holidays in this country is Nha Trang.

    <p>  The Russians leave a lot of good words about the rooms: they are normally equipped, there is everything necessary for a comfortable pastime.  Of course, there is no particular chic in the rooms, but when there is such a convenient beach nearby, the gorgeous sea and many attractions that you need to have time to see, not many people prefer to stay for long in the rooms. </p><p>  The hotel does not offer entertainment for children, but it does have a spa and other similar services.  According to many, the massage that is done at the hotel contributes to relaxation and complete peace. </p><p>  The hotel staff works very quickly and smoothly, instantly solving problems.  Many of our compatriots were pleasantly surprised by the low food prices in local restaurants.  Excursions are also inexpensive.  The summary of many reviews is as follows: good quality and excellent prices - this is how the Russians remembered the rest, although the youth did not particularly like it because of the lack of entertainment.  However, this drawback can be completely compensated for by an excellent beach, amazing diving and numerous entertainments on the shore of the South China Sea, as well as excursions. </p>
