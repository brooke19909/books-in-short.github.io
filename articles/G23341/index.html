    <p>  As you know, the United Arab Emirates is a state consisting of several territorial units. </p><p>  Unusual to the ear of a Russian person, the word Abu Dhabi is the largest of the seven emirates that make up the whole country.  Its area is quite impressive - 80 thousand km <sup>2</sup> . </p><p>  <span>The capital of the UAE</span> - Abu Dhabi - in a few years has truly turned into an unforgettable place, the greenest city on the entire Persian Gulf coast.  Today, many gardens and parks are equipped here, thanks to which the air temperature here is several degrees lower than in the desert around. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Section 2. How to get to the famous resort? </h2><p>  Looking at the map of Abu Dhabi, where the eponymous international airport is located, you can determine it almost immediately.  It is in this direction that a modern, wide and beautifully lighted highway has been laid.  It will be enough for travelers to cover a distance of 32 km.  All terminals of the main air gate of the country are located in one room. </p><p>  It should be noted that the first and second terminals are served immediately by 12 international carriers, while the third is at the full disposal of the local Etihad Air airline. </p><p>  You can get to the airport from the capital by taxi, by shuttle bus number 901, which runs every 40 minutes, and by Etihad airline's private shuttle. </p><p>  It will be useful for Russian tourists to take into account the fact that the S7 (Etihad Air) airliner is constantly leaving from Moscow. </p><h2>  Section 3.

    <p>  Now Abu Dhabi on the world map can be found without any problems.  Even a person who is not particularly interested in geography can cope with this task.  The magnificent capital of the United Arab Emirates has long been the subject of close attention from not only holiday tourists, but also many business people on the planet. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Of course, the city has gained its present look over the past few years, but according to official figures it was founded in 1760.  However, it should be noted that not so long ago archaeologists found confirmation that settlements existed in this place from the third millennium BC.  So, it is quite possible to assume that Abu Dhabi (the capital of the UAE) could easily enter the ten most ancient cities on the planet. </p><p>  By the way, there is an amazing legend about the emergence of the city.  Once the Arabs, who lived in one of the oases, went hunting.  Soon they met a gazelle and began to pursue it. </p><p>  The animal looped around the desert for a long time, the hunters followed him until it led them to a spring with beautiful fresh water, which was always worth its weight in gold in this region.  The men were so happy that they decided to give the life of a gazelle. </p><p>  Later, a settlement was formed near the source, which became known as the ‚Äúfather of the gazelle‚Äù, which in Arabic means Abu Dhabi.  A new territorial unit has appeared on the world map.  So, at least, the legend says, and local residents, as a rule, try to convince tourists that everything was really like that. </p><h2>  Section 4. Location and Climate Features </h2>

    <p>  We can say with confidence that, in general, the United Arab Emirates (Abu Dhabi in particular) is able to surprise anyone, even the most sophisticated and moody traveler. </p><p>  Many tourists claim that coming to rest in this place of amazing beauty, you should definitely visit its different corners.  Those who spend most of their holidays on the beach, as a rule, subsequently regret very much about the time spent. </p><p>  The United Arab Emirates is actually very diverse and literally in every locality of the traveler, another discovery awaits.  For example, the city in the east of the emirate of Al Ain and the region in the west of the island of al-Gharbiya are known for their exotic attractions and the breathtaking world of entertainment. </p><p>  Take a closer look at the Corniche promenade, visit the Abu Dhabi National Museum, the impressive Al Ain oasis with palm plantations and the region‚Äôs largest zoo.  Also, in your free time, you should go on an excursion to the cultural and ethnographic village with the Emirates Palace and the five-star Hotel Yas Vaysra. </p><p>  Special attention deserves a special park, rightfully considered not only the first, but also the best thematic entertainment center.  The Ferrari World is appealing to tourists who prefer drive and speed.  There is a huge attraction that will not leave you indifferent and will delight people of completely different ages.  In general, today in the park there are more than 20 attractions.  However, the territory of the entertainment complex is constantly increasing. </p><p>  At 100 km from Abu Dhabi, on an island called Sir Bani Yas, the Arabian Wildlife Center, which has more than 10 thousand animals, is located. </p><h2>  Section 6.

    <p>  It is not surprising that Abu Dhabi, where there is at the same time a huge number of people (both local and newcomers), has excellent transport infrastructure.  To move here, wide modern streets with three lanes have been built.  It is worth paying attention to the fact that the roads that run from north to south are called Road, and those that stretch from the west to the east - Street. </p><p>  The best mode of transportation in the UAE capital, Abu Dhabi, a photo of which can now be seen in many travel magazines in the world, is considered a taxi.  Public transport here is not very developed and is intended mainly for the transport of laborers and peasants. </p><p>  Today in the city there are 4 types of taxis: white private taxis, silver new cars, golden taxis and pink taxis with female drivers who transport only women and boys under 10 years old. </p><p>  All taxi services are equipped with meters and work at standard rates, but you need to agree on the fare in advance with private taxi drivers.  The car can be caught right on the street or found in parking lots near shopping centers.  In addition, buses run in the village at intervals of 10-30 minutes. </p><h2>  Section 7.

For example, its arches are decorated with the world's largest chandelier.  There is also a huge carpet, which has no analogues in the world.

    <p>  The United Arab Emirates (a map of the country serves as another confirmation) is located at the intersection of many trade routes, which means that this place can be considered a paradise for shopping lovers. </p><p>  For example, in Abu Dhabi there are a large number of ultra-modern shopping centers where world-famous brands are sold.  But in the markets you can buy a lot of great local souvenirs, exquisite hand-made things, and exotic spices. </p><p>  Many travelers claim that you can buy absolutely everything here: from branded watches framed with precious stones, to chic outfits, from ancient antiques to high-quality household appliances, from jewelry to textiles and carpets. </p><p>  All stores basically open from 10.00 in the morning, work without lunch and close in the evening at 22.00.  Although it is worth paying attention to the fact that during the <span>month of Ramadan</span> the situation is different: all shops are closed after lunch, and begin to work only late in the evening. </p><p>  In Al Ain, which is part of the largest emirate of Abu Dhabi, the shopping centers Al Ain Mall, Al Jimmy, and Bivadi Mall are very popular.  Not so long ago, another ultramodern shopping center was opened - Foa Mall, which offers not only to buy books, toys, clothes and much more, but also a snack in a cozy, relatively inexpensive cafe. </p><h2>  Section 9. 5 Things to Do in Abu Dhabi </h2>

    <p>  Tourists who have already visited the Emirates have identified five things that must be done when visiting this city: </p><p>  1. Go to Mina Port Road, find the Afghan Bazaar there and see with your own eyes a product resembling a fabulous carpet-plane. </p><p>  2. Sit on the very edge of a gigantic dune in the oasis of Liva. </p><p>  3. Drive cars in the theme center-park "Ferrari World".  Why not feel like a real Schumacher? </p><p>  4. In the city of Abu Dhabi, relax under the shade of exotic trees. </p><p>  5. Take a closer look and peer at the camel market.  What if it comes in handy somewhere? </p><h2>  Section 10. Communication with the outside world </h2><p>  It should be noted that, without exception, all telephone communications in the Emirates are paid.  The cheapest way for tourists will be to call home from street payphones or from specially equipped call centers.  The most expensive call will cost from the hotel. </p><p>  If you use the automatic line, you must first dial ‚Äú007‚Äù, then the area code, and then the desired phone number. </p><p>  In the event that it becomes necessary to continue to use mobile communications for a long time, the best option will undoubtedly be the purchase of a local SIM card with a fixed number. </p><p>  The Internet is paid exclusively depending on the time spent by the user on the network.  True, Wi-Fi access is free in public gardens and city parks. </p><h2>  Section 11. Traveler Reviews </h2><p>  All tourists who have visited the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, for a long time, are completely delighted with the beauty, luxury and wealth.  Many here are amazed by the amazing clean beaches, on which couples with small children and cheerful groups of friends can relax. </p><p>  Hotels pleasantly surprise with excellent service, restaurants - with an exquisite menu.  In general, we can say with confidence that the capital of the UAE Abu Dhabi is actually an unusual and original territory: attractions, beaches, streets, and shopping centers. </p><p>  As a rule, travelers ask the only question: how could such a paradise be created from the dead desert in just 50 years? </p>
