Phablets Samsung, Lenovo, Nokia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, there are millions of devices from different manufacturers of a wide variety of shapes and models.  Many of them have become so universal that it is quite difficult to classify them into one category: there is no single concept of ‚Äúmobile phone‚Äù, ‚Äúcomputer‚Äù or ‚Äúclock‚Äù.  There are smartphones, tablets, stationary PCs, smart watches and many other subcategories, to which this or that device belongs. </p><p>  Today the topic of our article is the phablet.  What is it, why this word has become so popular recently, as well as much more about such devices, we will tell later in the text. </p><h2>  General concept </h2><p>  The term ‚Äúphablet‚Äù, of course, came from English by the merger of two other words - phone (‚Äúphone‚Äù) and tablet (‚Äútablet‚Äù).  It turns out that this term denotes a cross between an ordinary smartphone and a tablet computer for full work. </p><p>  It‚Äôs just that the situation on the device market is such that mobile phones and computers differ little in hardware and hardware.  Basically, the difference lies in the size of the display, case and battery: tablets are just ‚Äúscaled‚Äù phones.  It's just that if initially smartphones with <span>touch screens</span> were produced with a display size of 3-5 inches, and tablet computers - 10-12 inches, then over time the gap of 6-9 inches filled the same phablet.  What is it, now you probably understand. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2>

    <p>  The "tablet phones" (as they are also called) have some advantages, due to which they are loved by users.  For example, this is a wide functionality.  As already noted, the phablet (what it is, you already know) has the same capabilities as the tablet.  Moreover, due to its size it is more compact, it can be carried with you in any situation.  On the other hand, there is another plus.  It also concerns the size of the device.  Phablet is no longer a smartphone.  A phablet is an enlarged display from which it is more convenient to read, type, and watch movies. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Plus, again, you can make calls and write SMS from him with a SIM card.  Therefore, the device is even more versatile than a phone or tablet. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  The negative sides of the phablet include what concerns its merits.  For example, it‚Äôs more than a phone, so you won‚Äôt put it in your pocket when you go for a walk - you will have to take a bag with you.  Again, typing will be more convenient with a 12-inch tablet with a huge keyboard than with <span>a</span> 7-inch <span>screen</span> .  The phablet is good and bad depending on the user's preferences, on his goals.  And, choosing such a device, you need to look at why you need it.  The need for a gadget is determined by your lifestyle, for example. </p>

    <h2>  Samsung Phablets </h2><p>  Since our article is devoted to medium-sized devices - phablets with a screen of 6-9 inches, we will try to give examples of the most successful models that you should pay attention to.  And let's start, perhaps, with one of the top manufacturers of electronic devices - the Korean company Samsung. </p><p>  The manufacturer‚Äôs lineup has several models that can be attributed to this class of devices.  In particular, this is the Samsung Galaxy Note (which has several generations of models at once, because there are Note 2, 3, 4).  These are phablets in their classic form, since they have the signs of a tablet, but are able to make calls and have a relatively small screen size.  In contrast, another model - Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 - is just a giant, but also a device that can be attributed to this class.  The diagonal of its screen is 8.4 inches. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  As the popularity of Note models shows, phablets are quite in demand.  This is confirmed by sales of devices from other manufacturers that belong to the same class.  Anyway, there are more and more gadgets with such a screen size as 6-9 inches.  Even this can be called a vivid indicator of their popularity and relevance. </p><h2>  Lenovo, Asus and others </h2><p>  For example, we all know that the Chinese concern Lenovo is positioned primarily as a player in the budget class due to the large number of such models.  Although, of course, among them there are expensive flagships. </p><p>  If we talk about the Lenovo phablet, the first to come to mind is the K3 Note model.  It is multifunctional, has a screen diagonal of 7.6 inches and at the same time costs only $ 145.  If you do not want to pay for the promotion of the Samsung brand - please, you can take Lenovo. </p>

    <p>  Another example is Asus products.  This manufacturer has many of its phablets, which have a diagonal of 7-8 inches.  Moreover, the buyer also has a choice - to buy a more affordable, but simple in functionality PhonePad or to pay a little more for a 7-inch tablet with one of the most powerful <span>hardware</span> on the market of <span>budget</span> Nexus 9 <span>devices</span> . </p><p>  In addition to Asus and Lenovo, on sale you can find models of other companies.  For example, HTC, LG, Huawei and Meizu also offer a good selection of such devices. </p><h2>  Nokia and Windows Phone Phablets </h2><p>  But do not think that phablets are just Android devices.  Nokia also has its own interesting ‚Äútablet phones‚Äù.  For example, the available Lumia 1320 or 1520. These are somewhat outdated, due to which their price is much lower, and the functionality as a whole corresponds to the cost. </p>

    <p>  Now, the developer focuses on smartphones with a smaller display - mainly up to 5 inches.  The Nokia phablet may have been considered unsuccessful, so for now they have decided to abandon the models in this segment. </p><h2>  Apple in the phablet market </h2><p>  You may ask, what about the world leader, the giant manufacturer of Apple products?  Do they have anything? </p>

    <p>  Of course!  The new iPhone 6 Plus with a diagonal of 5.5 inches is a typical phablet.  The device looks quite large compared to the regular 6th version, but at the same time has advanced features due to the larger display.  It should be noted that this product is somewhat innovative for the company, since previously Apple did not compete with Samsung in the market of devices with a screen larger than 4.5 inches.  Now, obviously, the American company is testing the ground where the Korean company has been leading for several years. </p><h2>  Is it worth buying? </h2><p>  We briefly described this type of device as a phablet.  What is it, you know: the gadget is just something in between a tablet and a smartphone.  In this case, the device‚Äôs functionality is the same as its ‚Äúcolleagues‚Äù with other display sizes.  This is one of the operating systems on the market today, a processor, a battery, a camera, and some kind of graphics engine.  Let's just say: an enlarged smartphone or a smaller tablet. </p><p>  And in fact, to answer the question: "Is it worth buying a phablet?"  - it‚Äôs just impossible, it all depends on your goals and objectives that confront the device.  If you would like to type in large volumes, working with such a device will be less comfortable than with a tablet.  But you can watch movies on a smaller screen.  The same applies to working with mail, social networks, instant messengers - all this is very conveniently implemented on devices such as phablets. </p><p>  And, of course, you will make the final decision about whether you need such a gadget or not.  And only you can say how this or that device will be useful for entertainment, work and training specifically for you. </p><p>  Therefore, we wish you good luck in choosing and hope that you will be able to choose the most suitable gadget for yourself. </p>
