Meanwhile, this little thing can become indispensable with manual sewing. </p><p>  What is a thimble and how is it used?  This thing can be simply indispensable when working with thick tissues or skin, when you need to create a lot of pressure to push the needle through the material.  A thimble is a small cap that is worn on a finger to protect it from a needle prick during manual sewing. </p><h2>  How to use it </h2><p>  The thimble can be used for any handmade work, but it is mainly used for sewing and quilting.  If it has never been used before, then at first there may be a strange and uncomfortable feeling.  But finger protection is very important.  Therefore, you just have to start sewing by wearing a thimble, how quickly you get used to this feeling, and an extraneous thing on your finger ceases to interfere, becoming a useful addition to the process. </p><p>  Most thimbles have many small indents so that the end of the needle does not slip when pushed.  Usually a thimble is worn on the middle finger, but you can put it on the index finger or even a big one, if it is more convenient for a particular style of sewing. </p><p>  By observing your own hands, you can determine which finger pushes the needle.  When wearing a thimble, use it to push the needle through the fabric.  You can work with the upper part of the finger or the side, depending on which is more convenient. </p><div class="photo" data-original="brooksann.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Different types of thimbles" class="if uuid-3022849" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/115573/3022849.jpg"></div><h2>  Which finger to wear? </h2><p>  The thimble is most often worn on the middle finger.  However, some people prefer to wear a thimble on the index, and sometimes on the big one.  You can also wear two thimbles at once or wear gloves instead.  The reason the first option is better than the second is because they do not constrain the movement of the hand. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The choice of a finger is also affected by its size, because they are not the same for everyone.  You may have to try a few thimbles before finding the one that fits perfectly.  If preference is given to the thumb, you will need to look for and buy one that is made specifically for him. </p><h2>  What are they? </h2><p>  There are two main types of thimble: closed, which covers the entire finger, and with an open top, which is convenient for those with long nails. </p><p>  Thimbles can be made of various materials.  Many probably saw a traditional metal thimble.  But it can also be made of plastic, leather or combination materials.  Leather, for example, is popular for quilting and hand embroidery, as they are more flexible.  Over time, they take the shape of a finger, which makes them even more convenient. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.seamstobeyouandme.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Leather thimble on a finger" class="if uuid-3022850" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/115573/3022850.jpg"></div><p>  When buying a thimble, you can ask to try putting it on or read reviews about using different types for a specific job.  Since it is sometimes difficult to find the perfect shape, many people choose thimbles made of fabric because they are flexible. </p><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear what a thimble is and how to use it.  It can be bought at any sewing store.  Thimbles are usually cheap, but you may have to test a few to choose the one that is perfect and comfortable for long sewing. </p>
