  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Benjamin Franklin is a man of legend.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The biography of Benjamin Franklin is the story of a man who has achieved high results in his life, having made a difficult journey from an uneducated hard worker to a famous scientist.  He is remembered and respected throughout the world.  And in the USA, Benjamin Franklin is depicted on a hundred dollar bill. </p><p>  He grew up in a simple American soap-maker family.  At 10, Benjamin begins to work with his father in the studio, and after a while he moves to the printing house.  This is where his legendary career growth begins.  Since childhood, Benjamin Franklin has shown great interest in science, he independently engages in the study of languages, biology, chemistry, mathematics and physics. </p><p>  At the age of 17, he decides to move to Philadelphia, where he continues his work in the printing house.  And after some time, Benjamin organizes his own printing business, where he works as an author and publisher of such periodicals as the Pennsylvania Newspaper and Poor Richard's Almanac.  At the same time, he continues to be actively interested in politics and science.  Franklin creates the theory of <span>electrical phenomena,</span> establishes the first public library and academy in Philadelphia in the United States, invents a lightning rod, explores the Gulf Stream, invents lamps for lanterns, an economical stove, etc. </p><p>  Benjamin Franklin is a defender of the natural rights of people that are given to each of us at birth - this is health, freedom, life, etc.  He defines a person as "an animal producing tools."  Franklin is a tireless fighter for democracy, universal <span>suffrage,</span> freedom and an ardent opponent of slavery.  In 1754, he initiated the congress in Albany for representatives of the colonies.  At the meeting, he proposes a plan to unite the exploited countries.  <span>B. Franklin</span> acts as a messenger of the colonies.  He was in charge of protecting Georgia, Massachusetts, New Jersey.  The result of his peacekeeping activity between England and its colonies is the conclusion of the most important documents in world history.  First of all, this is <span>the</span> US <span>Declaration of Independence</span> and the constitution, as well as the Treaty of Versailles, thanks to which the long-standing war for the independence of the British colonies ended. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The life of Benjamin Franklin is entirely connected with politics.  At first he was appointed secretary of the assembly in Philadelphia, then the chief postmaster.  For writing scientific papers, he was awarded <span>the</span> Copley <span>Gold Medal</span> and recognized as a member of the Academic Royal Society of England.  Franklin's works published in England by his friend P. Collinson gained great popularity in Europe.  He was also recognized as an honorary member of several foreign academies, including the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. </p><p>  Over the last years of his life, Franklin has written a number of articles of a general humanitarian orientation and Autobiography, which tells about his own fate and is diluted with wise sayings.  This voluminous work was begun in 1771, and completed in 1791. Benjamin Franklin's "Autobiography" appeared in a Russian translation in 1799.  In this work, the scientist describes the periods of his formation and formation as a person.  He talks about the important role of circumstances in human life.  If they are conducive to the implementation of the intended goals, then they can achieve success in a fairly short time, and if they interfere, then they form a will and temper character.  Analyzing the events of a scientist‚Äôs life, one can see that a person with a sharp mind and fiery energy is subject to any branch of knowledge and any kind of activity. </p><p>  On April 17, 1790, Franklin's life was interrupted in the 85th year of life.  More than twenty thousand people came to escort him on his last journey. </p><p>  The contribution made by Benjamin Franklin to the development of the USA and the whole world is invaluable.  By decision of the Peace Council, his name is included in the list of prominent figures of mankind. </p>
