  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The Grand Canyon in the USA - the largest on the planet</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>The Grand Canyon</span> in the USA (photo) is one of America's oldest <span>national parks</span> .  The Grand Canyon or Grand Canyon is located in <span>Arizona,</span> it extends over an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 5 thousand square meters.  km  In 1908, the Grand Canyon was given the status of a national <span>natural monument.</span>  The year 1917 was marked by the assignment of the status of National Park to the canyon.  In 1979, the UNESCO <span>World Heritage List was</span> replenished with another natural monument. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Grand Canyon in the USA" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13750/211371.jpg" width="600"></div><br>  The Grand Canyon in the United States appeared much earlier than previously thought.  Many millennia ago, another canyon was formed here, formed by a river that flowed in the opposite direction, and in its place a modern one appeared.  In accordance with these facts, American scientists reconsidered the geological age of this rock formation, and from 6 million years it was increased to 17. <br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Grand Canyon in the USA photo" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13750/211374.jpg" width="460"></div><br>  Even before the opening of the National Park, these amazing places attracted a large number of explorers and travelers.  Today, tourists from different parts of the world with bated breath come to the edge of the abyss to enjoy amazing views.  And it is in this case that the expression ‚Äúit is better to see once than to hear many times‚Äù is best suited. <br><br>  The Grand Canyon in the United States has a depth of 1800 meters, its length is approximately 350 km.  The width across the entire depth has obvious differences, so at the plateau level it is from 8 to 25 km, and at the very bottom it is only 800 meters.  In some places, the gorge narrows to a mark of 120 m. For many thousands of years, the rocks were eroded by the waters of the Colorado River and the result was a gorge that was grand in size.  This process has not stopped even today, although it is happening very slowly and almost imperceptibly to the eye.  The rate of depression is approximately 15 m in one million years. <br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="grand american canyon" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13750/211370.jpg" width="600"></div><br>  The especially large American canyon surprises with its color scheme.  This is influenced by the time of year or day and the amazing play of shadows.  Depending on these factors, everything in the gorge becomes pink-blue, black-brown, or white-purple.  To see this magnificent phenomenon, millions of tourists come to this place and climb to numerous viewing platforms.  You can get into the canyon from the south side, through Flagstaff or William.  On this side is the village, specially designed for tourists - the Grand Canyon. <br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="canyon" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13750/211373.jpg" width="600"></div><br>  Those who want to see the big canyon in the USA and talk to nature one on one, it is better to go from the north side from Jacob Lake on the Arizona-67 highway.  It should be noted that in winter this road is almost impassable.  You can even spend the night in the National Park, travelers often stop at the tourism center "Canyon View Information Plaza", and lovers of nature are waiting for the camping "Meyser", where you can set up a tent.  A particularly unusual place to sleep is the small village of Fantom Ranch, which is sheltered at the very bottom of the canyon. <br><br>  To explore the large canyon in the United States, you can go on bus excursions that organize near the southern entrance to the park.  Narrow paths lead to the bottom of this unique mountain formation, on which you can go down on your own or on a mule.  An equally interesting experience will be the rafting downstream of the Smooth Water River, which lasts about 5 hours.  And some companies even offer to go on a sightseeing tour by helicopter. <br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="grand canyon" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13750/211375.jpg" width="600"></div><br>  Do not forget that significant changes in air temperature are common for this place.  Even in the hottest time, you need to have warm clothes with you.  After all, towards evening, the temperature drops to several degrees above zero.
