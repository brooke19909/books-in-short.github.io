Take at least Xiaomi.  Five years ago, few people heard about this brand.  And now the company is fighting fiercely for top places in the modern mobile device market.  The riddle.  But, it seems that the solution is simple.  The manufacturer offers high-quality, modern devices with good performance for adequate money.  The masters of the industry are used to making money on the brand.  Buying, for example, a smartphone from Samsung, you pay a tidy sum for the image of the company logo on the case.  Xiaomi does not suffer from this.  So her apparatus scatters like hot cakes.  Moreover, they are surprisingly high quality.  Take at least <span>Xiaomi Redmi 4A 32GB.</span>  <span>The characteristics of</span> this "state employee" embarrass the giants of the "smartphone industry" in an awkward position, because they did not even assume that devices of this level could be sold for a penny. </p><h2>  A little bit about the company </h2><p>  Xiaomi was founded in 2010.  She immediately started developing her own MIUI firmware.  And only in 2011 the first smartphone from this manufacturer was released.  He enjoyed such frenzied popularity that the whole party was sold out in a matter of minutes.  Encouraged by the success of Xiaomi, it began to develop new devices.  And they all received hot user support.  Until 2013, the company sold gadgets at cost, that is, did not earn a penny.  However, this did not stop her from further developing and launching new smartphones.  The company management decided to flood all segments of the market with its products.  And even the budget segment.  Proof of this is the Xiaomi Redmi 4A 32GB smartphone.  Its characteristics allow us to hope that it will become a bestseller among entry-level devices. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance and design </h2><p>  What can be said about the design of the new state employee?  Only that you will not find any frills in it.  The case is completely solid, but made of plastic.  The front panel is covered with tempered glass Corning <span>Gorilla Glass</span> with an oleophobic coating.  The front part is made according to standard canons: under the screen - three touch navigation buttons, and above the display - a speaker grid, a front camera and a proximity sensor.  Everything is strict and tasteful.  It should be noted that no matter what color the back panel, the front is always white.  This is the corporate identity of Xiaomi Redmi 4A Pro 32GB.  We will analyze its characteristics a little later.  On the rear panel there is a peephole of the main camera and a two-ton LED flash.  And at the very bottom of the case is the speaker grill.  Mechanical controls are located on the side faces of the device.  As you can see, the layout of all elements is standard.  Exactly the same as in other budget devices.  Now consider the screen news. </p>

    <h2>  Screen specifications </h2><p>  So, which display is installed in the Xiaomi Redmi 4A 32GB?  Characteristics from the manufacturer indicate that it is very good (for a budget device).  The device has a five-inch display with IPS matrix, created using OGS technology.  This means that there is no air gap between the glass and the screen itself.  This helps to achieve a more accurate color rendering.  The screen resolution is 1280 by 720 pixels.  This is the HD standard.  The maximum brightness is quite enough so that on a sunny day you can see something on the screen.  Viewing angles are pretty decent.  As with any IPS display.  Now about pixel density.  It is 293 dpi.  For an HD screen, this is usually the case.  Be that as it may, it is impossible to see the pixelation of the text with the naked eye.  The contrast is 533 to 1. In general, the smartphone received a very high-quality screen.  And this once again confirms the theory that Xiaomi does not care about the brand.  They do everything for customers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Hardware platform specifications </h2><p>  So we got to the most interesting.  What about the performance of the Xiaomi Redmi 4A 32GB EU Black?  The characteristics declared by the manufacturer indicate that the device boasts its power.  Moreover, this is the most powerful device in the budget segment.  Judge for yourself.  The gadget has a 64-bit quad-core processor from Qualcomm.  RAM - 2 gigabytes.  Plus a pretty advanced graphics coprocessor from Adreno.  This allows the smartphone not only to work quickly, clearly and smoothly, but also not to have difficulty launching games, which is usually not designed for budget devices.  In addition, the device supports the latest generation LTE communication standard, has high-speed Bluetooth and Wi-Fi transmitters and an advanced GPS module.  The internal flash drive is designed for 16 gigabytes.  But you can easily increase the amount of memory due to the micro-SD flash drive up to 256 gigabytes.  Pretty good specifications for an entry-level device. </p>

    <h2>  Cameras (main and front) </h2><p>  A review of the technical specifications of the Xiaomi Redmi 4A 32GB is inconceivable without mentioning the cameras.  And there is something to talk about.  The main camera is represented by a 13-megapixel fast wide-angle module with an aperture of 2.2.  What does it mean?  This means that a budget device can create high-quality photos without straining too much.  In addition, there is a fully manual adjustment of all camera features and a full HDR mode.  Also, the photomodule can write video in HD format with stereo sound.  Apparently, the main camera is the second ‚Äúcool‚Äù thing after the screen in this smartphone.  With the front camera, too, everything is in order.  This is a five-megapixel wide-angle and high-aperture module that copes with the photo perfectly even in low light conditions.  This camera also has manual settings for some options, which you rarely see even with flagships.  In general, the cameras in 4A are only pleasing.  And who will say that this is a budget device?  The cameras of the device are precisely drawn to the middle price segment, but not to the budget one.  Like, in principle, the screen of the device.  And for this honor and praise to the engineers of the company.  It seems that they are baked not about their own benefit, but about users and fans of the company's products.  If so, then there is no price for such people.  Although it is likely that in this way they earn a good name. </p>

    <h2>  Software platform </h2><p>  Now let's move on to the Xiaomi Redmi 4A 2-32GB operating system.  The characteristics of the hardware allow us to hope that something from the most recent Android will be installed.  The smartphone has OS version 6.0.1 installed under the proprietary MIUI 8.1.4 shell.  The latter is a very successful mix from the design of Samsung and Apple iPhone.  The branded shell works surprisingly smartly and seamlessly.  And it does not affect the speed of the Android itself.  On the contrary, the arrangement of elements in the shell, as well as many interface settings, allow you to maximize the device "for you."  In addition, the dull and boring standard "Android" is already tired of everyone.  As for the unnecessary Chinese software, it is not at all in the international version of the firmware.  But if you bought a device in China, then be prepared for the fact that you will have to change Android to an adequate European one. </p>

    <h2>  Battery </h2><p>  And what about the autonomy of Xiaomi Redmi 4A 32GB Gray?  Battery characteristics make me think that autonomy is pretty good.  The novelty has a lithium-polymer non-removable battery with a capacity of 3120 mAh, which, taking into account the power of the gadget, may be quite acceptable.  Real tests showed that in game mode the smartphone "lives" for about five hours.  In intensive load mode (data transfer, Internet, music / video), he is able to work almost the whole day.  But no one has yet tested it for stand-by time in standby mode.  Even the manufacturers.  Yes, this is not so important.  Much more important is another: in mixed mode, this smartphone can live a full two days.  This is the most autonomous device with a similar power of the "iron" component.  There is a profound optimization of the hardware and operating system of the device.  By the way, it charges in 3 hours when using a "native" charger.  There is no possibility of fast charging (like wireless).  But a budget device doesn‚Äôt need such difficulties. </p>

    <h2>  Smartphone Positioning </h2><p>  So, who can Xiaomi Redmi Note 4A 3GB 32GB come in handy for?  Its characteristics indicate that any average user who needs an inexpensive, moderately powerful and reliable device can become a potential buyer.  But let's not forget about the appearance.  For many, the look of a smartphone is everything.  We can confidently say that 4A will be a real bestseller, since it is cheap, has all the necessary options and is quite capable of pulling even games.  An important role is played by the fact that there is no overpayment for the brand, which is what giants of the mobile industry like Samsung like to do. </p><h2>  Reviews about the device </h2><p>  Of course, there are already those who have purchased a new product from Xiaomi.  They leave reviews about the smartphone to help other users make their choice.  And what do people say about this device?  Oddly enough, but the reviews about Xiaomi are mostly positive.  Everyone absolutely likes the price of the device.  The owners of this smartphone believe (and rightly so) that the gadget has no analogues in this price segment.  Millions of users admire the power of the device (and quite deservedly), its appearance and autonomy.  This is almost the only case when a mobile phone is not answered negatively.  Such a precedent has not yet happened in our practice.  But the whining of the trolls about the fact that Chinese gadgets are not worthy of attention is not worth taking seriously. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we examined what a budget smartphone Xiaomi Redmi 4A 32GB Black is.  The characteristics of the gadget are such that it can be easily attributed to the devices of the middle price segment.  But the price is really budgetary, which cannot but rejoice.  There is no doubt that many people will like the smartphone.  Who knows, perhaps even the old fans of the Samsung and iPhones will soon turn their backs on their idols.  Everything goes to that.  In the meantime, let's hope that Xiaomi will not get sick with the desire to make money on the brand.  So far, they are doing well.  Let them continue in the same spirit. </p>
