When choosing, it is worth considering many different parameters, for example, brightness level, backlight type, resolution to diagonal ratio, refresh rate, etc. In addition, the choice is complicated by the large abundance of various models, among which there are extremely unsuccessful instances.  In today's review, we will talk about several very good LCD monitors that you can safely recommend for purchase. </p><h2>  LG Flatron W1934S </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.terapeak.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd monitor LG Flatron W1934S" class="if uuid-2307856" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2307856.jpg"></div><p>  So, the first model on the list will be the LG Flatron W1934S.  Despite the fact that this monitor is already almost 10 years old, it can still be found on sale, although it is already much less common, but nonetheless.  This LCD monitor will be a great purchase, especially for those who do not have a lot of money. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Now a little about the configuration.  The LG Flatron W1934S comes in a medium-sized standard cardboard box.  On the packaging you can immediately get acquainted with the main technical characteristics and capabilities of the model.  Inside the box, the user will find the actual 19-inch LCD monitor itself, a power cable, a VGA cable, instructions, a warranty card and a driver disk. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Description and specifications </h2><p>  Now a little about the monitor itself.  Its diagonal is 19 inches, resolution - 1440x900.  At the time of release, this was not the most popular resolution, and many users suffered for a long time trying to set it in the PC settings.  The monitor is mounted on a special leg, installation on the wall is possible. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.terapeak.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="monitor LG Flatron W1934S" class="if uuid-2307861" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2307861.jpg"></div><p>  As for the display, it is matte and collects fingerprints, dust particles, etc. very well. The brightness margin is good - 300 cd / m2.  In contrast, everything is more than standard - 1000: 1.  Color reproduction is good, colors are closer to natural ones.  Viewing angles are 170 degrees. </p><p>  At the bottom of the monitor are buttons for quick setup, as well as switching from 16:10 to 4: 3 format.  The power supply is built into the case, does not make much noise.  Power consumption - 36 watts, and in standby mode 1 watts. </p><p>  Here are the main specifications of the LG Flatron W1934S: </p><ul><li>  The diagonal is 19 inches. </li><li>  Resolution - 1440x900. </li><li>  The refresh rate is 75 Hz. </li><li>  The type of matrix is ‚Äã‚ÄãTFT TN. </li><li>  Viewing angles - 170 degrees. </li><li>  The response time is 5 ms. </li><li>  Connectors - VGA. </li><li>  The dimensions of the monitor (W / H / D) are 448/376/183 mm. </li><li>  Weight - 3.2 kg. </li></ul><h2>  Reviews and price </h2><p>  As noted in user reviews of this model, the LG Flatron W1934S has virtually no shortcomings, except for the power button indicator that is too bright.  Also, there is often a problem with capacitors in the power supply circuit.  Everything is solved by soldering.  The price of an LCD monitor today varies from 3 to 6 thousand rubles.  For a budget and high-quality model, this is quite acceptable. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Samsung S24D330H </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.lesnumeriques.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="monitor Samsung S24D330H" class="if uuid-2307864" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2307864.jpg"></div><p>  Next on the list is the LCD monitor - Samsung S24D330H.  This is quite a good, relatively recently released model, which has good color rendering, modern functionality and is perfect for both home use and work. </p><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  LCD monitor for sale in a standard cardboard box for Samsung.  The packaging indicates the main features of the model, as well as some of its technical characteristics.  Inside, in addition to the monitor itself, you can find a power cable consisting of two parts (one part is a wire with a plug, the other is a power supply and a plug to the monitor), a stand, a set of instructions, a software disc, a warranty card and an HDMI cable. </p><p>  In some trim levels, instead of HDMI, there is a standard VGA cable. </p><h2>  Characteristics and Description </h2><p>  The Samsung S24D330H LCD monitor screen has a diagonal of 24 inches.  Resolution FullHD - 1920x1080.  The display is matte, anti-glare, fingerprints remain, but not very noticeable.  As a backlight, modern LED technology is used here, which cannot but rejoice. </p><p>  Also, it is worth noting the presence of an HDMI connector, through which the monitor can be connected not only to the PC video card, but also to other devices, for example, a TV set-top box or laptop.  In case the video card does not have an HDMI connector (older models) or an integrated video card is used, the Samsung S24D330H has a standard VGA connector through which you can connect. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lesnumeriques.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd monitor Samsung S24D330H" class="if uuid-2307860" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2307860.jpg"></div><p>  The brightness margin of the monitor is good, but could have been larger - 250 cd / m2.  As for contrast, everything is standard here - 1000: 1.  Color reproduction is good, but not entirely accurate.  Viewing angles - 170 and 160 degrees.  The monitor is mounted on the leg, there is no wall mount. </p><p>  Technical characteristics of the model: </p><ul><li>  The diagonal is 24 inches. </li><li>  Resolution - 1920x1080. </li><li>  The refresh rate is 60 Hz. </li><li>  The type of matrix is ‚Äã‚ÄãTN + film. </li><li>  Viewing angles - 160 and 170 degrees. </li><li>  The response time is 1 ms. </li><li>  Connectors - HDMI, VGA. </li><li>  Monitor dimensions (W / H / D) - 569/417/197 mm. </li><li>  Weight - 3.15 kg. </li></ul><h2>  Cost and reviews </h2><p>  As noted in the reviews for this model, Samsung S24D330H has several disadvantages.  The first is a weak margin of brightness.  The second is poor stability on the stand.  The third is a frequent marriage in the form of dead pixels.  And the last, fourth - touch buttons for setting parameters.  However, for its price it is one of the best 24-inch models on the market.  As for the price of the Samsung S24D330H LCD monitor, you can buy it for 8000-8500 rubles. </p><h2>  LG 29UM69G-B </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.benchmark.rs" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="monitor LG 29UM69G-B" class="if uuid-2307855" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2307855.jpg"></div><p>  Another LCD monitor with an HDMI connector that definitely deserves attention is the LG 29UM69G-B.  And although this is already the second representative of LG, the difference between the models is simply enormous, starting from the appearance and ending with the technical characteristics. </p><h2>  Monitor Options </h2><p>  The monitor comes in a wide cardboard box.  On the package, the main characteristics of the model are traditionally indicated, as well as some of its features, for example, IPS matrix, LED backlight, etc. Inside the box, in addition to the largest monitor, there is a user manual, warranty card, software disc, assembly instructions, network cable with power supply, HDMI cable and stand. </p><h2>  Description and specifications </h2><p>  <span>The LCD monitor</span> LG 29UM69G-B has a diagonal of 29 inches and a resolution of 2560x1080.  The display is matte, anti-glare, fingerprints remain, but are almost invisible.  The brightness margin here is not as large as we would like - 250 cd / m2.  The contrast level is 1000: 1, there is also a dynamic contrast with the Mega DCR indicator. </p><p>  The monitor shows good picture quality, the colors are bright, saturated, close to natural.  Viewing angles - 178 degrees. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.benchmark.rs" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd monitor LG 29UM69G-B" class="if uuid-2307863" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2307863.jpg"></div><p>  LG 29UM69G-B has ADM FreeSync technology, thanks to which there are no problems when viewing dynamic scenes.  The refresh rate of the monitor itself is 75 Hz. </p><p>  Of the interesting points, it is worth noting that the monitor has built-in speakers with a power of 10 W, as well as a 3.5 mm jack for headphones.  True, there is a connector on the back, which is not very convenient.  In addition to the usual stand on which the monitor stands, there are also holes for a wall mount such as Versa. </p><p>  Specifications LG 29UM69G-B: </p><ul><li>  Diagonal - 29 inches. </li><li>  Resolution - 2560x1080. </li><li>  The refresh rate is 75 Hz. </li><li>  The type of matrix is ‚Äã‚ÄãIPS. </li><li>  Viewing angles - 178 degrees. </li><li>  The response time is 1 ms. </li><li>  Connectors - HDMI, 3.5 mm, USB Type-C, Display Port. </li><li>  Monitor dimensions (W / H / D) - 703/415/203 mm. </li><li>  Weight - 5.5 kg. </li></ul><h2>  Cost and user reviews </h2><p>  As such, the LCD LCD monitor LG 29UM69G-B, judging by user reviews, does not have such drawbacks.  The only thing customers are dissatisfied with is an unregulated stand and a glossy case.  Otherwise, there are no complaints.  There is a monitor today from 15,500 to 18,500 rubles. </p><h2>  BenQ BL2411PT </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.prad.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="BenQ LCD Monitor BL2411PT" class="if uuid-2307862" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2307862.jpg"></div><p>  Next on the list is the BenQ BL2411PT monitor.  BenQ has long won a name in the monitor market as one of the best manufacturers in this segment.  The BL2411PT model gained popularity almost immediately after entering the market.  Let‚Äôs take a closer look at it. </p><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  Monitor for sale in a cardboard box, stretched up.  On the packaging, traditionally for the company, the main characteristics of the model, its features and other information are indicated.  Inside, in addition to the monitor itself, the user will find a user manual, a driver disk, a warranty card, a stand, a VGA cable, a DVI cable, a power cord and a two-way 3.5 mm cable for connecting speakers to the computer‚Äôs sound card. </p><h2>  Characteristics and Description </h2><p>  Monitor BenQ BL2411PT has <span>a screen diagonal of</span> 24 inches.  Resolution is a little non-standard - 1920x1200.  The display is matte, there are practically no fingerprints left on it, but the dust is fine.  The matrix here is used IPS with LED backlight.  There is Flicker-Free technology. </p><p>  The brightness margin is 300 cd / m2, which is quite good.  The contrast level is 1000: 1, there is also a dynamic contrast with an indicator of 20,000,000: 1.  The picture quality is very good, the colors are natural, saturated.  Color reproduction is almost perfect.  In principle, BenQ is loved for this.  Viewing angles - 178 degrees, the image quality does not change regardless of the tilt. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.prad.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="BenQ monitor BL2411PT" class="if uuid-2307859" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2307859.jpg"></div><p>  We should also praise the monitor stand.  It is not only adjustable in height and tilt, but also allows you to rotate the monitor 90 degrees.  In addition to the stand, it is possible to mount the monitor on the wall. </p><p>  Among the additional features, we can distinguish the presence of two speakers, 1 W power, Eco mode, a 3.5 mm headphone jack, a presence sensor, color calibration and support for the entire color spectrum of sRGB. </p><p>  BenQ BL2411PT LCD Monitor Features: </p><ul><li>  The diagonal is 24 inches. </li><li>  Resolution - 1920x1200. </li><li>  The refresh rate is 76 Hz. </li><li>  Type of matrix - TFT IPS. </li><li>  Viewing angles - 178 degrees. </li><li>  The response time is 5 ms. </li><li>  Connectors - VGA, DVI, Display Port, 3.5 mm for headphones and 3.5 mm for audio. </li><li>  Monitor dimensions (W / H / D) - 555/444/236 mm. </li><li>  Weight - 6.7 kg. </li></ul><h2>  Reviews and price </h2><p>  According to reviews of the BenQ BL2411PT LCD monitor with LED backlight, the model still has drawbacks, but they are not critical.  Someone is a little tall stand, for someone the dark color is too dark, someone does not like the speakers or design, etc. No one has complaints about the image quality, and this is the most important thing.  You can buy a monitor for 15 500-18 000 rubles. </p><h2>  Philips 276E7QDSW </h2><div class="photo" data-original="abertoatedemadrugada.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd monitor philips 276E7QDSW" class="if uuid-2307858" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2307858.jpg"></div><p>  The penultimate LCD monitor is the Philips 276E7QDSW.  Not so often <span>, Philips monitors</span> fall into any ratings.  The 276E7QDSW model has become quite successful for the company, because it perfectly combines price and quality. </p><h2>  Model Options </h2><p>  The monitor is sold in a medium-sized cardboard box.  The package has a corporate color and it shows all the main characteristics and features of the model.  Inside, in addition to the monitor itself, there is a network cable with a power supply, a VGA cable, a user manual, a driver disk, a warranty card, a stand and everything.  Despite the fact that the Philips 276E7QDSW is equipped with an HDMI connector, the corresponding cable does not come with the kit, but it's a pity. </p><h2>  Description of the monitor and its characteristics </h2><p>  Philips 276E7QDSW has a diagonal of 27 inches.  FullHD screen resolution (1920x1080).  The matrix installed here is not quite standard - PLS with LED backlight.  This type of matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãjust starting to gain momentum, so many users are reluctant to buy such monitors. </p><p>  The display cover here is traditionally matte, anti-reflective.  Fingerprints almost do not remain and it pleases.  The frames around the edges of the display are thin - this is also a plus.  Like the previous monitor, there is support for Flicker-Free technology. </p><div class="photo" data-original="abertoatedemadrugada.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="monitor Philips 276E7QDSW" class="if uuid-2307857" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2307857.jpg"></div><p>  The brightness margin is not bad - 250 cd / m2, but it was possible to make it a little more.  Contrast - 1000: 1, dynamic contrast - 20,000,000: 1.  Viewing angles are 178 degrees.  According to the picture there are no complaints.  Good and saturated colors, at angles the image does not fade and does not go into any shade.  Color reproduction is good, but not perfect - it will not work for professional designers. </p><p>  The Philips 276E7QDSW stand is pretty good and pretty.  There is the possibility of adjusting the angle of inclination, but alas, that‚Äôs all.  In addition to the stand, you can use the wall mount, the holes for it are located behind the monitor. </p><p>  Features of the Philips 276E7QDSW LCD Monitor: </p><ul><li>  Diagonal - 27 inches. </li><li>  Resolution - 1920x1080. </li><li>  The refresh rate is 76 Hz. </li><li>  Matrix Type - PLS. </li><li>  Viewing angles - 178 degrees. </li><li>  The response time is 5 ms. </li><li>  Connectors - HDMI, Audio HDMI, VGA, DVI. </li><li>  Monitor dimensions (W / H / D) - 616/468/179 mm. </li><li>  Weight - 4.3 kg. </li></ul><h2>  User reviews and cost </h2><p>  As reviews of the Philips 276E7QDSW LCD monitor show, the model is virtually devoid of flaws.  Of the little things, people note a not-so-functional stand and a slight yellowness of white color.  Otherwise, everything is in order.  As for the cost, you can buy a monitor for 13-15 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Acer Predator GN246HLBbid </h2><div class="photo" data-original="nl.hardware.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd monitor Acer Predator GN246HLBbid" class="if uuid-2307865" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2307865.jpg"></div><p>  Well, the last LCD monitor on the list today is the Acer Predator GN246HLBbid.
