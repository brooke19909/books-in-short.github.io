Many advise to go further - you can go to a quiet, remote beach.  And then - to the monastery.  Where, by the way, hotel guests organize a free tour. </p><p>  The service is up to par.  As it should be in a 4-star hotel.  The staff is polite, helpful.  If something is needed, they react immediately, which cannot but rejoice. </p><p>  In general, if you need a good, carefree vacation in a beautiful place, you can go here.  The prices are rather high, but the vacation at this hotel is worth it. </p>
