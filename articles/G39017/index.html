"Blah Blah Car" - search for travel companions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There are practically no people who would not like to travel.  Tourism gives a lot of positive emotions and allows you to escape from everyday work.  But far from everyone can afford a trip to a foreign country.  With the growth of the foreign exchange rate, air tickets prices have risen substantially.  But you can travel very well with your own car!  You can find a companion through the Blah Blah Kar website.  Search for travel companions in one click! </p><h2>  What is ‚ÄúBlah Blah Car‚Äù </h2><p>  The social network, bringing together a huge number of people from around the world, appeared relatively recently.  People who often travel to another country manage to make good money through Blah Blah Kar.  Travelers reviews about the driver leave in the appropriate section.  The more positive comments a particular user can collect, the more likely they are to travel in their own car absolutely free. </p>

At Bla Bla Car, customer reviews provide an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe person with whom you will have to spend some time on the road.

Most often, the service is used by residents of the CIS countries, Croatia, Belgium, India, Italy, Spain, Turkey, France and Croatia.  Over 3 million reservations are available daily.  You can get to your destination in a convenient vehicle with interesting fellow travelers. </p>

The cost of a trip with a companion is on average two times lower than the cost of an air ticket on the same route.  According to statistics, drivers managed to save about 300 million euros thanks to the BlaBlaCar website.  The new model of intercity travel is more and more interested in tourists.  Why pay more if you can save money for future excursions or staying in a comfortable hotel?  Drivers who manage to find the right amount of fellow travelers generally travel for free.

    <h2>  How the service works </h2><p>  Drivers must register at the Blah Blah Car.  Travel companions leave reviews directly on the site.  People who do not have their own car and plan to hitchhike do not have to register.  To find a good car that will go in the right direction at a certain time, you only need to set the search parameters.  It should be indicated when it is necessary to leave, from where and where.  The system will display all possible options. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

Additionally, drivers indicate the conditions of the trip.  For example, if smoking is allowed in the cabin while driving, the vehicle owner will inform you of this.  If the driver does not like to talk on the road or listen to loud music, you will also be able to find out about this in advance.

    <p>  Each driver has his own rating, which is growing due to positive reviews.  It is beneficial for vehicle owners to work through Blah Blah Kar.  Travelers without registration can leave reviews without any problems.  However, some drivers create a rating for themselves thanks to the promotion services.  Preference should be given to those car owners who have good reviews from real users. </p><h2>  How is payment made? </h2><p>  If you managed to find a good car, which leaves at the right time in the right direction, you just have to pay the driver.  However, money is not paid directly.  Initially, a certain amount goes to the transit account.  And only on arrival, the money gets at the disposal of the driver.  If a fellow traveler has paid a certain amount, but for a number of reasons could not hit the road, he must warn the driver in advance.  In this case, the amount for the trip will be refunded in part or in full. </p>

The site absolutely does not charge a commission from its users.  But in Europe, you have to deposit 15% more.  Most likely, in the future this situation will develop in the CIS countries.  However, even with a commission, traveling through the service will be much cheaper than using the services of tour operators.

    <h2>  How to offer a ride to the driver </h2><p>  A person who has his own car and plans to find partners on the road should initially register on the Blah Blah Kar website.  Travelers will leave feedback after the trip.  The more users can use the services of a driver, the higher he will have a rating. </p>

Next, you need to specify the parameters of the trip.  The driver specifies the starting and ending points with possible stops.  Be sure to indicate how many seats can be reserved.  In case of interest, a possible travel companion contacts the driver through the service.  Other contact information may also be provided.

    <h2>  Security </h2><p>  As described above, a fellow traveler can find the right car without first registering.  However, most drivers are in no hurry to trust strangers.  Preference is given to users who have provided real information about themselves, and also have a sufficient number of positive reviews.  Without registration, it is rarely possible to find an inexpensive travel option. </p>

In this way, many begin to gain a rating on ‚ÄúBlah Blah Kar‚Äù.  Someone should leave impressions from a fellow traveler for the first time.

    <p>  Each driver, even before the start of the journey, has the right to familiarize himself with documents proving the identity of the companion.  Safety is paramount in this matter. </p><h2>  Service Reviews </h2><p>  Every day, the company is developing more and more opportunities for comfortable travel around the world.  Already there is an opportunity to open access to their offers only to a specific category of users.  Women note that sorting drivers by gender is very convenient.  Indeed, many jealous husbands can‚Äôt even imagine in their thoughts the possibility of a woman traveling in the same car with another man.  But some representatives of the stronger sex, on the contrary, choose only girls.  Service helps to unite hearts as well! </p><p>  You should definitely travel through the ‚ÄúBlah Blah Kar‚Äù.  Travelers reviews will definitely leave positive if the trip gave a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãpleasant emotions and new acquaintances. </p>
