  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Digital and analog television.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Modernity gives mankind such a variety of different benefits that people have a desire to receive more and more.  Today, instead of a conventional mobile phone, many of us are increasingly choosing a device with a <span>touch screen,</span> Internet chats are replaced by communicating with a video image, and the usual on-air television seems to be an outdated rarity when there were huge possibilities for digital broadcasting.  A wide range of programs, the highest quality, all this creates the desire to get rid of obsolete terrestrial television in favor of such innovations as digital and analog television. </p><p>  Cable television entered the life of Russians about fifteen years ago.  First of all, the first subscribers were tempted by the chance to add at least some variety to the broadcasting network.  Indeed, at that time even one additional television channel was already a big advantage.  Soon, dozens of various channels began to offer viewers.  Then it seemed that the cable capacity should someday be limited, but soon the usual cable TV was replaced by digital and analog television. </p><p>  In digital format, now about 6 channels are offered to subscribers in the basic package and about 14 TV channels are in test mode, while the cable that provided analog broadcasting had no more than 60 television channels. </p><p>  If we consider digital and analog television from a technical point of view, we can expand the volume of its broadcasting almost endlessly.  The capabilities of subscribers can constantly increase, and even the most demanding viewer will find what he needs.  Want to know more about the Egyptian pyramids or wild <span>African tribes?</span>  Turn on the adventure channel.  More interested in scientific discoveries and secrets of the unknown?  You can choose a scientific channel.  Music, films, culture, cartoons - just have time to switch channels. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If a subscriber wants to rid himself of channels that are not of particular interest to him, today there is an opportunity to create a ‚ÄúList of favorite channels‚Äù.  This option allows you to select about ten programs, and watch them as much as you like.  For example, such a menu: classic movies, music, travel and cartoons.  By the way!  Some viewers are especially scrupulous in matters that relate to quality.  Of course, it is always nice to have the opportunity to view the picture in great detail without straining your eyes.  Thanks to the fact that analogue TV and <span>digital technologies are</span> now replacing broadcasting <span>, this is</span> becoming quite possible. </p><p>  For fans of screens of huge sizes, there is also very good news.  They are well aware that the quality of the television ‚Äúpicture‚Äù is noticeably reduced as the screen increases.  In principle, this effect is comparable to photography: after all, the larger the photo is enlarged on a computer monitor, the more noticeable are all the shortcomings.  So, companies engaged in the promotion of digital technologies are already starting to provide their subscribers with high-definition TV channels.  With this resolution, <span>the screen size</span> does not affect the image quality at all. </p><p>  Analog television and digital broadcasting provide subscribers with another advantage - the ability to change the broadcast language of the TV channel.  If suddenly foreign guests come to you, they will be able to choose their native Italian or French channel to watch TV programs and program their broadcasting in their own language. </p><p>  Today, specialists working in areas such as digital and analog television have taken into account the smallest needs of viewers, which can provide maximum comfort to subscribers.  For example, take a detail such as a program guide on a television screen.  Now there is no need to buy newspapers with announcements and periodically look for rumpled newspaper pages under the sofa.  The broadcast menu is displayed at the touch of a button. </p><p>  The changes are obvious: everything that millions of viewers could only dream of recently became available! </p>
