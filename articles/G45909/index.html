    <p>  At the hotel there are many ways to have fun and have a good time.  The animation here is positive, active, but unobtrusive - you can go in for sports, take part in contests or competitions, or just watch an interesting performance.  The staff at the hotel are polite and hospitable - you can always turn to them for help.  Almost all employees speak English and Russian, so communication problems should not arise. </p><p>  According to reviews, most vacationers are families with children, as the kids here are fun and comfortable, and parents have time to relax and sunbathe.  In addition, the cost of hotel accommodation is affordable, especially considering the level of service. </p>
