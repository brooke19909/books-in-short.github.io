    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  As mentioned above, Valana Hotel 3 * is a complex of apartments.  People cook for themselves or eat in cafes and restaurants.  Moreover, there are a lot of grocery stores around, including supermarkets with good discounts.  You can eat at the hotel itself - there are trips with a half-board of the "breakfast-dinner" type.  The hotel has a restaurant, a snack bar, and a cocktail bar by the pool.  There is a children's menu, high chairs for babies are provided.  For breakfast, it is customary to serve salads and vegetable dishes, as well as cheeses and <span>cold meats.</span>  Dinners are praised.  There are always several types of meat dishes to choose from, stewed vegetables, and fruits for dessert.  Great Cypriot coffee.  But many tourists, judging by the reviews, prefer to dine every day in the new restaurant, and have a snack on the beach.  Moreover, they cook tastier there, and the assortment is larger. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Valana hotel class" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1009371.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sea and pool </h2><p>  Valana Hotel Class 3 *, as befits an institution of this type of "star", has an outdoor pool with a children's section.  He is very good, large, odorless bleach.  Extremely like children.  Near it - a lounge area with everything you need.  To get to the sea, you need to go through several streets.  The beach is public, sandy, equipped, with paid sun loungers and deck chairs.  Here you can not only sunbathe and swim, but also ride a yacht, learn how to windsurf, dive with a mask or ride with a breeze on water skiing or a scooter.  The entrance to the water is convenient, the water is clear.  Not to mention all sorts of "bananas", "cheesecakes" and other essential attributes of a beach holiday.  Although the coast is not very wide, tourists note that there are a lot of trees near the water under which you can hide in the heat and save yourself from having to pay for an umbrella.  The sand, as always in Limassol, is volcanic, gray.  It is good for those with joint diseases. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Valana hotel class 3" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1009362.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Tourists called the Valana Hotel Class 3 * hotel wonderful, but not suitable for vacationers who are accustomed to all inclusive.  It is suitable for independent travelers who try to save on accommodation in order to be able to spend money on exploring the island and shopping.  The hotel is very conveniently located.  Yes, it is not on the first line, but it provides an opportunity to save money.  The rooms are large.  In such studios in a couple of days you already feel like in a real apartment.  It is fun here, there are a lot of young people from different countries, and even from Cyprus itself.  At the same time, no one screams at night, and the rooms are quiet.  Almost all windows face the courtyard, while guests in the neighboring apartments cannot sleep due to noise from the road.  People are very friendly, they will always help you and tell you everything.  Relatives of the owner can even give you a free city tour if they like you.  In a word, if you are ready to enjoy Cyprus and walk, and not spend all the time in your room, you will be satisfied.  This is a worthy place. </p>
