    <p>  Take measurements first.  After all, you need to know the size.  For a jacket you will need data such as the width of the front and back, shoulder width, you need to know the length of the product from shoulder to strap, sleeve length.  Take a centimeter and find out by measuring the girth of the chest - at the most prominent points of the chest, girth of the waist, hips, length of the front to the waist, length of the back, shoulder and sleeve.  Based on these measurements, you build a pattern on yourself. </p><h2>  Selection of materials and tools </h2><p>  <span>Knitting a cardigan with knitting needles</span> for women is characterized by the fact that he does not need many devices.  So, in order to create an exclusive thing, the craftswoman needs yarn and knitting needles.  Knitting needles can be made of different materials, they can be plastic, wooden, metal.  If you are not a very experienced knitter, then it is better to take metal knitting needles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting cardigan for women" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/671718.jpg" width="213"></div>

For example, acrylic and wool.  Products made from such a yarn will be less susceptible to deformation during washing and drying. </p><h2>  Start knitting </h2><p>  Knitting is a fascinating activity, and it is not difficult to learn.  A beginner knitter should learn from more experienced craftswomen.  Knitting magazines may come to the rescue.  For example, Verena, in which you will find detailed instructions on how to knit a beautiful thing.  You can also choose a model there, because in this magazine in a large number there are tips on <span>how to knit</span> jackets, cardigans with knitting needles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting jacket with a description" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/674369.jpg" width="370"></div>

    <p>  Having found the model, you must calculate the number of loops needed to start knitting, and make a pattern.  A jacket with knitting needles, the schemes of which you can copy from a magazine to a notebook, will now become a simple task for you.  You also need to know how much yarn is needed for knitting.  Usually for this product for an adult you need five skeins of one hundred grams of yarn.  If you knit a <span>long jacket</span> for a girl with knitting needles, then you may need more yarn. </p><h2>  Little jacket: materials and patterns </h2><p>  Spring mood will be achieved with a short fluffy jacket in <span>pastel color.</span>  With it, you can create your own touching and romantic image.  In order to knit such a jacket with knitting needles (the description can be found in the article), you will need three hundred grams of Gonca Cartopu yarn, fifty grams of Flora Cartopu yarn, number 3 knitting needles, hook number 2, two buttons of the same color as the yarn, and special needle for wool with a big eye. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting jacket for girls" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/671738.jpg" width="340"></div>

This pattern is constantly repeated on the front side, on the wrong side all crochets are sewn with <span>purl loops.</span>  Such a women's jacket with knitting needles is knitted with a single fabric, the beginning of knitting is the back.  Loops calculated for size 40. </p><h2>  The procedure for working on a jacket </h2><p>  On the knitting needles 70 loops, then knit four rows with an elastic band two by two.  During the first row, one loop is added, then we continue to knit with an openwork pattern.  After nine centimeters from the edge, we begin to add loops for the sleeves.  In each second row, add one loop two times, then add two loops in each row, then three loops in each row.  So the jacket is knitted with knitting needles (with the description in the article) up to a height of 29 centimeters.  At this height, we close the central 28 loops for the neck at the back, and now the two parts are knitted separately. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cardigan knitting scheme" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/671719.jpg" width="340"></div>

    <p>  After two rows, one loop should be added thirteen times in every fourth row.  This is necessary to form the neck in front.  To form the sleeves, you need to close 15 loops on the sides in each second row at a distance of 15 centimeters from the neck, two times three loops, two times two loops, two times one loop.  The jacket with knitting needles (with the description in this article) will turn out great if you knit a two-on-two elastic band for the butt, add three loops during the first row.  When two and a half centimeters are tied with an elastic band, then you need to close 38 loops on the shelves. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Assembly and decoration </h2><p>  So, you carefully studied knitting a jacket for women and even did all the work.  But now you need to complement your product.  With the help of the hook you can finish the front shelves and the neck.  The edge can be tied with crochets, the second and third rows can be made with double crochets.  The crochet of the jacket is also crocheted.  It is necessary to tie a chain of air loops fifty centimeters long and then do the following rows with single crochet, while the height of the belt will be about two to three centimeters.  To get the jacket with knitting needles (you got acquainted with the description) successfully, you need to decorate it with flowers.  Crochet a chain of five loops, lock in a ring and process in this way: three double crochet, six air loops and so on in a circle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted cardigan" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/671723.jpg" width="212"></div>

    <p>  To knit a warm product, you will need five hundred or six hundred grams of Schulana Mandola yarn, number 5 straight knitting needles, two hook-and-loop fasteners.  This is a mixed yarn consisting of half wool, half polyacrylic.  Before starting work, make a pattern on paper to have a pattern with which you can compare a knitted fabric. </p><h2>  How to work on a jacket </h2><p>  If you need to know how to knit a jacket with knitting needles (with a description of the process) for size 44, then you can put 56 loops on the knitting needles and knit with the <span>front stitch.</span>  It will be a back.  At a height of thirty centimeters from the edge, you need to close three loops once for the armhole and, in each second row, two loops once. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting cardigans for women" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/671725.jpg" width="340"></div>

    <p>  So you will make armholes.  When the height of the armhole is equal to 21 centimeters, it is necessary to begin to form shoulder bevels.  To do this, on both sides it closes once in two loops, in each second row once in three.  As a result, after 54 centimeters from the typesetting edge, you should have fourteen loops that you will close. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting jacket for girls" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/674363.jpg" width="353"></div>

    <p>  To knit the left shelf, you type thirty loops on the knitting needles and knit the front surface to a height of thirty centimeters.  Then, from the right edge, close three loops once, then in each second row once two.  When the height of the armhole reaches twenty centimeters, you need to postpone four loops for cutting the neck from the left edge, in each second row you will close two loops two times and two times three.  Shoulder bevels close, as on a back. </p><p>  Knitting a jacket for women means creating sleeves.  To do this, you need to dial thirty-two stitches on the knitting needles, knit to a height of forty centimeters, and then form a sleeve ridge.  To do this, close on both sides once three loops, then once two loops in the front rows, in each fourth row close two loops.  When the height of the oket of the sleeve reaches fifteen centimeters, then you close the remaining six loops. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knit cardigans" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/671728.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  After you have prepared all the details, you need to steam, dry, and then connect using a special kettel seam.  It is carried out by means of a plastic needle with a wide eye.  You can buy it at the hardware store.  Connect the parts of the product with the same thread from which you knitted the product.  Sewing threads cannot be used, because then the product will not stretch. </p>
