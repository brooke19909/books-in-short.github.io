Therefore, not everyone can afford a trip to this amazing country.  But you can go to Israel in February, when travel packages become more affordable. </p><h2>  Weather </h2><p>  The weather in Israel in February is characterized by rainy days, but the air temperature remains moderately warm.  An exception is the southern regions of the country, which are located next to <span>the Negev desert.</span>  In these regions, there are more dry and sunny days. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="to Israel in February" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47695/1718293.jpg" width="583"></div>

    <p>  For some, a trip to Israel in February is considered unreasonable.  Nevertheless, the Israeli winter is very different from the Russian one.  Therefore, our travelers do not perceive the Israeli winter as the locals do.  For example, in Tel Aviv and Netanya, the air warms up to 17, and sometimes up to 21 ¬∞ C, and at night it drops to 11 degrees. </p><p>  In Jerusalem, during the day, the thermometer reaches an average of 14 ¬∞ C; at night the air cools down to 8 degrees.  In Tiberias and Haifa, the thermometer often shows 16 ¬∞ C.  The warmest in Eilat - the average temperature here is 20-22 ¬∞ C, because the coast of the Red Sea has always been characterized by higher temperatures.  But still, going to Israel in February, you should take a windbreaker and sweater with you. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Holiday Choice </h2><p>  Of course, the winter season is considered the coldest in Israel.  But in fairness, it should be noted that day and night all over the country keep positive marks.  The exception is mountainous regions, where snow often falls.  So, when purchasing tours to Israel in February, it is recommended to choose the appropriate vacation in advance. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather in israel in february" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47695/1718289.jpg" width="552"></div>

    <p>  In the summer, travelers travel to this country to relax in its many resorts.  Excursion tours to Israel in February are mainly aimed at visiting pilgrimage sites and ancient attractions. </p><p>  According to the reviews of numerous tourists, it can be concluded that in February you can safely enjoy the sights of Jerusalem, wander through the quiet streets of Nazareth, plunge into the hectic life of Tel Aviv and relax on the <span>beaches of Eilat.</span>  Whether or not to take swimsuits with you - each tourist decides individually.  But in order to enter the Mediterranean Sea in winter, one must have the appropriate preparation for this.  If you are going to Israel in February and wanting to spend a vacation on the beach, it is better to go to the Red Sea. </p><h2>  Eilat in February </h2><p>  Many people call this resort the Israeli "pearl", because here, along with a high level of service, you can relax at any time of the year.  And indeed, the warmest weather is in the south of the country, and rains are relatively rare. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tours in israel in february" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47695/1718292.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The average air temperature during the day and the average water temperature here reach the mark of 22 degrees.  But warm clothes are still worth taking with you.  Because in February there are often winds, and at night the air cools down to 10 degrees.  Many tourists come to Eilat at the end of winter, in February, to enjoy sunbathing on the seashore.  But here you should not count on a bronze tan.  The maximum that you can get is a dark skin tone. </p><h2>  Dead Sea in February </h2><p>  Some tourists intentionally travel to Israel to spend time at the Dead Sea.  Rest on this pond helps relieve stress, free yourself from negative thoughts and improve your health.  But in February, <span>the water temperature in the Dead Sea</span> reaches 18 degrees, and dipping in it gives an invigorating effect for the body as a whole. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Israel in February" class="if" height="307" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47695/1718986.jpg" width="531"></div>

    <p>  According to the reviews of travelers, it is clear that vacationers come here, but much less than in the summer.  Experienced tourists are advised to bring along a container with a sealed lid for salt crystals, which can be collected along the coastline.  These salt crystals are no different from those sold in tourist shops.  If you drive purposefully to the Dead Sea, you can purchase a two-week tour to one of the spa hotels in the resort of Ein Bokek.  Those who rest in other Israeli resorts can buy a two-hour excursion to the Dead Sea.  Such excursions are sold in any hotel or in numerous travel agencies. </p><h2>  Ramat Shalom in February </h2><p>  There are tourists who travel to this subtropical Mediterranean country to spend their holidays in the Ramat Shalom ski resort, which is located on the highest point of the country - on Mount Hermon. </p><p>  Resort hotels offer their vacationers a high level of service and beautiful rooms.  For the best comfort of tourists, special tracks and equipped lifts have been laid on the mountain.  The ski slopes are not particularly difficult, and a person with a slight slalom skill can easily pass on them. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="israel february reviews" class="if" height="318" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47695/1718333.jpg" width="517"></div>

    <p>  It should be noted that a reserve exists on the territory of Hermon.  Therefore, on the side of the mountain you can see a variety of amazing landscapes and waterfalls.  But Israel is a country of attractions, so admirers of history and antiquity on Mount Hermon can visit the ancient city of Ramla, Nimrod Fortress and wineries in the Golan Heights. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  It should be noted that a large number of travelers specifically depart for Israel in February.  Reviews from most of them are the most enthusiastic.  So, for example, our compatriots write that they are going to Israel in February, when there are no crowds of numerous tourists.  At this time, they can easily get acquainted with the sights of Jerusalem and Haifa, relax on the shores of the Dead Sea and wander around all sorts of interesting places. </p><p>  Arriving in Israel in mid-February, travelers note that during the entire stay in the country the days were sunny and warm.  But at night the air temperature dropped to 6 degrees Celsius.  Tourists are pleased that various excursions can be safely purchased at any hotel in the city. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sightseeing tours to Israel in February" class="if" height="348" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47695/1718295.jpg" width="542"></div>

    <p>  Many people travel to Israel in February to fulfill their long-held dream of plunging into <span>the Jordan River.</span>  However, it should be noted that washing takes place in special clothing, which is sold directly by the river for 25 shekels.  In tourist shops, its price drops to 20 shekels, and in any city store it can be purchased for 5 shekels.  In the last month of winter, a lot of people come here to plunge into the holy river or to conduct a baptismal ceremony. </p><h2>  February Holiday Benefits </h2><p>  February is the best month for practical tourists.  First of all, the cost of permits is markedly reduced.  Travel companies offer customers a large number of attractive offers at affordable prices.  In addition, you should be aware that when traveling to Israel in February, you can settle in a hotel for a little money and purchase a subscription to spa treatments.  At the end of winter, even tourist shops make significant discounts for their customers.  In general, when you intend to spend your vacation in Israel in February, you can have a budget rest with appropriate comfort. </p>
