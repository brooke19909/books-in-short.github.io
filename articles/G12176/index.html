A country that is generous with the sun, warmth and hospitality.  The country of eternal summer and eternal smiles.  It is said that in Thailand it is impossible to frown and walk in a bad mood.  Nature itself acts as a healer and heals from spleen and depression, longing and despondency.  Among the many paradises lost in this small country, the island of Phangan is not the last.  Thailand is proud of this oasis of relaxation, where the gentle sun and velvet sandy beaches invade foreign guests weary of everyday life.  Have you never been there before?  What are you waiting for?  The next vacation can be spent on exploring the sights of this country.

    <h2>  Koh Phangan Island (Thailand) on a country map </h2><p>  The charming town, which attracts tourists with its beauties, takes up very little space on the map.  Yes, he is miniature in real life, he can not be called a giant.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe island is 168 sq. Km.  And in diameter, this baby is only 15 km.  But, despite such a small size, the island of Phangan (Thailand) enjoys well-deserved popularity among local residents and is well known to foreign guests. </p><h2>  Name history </h2><p>  Previously, this shelter for tired tourists was called Koh Phangan.  He is now so often called.  He owes his name to the word "Ko", which is translated into the familiar language as "island", and another word from the vocabulary of the inhabitants of the southern provinces - "ngan", this word means "sand barrier" or "strip". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pangan island thailand" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12993/367661.jpg?1396711637905" width="374"></div>  A telling name, because the coastal part of the resort is replete with many sandy islands and sediments.  They protect the island from waves of aggressive times and strong monsoons.

It is separated from the capital by 500 km.  It is part of the famous Samui archipelago, which includes about 40 islands.  For a small country like Thailand, this is a lot.  Koh Phangan is located at a distance of 15 km from the main <span>island of the</span> Samui <span>archipelago</span> .  The main port of the town is Thong Sala.  He is also part of the capital. </p><h2>  History tour </h2><p>  We rarely think about the past of the settlements we visit while traveling.

It was they who confirmed his solid age.  As it turned out, the existence of Phangan Island dates back 2000 years.  In the 19th century, the Chinese began to emigrate, due to which population growth was formed.  At the very beginning of the 20th century, about 300 families lived here.  Lovely, kind Thais did not pretend to European charms.  They quietly enjoyed the eternal sun and the generous gifts of the sea.  Mainly engaged in agriculture and fishing.  But since the mid-80s, the situation has changed dramatically.  Thailand decided to go into the tourism business.  And crowds of tourists from all over the world poured into this paradise country.  I liked Thailand, they began to talk about it more and more often.  Today it is one of the fashionable resorts.  Among the most visited regions of the country are Phangan Islands.

    <ol><li>  Bangkok.  It is located near Phangan.  However, in this cozy country everything is at hand.  A bus runs from Bangkok to the island.  Such pleasure will cost from 500 to 1500 baht.  There are both tourist and local buses to Phangan.  The first of them leave from the street, which is designed specifically for guests of the country, the second - from the usual bus station.  You cannot give preference to any one type of transport.  Both are equally comfortable and suitable for movement. </li><li>  Surat Thani.  This place also has a local airport called Surat Thani Airport.  You can get to Phangan by traveling by bus, and then by ferry.  The trip will take about 2.5 hours. </li><li>  Samui  Here you will be met by the airport of the same name.  From this city, getting to Phangan is easy.

The beaches of Phangan Island represent a whole kaleidoscope of popular and not-so-small places where you can swim in the sea waves, meditate, lying on the beach and absorbing in every cell the generous warmth of the Asian sun.

    <p>  What kind of beaches does it make sense to visit when you arrive in Koh Phangan (Thailand)? </p><ol><li>  Malibu.  This place was named for the pleasant to the touch white sand.  There are swings on the beach right under the palm tree. </li><li>  Mae Had.  Another place that can not be ignored.  It is characterized by crystal water and coral reefs.  Decoration can be called an alley located in the middle of the beach.  It consists of 2 rows of trees on which flowers stunning in their beauty grow. </li><li>  Coma.  The island, which will be a discovery for those who are engaged in diving.  You can get on it with Mae Had, going through a sand spit.  Here is an unforgettable snorkeling <span>(scuba diving).</span>  There you can admire a huge variety of marine life. </li><li>  Haad Salad.  One of the most beautiful beaches that Phangan boasts.  Thailand is famous for such places where it takes your breath away from the miraculous charms of the surrounding nature.  Nearby is a village with developed infrastructure.  So here you will not be divorced from civilization. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pangan thailand how to get" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12993/367662.jpg?1396711867239" width="273"></div></li><li>  Had Yao.  This is a vacation for those who want to be alone, who are tired of the daily crazy rhythm of life.  There are no Thai noisy markets, no cafes, but there is an amazing opportunity to enjoy the sunsets and enjoy the ringing silence. </li><li>  Had Reed.  If you want to look here, you should remember that the road to it is really dangerous, many steep turns will appear on your way.  Therefore, it is better to give preference to a taxi.  Had Rin is famous for its amazing Full moon party.  This is a great place if you are attracted to a club holiday.  But there are all conditions for doing nothing on the beach.  Warm and gentle sand, a hospitable lagoon will take you into their arms. </li></ol><h2>  Sights of Phangan </h2><p>  Despite its miniature size, there was a place here and the cultural values ‚Äã‚Äãthat Phangan is famous for.  Thailand is a unique country that boasts its traditions and monuments. </p><ul><li>  You can visit the <span>Buddhist temple</span> built by the Chinese.  He is not so many years old.  Documents indicate that he recently celebrated his 20th anniversary.  But this in no way detracts from its merits.  Vivid drawings on the walls, a <span>Buddha statue,</span> attractive multi-tiered turrets - all this can be seen in the temple. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pangan island thailand photo" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12993/367660.jpg?1396711917252" width="262"></div></li><li>  If you want, elephant safari is at your service.  There is a special trail on horseback for horse riding on these animals.  The sensations you will experience are amazing. </li><li>  Full Moon Party - a unique party in the festival format.  Constantly it collects about 20-30 thousand people.  If you were at the time of its holding (arrange it once a month), be sure to visit this show. </li></ul><h2>  What do tourists in love say? </h2><p>  All of us, going to any unfamiliar country, are harassing inquiries with friends and acquaintances who are already fortunate enough to visit there.  Before you go to Thailand, it would also be nice to get acquainted with the opinions of experienced tourists.  If you are attracted to Koh Phangan, reviews will help you with a choice of accommodation, tell you about prices and which beach is better to prefer.  People who have been there once remember their journey with a happy smile and dream of returning to this country again. </p><p>  Many attractive secrets and generous gifts hide Phangan Island.  Thailand, whose photo is admired by the beauty of the landscape, has more than one such magical corner in stock.  So why not start dating them? </p>
