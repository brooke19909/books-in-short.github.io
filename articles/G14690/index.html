How is he interesting?  Where is?  What legends are associated with it?  We will talk about this and much more in this article. </p><h2>  Where is? </h2><p>  Where is Chufut-Kale located?  <span>The cave city</span> is located on the Crimean peninsula in the Bakhchisarai district.  The nearest city (Bakhchisaray) is about 2.5-3 kilometers.  The fortified city is located on a high steep mountain plateau of the spur of the inland Crimean mountains, which is surrounded by three deep valleys. </p><p>  Chufut-Kale is a cave city, whose address cannot be found on any map.  The location in the guides is approximate: Bakhchisaray district, <span>Crimean peninsula.</span> </p><p>  In order not to go astray, heading to the cave city of Chufut-Kale, the coordinates for GPS navigators are as follows: N 44 ° 44'27 ”E 33 ° 55'28”. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  One of the questions that arises for those who want to visit the cave city of Chufut-Kale is how to get there.  There are two options: to travel by public transport to the final stop "Staroselye" (Bakhchisaray) and then follow the signs to the fortress on foot or go to Chufut-Kale as part of an excursion group (this option is chosen by most tourists vacationing at the resorts of the Crimean southern coast peninsula). </p>

    <h2>  Cave Name Options </h2><p>  The cave city has changed its name more than once in its centuries-old history. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  According to one version, the first name of the city was Fulla.  A settlement with this name is repeatedly mentioned in the annals of 1-2 centuries of our era, however, scientists were unable to establish exactly where it was. </p><p>  Since the 13th century, in the sources this city is already referred to as Kirk-Or (the Kirk-Er variant is still encountered), which literally translates as “forty fortifications”.  Also, during the reign of the Crimean Khan, you can find the name Gevher-Kermen (in translation - "fortress of jewels"), this name can be explained by the fact that Tatar ulama decorated all the gates, walls and gates of the castle with precious stones. </p><p>  In the mid-17th century, the citadel was transferred to the Karaites and received a new name - Kale.  Translated from the Crimean dialect of the Karaite language, “kale” (“kala”) means “brick wall, fortification, fortress”. </p><p>  After the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula to the Russian Empire, the village of Kale transforms into the cave city of Chufut-Kale, which is translated from the <span>Crimean Tatar language</span> as “Jewish” or “Jewish” fortress (çufut - Jew, Jew; qale - fortress).  This name was given to the fortress by merchants who came here for various needs, gradually the name Chufut-Kale becomes official, it is used in the scientific works of Soviet scientists and in the literature of Karaite authors from the middle of the 19th century to 1991. </p>

    <p>  Since 1991, the Crimean leaders of the Karaites renamed the cave city-fortress Chufut-Kale in Juft-Kale (translated as a double or double fortress), but this renaming was unofficial. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Along with the names Chufut- and Dzhuft-Kale, other names of the cave city are also found in Karaite literature: until the middle of the 19th century it is called “Selo Yuhudim”, and after it - “Sela ha-Karaim”. </p><h2>  Foundation History </h2><p>  There are several versions about the foundation of the cave city.  According to one of them, the first settlement here was founded by the Sarmatians and Alans in the 4th century AD.  According to the second version, to which most scholars are inclined, in 550 years (during the reign of Byzantium Emperor Justinian) in order to protect the approaches to Chersonesos, three cave fortress cities were founded: Chufut-Kale, Mangul-Kale and Eski-Kermen.  However, data on these villages were not included in the treatise "On buildings", information about them became available as a result of archaeological excavations. </p><p>  The impregnable cliffs and high cliffs formed by nature were framed by man with high walls and fortifications.  The citadel has become a reliable shelter and an excellent defensive structure. </p><h2>  Fortress during the Crimean Khanate </h2><p>  In the second half of the 11th century, the Kipchaks (better known as the Polovtsy) gained dominance over the fortress, renaming it Kirk-Er. </p><p>  In 1299, the forces of the Emir Nogai took this fortification by storm after a long and stubborn siege, plundered, expelling the Sarmatian-ulans who inhabited the citadel.  The conquered cave city of the Tatars was called Kirk-Or. </p>

    <p>  In the 13-14 centuries (during the reign of Khan Dzhani-Bek) there was one of the garrisons of the Crimean ulus, breaking away from the Golden Horde. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The cave city of Chufut-Kale was actively and rapidly developing in the 15th century.  The reason for the rapid development of the citadel was the fact that Kirk-Or became the first capital of the Crimean Khanate.  <span>Khan Hadji Giray</span> built his residence here after he defeated the ruler of the Kirk-Orsky Khanate Eminek-Bey.  Haji Giray became the founder of a whole dynasty of Crimean rulers.  During his reign, a khan's palace was built on the territory of the fortress, a madrasah was founded, the mosque erected under Janibek was expanded.  There is an assumption that in the first years of the reign of Khan Haji Giray, a mint was also built, where silver coins with the inscription “Kirk-Or” were printed (the remains of this building were found on the territory of the fortress by archaeologists). </p><h2>  The history of the fortress after the deprivation of the status of the capital </h2><p>  In the middle of the 17th century, Khan Mengli Giray ordered the construction of a new palace in Solonchak and transferred the Khan's residence there.  The fortress was given to the Karaites and renamed in Kale, and later received its final name - Chufut-Kale.  The Karaites increased the area of ​​Chufut-Kale almost 2 times due to the defense system attached to the east side, behind which a trade and craft settlement was formed. </p><p>  The ancient wall, made up of large rectangular-shaped stone blocks and fastened with mortar, has now become a middle one, dividing the plateau into eastern and western parts, each of which could hold an independent defense.  So another name for the fortress appeared - Juft-Kale (steam or double fortress).  In front of the walls of the citadel dug a wide moat, insurmountable for <span>wall-hung guns,</span> pedestrian bridges were thrown over it. </p>

    <h2>  History from the time of joining the Russian Empire </h2><p>  During the reign of Peter I’s niece Anna Ioannovna, the Russian army captured Bakhchisaray and destroyed Chufut-Kale.  After the annexation of Crimea to the Russian Empire, the Empress’s decree lifted restrictions on the residence of Krymchaks and Karaites, many left the walls of the citadel, only a small Armenian community and some Karaites remained who did not want to leave established life. </p><p>  By the end of the 19th century, all residents left Chufut-Kale, only the caretaker's family remained to live here.  The last resident of the citadel, the famous Karaite scientist, the author of many scientific works A.S. Firkovich, left its walls in 1874. </p><h2>  The defensive value of the fortress </h2><p>  The primary value of Chufut-Kale is defensive.  In addition to high strong walls and a wide moat, several more tactically important decisions were applied here.  The road to the fortress passes by the Assumption Monastery, which has a source of drinking water, along the Mariam-Dere beam, then rises steeply up - past the cemetery - to the southern (small) gates.  These gates were built as a trap: they cannot be seen until you get close to them.  Most likely, there used to be a gate here, because oak leaves remained on the walls at the gates. </p>

    <p>  The path to the cave city of Chufut-Kale went along the steep slope of the ravine in such a way that the enemies were forced to climb to the citadel, turning to it with their right, least protected side (the shields were carried in the left hand and the weapons in the right).  During the rise, the enemies were attacked by arrows, which showered the defenders of the fortress specially equipped in the walls of the loopholes.  It was almost impossible to beat the gate with a ram: there was a steep slope in front of them, and a gentle path right in front of the gate made a sharp turn.  But even if the enemy penetrated the gate, another trap was waiting for him: the soldiers storming the citadel had to make their way along a narrow corridor specially knocked out in the rock.  Stones rained down on the heads of the conquerors from the wooden flooring arranged over the corridor, boiling water poured, and the archers hiding in the caves shot without a miss. </p><p>  On the eastern side, the city was protected by a high wall and a wide moat in front of it, and the southern, northern and western walls did not need protection, since the plateau on these sides breaks off vertically, only experienced climbers can climb here. </p><h2>  Architecture Chufut-Kale </h2><p>  Chufut-Kale is a cave city, the photo of which, unfortunately, is not able to convey its former power.  Until now, only part of the caves and few buildings of the Karaites have survived, most of the buildings are ruins. </p><p>  On the south side, the complex of the oldest caves is well preserved, the main purpose of which is defensive or combat.  In the old part of the city, most of the caves have already collapsed, but two household caves have survived.  These are large artificial structures that are interconnected by a stone staircase carved into the rock.  Presumably, these caves were used as a prison for prisoners who could be kept here for years (the assumption is based on the remains of bars on the windows of the lower cave and notes by Count Sheremetyev, who spent almost 6 years in Chufut-Kale prison).  Above these caves in the 17th century a residential building was built. </p>

    <p>  Not far from the caves, a beautiful example of architecture of the 15th century was preserved - the mausoleum of Dzhanike Hanim, with the name of which many legends are associated.  According to one of them, Dzhanike lived in the palace next to the barracks for 1000 soldiers, under her leadership, the soldiers heroically defended Chufut-Kale, but Hanim died during the siege.  Her father, Tokhtamysh Khan, ordered the construction of an octagonal mausoleum on the site of her death, decorated with a high portal and carved columns.  In the depths of the mausoleum there is still a tombstone of the tomb of the famous empress. </p><p>  The Karaite kenasses located near the mausoleum are also well preserved.  These rectangular buildings, surrounded by open terraces with columns and arches, served for general meetings, services were held here, and courts were held by spiritual elders.  At the end of the 19th century, an extensive library of ancient manuscripts collected by the scientist A. S. Firkovich was stored in the building of the Small Kenassa. </p><p>  On the narrow main street of the city, wheel ruts are preserved, their depth in some places reaches 0.5 meters, they testify to the centuries-old and active life that was boiling here once. </p><p>  It will also be interesting to visit the last resident of Chufut-Kale (A. S. Firkovich) hanging over the cliff of the house.  You can wander through the <span>defenses</span> in the eastern part of the fortress. </p><h2>  Cave city of Chufut-Kale: reviews of tourists </h2><p>  Tourists who visited the fortified city are strongly advised to go here accompanied by an experienced guide who will tell the story of this unique place and show in all its glory the cave city of Chufut-Kale.  At an altitude of just over 550 meters, beautiful monuments of antiquity have been preserved, looking at which you do not believe that people used to live here.  Often, looking at these caves, people do not believe that they were non-residential: here all the "residential" buildings were above the ground, and the caves were for utility or household purposes. </p>

    <h2>  What to see nearby? </h2><p>  Going to Chufut-Kale, a cave city, the photos of which will remind you of this amazing trip for many years to come, you should go to the Holy Assumption Monastery, founded in the 8th century, on the way back.  Here you can follow the icon of the Holy Assumption Mother of God, order services, pray or submit notes.  On the territory of the monastery there is a spring with delicious drinking water. </p><p>  You also need to visit the beautiful Khan's palace in Bakhchisarai, founded in the 16th century.  This beautiful palace looks like a decoration for a beautiful oriental tale.  In the palace you can see how the khan lived, visit the art museum and an arms exhibition, take a picture against the backdrop of the Fountain of Tears sung by Pushkin. </p><p>  Chufut-Kale is one of the few surviving cave cities in Crimea and the most visited among them.  Caves and walls of the fortress, kenassa, mausoleum and narrow streets of the city breathe history and antiquity, making you think about the meaning and transience of life. </p>
