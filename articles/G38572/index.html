    <p>  While they are beneficial, the OS is somehow involved in the business operations of the company.  So, their cost should be included in the cost of finished products.  How does this happen?  Of course, in parts.  Equal shares in the category of goods in the process of creation of which the main asset is used.  What does this part of the cost attributable to equipment or facilities look like?  This is depreciation.  Each month, the calculated amount is accumulated on account 02, which is then written off to the cost of production. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The reasons for the disposal of fixed assets </h2><p>  The first thing that comes to mind when one has to talk about the liquidation of property is its moral and material obsolescence, that is, depreciation in all respects.  In the normal course of business, this usually happens.  The equipment has served its due date, depreciation deductions have been paid in full - the object can be written off.  And in good condition, upgrade or sell for parts. </p><p>  If you think more broadly and consider all the possible scenarios that may occur at the enterprise, it turns out that there are many more reasons for writing off fixed assets: </p><ul><li>  sale; </li><li>  exchange for other property in accordance with an exchange agreement; </li><li>  donation; </li><li>  damage due to emergency; </li><li>  premature wear; </li><li>  theft of property. </li></ul><p>  In each specific situation, there will be a need to draw up relevant documents confirming the reason for the disposal of fixed assets and record the completion of a business transaction in the accounts. </p><h2>  General instruction </h2><p>  How to write off fixed assets from the balance sheet of the enterprise, that is, to document the fact of decommissioning?  In whose authority do you decide whether the property is suitable for use or is it time to send it to rest?  An accounting policy comes to the rescue.  It should contain clear instructions on how to write off fixed assets from the balance sheet.  In general, a commission is created that is authorized to consider the suitability of the property, the appropriateness of its use and liquidation.  It consists of the head of the enterprise, the accountant and the head of the department in which this OS is installed.  In some cases, independent experts may be invited to fully evaluate the technical characteristics of the facility. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The decision of the commission is documented.  If the liquidation of the property is approved, decommissioning is carried out and the corresponding entries are made in accounting. </p><h2>  Documentation </h2><p>  After the commission inspects the facility and establishes the reasons for the need for decommissioning, the data obtained is recorded in the act of decommissioning the asset.  The preparation of this document is a prerequisite for the disposal of property from the balance sheet of the enterprise.  Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation developed unified forms of acts: </p><ul><li>  OS-4 - for fixed assets in the amount of 1 pc .; </li><li>  OS-4a - for organization transport; </li><li>  OS-4b - for several property items. </li></ul><p>  The document is filled in two copies, one of which is intended for the accountant, and the second for the person financially responsible for this property.  Be sure to indicate the reason for writing off the OS.  If the liquidation occurs through someone else's fault, employees (other individuals) must be indicated in the act. </p>

    <p>  The second table describes the individual characteristics of the property, which were usually previously recorded in the act of admission.  The third part is devoted to the costs associated with the disposal of fixed assets, as well as the benefits that arise in the case of the sale of residual material or spare parts.

Regulates the procedure for writing off property from the balance of small business entities - the Tax Code of the Russian Federation (Article 346.16).  According to the Code, upon disposal of fixed assets, the use of which in the future is not possible, their value is not fully included in the tax base.  The amount remaining on the balance sheet during the liquidation of non-current assets is not taken into account for tax purposes. </p>
