  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Gender Psychology and Psychology of Sex. What are the main differences?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Gender psychology is an absolutely new direction in the system of social sciences and humanities, it is just beginning its first steps and declares itself as an independent science in the field of psychological knowledge.  Gender psychology is responsible for the peculiarities of people's behavior depending on their affiliation with a male or female gender.  She studies phenomena such as self-esteem, socialization, prejudice, discrimination, self-perception and the emergence of various social norms and roles.  The basis of gender psychology is the psychosocial development of personality and gender psychology, it is these aspects that determine the structure of learning. </p><p><br>  Gender sociology is mainly concerned with the sexual development of girls and boys, and the adequacy of their sexual roles.  The bulk of scientific work on gender psychology does not study the <span>social inequality of the</span> sexes, the nature of gender differences and the assessment of psychological diversity between the sexes. <br>  Initially, the concept of ‚Äúgender‚Äù was intended to denote the physiological characteristics of a person (male or female), the gender of a person was considered the foundation and prevailed in determining social and psychological differences between men and women. <br><br>  As a rule, men are characterized by increased ambitiousness, rationality and independence, while women are considered more sensual, gentle, emotional and sociable.  Such ideas about women and men are very common in our culture.  Based on the latest scientific research, gender psychology claims that there are much more similarities than differences between women and men.  The only clear distinction between the sexes is their role in reproducing offspring.  Today, the physical differences between the sexes are very vague, because muscularity and endurance are no longer a priority for the male population of the planet.  For example, men from southeast Asia are much shorter than European women. <br><br>  In addition to physiological divisions between people, there is a division of their forms of activity, social roles, differences in behavior and temperament.  Very often, the biological sex does not quite correspond to the emotional characteristics, and sometimes it is the exact opposite.  Hence the concept of ‚Äúgender psychology‚Äù arises - that is, science that studies the totality of cultural and social norms that are considered the privilege of one gender or another.  Ultimately, it is not the biological gender of the personality that determines its type of activity and behavior model, but sociocultural norms affect the psychological characteristics of men and women.  Being a woman or a man in society does not mean possessing certain anatomical features of the body structure, it means scrupulously fulfilling the gender roles prescribed by society. <br><br>  Unlike <span>gender</span> psychology <span>, gender</span> psychology does not just study the <span>psychological characteristics of</span> men and women.  In the center of her attention, first of all, are the results of <span>personal development</span> caused by the phenomena of sexual stratification and differentiation.  Gender psychology primarily focuses on the hierarchy of statuses, roles, positions of women and men, while the issue of discrimination and gender inequality is actively discussed.  Gender psychology, like gender linguistics, in contrast to gender psychology, is characterized by different theoretical and methodological foundations.  For example, for gender psychology, the basis is the socio-constructivist paradigm, while for gender psychology, the basis is the biodeterminist paradigm. </p>
