    <p>  In the mountain valley of the <span>Krasnoyarsk Territory there</span> is a wonderful natural corner - Lake Uchum, which has bitter-salt water and healing silt mud.  The source is surrounded by low mountains.  Many centuries ago, many diseases were treated with Uchum mud.  In the XIX century, a treatment center was opened here, and a sanatorium resort with the name "Lake Uchum" was created in 1925. </p><h2>  Location </h2>

    <p>  First of all, it should be noted that the reservoir can quite boast of its rather unusual oval shape, while the water surface is a little more than 4 square meters.  km </p><p>  Specialists especially note sandy gravel, slightly boggy in the east, shores, gently sloping, sandy at the top, bottom with ubiquitous silty deposits.  The greatest depth of the lake is 6.5 meters. </p><p>  Lake Uchum (a map only once again confirms this statement) is located in an amazing valley, consisting of rocky slopes, gloomy bare rocks, mixed deciduous, pine, birch forests and steppe plots.  In the south and north of the valley, forest shelter belts rose above the earth's surface.  And thanks to the abundance of precipitation falling here, a lush and rather diverse grass cover was formed.  Uchum Lake is replenished with underground drains and <span>precipitation.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Although this place has been known since ancient times for its healing properties, doctors first turned their attention to it only in 1892. It was then that they discovered the healing properties of not only lake mineral water, but also mud, which contains hydrogen sulfide.  All data obtained were scientifically substantiated and classified. </p><p>  In addition, today's resort "Lake Uchum" has two springs with mineral water.  Not only locals try to come here, but also guests from near and even far abroad. </p><h2>  Healing rest on Lake Uchum </h2>

    <p>  Due to the location of the reservoir inside the mountain valley, a special climate has formed here.  According to experts, the lake today has unique healing properties.  It is able to heal the human body not only with its mineral water, but also with lake natural mud.  By the way, not everyone knows that the water from the springs of the southeastern and southern parts has long been called a kind of "local narzan." </p><h2>  The amazing properties of local mud </h2>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The mud of the lake today is an integral and most important healing factor of the resort.  Their healing characteristics were discovered at the end of the 19th century, during the complete diagnosis of the lake by specialists and scientists regarding its medicinal properties.  It should be noted that along the entire perimeter of the water expanse, the thickness of mud deposits varies.  In the center, it is the largest, and as the depth decreases, it decreases.  There is no mud at all on the south side of the lake. </p><p>  Such deposits with a complex chemical composition have a sharp hydrogen sulfide odor, black color and a uniform appearance.  To the touch they are velvety-oily and soft, without any difficulties are applied to the body and are easily washed off. </p><p>  In mud, in addition to hydrogen sulfide itself, there are: </p><ul><li>  calcium carbonate; </li><li>  <span>calcium sulfates</span> ; </li><li>  sodium; </li><li>  sodium chloride; </li><li>  magnesium; </li><li>  iron; </li><li>  copper; </li><li>  manganese; </li><li>  lead; </li><li>  titanium; </li><li>  vanadium; </li><li>  a number of other trace elements. </li></ul><p>  Scientists and doctors argue that the most healing is the mud of the lower layer of the central part of the reservoir.  These are the oldest sludge deposits with heat capacity, high hydrophilicity and heat-holding ability, which has a strong stimulating effect. </p><p>  The total reserves of therapeutic mud are approximately five million cubic meters.  Siberian doctors equate the local mud with similar deposits of the Black Sea coast. </p><p>  Experts unanimously defined the resort as a highly effective balneological and mud center for the treatment of diseases of the nervous system, digestive organs, musculoskeletal system and many others.  etc. That is why the Uchum Lake health resort located here is a sanatorium that has been successfully operating throughout the year. </p><h2>  What can I see </h2>

    <p>  Lake Uchum is naturally protected from the west wind due to the presence of a high ridge, which guarantees the presence of special microclimatic features.  In the summer, the resort is quiet, sunny, hot and sultry.  At night, the valley cools, dew falls, and the area is filled with invigorating fog. </p><p>  Vacationers love to spend free time, leisurely strolling around.  Many decide to climb Mount Lighthouse.  Two paths were laid to its summit: the first one was short but difficult (rocky and steep), the second one was long but gentle. </p><p>  The peak of the mountain is 340 m above the lake.  It offers a beautiful view of the reservoir itself, the village, medical buildings, and the lake valley.  Lake Uchum, the photo of which is presented in the article, is really very beautiful. </p><p>  However, it should be noted that the healing waters of this natural spring, like other similar ones, are in urgent need of safety, purity, maintaining the water balance and the natural mode of existence.  Plus, the resort area must be improved and brought to a higher level of comfort. </p><h2>  Features of wild relaxation </h2>

    <p>  There are many vacationers who came not only on trips.  Tourists get to the lake both independently and by regular transport - train and buses.  Uchum <span>train station</span> is located 16 km from the resort. </p><p>  Those who came to rest are mainly located on the northern shore of the lake, at the very foot of the mountain range.  There is a 200 m zone equipped with convenient beaches and access roads, guarded and protected from vehicles and, consequently, exhaust gases. </p><p>  In summer and warm autumn days, tent camps are set up in the surrounding area.  They are able to accommodate more than 1000 people.  All of them can choose their own treatment.  The simplest mud baths are organized here, but bathing in warm lake water is the most popular. </p><p>  Unfortunately, at the moment there is no infrastructure for visitors.  Visitors carry everything they need on their own or find it in a village near the resort, which has noticeably increased and improved over the past ten years.  Vacationers will be able to take mineral water from here, which is constantly beating from the well. </p><h2>  Rest in the sanatorium on the lake </h2><p>  Lake Uchum, despite its relatively small size - 4 km long and 2 wide - is a huge repository of natural medicines, and experienced medical staff of the resort sanatorium can help defeat many types of diseases. </p><p>  The institution has 4 residential buildings with 600 beds, a medical building, a restaurant, a dining room and VIP rooms.  From the first building to the dining room and medical building can be reached through a superbly equipped insulated passage.  On the ground floor there are double rooms, and the second and third are single rooms with double beds.  At the restaurant, meals are organized and served on a buffet basis. </p><p>  For disabled people in wheelchairs throughout the resort there are special ramps.  And for patients with an injured spine, the sanatorium has rooms with special multifunctional beds.  The clinic is equipped with specialized equipment to serve different categories of people with disabilities. </p><p>  In the second building there are two-room rooms with a bedroom, a living room and a private bathroom. </p><h2>  How to get to your destination </h2><p>  Every day from Krasnoyarsk at 10.20 a bus No. 573 leaves with a flight ‚ÄúKrasnoyarsk - Uchum‚Äù, at 8.40 and 19.00 - a bus No. 571 ‚ÄúKrasnoyarsk - Kopievo‚Äù leaves.  From the railway station daily and with an interval of several hours, private vans make five flights. </p>
