    <p>  Yes, it is precisely these viscous sweet candies that we will need.  A pair of sachets with a total weight of 180 grams can be purchased for 110-120 rubles, and the finished mastic as a result of this amount will turn out 900-1000 grams!  As you can see, the savings are obvious.  But this is not the only plus of homemade mastic.  Many people consider it tastier than a purchased competitor. <br><br>  So, do you need to decorate the cake with mastic with your own hands?  We will tell you how to make this product yourself using marshmallows.  Everything is very simple.  You need to put the souffle in a bowl, melt it to a viscous state in the microwave, add 2 tablespoons of room temperature butter to it, a couple of teaspoons of natural lemon juice and mix it all well.  After this, you need to add one tablespoon of powdered sugar to the mass (stock up on it, you will need a total of 500-700 grams of this product) until it acquires the consistency of batter.  After this, the future mastic must be kneaded (like a regular dough).  Homemade wonderful product is ready!  It is necessary to store such mastic in the same way as purchased mastic - always in cellophane film and in the refrigerator. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What does a beginner need? </h2><p>  In order to create figures with jewelry yourself, of course, you need to have the appropriate confectionery equipment.
