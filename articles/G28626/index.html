    <p>  In the surrounding area there are many attractions that can be visited as part of organized excursions.  For example, vacationers will visit the estate and museum of A. N. Ostrovsky, take a walk around Kineshma, go to the Museum of Local History and Museum A. Tarkovsky in Yuryevets, as well as to the Palekh Museum of Lacquer Miniatures.  They are waiting for a boat trip to the city of Ples. </p><h2>  Named in honor of the hero of the revolution, Stanko sanatorium (Ivanovo region): reviews </h2><p>  The impression that this medical institution makes on vacationers, first of all, depends on what level of service they are used to.  So, in their reviews, people of the older generation who compare the current state of the number of rooms and the quality of services with those that were in the Soviet period, evaluate the sanatorium (Ivanovo region) named after the revolutionary as a revolutionary.  As for young people, they find it boring there, which is quite natural.  After all, this institution is intended primarily for treatment, and not for entertainment. </p>

    <h2>  How much is the pleasure? </h2><p>  I must say that at all times of the year vouchers to the Stanko health resort are in demand.  Sanatorium (Ivanovo region) forms prices depending on the season.  They depend on the room category. </p><p>  You can get treatment either by buying a ticket with a full package of services, or by paying for treatment separately.  Moreover, the number of days can be any: from 1-2 to the 21st, and if there is a desire, more. </p><p>  Prices in the sanatorium also depend on whether treatment is included in the package or if it is only about rest.  In the first case, in the summer, double rooms cost 2200 rubles per day, single rooms - 2800 rubles per day, "Lux" - 3000 rubles per day, and "Suite" or "Studio" with air conditioning - 3100 rubles per day.  In addition, additional seats are provided, which are somewhat cheaper. </p><p>  If the guest chooses the option of rest without treatment, then during the holiday season double rooms cost 2200 rubles per day, single rooms 2500 rubles per day, Lux - 2700 rubles per day, and Lux ​​or Studio with air conditioning - 2800 rubles per day. </p><p>  Children under 14 years old when placed on the main place are given a discount of 25% of the cost of an adult permit. </p>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  From the bus station of the city of Kineshma, which is located next to the city bus station, flights are made several times a day to the sanatorium named after Stanko.  The first bus leaves at 06:25, and the last at 21:10. </p><p>  Those who go on vacation by their own vehicles and who are not familiar with the Ivanovo region can find the Stanko sanatorium if they first get to Kineshma, then turn left at the direction indicator towards Navolok and travel about 20 km. </p><p>  To have a great vacation and get rid of old sores, it is not necessary to go to distant lands.  You are always ready to receive the Ivanovo region.  For many decades Sanatorium Stanko has been a great place for relaxation and treatment, where guests will find a lot of entertainment and interesting excursions. </p>
