    <h2>  Etymology of the name </h2><p>  What explains such a strange name for the resort village?  Everything is very simple.  In 1878, two entrepreneurs of Greek origin, the Archangels and Creazi, decided to build a port for loading grain onto ships.  In nearby Yeisk was already like that.  But there, due to the shallow depth of the harbor, the ships could not approach the shore.  The grain was carried in boats and loaded onto ships on a long-distance roadstead.  That's when entrepreneurs turned their attention to the Jasen Spit.  This sandy embankment stretches from the village that gave it a name for thirteen kilometers in a southeast direction.  And the sea off the coast of the spit is deep enough for the approach of bulky vessels.  The Greeks built berths, warehouses and barracks for workers of the Yasensky crossing of bread.  A flood of nineteen fourteen washed away all these structures.  But people did not leave their homes.  Residents built houses and began to engage in fishing.  And the former name - Yasenskaya Ferry - remains.  With the fashion for sea vacations, residents quickly reoriented themselves and began to welcome visitors.  But fishing in these parts and now is wonderful and promises a rich catch. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Where is the village and how to get there </h2><p>  What is the address of the resort village Yasenskaya Crossing?  Krasnodar Territory, <span>Yeisk District.</span>  The village belongs to the Yasensky rural settlement.  But in fact, Ferry is located thirteen kilometers from the village.  Almost one hundred and ninety kilometers are separated from Krasnodar.  You should go from Yeisk.  It is fifty-five kilometers away.  Starting from the village of Shilovka, the road will go along the sea and the most impressive landscapes from this moment open.  From the village of Yasenskaya to the resort village there is a narrow asphalt highway.  Then comes the so-called rash.  It separates the <span>Khan Lake</span> from the waters of the Sea of ​​Azov, more precisely, from the Beisugsky estuary.  On this embankment you can drive right through to the village of Kanevskaya (sixty kilometers).  But you can’t count on a good road. </p><p>  Very close to the Yasenskaya Crossing you can see the island.  This is the beginning of a long braid.  Some one hundred and fifty meters separate it from the coast.  But swimming is not worth it: there is a rather strong current in the ravine.  But if you get to the Yasenskaya Spit by boat, then the path to Primorsko-Akhtarsk and further to the south of the Kuban will be a hundred kilometers shorter. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Climate and Sea </h2><p>  Everyone who rested in this resort village near the sandy embankment claims that the number of sunny days is more than in Yeysk.  The holiday period lasts all summer.  But since the Yasenskaya Crossing is slightly advanced towards the waters of the Sea of ​​Azov, winds blow here.  This is definitely a plus.  On the one hand, the sea breeze refreshes the summer heat.  Winds create a unique opportunity for kitesurfing.  People on the board, parachuting through the expanse of the waters, can be seen quite often in the Yasensky Crossing.  And in early May, the village hosts the annual kitesurfing festival. </p><p>  The wind rose prevails from the water area to the shore, so you can not be afraid that the novice athlete will carry away to the open sea.  As for the beaches, in the village itself there is a good sandy stretch of coast with a small interspersed seashell.  A poster warns swimming in front of the scythe.  There the current is strong, and the boats of carriers scurry here and there.  But the services of the latest reviews recommend using.  On the spit, excellent sandy beaches, almost untouched by the disfiguring human factor.  If you move further along the embankment, you can find a way out to the surface of healing mud from Lake Khan. </p>

    <h2>  Yasenskaya Ferry: rest </h2><p>  It should be said that not everyone likes the remoteness of the resort village from the cities.  In the Yasensky Crossing you will not find discos, bars or restaurants.  But at your service there will be endless beaches, fresh home products from the gardens, gardens and cribs of local residents, nature unclouded by civilization, tranquility and silence.  Slow walks along the sea and watching <span>bird markets</span> on Lake Han - what else do you need to relax? </p><h2>  Housing </h2><p>  According to reviews, Yasenskaya Ferry until the collapse of the USSR remained a quiet fishing village.  Not a single boarding house or holiday home was built there.  But the locals quickly shifted to green tourism.  It’s rare that a house in the village does not give up visitors in the summer.  Prices for rental housing are low.  But the rest here is unassuming.  “Wild” tourists often come here, setting up tents on the crawls absolutely free of charge.  There is a shop and a market in Yasenskaya Ferry where you can buy fish, vegetables, fruits, and homemade dairy products. </p>
