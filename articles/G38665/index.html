  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The history of the origin of money</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The history of the <span>origin of money</span> originates in the most ancient times.  Until a certain period, trade was carried out through the <span>exchange of goods.</span>  But once a single equivalent was introduced, which was supposed to be present on commodity markets, measuring cost. </p><p>  The function of this equivalent was first performed by various products.  So, for example, in ancient Iceland - the country of fishermen and sailors - fish was considered "money" (everything was bought and sold for cod).  In Homer's poems, the number of bulls indicated the value of one or another product. </p><p>  By the way, the very concept of ‚Äúmoney‚Äù is close in origin to the word ‚Äúcattle‚Äù.  So, the old Russian princely treasury was called ‚Äúcowgirl‚Äù, and the treasurer was called ‚Äúcowherd‚Äù, despite the fact that there were gold bullions and furs in the treasury itself. </p><p>  In ancient times, the constant crowding out of certain goods by others brought traders serious inconvenience.  There was a need to create a stable equivalent.  So the preconditions for the emergence of money were formed. </p><p>  In 1200 BC, a Chinese character was depicted on the pattern of <span>kauri shells</span> .  He designated "money."  Thus, the entry into the constant equivalent of life gradually began. </p><p>  ‚ÄúCoin‚Äù was called <span>Juno (the goddess</span> in ancient Rome), in the temple of which in the 3rd century  BC  e.  the mint was located. </p><p>  Metal money has become the first most common and long-lasting form.  Some value of coins is preserved in the modern world.  Metal money served a variety of materials.  The most common were copper, gold, silver.  In the modern world, the manufacture of <span>small change coins is</span> made from various alloys, which include aluminum, nickel and other elements. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The history of the origin of money is closely linked to written obligations.  "Promises to pay" first appeared in China.  They represented receipts that were issued for certain values, which were handed over to special stores for storage. </p><p>  Researchers to this day can not unambiguously name the country in which the history of the origin of money originates.  It is believed that the first coins were issued in the 7th century.  BC  e.  The history of metal money began at that time in China.  The same country began to issue paper banknotes, however, much later (in the 8th century A.D.).  Many travelers came to the Land of the Rising Sun only to look at the first currency. </p><p>  The history of the origin of money (paper) in China is closely connected with the emergence of the first counterfeiters.  The fact is that at that time paper bills could be freely exchanged for gold, which many people hastened to use. </p><p>  As you know, the first printing press was invented by Guttenberg in 1440.  Of course, it was intended for the publication of books, but soon it was used for the release of money.  Thus, a fairly quick and easy way of making notes appeared. </p><p>  The opening of the first Central State Bank in Sweden was a very significant event for the entire global economy.  It happened in 1661. </p><p>  For a sufficiently long period, no other country decided to open banks at home.  And only in 1801 the first Central Bank arose in France. </p><p>  The United States entered a new economic level in 1824 by introducing <span>cashless payments, which</span> greatly simplified the payment of large acquisitions.  In 1944, the world famous currency ‚ÄúAmerican dollar‚Äù came into circulation. </p><p>  In the early 1990s, the first electronic money arose, with which a huge number of consumers can pay for an online purchase. </p><p>  In 2002, another well-known currency, the ‚Äúeuro,‚Äù came into circulation.  In many countries of the world, it is used as a national currency. </p>
