Employee reviews will help to understand the integrity of the corporation.  Indeed, subordinates are often able to talk about the pros and cons of the employer.  Not all employee opinions are true.  What to look for applicants who plan to find a job at Century 21?  Should I contact this employer? </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The first step is to understand what the organization is doing.  Century 21 is a real estate agency.  It offers services for the sale, purchase or rental of real estate.  It is interesting that this organization is originally an American brainchild.  Therefore, Century 21 is considered a well-known company. </p><p>  But is it worth it to work here?  How good is the employer?  What pros and cons are subordinates often pointing to? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="century 21 employee reviews" class="if" height="299" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1545135.jpg" width="399"></div>

    <h2>  Country Distribution </h2><p>  The country where Century 21 is located - Russia.  Reviews of positive employees are left for the distribution of the organization.  As already mentioned, this employer is known not only in Russia.  But this is not so important for subordinates. </p><p>  The significant point is that Century 21 has branches in several cities of Russia.  This allows you to believe in the integrity of the organization.  That is, the office really provides real estate services.  This is not a fictitious fraudulent company that was supposedly originally based in America.  It is proposed to find a job in the organization in Moscow, Irkutsk and some other cities. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Services </h2><p>  What specific services are provided at Century 21?  An important point of interest to many applicants.  It‚Äôs not enough to know in which area the corporation works.  To fully understand the upcoming activities, you will have to understand what services are provided by the company. </p><p>  Century 21 is a real estate agency.

    <h2>  Employer promises </h2><p>  Real estate agency <span>Century 21</span> receives good employee <span>reviews</span> for the promises that the employer makes.

Some subordinates say that the organization does conclude employment contracts with everyone in the prescribed manner.  Some employees assure that they will have to perform official duties without official registration.  What to believe? </p><p>  In fact, some time without registration is really necessary to work - during training.  If you believe the reviews, then during this period a potential employee performs all the standard functions of a realtor.  But formal employment is offered only after an internship. </p><p>  Century 21 is a responsible company.  She offers combination and full time.  But all these processes are documented in an official manner. </p><h2>  Schedule </h2><p>  Century 21 ambiguous employee reviews also earns for the work schedule.  Some employees say that he is really flexible.  Convenient, does not cause troubles and discomfort to subordinates.  In fact, the schedule is close to free.  This can not but rejoice. </p><p>  Along with this, some say that the Century 21 work schedule is extremely inconvenient.  Work in the office is strictly established.  But at the same time, one cannot say for sure whether it will be necessary to remain overtime or not.  Most often you have to do this. </p><p>  It is also noted that Century 21 offers a schedule with a variety of workloads.  On some days, you can sit idle all day in the office, but once you need to work from morning to late evening.  There are no guarantees that on weekends they will not be called to work without additional pay.  Therefore, the schedule in Century 21 is not standardized.  And that repels many. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="century 21 employee reviews moscow" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1545131.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Collective </h2><p>  Century 21 employee reviews (St. Petersburg, Moscow and so on - the location of the organization‚Äôs office in this matter does not play a special role) earns positive for the work team.  He, according to the numerous opinions of subordinates, is really friendly.  Some say that you can go to work like home.  People at Century 21 are responsive, open minded.  They are always ready to come to help out in difficult times or somehow support.  Beginners get comfortable here is not as difficult as it seems. </p><p>  Century 21 places great emphasis on corporate ethics.  A variety of holidays, trainings, as well as teambuilding in the company are held very often.  All this brings the team together.  This organization is an ideal employer for those who love communication.  If it plays an important role in employment, you can safely work in Century 21. </p><h2>  Superiors </h2><p>  Century 21 employee reviews are mixed for their impressions of executives.  What about the heads of the corporation? </p><p>  Opinions are divided.  Some believe that Century 21 executives are responsive and kind people who are distinguished by their humanity with respect to ordinary employees.  You can always agree with the authorities.  No one will treat subordinates as disenfranchised slaves. </p><p>  And someone assures that the bosses in Century 21 are arrogant and unfair leaders.  They do not consider subordinates as people, constantly fine them, punish them and burden them with work.  Negotiating anything with such superiors is futile. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="century 21 Russia real estate agencies employee reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1545129.jpg"></div>

    <p>  What should be believed?  In fact, there is no confirmed information about the validity of positive or negative reviews.  But, as practice shows, few people believe in the integrity of managers.  Therefore, applicants most often listen to negative opinions about superiors. </p><h2>  Salaries </h2><p>  Jobs at Century 21 receive negative reviews from employees most often for salaries offered.  Initially, subordinates are promised good earnings, which will be considered high compared to average salaries.  Only in practice, this condition is not fulfilled.  What is really going on? </p><p>  The thing is that most posts lack salary.  Earnings are formed only as a percentage of completed transactions.  Or the salary is very small.  The main source of profit is still a percentage of the services provided.  Instability is what scares most away. </p><p>  Many say that Century 21 is not a place to make decent money.  There are prospects for a good profit, but it is practically impossible to bring them to life.  This will have to be remembered.  Although some reviews indicate a decent wage in conscientious work from about the 3rd month of work in the corporation. </p><p>  Some also emphasize that salaries are constantly being delayed.  These are exactly what Century 21 <span>employees</span> get <span>.</span>  <span>Moscow</span> is a city of prospects.  Therefore, in the capital, obviously, one should not find a job in the company under study.  You will have to work a lot, but there are no guarantees of a decent payment for the work done. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="century 21 employee reviews spb" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1545133.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <br>
      <p></p>
    <h2>  Social package </h2><p>  The social package in the company is also offered in full.  It is very problematic to get it at first.  But after a year of work at Century 21, there will be no negative moments.  Vacation, sick leave, maternity leave - all this is offered in a real estate agency.  They also set aside time for lunch.  The dining room, according to some reviews, Century 21 is often located in uncomfortable places.  But this is not such a problem. </p><p>  On vacation employees go on schedule.  It is difficult to get a paid vacation before the annual cooperation.  Most often, employees have to take vacations at their own expense.  The rest of the Century 21 network (Russia, <span>real estate agencies)</span> earns positive <span>feedback from employees</span> for a social package. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  What conclusions can be drawn from the foregoing?  In general, the organization is a good employer, but with its own shortcomings.  Claims Century 21 receives standard - they promise a lot at the interview, then they pay a little, then the bosses are not happy, then the work schedule is not the same.  You should not be afraid of this phenomenon.  It is better to remember that the employer is not ideal. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="work in century 21 employee reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1545130.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Century 21 (Irkutsk) employee reviews are mixed.  However, as in any other city.  The company shows itself as an average employer who is not completely frank with subordinates.  This should be remembered by each applicant.  Employment at Century 21 is suitable for sociable people with high resistance to stress. </p>
