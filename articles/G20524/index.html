It can be assumed that the Samaritan is a resident of this country.  But the word "Samaritan" has another meaning.  In the American dictionary, it is interpreted as "a person who unselfishly helps others."  In English, this expression has been used since the 17th century, the reason for this is the biblical parable. </p><h2>  The story of the Samaritan </h2><p>  In one parable, it is said that Jesus Christ, even during the period of his life on earth, called on people to work with him, saving their neighbors.  He claimed that subsequently such people would inherit his heavenly home.  One of the priests, wanting to test Jesus, asked: “How can you earn eternal life and who is our neighbor?”  To his question, Jesus told a parable. </p><p>  The traveler, following from Jerusalem, met with the robbers who robbed him, beat him and left him half dead to die on the road.  A nearby clergyman indifferently walked past him.  The Levite who walked by did the same.  A third passerby, having seen a man lying on the ground beaten by robbers, approached him. </p>

    <p>  He was a good Samaritan.  He washed the wounds of the victim with wine and oil, bandaged them.  He laid it on a burro, laying his cloak, and drove him to the hotel.  A passerby left him there in the care of the owner. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  This person paid for both living and patient care.  At the end of the story, Jesus asked: “Which of the three, in your opinion, was the neighbor?”  The priest replied that the neighbor, of course, was the third passerby.  Jesus advised him to do what the Samaritan did. </p>

    <h2>  "Love thy neighbour…" </h2><p>  The priest and the Levite, who did not help the injured, considered themselves righteous.  In fact, they treated the poor and unhappy people down, did not consider them neighbors.  There was no love for people in their hearts.  And the biblical commandment says: “Love your neighbor as yourself, and treat him as you would like to be treated with you.” </p><p>  The described case shows that the Samaritan is the embodiment of kindness and love for a person.  He was not afraid that the robbers could return and brutally crack down on him.  He behaved with dignity.  And, as he could, helped the victim.  Unfortunately, in our life there are many cases when <span>people indifferently</span> pass by a person who needs emergency help.  Often mistaken for a drunken man lying on the sidewalk: he may have a heart attack.  Timely taken medicine can save his life. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Don't pass by </h2><p>  Callousness and indifference allow you to pass by a person who needs help and support.  What is happening around us today indicates that many do not read the Bible.  Therefore, they do not imagine who it is - the good Samaritan, a parable about which was told by Jesus. </p><p>  Followers of Christ in Orthodoxy and representatives of other religions urge humanity to peace and good.  They claim, based on the Bible, that a person who does good will have eternal life in the kingdom of heaven.  Everyone understands these words in their own way and treats them differently.  But the call in them to do good is the driving factor in social development.  There are many legends, true stories and parables on this subject.  A Samaritan is a character in one of them. </p>

    <h2>  Witnesses of history </h2><p>  At present, in Israel, on the territory of the former Samaria, there are ruins reminiscent of the splendor and wealth of the city where the good Samaritan lived.  Numerous pilgrims and tourists who visited <span>the promised land,</span> recall the biblical commandment: "He who does good to others, himself becomes spiritually richer and stronger."  Samaritan is a kind, responsive person.  His heart is filled with love and mercy.  He provides selfless help to needy people. </p>
