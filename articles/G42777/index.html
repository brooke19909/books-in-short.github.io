  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Screw juicer - excellent juice quality</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In Russia, juicers began to be used for a very long time.  Previously, they were called manual or lever, crush.  The fruit and vegetable juicer had a simple operating principle.  The device consisted of an aluminum cup with a built-in press attached using special hinges.  To get juice on such a crush, oranges or grapefruits were first peeled and then cut into pieces and passed through a press.  This work required some effort, and the harder the fruit was squeezed, the more juice came out. </p><p>  Modern units for obtaining juice have not changed.  Only now, brute masculine strength is not required to obtain a product, but some skill is still useful. </p><p>  A manual screw juicer is very similar to a meat grinder, and is usually used to get juice from berries.  To do this, juicy raspberries, currants, grapes are loaded into a special funnel and ground using a rotating shaft.  In the process, the aromatic juice passes through the grid and flows into the collection bowl, and the processed products, cake come through the hole provided for this in another dish. </p><p>  Many stores offer the use of a screw nozzle, which allows you to make a real juicer out of a regular meat grinder.  But in such cases, the resulting savings will affect the quality of the final product, so a screw juicer, specially created for squeezing juice, is better suited.  To start using this appliance, you should first cut the fruits, vegetables, nuts and greens into pieces and put them in a bowl in the bowl located at the top of the device.  Inside is a powerful rotating shaft or auger, due to which the juicer got its name.  The auger acts on the fruit mass, and the squeezed juice drains into the container intended for it, and the waste in the form of oilcake through a special channel goes to another dish. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Whatever the arguments of the manufacturers, some efforts must be made to learn the juice using hand-held devices.  And in order for the screw juicer to work rationally, only small volumes of berry mass are permissible.  But, in the case of love for large homemade blanks and in the presence of a personal plot, it is more appropriate to use electrical devices. </p><p>  <span>The screw juicer</span> is the best among similar devices in terms of reliability, <span>noise level,</span> continuous operation time and juice quality.  When using it, you can get liquid from various products: berries, nuts, leaves, herbs, seeds and even pine needles. </p><p>  The advantages of screw juicers over traditional juicers are obvious.  To get juice from soft foods, small berries, gooseberries, mulberries and others, you need to make some efforts, and you can only dream of green juice.  This is problematic because of the sieve included in the construction of conventional juicers, which simply cannot cope with the size of seeds and other waste, clogs or passes the cake, which clogs the finished product. </p><p>  The screw press juicer has no such drawbacks.  Its design includes special bushings that squeeze fruits, berries, vegetables or grass, leaving only absolutely dry cake from them.  And some models give such waste that can be set on fire, and they light up.  True, such devices are very expensive. </p><p>  Juicers of the brand Braun, OSCAR, Hurom are in demand on the market.  Omega models 8004 and 8006, which is a world leader among similar devices, are in special demand in the Russian market. </p><p>  A significant difference between screw juicers and various traditional juicers is that they do not heat up in the process of chopping vegetables and fruits.  This property allows you to save all trace elements, enzymes and vitamins in their original form.  Therefore, the resulting juices can be safely called living. </p>
