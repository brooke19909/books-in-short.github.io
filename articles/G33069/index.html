By area, Sweden is comparable to Spain, Thailand or the US state of California.  Stunning landscapes and picturesque fishing villages instantly captivate with their beauty.  Wooden buildings, traditional huts, stone fortresses and cathedrals are collected in small towns in Sweden.  The luxury of modern architecture is concentrated in large cities. </p><p>  Despite the small area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe country, the number of attractions in every major city is off scale.  We offer you to familiarize yourself with 7 major cities in Sweden, the history and culture of which will shock even the most inveterate traveler. </p><h2>  Lulea - an explosion from the past </h2><p>  A trip to the city of Lulea is a great reason to look forward to the winter.  The smallest and winteriest city is located in the center of Northern Sweden.  Sports and outdoor activities are the most popular activities among the residents of Lulea.  Sweden has a rich cultural life with theater, music, films, dances and exhibitions, and Lulea is no exception.  You can stroll past the red wooden houses and visit the ‚Äúvillage center‚Äù.  One can feel the taste of Swedish life a hundred years ago.  It is possible to bake your own flat bread or learn how to make butter.  It doesn‚Äôt matter if you visit Lulea in summer or winter, in this city there are plenty of things that will surprise you. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lulea 2" class="if uuid-2451632" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85776/2451632.jpg"></div><h2>  √ñrebro - the heart of Sweden </h2><p>  A beautiful city in the heart of <span>Sweden.</span>  <span>With a population of</span> almost 143,000, Orebro is the seventh largest city in the country.  Among the residents are immigrants from more than 165 different countries.  A large number of bike paths and the beauty of √ñrebro inspire trips around this city.  This place can rightfully be called the city of cycling in Sweden.  <span>Giant trees, old-timers,</span> reserves with a huge number of birds, whooper swans, staging spectacular performances at the end of March, are impressive.  The cultural life of √ñrebro is also stunning in its global scale.  OpenArt, the annual open-air art festival, attracts tourists to Orebro from around the world.  The city landscape turns into a bright potpourri, where art in all its forms plays with residents and visitors of the city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="√ñrebro 3" class="if uuid-2451641" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85776/2451641.jpg"></div><h2>  Vasteras - city of energy </h2><p>  Vasteras is Sweden‚Äôs sixth largest city, with a population of around 140,000. The city was founded over 1,000 years ago, during which time it grew, developed and changed its character.  Vasteras is considered the most high-tech in Sweden and is home to the largest solar power generation park in the Northern Region.  In addition, Westeros is interested in innovative technologies.  An Expectrum development center has been built in the city, which significantly increases and reinforces students' interest in science and technology.  Its purpose is to give the young generation the opportunity to develop their abilities in this industry.  The result is an environmentally friendly city that sets a great example to the whole world! </p><div class="photo" data-original="biveros.se" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vasteras 4" class="if uuid-2451671" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85776/2451671.jpg"></div><h2>  Uppsala - the city of the Gentiles </h2><p>  The Firis River neatly divides the oldest city in Sweden into two parts: the historic quarter west of the river and the modern city center in the eastern part.  One of the important achievements of the 12th century is the Celsius scale, discovered by astronomer <span>Anders Celsius.</span>  The main heritage of ancient times is the preserved Great Barrows. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This city has long been considered the pagan center of Sweden.  Uppsala had a pagan temple in the Old Town of Sweden.  By decree of the pope, Uppsalu was made a Christian center to eradicate all existing pagan traditions.  Located in the city center, the Baroque Botanical Garden will enchant you with its alpine plants.  Forests and lakes are ideal for swimming.  Uppsala Castle is located near the garden, it is the official residence of the governor of the district, in addition, there is a wonderful view of the city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="biveros.se" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Uppsala 5" class="if uuid-2451677" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85776/2451677.jpg"></div><h2>  Malmo - Sweden's youth </h2><p>  The third largest and happiest city in Sweden.  Almost half of the population is under 35 years old.  The city is considered the center of young families, where about 170 nationalities are registered.  Malm√∂ comes to life in the summer, with two huge festivals capturing the city.  It is called the city of parks and great food.  Malmo has a world-class skate park and one of the best arenas in Europe for shows and hockey.  In addition to entertainment, this city is well prepared to attract foreign companies.  Logistic routes make Malmo an ideal base for business. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Malmo 6" class="if uuid-2451685" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85776/2451685.jpg"></div><h2>  Gothenburg - the sea spirit of freedom </h2><p>  Sweden's second largest city is in the shadow of the capital, Stockholm.  Gothenburg is the birthplace of Volvo and Alicia Vikander.  Here are the best Michelin star restaurants, picturesque architecture, famous galleries and art museums.  This is the second city in Sweden, which allows Gothenburg to be more relaxed and calm than the capital.  The feeling that the sea air gives the spirit of freedom to this city. </p><p>  Gothenburg is full of exciting and thoughtful architecture.  An eclectic mix of historic buildings and modern design captivates at a glance.  The charm of early Swedish architecture has been preserved.  Haga is one of the first suburbs, although it is located right in the center, as planned in the middle of the 17th century.  In the vicinity, the original charm has been preserved, and on the picturesque main street of Haga Nigata, you can see well-preserved wooden houses. </p><p>  Gothenburg is a miniature Scandinavia.  You do not need to travel far from the city center to see the beauty of nature.  Gothenburg archipelago stretches along the coast.  There are no cars in the southern part of the archipelago, making it an ideal place for cycling.  Modern Gothenburg conquers with its luxury when choosing museums, entertainment and restaurants.  Upscale shopping galleries, concept stores, vibrant markets, and chic restaurants are just part of the city‚Äôs luxurious life. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gothenburg 7" class="if uuid-2451691" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85776/2451691.jpg"></div><h2>  Stockholm - the main city of Sweden </h2><p>  The list of cities may be large, but the capital is one.  Stockholm is a modern, dynamic and ever-changing city.  The name was first mentioned in a letter in 1252 written by Birger Jarl, one of the original founders, whose name can be found everywhere. </p><p>  Stockholm is the second technical center in the world, second only to Silicon Valley.  The Swedes are smart and progressive enough, but, and more importantly, Stockholm attracts the most innovative people from all over the world.  All of them are conquered by the capital, which is known for its beauty and proximity to nature. </p><p>  Stockholm's legendary style is known throughout the world.  The highlight of the capital is the rich history of interior design.  Good design is just a given here.  Even the most modest coffee house will surprise you with its design, lighting, choice of furniture and wall coverings. </p><p>  Boring museums and historical sites - forget about it in Stockholm!  Museums and galleries in the capital of Sweden offer a wide and varied range of cultural ‚Äúgoodies‚Äù that can be enjoyed regardless of the weather.  A museum on the beautiful island of Skeppsholmen, where there are collections of works by artists such as Picasso, Derkert, Matisse and Dali. </p><p>  The world's first open-air museum, Skansen, was founded in 1891.  At the museum, be prepared to meet wild Nordic animals such as bears, wolves, or even lynx.  Teknska Museet shows the most important inventions in world history, the alcohol museum, of course, the music museum of the ABBA group - all of them will please with their originality. </p><p>  The beautiful Swedish capital prides itself on being open to all.  A curious city, always striving to try something new and surprise its residents with this.  Welcome to Stockholm! </p><div class="photo" data-original="free4kwallpaper.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Stockholm 8" class="if uuid-2451696" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85776/2451696.jpg"></div><p>  Sweden is an amazing and very versatile country that is a must to visit.  She will delight anyone, even the most avid, traveler and leave an indelible impression. </p>
