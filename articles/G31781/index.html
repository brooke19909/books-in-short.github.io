    <p>  Sharm el Sheikh ... Both this resort and its hotels are modeled on the best European resorts.  Harmonious infrastructure, well-managed management and productive teamwork invariably deserve grateful and friendly feedback from vacationers.  And the unique nature of the tip of the <span>Sinai Peninsula</span> is a significant factor in a successful resort business. </p><h2>  Location and Rating </h2><p>  The Sunrise Diamond Beach Resort 5 * hotel itself is located in the coastal urban area of ‚Äã‚ÄãHadaba, towering above the Old Town, only three kilometers distant from it, and, of course, over the Red Sea.  From here, gorgeous panoramic marine landscapes open.  Resorts say: the view of the sea from the windows of the rooms is so original that it seems as if the hotel itself is in the middle of its waters.  The famous Frenchman Jacques Cousteau, a famous traveler, included these lands in the top ten of his personal rating of the most beautiful places on Earth.  As you know, the highlight of Ras Um El Sid Bay (namely, here is the beach of the first-line hotel we are considering) are unique coral reefs with a rich underwater world. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is not surprising that Sunrise Diamond Beach Resort 5 * is of interest to such picky servicemen as Italians, Germans.  Some of them regularly spend their holidays here.  By the way, guests from Italy are traditionally the most in this hotel complex.  Therefore, the local animation is carried out mainly in Italian.  However, the staff understands the Russian language and speaks it reasonably well.  It is strange that relatively few residents of Russia and Ukraine go to this five-star hotel with very economical prices.  Therefore, we will try to talk about this hotel network Sunrise Resorts &amp; Cruises. </p><h2>  Club Hotel </h2><p>  The hotel housing stock is the main three-story hotel building, as well as 11 smaller three-story buildings.  These aesthetic snow-white buildings with semicircular windows, columns and arches are made in the Ottoman style.  This entire architectural ensemble was built in 2007.  According to the spa, he remains a steady feeling of a single oriental palace.  Numerous walking terraces are laid on the territory of the hotel, cozy recreational areas are equipped.  Around them are designer green spaces.  The feeling of ‚Äúhomework‚Äù remains already at the first acquaintance with him, because the reception of the Sunrise Diamond Beach Resort 5 * hotel (Sharm el Sheikh) is located not at the entrance to it from the street, but inland.  You need to go to it along the entrance terrace. </p><p>  The hotel complex itself is not just on the first line, but also on a hill.  Therefore, a gorgeous panoramic sea view even opens from its windows on the first floor. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The hotel grounds are vast.  It is structured around three outdoor pools and stylishly landscaped with two species of palm trees, well-groomed flower beds, exotic plants.  Vacationers with pleasure walk along the picturesque terraces.  You yourself can see how harmoniously designed the territory of Sunrise Diamond Beach Resort 5 *.  The club hotel's map, shown below, shows its infrastructure. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel sunrise diamond beach resort 5" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/490810.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The main pool is equipped with heated water, which significantly contributes to the comfort of the spa in the cool season.  At a depth of 1.7 meters, it has a large aesthetic water mirror of complex shape, decorated with neat bridges and an island with palm trees.  Guest reviews indicate that it is well-groomed, safe, with crystal-clear and always warm water.  Swimming lovers prefer it, it conducts classes in water polo.  On the shore, near its water bowl, under the guidance of trainers, groups of vacationers regularly engage in aerobics, gymnastics, dancing, yoga. </p><p>  The middle pool is not for athletes, but for bathers.  Resorts in the reviews say that lounge lovers gather here who like to relax, reading in the shade, having a snack and taking a nap.  Near it there is a bar. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The third pool is a family pool, it is also heated and is the most compact of the three.  It is located at the main building of Sunrise Diamond Beach Resort 5 *.  It has a children's section, and nearby, to the delight of the children, playgrounds are equipped. </p><p>  Around the pools are equipped with large terraces for relaxation, landscaped sun loungers and sun umbrellas. </p><p>  There are also special venues for beach volleyball and tennis.  However, it‚Äôs real to use them only in the evening, when they become paid, because the sun of Sharm el-Sheikh is quite uncompromising during the day, which is natural for a desert climate.  A much more enjoyable type of outdoor activity is diving, which we will talk about later. </p><h2>  Hotel rooms </h2><p>  From hotel suites, it can be concluded that classic rest is the essence of a guesthouse in Sunrise Diamond Beach Resort 5 *.  Sharm el-Sheikh in the segment of the Ras Um El-Cid bay is characterized by precisely such a positioning of the resort business.  Vacationers subtly distinguish the advantages of this hotel complex over the notorious economy class.  Even the area of ‚Äã‚Äãa standard hotel room - 44 square meters - indicates a special attitude towards customers.  And 60 family rooms are more likely to resemble apartments than a hotel suite.  In total, the hotel has 438 rooms.  367 of them have sea views, and the remaining 71 overlook the pools. </p>

    <p>  The staff of the hotel complex daily changes vacationers and bed linen, and towels for new ones.  Housekeeping is also provided daily. </p><p>  The hotel rooms are renovated, they are air-conditioned.  The ceilings are high with aesthetic hinged elements.  The walls and ceiling are painted in monochromatic pastel beige color, very light.  The floor is ceramic.  Natural wood furniture, low.  The design is open, plenty of free space.  Instead of cabinets cluttering up the space, storage rooms for clothes and things are mounted on the walls.  (This is what Spanish designers like to design.) However, the impression of an oriental style from the design of Diamond Beach Resort 5 * rooms remains.  (Sharm El Sheikh, after all, is Sheikh Bay. Designers follow the general trend of the resort.) This effect is achieved thanks to the warm pastel colors and the single unobtrusive and aesthetic oriental pattern of decorative elements (bedspreads and dense curtains, the specific ornament of numerous pseudo-screens exposition niches in the walls).  The lighting of the rooms is professional, creating the effect of a soft uniform "milky" light, pleasant to the eyes, not casting sharp contrasting shadows from the interior. </p><h2>  Bathroom and balcony </h2><p>  Separately, we‚Äôll tell you about the bathroom used by guests of Hotel Sunrise Diamond Beach Resort 5 *.  It can be functionally divided into 3 parts.  On the opposite side of the entrance to the bathroom is a spacious universal shower.  There is also a dryer, as well as a shelf for bath towels.  All plumbing is new and works perfectly, providing the proper pressure and temperature of hot water. </p>

    <p>  Closer is the bathroom complete with a brush and flushing device.  On the wall there are paper holders, on the opposite wall there are floor scales.  Directly at the bathroom door is a modern sink wall with a combined large mirror.  One part of it reflects in kind, and the other increases.  Two towels for the face hang here.  In the basket on the sink, the hotel staff maintains a constant availability of detergents: two shower gels, hair shampoo, soap.  Also, vacationers in the same kit are provided with a shower cap and a pair of terry cloths for hands. </p><p>  The balconies in the rooms of the Sunrise Diamond Beach Resort 5 * hotel (Sharm el Sheikh) are quite spacious and equipped with a compact plastic table and armchairs.  It is pleasant to spend leisure time on them, reading, admiring the beauties of sea landscapes. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Since the soil is stony (the hotel is located on a cliff, and the terraces from it cascade down to the sea, which is typical for the coast of Ras Um Sid), the hotel beach has an unnatural origin.  It is loose, sandy, very neat and well-groomed.  Fully equipped with mattresses, umbrellas, sun loungers.  They, along with <span>beach towels, are</span> free of charge given to owners of bracelets from Sunrise Select Diamond Beach Resort 5 *.  Resorts reviews about him are positive.  However, a wish is expressed to the administration - to expand it.  Places by the sea have to take in the morning.  Still, for a club hotel, it is desirable that the beach was larger. </p>

    <p>  To get the full pleasure of swimming, it is advisable to take fins, a mask and a camera with you.  It will also suit a regular, digital, but in a special waterproof case.  (The latter can be bought or rented.) The entrance to the water is from a hotel plastic pontoon.  Moreover, the depth begins immediately, and it is rather big (about 30 m - immediately from the pontoon).  Agree, it‚Äôs unusual to swim and look down in a mask, as if you were looking from a mountain.  (Note that the water here is crystal clear.) At the bottom, strange corals grow and coral fish of different sizes swim.  There are countless numbers of them. </p><p>  If you enter the water not from the pontoon, but where its depth above the corals is greater, then it is advisable to use rubber slippers.  And then more experienced swimmers can swim to the reef at the Ritz Hotel.  There the underwater world is even richer. </p><p>  We strongly recommend that vacationers visiting the Sunrise Diamond Beach Resort 5 * hotel pre-take a few diving lessons.  A hotel instructor is a truly knowledgeable and qualified person.  Even if you are an experienced diver and swim comfortably at a depth of 30 m, you will still receive good advice.  However, deciding to dive, do not forget the immutable rule of diving: dive should be exclusively in pairs.  Do not forget about safety in the depths. </p><p>  For beginner swimmers and children, relaxation in hotel pools is preferable.  They swim there, swim in the Red Sea.  That is the whole difference. </p><h2>  The underwater world of the Red Sea </h2>

The photo posted in the article will be the answer to this question.  We can not help but tell about some of them.  First of all, <span>these are corals.</span>  <span>There</span> are more than 250 species of <span>these</span> exotic living organisms in the Red Sea!  They are colorful and beautiful. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sunrise diamond beach resort 5 pics" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13346/494559.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Resorts pay much attention to sea vacations in their reviews.  They are amazed that the depth in the near water of the beach is up to 30 meters.  You can, of course, look at the underwater world from the surface of the water.  However, if you have scuba diving skills, then the vacationer will have more powerful sensations obtained from the direct contemplation of coral and fish.  And if the resort in the Red Sea takes a real underwater photo shoot, then the memory will remain even longer. </p>

    <p>  How do hotel guests describe their impressions of the dive?  Adults seem to be turning into children.  They write with enthusiasm about colored fish, as if from an aquarium, only, of course, more.  And the underwater world is really colorful.  Reminds us familiar scalar fish Platax.  Flocks of photogenic zebras having the <span>color of an electrician</span> float every now and then <span>,</span> and for some of them, the tail and fins are for some reason bright yellow.  Such contrasts can only be seen in the Red Sea.  Multi-colored parrot fish scurry about on coral.  The surgeon fish is very beautiful (do not be afraid, it is not aggressive, just its tail and fins are really sharp; the upper fin and tail are colored in the color of an electrician, and the side fins are yellow).  Bright and feathery lionfish are original.  There are also larger fish: moraines, stingrays, barracudas.  Indeed, a lot of impressions are associated with the resort with the beach of the hotel Sunrise Diamond Beach Resort 5 * (Sharm El Sheikh).  Their reviews are enthusiastic and interesting, because the corals here are one of the most tempting in the world even for qualified divers. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  What do the spa guests say about the menu of the main restaurant ‚ÄúHalf Moon‚Äù, which provides basic buffet food?  The reviews are positive, because the menu always contains a sufficient number of meat dishes from beef, lamb, lamb, chicken, turkey.  The assortment also includes fish dishes.  Periodically (every other day) the menu contains crabs, seafood.  Many salads and vegetable dishes: smoked, stewed, fried, steamed.  Their abundance is one of the features of oriental cuisine.  Everything is delicious, especially eggplant.  There are many side dishes, however, the most popular of them: rice (it is very tasty cooked) and traditionally french fries. </p>

    <p>  The assortment of six to eight kinds of fruits is constantly on the menu: apples, plums, watermelons, melons, grapes, peaches.  There are several types of delicious ice cream. </p><p>  A good selection of low alcohol drinks.  All inclusive beer is offered to guests of excellent quality in 0.33 liter glass bottles.  Gin is diluted with high-quality tonic.  Red wine, according to guests, is very tasty. </p><p>  The catering system at Diamond Beach Resort 5 * (Sharm el Sheikh) is a separate "state in the state."  To begin with, this extensive club hotel has a total of 4 restaurants serving customer service (3 of which are la carte) and 5 bars.  Residents from Western Europe (and there are most of them at the hotel) do not like to save on food, strictly tied to the all inclusive system.  They regularly order lunches or dinners at la carte restaurants.  Our tourists also occasionally visit them. </p><h2>  Italian restaurant </h2><p>  We recommend visiting the Italian restaurant San Marino.  It is in it that you can try the classic dishes of the cuisine of this country.  What to order?  Let me tell you.  Margarita pizza, flaunting the colors of the national flag, thanks to red tomatoes, white mozzarella, green basil.  The Italians sitting at adjacent tables will appreciate it.  For lunch, try the legendary <span>minestrone soup,</span> which perfectly combines seven vegetables, seven types of meat and seven spices.  Of course, it is worth ordering Bolognese lasagna at Diamond Beach Resort 5 * (Sharm el Sheikh), then at the same time you can taste the wonderful taste of <span>Parmigiano Reggiano</span> cheese in it <span>.</span>  For dessert, order tiramisu to enjoy a delicious bouquet of coffee, mascarpone cheese, rum, and cookies. </p><h2>  Indian restaurant Khandahar </h2><p> Indian national cuisine is represented by a separate la carte restaurant Sunrise Diamond Beach Resort 5 *.  Reviews of vacationers talk about their gastronomic experiments, because Indians practice exclusively vegetarian food.  The restaurant should order a palir panir - a delicious soup of paniri cheese, vegetables, spinach and spices.  For the second, it makes sense to order a small jacket: deep-fried fried meatballs from potatoes with paneer in a fragrant creamy sauce with oriental herbs.  Nevertheless, for many, their favorite Indian food is thali - a kind of assortment of small exotic vegetable dishes with spices on one tray.  In the festive thali there are about twenty such component dishes, in the everyday - six or seven. </p><h2>  Beach Restaurant Blue Bay </h2><p>  Resting on the Mediterranean Sea and not tasting the local fish and seafood ... Who is attracted by this prospect?  In any case, this institution, located on the beach, is visited by most vacationers Sunrise Diamond Beach Resort 5 *.  Reviews testify to this.  A typical first order of Russians in it is lobster.  Indeed, how can it be that you don‚Äôt taste lobster? .. And then - various fish of the local sea, octopuses.  However, to be objective, the shrimp fried in orange juice is especially tasty.  Present in the restaurant are more familiar to us trout and salmon. </p><p>  However, by definition it is a restaurant of Mediterranean cuisine.  Therefore, here you can taste the cheeses with which it is so rich: Greek feta, Cypriot halumi.  Of the meat dishes, we recommend ordering beef tartare cooked together with anchovy fillet. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>
