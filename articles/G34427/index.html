But then she became part of the Xeno chain.  The hotel is country, club type, inexpensive.  It is designed to spend time at sea and ride around the area.  Getting from the airport is a long time, but closer than to Alanya, to which the Xeno Hotels Sugar Beach 4 * hotel is administratively assigned.  Tourists write that it takes about four hours to go to the hotel with a transfer, and vice versa - less.  But if the bus is air-conditioned, comfortable, with an interesting guide, then time flies unnoticed.  But local authorities are already building a new international airport.  It is located near the town of Gazipasha.  From there, get to the hotel for about half an hour. </p>

Around the hotel there is a village with a well-established infrastructure.  There are many cafes, shops, entertainment and attractions.  So, in addition to excursions, you absolutely do not need to go anywhere from here.  But if you want to see Alanya itself, then you can get there by bus for one and a half lira.  And there already visit the fortress, and the embankment, and old shipyards.  On Saturdays, a fruit market is located next to the hotel.  There you can cheaply buy sweets.  The village of Mahmutlar itself is unusually beautiful - people go there to take pictures for memory.  There is a very nice park with fountains and benches where local artists arrange to draw.  Mahmutlar is considered the most budget resort in the vicinity.  These places are famous for the warm water of emerald color, picturesque mountains and pine forests. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Alanya Hotels </h2><p>  Reviews of hotels in this resort area are the main source of information for vacationers.  It is no secret that often the "star" of hotels in Turkey is simply a formality.  Usually the most attractive hotels are located in Alanya itself.  Their prices are lower than in Antalya or Kemer, and there are more opportunities to find entertainment.  On the other hand, the cost of rest in hotels located in villages outside the city is even lower.  But tourists often get bored there because there is nowhere to go and nothing to do.  But this does not apply to our complex Xeno Sugar Beach Hotel 4 *.  Reviews of vacationers recommend it as an ideal accommodation.  The center of Alanya is quite accessible, and the village itself is very good for tourists in terms of shopping and entertainment.  Hotels in Mahmutlar itself are basically the Quartet.  Most of them are multi-story buildings with a not very vast territory and pebble beaches that are across the road.  Prices are even lower than in the rest of Alanya. </p>
