  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to knit a sweater with knitting needles - patterns, features and recommendations</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For a truly unique thing to appear in the wardrobe, you need to do it yourself.  All famous couturiers recognize that handmade is always a bright, individual element of any image.  A thing will have a soul if you invest a part of it in it.  It is not necessary to be a great master.  Having learned the basics of <span>knitting,</span> you can create exclusive knitted cardigans, cardigans and sweaters. </p><h2>  Basic pattern </h2><p>  The choice of yarn and pattern is not the most important thing.  Work begins on knitted women's sweaters with patterns and patterns.  A simple option can be created by yourself, circling any t-shirt.  Get a back pattern.  To pattern the shelves, you need to deepen the neck and divide the part in half if a fastener is planned.  Sleeves are enlarged to the desired length, slightly narrowing to the wrists.  Be sure to add small allowances for a loose fit, especially if the shirt is narrow.  The size of the neck should match the circumference of the head.  It turns out something like this picture. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="straight sleeve" class="if uuid-2422553" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2422553.jpg"></div><p>  A paper pattern will help to correctly calculate the length and width of the parts and evenly steam them at the end of the work.  You can limit yourself to a small-scale scheme.  In this case, it is necessary to apply to it all sizes in centimeters and in terms of loops and rows. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Loop and row calculation </h2><p>  When the model and patterns are selected, yarn and tools are prepared, you will have to do a little arithmetic.  Samples of all patterns that are planned to be used are tied.  If a large braid is located against the background of a small relief, then the sample should contain two fragments of the first pattern and several rapport of aran between them.  The sample will turn out to be large and require some time, but the error in the calculations will be minimal.  For an openwork pattern, you also need a sample of several rapports.  Knitted sweaters with all kinds of exquisite patterns can be very deformed, unpredictably stretching in length and width.  On a single repeat pattern, this effect will not be noticeable. </p><p>  The length and width of the sample are recorded in centimeters, as well as in the number of rows and loops.  Using proportions, the sizes on the pattern are also translated into loops and rows. </p><p>  Now it is easy to calculate the decreases and additions.  For example, to expand the sleeve from the wrist to the shoulder, you need to subtract the number of loops on the wrist from the number of loops on the shoulder.  The result is divided into two, as the additions are made symmetrically on both sides of the canvas.  The resulting number of additions is evenly distributed along the length of the sleeve to a known number of rows. </p><p>  The number of loops of the initial row should be a multiple of the pattern repeat plus two edge loops.  If the pattern is asymmetrically located on the canvas, the finished thing will have an untidy look. </p><p>  Among other things, the sample will show how the pattern really looks like, knitted according to the pattern of the selected yarn.  Often the effect of a combination of color, yarn structure and knitting needles cannot be predicted.  In this regard, fantasy species are especially insidious: melange and section dyeing yarn. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to tie a sleeve </h2><p>  The easiest option when the armholes are not tied.  The upper edge of the sleeve is straight.  The loops for him can be dialed directly from the main canvas of the back and shelves and knitted from the shoulder to the cuff.  Sometimes it‚Äôs convenient to create an entire product from the neck.  Interesting look models connected from the cuff to the cuff.  The pattern on them is located across the sweatshirt.  Very often, a straight sleeve is used in wide, voluminous models and in small children's clothing.  It is best used in everyday and sports things.  Such a cut gives greater freedom of movement. </p><p>  The set-in sleeve is suitable for tight, elegant and romantic models.  Below is a diagram for knitted sweaters with this type of sleeve. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="sweatshirt with set-in sleeve" class="if uuid-2422529" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2422529.jpg"></div><p>  When the sleeve is connected to the armhole, the number of loops on the knitting needles is divided into six parts.  Decreases in the first three parts are symmetrically repeated in the following. </p><p>  The first group is divided into three parts: </p><ol><li>  The hinges close. </li><li>  Decreases are made in the front rows, first three, then two in each. </li><li>  The loops are reduced one at a time. </li></ol><p>  Then, one loop reduction on each side of the sleeve ridge is distributed over 1/3 of the length of the armhole. </p><p>  then decrease three loops to the end of the sleeve.  The remaining loops are closed in the last row. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It‚Äôs a little harder to knit this type of sleeve, starting from the ridge.  In this case, all actions are performed in reverse order. </p><p>  The set-in sleeve requires knitting the armhole.  To do this, determine the number of loops that need to be reduced, and divided into four parts: </p><ol><li>  All loops close simultaneously. </li><li>  Closes three loops in each front row. </li><li>  Closes two loops. </li><li>  The loops are reduced one at a time, through one front row, that is, once in four rows. </li></ol><p>  The jacket will not puff up if the shoulder line is made beveled by one or two centimeters. </p><p>  To make the sleeves symmetrical, you can knit them simultaneously from two different balls. </p><p>  The raglan sleeve provides both freedom of movement and soft fit.  At the same time, it fits in much easier than the previous version. </p><p>  Typically, such a sleeve begins to knit from the neck.  On the circular knitting needles gain the number of loops necessary for the neck.  Divide it into four parts.  Two for the sleeves - smaller, for the back and front - more.  If a clasp is provided, the front part is divided in half.  You can knit a sweater on straight knitting needles.  Places of application should be marked with pins.  On circular knitting needles in each row, two loops at all four marks are added.  On straight knitting needles, make only in the front rows. </p><p>  Incorporation with a double crochet will create a chain of holes.  Tying extra loops from the broach creates a smooth canvas.  Between two additions, you can knit two or three loops face.  A decorative strip will appear.  Sometimes raglan is emphasized, knitting small braids between applications.  When the product is ready to the bottom edge of the armhole, the parts are continued individually on straight knitting needles.  A narrow sleeve can be knitted round, like a stocking, getting rid of extra seams. </p><p>  Loops for a raglan sleeve, on the contrary, decrease if the details of the sweater begin to knit from the bottom to the neck.  In this case, the details are sewn along the armhole line as inconspicuously as possible.  Relief patterns tied along the edge of the fabric before decay help to hide the seam. </p><h2>  Collar Types </h2><p>  You can knit a sweater with a round neck, with a rectangular or V-neck.  The first option will require careful calculations.  The rounded neckline is made according to the same principle as the armhole.  Knit the neck begin from the center of the part, closing the loops in the middle.  The remaining decreases are done symmetrically. </p><p>  The simplest finishing options: on the edge, loops are typed for tying with an elastic band or front surface, from which a twisted steering wheel is obtained.  The edge crocheted in the forward or reverse direction looks neat.  In romantic or summer models, a crocheted lace trim is appropriate. </p><p>  If you spend a little more time and imagination, the collar will become the main decoration of the jacket.  There is a huge variety of species: stand, shawl, turn-down, golf, clamp and various fantasy options.  When choosing, you need to consider how the collar will be combined with a fastener and cuffs. </p><p>  The collar or hood can be knitted as a separate part and as a continuation of the neck. </p><h2>  Rounded bottom </h2><p>  The product can be bright and modern with a rounded edge.  Using this technique, they begin to knit a sweater from the bottom edge of the parts.  Most often, the back is knitted slightly elongated, in front <strong>- upright,</strong> in the shape of an arch.  You can connect both parts equally elongated or with an arched bend.  It all depends on the imagination of the needlewoman. </p><p>  The effect of rounding is created using partial knitting. </p><p>  For a convex edge: </p><ul><li>  the elastic band of the necessary width fits; </li><li>  the canvas is divided into four parts; </li><li>  three quarters knit; </li><li>  knitting overturns; </li><li>  two quarters are knitted and another five or six loops are an expansion step; </li><li>  knitting turns over again; </li><li>  the expansion step, two quarters of the straight canvas and one more expansion step are knitted (so that holes are not visible, when turning the canvas, the working thread is wrapped around the edge loop); </li><li>  further actions are repeated until all loops are in operation. </li></ul><p>  For concave edge: </p><ul><li>  the elastic band of the necessary width fits; </li><li>  hinges shelves are divided in half; </li><li>  one step of expansion is knitted from the edge; </li><li>  work turns upside down; </li><li>  in the next front row, two expansion steps are knitted (the second shelf is knitted in mirror image); </li><li>  extensions are repeated until all loops are involved. </li></ul><h2>  Types of Gum </h2><p>  The bottom of the product and cuffs look neater if you start knitting parts with an elastic band.  Apply a little trick so that the border does not look stretched.  For the first row of the product, only three quarters of the loops are gathered.  In the last row of gum, the required number of loops are evenly added. </p><p>  There are many spectacular patterns in order to give the edge of the product elasticity.  The simplest embossed elastic bands are 1 x 1 or 2 x 2, formed by alternating front and back loops.  English gum is more magnificent and fits much denser.  <span>French gum</span> looks like parallel small braids, looks great both on thick cardigans with a mix of embossed patterns, and on openwork sweaters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="types of gum" class="if uuid-2423537" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2423537.jpg"></div><p>  The most patient needlewomen knit separately a long ribbon or strip of embossed pattern to sew it horizontally to the edge of the jacket.  Fans of simple solutions will like the steering wheel from the front surface. </p><h2>  We knit a women's jacket with knitting needles.  Scheme </h2><p>  Beginning needlewomen should try their hand at working on their own model.  In any wardrobe, women's knitted sweaters with a simple cut and pattern are useful.  For example, such a universal thing fits in one go. </p><div class="photo" data-original="intheloopknitting.com" data-author=": by Terry Matz, "><img itemprop="image" alt="sweater with asymmetric closure" class="if uuid-2421866" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2421866.jpg"></div><p>  The model in the picture is knitted with needles No. 3, made of acrylic yarn.  Loops are typed for a wide neck.  Its decorative design is made in several rows of the main pattern.  Shawl knitting is simple in appearance, but capricious in execution.  All loops should knit with the same thread tension.  Otherwise, the thin relief strips of the pattern sag, and the canvas will look untidy.  Best of all, garter stitching works out of thick yarn. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="raglan sleeve" class="if uuid-2422337" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2422337.jpg"></div><p>  Knitting a raglan sweater from top to bottom is easier using circular knitting needles.  In the process of knitting, you can apply the work to yourself, check and correct the error of the initial measurements.  A sleeve ‚Äúthree quarters‚Äù is tied from the lower edge of the armhole on straight knitting needles and the shelves and back continue.  The highlight of the model is asymmetric shelves, giving the image a touch of carefree.  When knitting the right shelf, you need to make three button loops.  Horizontal loops are preferred.  They do not stretch during operation and do not require additional processing.  If the decorative buttons are prepared in advance, they can measure the size of the loops.  Since the product almost does not smell, the side seams and sleeves are crocheted.  This is the most gentle and inconspicuous way.  When processing, the edge of the sleeve is slightly tightened. </p><h2>  Examples of finished models </h2><p>  If creating your own model seems complicated, you can find a suitable description and knit a jacket with knitting needles in a magazine.  Knowing the basic methods of work will help to correctly correct any pattern, recalculate the specified number of loops to your knitting density and add individual touches to the finished model. </p><p>  The study of samples usually becomes the impetus for their own creativity. </p><p>  Here are some knitted sweaters with schemes.  Models created by amateur needlewomen.  All stages are thought out independently: from building a pattern to creating a pattern. </p><p>  The model attracts attention with rich color and a harmonious mix of patterns.  The fitted fitted silhouette is difficult to combine with reliefs, but the successful option deserves the spent work and time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cascadeyarns.com" data-author=": Diana Zangl, "><img itemprop="image" alt="red jacket" class="if uuid-2423495" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2423495.jpg"></div><p>  The laconic youth model is made with front stitch with several thin braids.  Vertical strips of embossed pattern visually stretch the waist, compensating for the shortened silhouette of the jacket. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cascadeyarns.com" data-author=": Lorna Miser, "><img itemprop="image" alt="short jacket" class="if uuid-2423590" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2423590.jpg"></div><p>  Spectacular lush pattern gives things a warm aura of comfort and coziness.  The hood successfully complements the look. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cascadeyarns.com" data-author=": Melissa Leapman, "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted sweater" class="if uuid-2423582" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2423582.jpg"></div><h2>  Elegant ladies </h2><p>  To create a more sophisticated and complex image, we knit a cardigan sweater. </p><div class="photo" data-original="intheloopknitting.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="two cardigans" class="if uuid-2422676" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2422676.jpg"></div><p>  You can use the simplest pattern with a straight sleeve, supplementing it with some interesting element or a complicated trick, like the things shown in the drawings.  One cardigan is connected by the front surface and is decorated with a wide stripe-strip with a complex aran.  In the work on the second, the diagonal knitting technique was used.  The front shelves were tied from the corner.  An ordinary scarf made using this technique looks fresh and original.  Melange yarn used in the work gives an additional charm. </p><h2>  Knitted sweater for girls </h2><p>  For warm children's clothes, the thread should be especially soft.  When choosing mixed varieties with wool, a skein must be attached to the wrist to check if the material is pricked.  Usually a moderate amount of decorative details is used so that the clothes do not hamper the movement.  For example, you can knit a sweater for a girl, as in the photo, with any lush aran, but the sleeves are best done with a simple pearl pattern. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.knittingmatters.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="jacket for girls" class="if uuid-2423124" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2423124.jpg"></div><p>  The shape of the sleeve is straight.  Raglan is also often used in small models, but a solid braid pattern does not fit well with it.  In order not to make a mistake in size and not to suffer with the scheme, the knitted jacket is supplemented with a set-in hood from a rectangular canvas.  The edge of the hood begins with the same elastic band as the cuffs and bottom of the product.  In the process of knitting, this part is tried on several times to accurately determine the depth of the hood. </p><h2>  Knitted sweater for a boy </h2><p>  Such a practical thing is useful in the wardrobe of a teenager. </p><div class="photo" data-original="darkmatterknits.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="jacket for the boy" class="if uuid-2423346" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2423346.jpg"></div><p>  Knitting a jacket with a classic simple pattern is quick and easy.  Fragments of a pearl pattern and shawl in this model are connected by a width of 16 loops and a height of 16 rows.  By knitting a sample from your yarn, you can change the size of the squares in accordance with the dimensions of the parts.  The main thing is to observe a symmetrical alternation of squares.  Although most boys prefer sweatshirts with zippers, wide soft plackets with buttons will also be a good solution.  The raglan sleeve is emphasized by three stripes of front loops, between which additions of loops are made. </p>
