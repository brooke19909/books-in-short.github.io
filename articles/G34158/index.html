Holidays on the Black Sea</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you are a lover of a calm and measured beach holiday in places where there is a lot of nature and few people, then you should spend a vacation on the Black Sea in the village of Kurortnoye (Odessa region).  It is located on the Budak Spit.  Does this name tell you anything?  There are not so many tourists from Russia here.  They prefer more noisy and ‚Äúuntwisted‚Äù places or rest in Odessa itself.  But the Resort was chosen by the citizens of Moldova.  Direct minibuses from Chisinau and other cities of the republic run to the village in the summer.  There are also guests from far abroad - Poles, Germans.  What is so attractive about a holiday in Kurortny?  You will learn about this from our article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Resort Odessa region" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1271218.jpg" width="448"></div>

    <h2>  Where is the village located </h2><p>  Kurortnoe is located eighty kilometers south-west of Odessa.  Administratively, the village belongs to the Belgorod-Dniester region.  But if this ancient city, which you definitely need to go to visit the medieval fortress and the ruins of ancient Thira, is located on the estuary, then Kurortnoye is washed by the real Black Sea.  But that is not all.  Since the village stands on a spit, water is present on its other side.  This water area is called the Budzhak estuary.  And if you are interested in fishing, this is the best place for a rich catch.  The resort is located at the very tip of the Budak Spit.  On the other hand, the village smoothly passes into another locality.  The conditional border between them is the resort "Primorsky".  With it begins the resort village of the same name.  The end of the spit is an ecologically clean area.  Compared to the noisy Zatoka, in Kurortny you can feel like Robinson Crusoe.  A few hundred meters behind the village deserted sandy beaches begin, where the only vacationers are seagulls and cormorants. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pension lighthouse" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1271203.jpg" width="448"></div>

This is a natural formation that has been washed over the centuries by the great Dniester River.  Therefore, all the beaches on the spit are solid golden sand.  Under water, it also forms dunes, so there are shallow ‚Äúbaths‚Äù with well-warmed water near the shore.  At the beginning of the Budak Spit, the resort of Zatoka is located.  It is widely spread along the coast and is administratively divided into several stations (Bugaz, Morskoye, Druzhba, etc.).  The easiest way to get to Zatoka is by train "Odessa - Belgorod-Dniester" or by minibus.  It is sent from Privoz and costs three times as much.  But if Zatoka is at the beginning of the spit, then Kurortnoye is at the very end of it.  In the middle of the village settled Sergeyevka.  You can get to Kurortnoye from Odessa by minibuses following to Zheltye Yar, Dimitrovka or Tatarbunary.  Traveling by personal vehicles is somewhat extreme.  An excellent road in Zatoka soon gives way to solid bumps. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sanatorium seaside" class="if" height="221" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1271216.jpg" width="448"></div>

    <h2>  Climate Resort </h2><p>  Due to the fact that the village is located at the very end of the spit, that is, it protrudes far into the Black Sea, a milder change of seasons is observed here.  In the Budzhak estuary are deposits of healing mud.  Its vapors, salt and iodine ions, floating in the air over the heated sand of the beaches, create all the conditions for the treatment of respiratory organs.  Thus, a wellness stay in Kurortny is also possible.  On the spit, there are not only boarding houses, bases and private hotels, but also motels.  It should be said that the Black Sea on the beaches of Kurortny is always five to seven degrees warmer than off the coast of Odessa.  The Bessarabian climate is dry and hot in summer.  The temperature in July often goes over thirty-five degrees.  But on the Budak Spit the heat dispels a fresh breeze from the sea.  The swimming period begins here in the second half of April, and ends in mid-October. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest in the resort" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1271234.jpg" width="450"></div>

The resort center is located on a high steep bank of the mainland.  All infrastructure is concentrated there.  Therefore, if you want to live closer to civilization, you should choose a recreation center or a boarding house in the central part of the Resort.  What are the pluses in this case?  Nearby is a food market with excellent Bessarabian wines and southern fruits, as well as a market for clothes, shoes, beach ammunition.  A lot of cafes, pharmacies, ATMs, shops.  In the village of Kurortnoye (Odessa region) there is a large offer of housing in the private sector.  All kinds of entertainment are available on the seashore in the form of ‚Äúpills‚Äù, ‚Äúbananas‚Äù, water slides, etc. The only minus is the stairs that you need to go down to the beach and, worse, climb back.  Since ancient times no one has settled down.  But in recent years, recreation centers have appeared on sandy beaches.  Many people choose life on the braid.  They are bought in the village and rest like Robinsons. </p><h2>  Wellness in Kurortny </h2><p>  Closer to the Budzhak estuary, you can often see people who are completely black, with a bluish tint, in color.  These are not newcomers from Senegal, but simple holidaymakers who smear themselves with mud in order to improve their health and rejuvenation.  But it is said that self-medication can also damage the body.  Sanatorium "Seaside" is open all year.  Healing estuary mud is also used here.  But the main profile of the sanatorium is the treatment of pulmonary diseases, as well as diseases of the upper respiratory tract.  The sanatorium is located on the very border of the village of Resort, on the banks of the estuary.  The choice of housing in this resort is quite wide.  You can settle in the room of a multi-storey building or take a detached summer wooden house.  Room categories also vary.  There are both suites and Standard rooms with a basic range of services. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Recreation facilities at the resort" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1271206.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Pension "Lighthouse" </h2><p>  This institution also accepts vacationers all year round.  The boarding house is located in the center of the village, so you have to go down to the sea from the steep coast.  But next to the services of vacationers the entire infrastructure of the village.  The territory of the boarding house is guarded; parking is available for guests' vehicles.  On the territory there are all conditions for families, there is a playground, many gazebos.  Pension Mayak is interesting in that it offers its guests good nutrition.  The rooms in it are also divided into categories.  Economy rooms are amenities and a refrigerator on the floor.  In the "Suite" inserted plastic windows.  These rooms are equipped with air conditioning, TV, player, refrigerator.  Guest rooms have balconies.  On the territory of the Mayak boarding house there is an Episode bar with a large selection of wines and other drinks. </p><h2>  Private sector: reviews </h2><p>  The entire village of <span>Kurortnoye (Odessa region)</span> is located on the mainland, on a high bank.  The rooms here were rented to vacationers even when such a business was considered illegal, during the Soviet Union.  With its collapse, the entrepreneurial vein of the inhabitants showed its full potential.  Now you can rent a house not only in the village itself.  On the spit or on the mainland, right on the beach in summer, they install comfortable vans with furniture and even sanitary facilities.  But the largest selection of housing is still in the center of Kurortny.  Vacationers leave laudatory comments about the private villa "Lotus", the house at ul.  Embankment, 5, and the estate "At Kuzi". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Budak Spit" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1271222.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Resort: prices </h2><p>  This region is considered a budget holiday destination.  Accommodation prices largely depend not only on the amenities provided, but also on the distance to the sea.  Thus, a trailer on the beach will cost the same as a junior suite in the village.  Numerous <span>recreation centers</span> in Kurortny provide a wide selection of housing.  Here you can rent a wooden house with amenities on site, as well as luxury apartments.  More recently, the first <span>recreation center with a swimming pool</span> appeared in the village <span>.</span>  This is Balsaminate.  On the base you can not only relax, but also improve your health.  If prices at Balzaminat start from twenty-eight dollars per person per day, then in other places accommodation will be much cheaper.  At the recreation center "Antei" prices start from just eight dollars. </p>
