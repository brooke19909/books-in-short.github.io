  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Holidays in Sweden - a country of childhood</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many people, having heard somewhere by chance about Sweden, for some reason immediately begin to recall their cloudless distant childhood, their dear friends, the ridiculous boy from the forty-fifth apartment, who did not dare to speak, and, of course, about the mischievous Carlson, who once flew away long ago to Stockholm, but promised to return ... </p><p>  Carlson will return or not - there can be no doubt about this.  Of course he will return.  Sweden is simply a big country, and although the population density here is only 20 people per square kilometer, there are a lot of single children and at least single adults here, as in the rest of the world, and you need to have time for everyone.  He will certainly come overcoming the mountains, lakes and virgin forests that occupy the vast territory of the country. </p><p>  Sweden is one of the most socially and technically advanced countries in Europe.  Locals are sensitive to the country's rich cultural heritage and very carefully preserve their customs and traditions.  And they really love their Carlson ... </p><p>  Sweden is ideal for family holidays.  In the parks for children there are many entertaining attractions, you can visit zoos, so it will be a great success to get last-minute trips to Sweden. </p><p>  Holidays in Sweden are high mountains, turbulent rivers and lakes.  The amazing beauty of nature with a unique flora and fauna in all its diversity are presented in Stockholm National Park. </p><p>  What do we know about Sweden?  Basically, such stereotypes as the <span>Swedish family, the</span> buffet and Swedish socialism.  In fact, these stereotypes by the Swedes themselves are not very clear, for example, what we call a buffet in Sweden is called a European buffet, and the Swedes have no idea what a Swedish family is and will definitely ask you what it is.  Therefore, if you do not want to spoil your vacation in Sweden, then it is better not to cover these and similar topics </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Tourists who have purchased last-minute tours to Sweden may consider themselves lucky.  There is probably no such excursion program anywhere else.  All excursions start from the center of the old city, where the royal palace is located.  Here, in the winter and summer at exactly twelve o'clock in the afternoon, a performance is being played for the city guests - a solemn change of the guard, accompanied by a military band, drumming and spectacular choreographic performances. </p><p>  The largest city in Scandinavia is Stockholm, spread out on islands located in the <span>Baltic Sea</span> .  Sweden is a real paradise for both fishermen and people who come here on vacation.  Waterways pass through Stockholm, connecting the sea with numerous inland lakes. </p><p>  Holidays in Sweden are the best suited for those who are tired of civilization.  In the center of Stockholm, a small village typical of Sweden has been recreated in the Skansen Museum.  In this place there are a small church, shops where you can buy souvenirs, and even leather and glass-blowing workshops.  Here you can see the national Swedish costumes and even sit with a local "peasants" for a glass of beer and sing songs.  So national history is naturally combined with modernity. </p><p>  Holidays in Sweden are a meeting with a fairy tale, because in the same territory there is another museum - ‚ÄúUnibaken‚Äù.  This museum is not quite ordinary - it is inhabited by the heroes of fairy tales Astrid Lindgren.  At the entrance, visitors are met by the daughter of the robber Roni or Peppy Long Stocking, with whom you can play or listen to their stories.  Here you can meet a man in his prime - Carlson! </p><p>  Nearby is another museum - the ship "Vassa", built in the XVII century.  But when the ship was lowered into the water, it immediately sank to the bottom, where it lay for three hundred years, and only in 1961 the ship was lifted and rebuilt. </p><p>  Sweden, the country of childhood ... The country of fairy tales and dreams ... </p>
