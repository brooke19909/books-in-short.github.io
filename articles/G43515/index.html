  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hotel Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa (Indonesia): reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If a wealthy tourist wants to relax at the highest level, he goes to Bali.  And not just in Bali, but in the resort of Nusa Dua.  Here the lavish hotels lined up along the ocean.  And the best of them is Hotel Nusa Dua Beach Hotel &amp; Spa.  Do not believe?  Then take a walk along the beautiful paved path that runs through all the coastal hotels in Nusa Dua.  There is something to compare! </p><p>  The hotel, which we will describe in this article, is part of the Leading Hotels of the World community.  ‚ÄúNusa Dua Beach 5 *‚Äù was built in 1983, and since then monarchs and queens, presidents and prime ministers have been resting in its apartments.  And now, meetings and meetings of the highest level are very often held there.  This hotel, of course, stands on the first line and offers its guests the most sophisticated and rich leisure infrastructure.  This is also evidenced by the reviews on which our story is based. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wotif.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nusa Dua Beach Hotel &amp; Spa (Indonesia, Nusa Dua)" class="if uuid-3221327" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3221327.jpg"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  From Denpasar International Airport to Hotel Nusa Dua Beach Hotel &amp; Spa take only half an hour.  And even if you book a collective transfer, because the bus with tourists first calls in Nusa Dua, and then leaves for Ubud, Jimbaran and Kuta.  The resort itself is located in the south of Bali.  The hotel we are describing is located almost in the center of Nusa Dua, surrounded by the same imposing and expensive "fives". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Without exception, tourists mention in the reviews the fact that you can walk through all the hotels of the resort without any obstacles.  Want to lie on a lounger of someone else's beach?  Yes please!  Did you find evening entertainment or daytime animation at your hotel boring or just boring?  Welcome to the disco in the neighboring hotel!  At the same time, security cameras are placed everywhere, and the safety of guests is monitored here strictly.  And beyond the gates, the life of the resort of Nusa Dua is in full swing.  The average price tag here is higher than, for example, on Kut.  But the audience here is not easy to rest. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="-8.7940956" data-lng="115.23016180000002" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/5/4/5/17545.png"></div><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Hotel Nusa Dua Beach Hotel &amp; Spa is built among a lush tropical garden.  The entrance is guarded by stone majestic gates.  Passing through them, you will admire the view of the building, stylized as a palace.  Its architecture traces the motives of the Middle East, and this is not surprising: they say that the hotel belongs to the Sultan of Brunei itself.  From the gate, the path leads to the building along the ponds with blooming lotuses.  They come down in cascades and are decorated with fountains in Balinese traditional motifs. </p><p>  Many tourists mention the truly luxurious lobby, more like a throne room in the royal palace.  Everywhere on the walls genuine objects of painting hang, figurines are visible, and the furniture is most likely antique.  By the way, works of art made by local masters (batik, painting, sculptures) are also present in the rooms, and at any price category.  This, according to tourists, gives an unforgettable experience of immersion in the national atmosphere of Bali.  The hotel area is quite large.  It fit 15 restaurants, bars and cafes, a spa, tennis court, a spacious swimming pool. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.gites.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nusa Dua Beach Hotel &amp; Spa (Indonesia, Bali): reviews" class="if uuid-3221333" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3221333.jpg"></div><h2>  Room Categories </h2><p>  Monarchs and presidents of powers lived here in suites and villas, which will be discussed later.  In the meantime, let's review the numbers for mere mortals.  The lowest price category of rooms is called superior room.  Most of these rooms at Hotel Nusa Dua Beach Hotel &amp; Spa are 184 out of 300. The premier room is almost twice as large as the superior, despite the fact that it is designed for two guests.  We stopped at the hotel with the whole family?  The Beach Hotel Nusa Dua has a family room for three and four people.  These family rooms also feature beds for children. </p><p>  If you do not want your children to sleep in a bunk bed, order the deluxe room for 3 (or 4) person categories.  There are very spacious bedrooms with normal beds.  As for filling the rooms, there is everything that is expected of the "five": air conditioning, TV, safe, minibar, hairdryer, bath and shower, bathrobes with slippers.  Naturally, the room has free Wi-Fi.  A feature of the hotel tourists call a lot of pillows, sets for making tea and coffee. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nusaduahotel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Nusa Dua Beach Hotel &amp; Spa (Indonesia)" class="if uuid-3221328" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3221328.jpg"></div><h2>  Suites </h2><p>  Residents of higher categories of rooms in Nusa Dua Beach Hotel &amp; Spa 5 * have certain privileges in comparison with other guests.  But the apartments themselves are incomparably better.  Club Palace room is located on the first floor of the building with direct access to the pool.  A room with the same name as Club Palace Suite consists of a bedroom and a living room.  The windows of the Agung Suite overlook the mountain of the same name.  This chic room is located on the 4th floor and consists of two bedrooms and a living room.  Nusa Dua Suite - two-tier.  It also has two bedrooms and a living room, but it features a private pool and spacious verandas. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Royal Residence Villa is a two-story house with a private spacious pool, surrounded by its own garden.  He stands right by the beach.  If we compare the suites with regular numbers, it seems that their content is identical.  The same air conditioners, televisions, etc.  However, the whole point is in the details, isn't it?  Luxurious furniture, premium bedding, precious trinkets decorating the rooms - all this will make your stay unforgettable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.agoda.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Nusa Dua Beach Hotel &amp; Spa (Indonesia, Bali)" class="if uuid-3221329" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3221329.jpg"></div><h2>  Privileges for VIP guests </h2><p>  Inhabitants of Club Palace room categories and above are served at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel &amp; Spa 5 * in the highest category.  At the settlement they are registered at a separate counter, offering refreshing drinks.  They also do not eat breakfast with mere mortals.  This restaurant is located in the garden and has a terrace overlooking a goldfish pond.  Throughout the day, guests can eat and drink as much as they like, including vintage alcohol.  Afternoon tea / coffee and cakes are served on the terrace especially for them.  And in the evenings, for two hours, VIP guests are invited to a cocktail party.  If desired, food is delivered directly to the room.  A personal transfer will deliver such guests to the airport. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.expedia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nusa Dua Beach Hotel &amp; Spa (Indonesia, Nusa Dua)" class="if uuid-3221332" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3221332.jpg"></div><h2>  Review of food establishments </h2><p>  At Nusa Dua Beach Hotel &amp; Spa (Bali), breakfast is included in the price of any room.  As already mentioned, VIP guests are dining in a separate restaurant, ‚ÄúSpa Cafe‚Äù.  Other guests have breakfast at The Crystal Room.  This restaurant also has an outdoor terrace.  In addition to these establishments, the hotel has several more, with paid a la carte service.  Each of these restaurants specializes in the cuisine of a particular country or region.  For example, French dishes are served at Baccarat, and Caribbean dishes at Royal Cafe Grill.  Bahamas lovers should visit Cafe Goombay.  Gourmets who want to enjoy oriental dishes are waiting in the Kimono restaurant, and adherents of oatmeal and vanilla pudding are waiting in the British Cricketers. </p><p>  Casanova, as you might guess, specializes in Italian cuisine, while Spices specializes in common Mediterranean cuisine.  Of particular note is the chic Royal Table restaurant with panoramic beach views.  It very tasty cook fish and seafood.  European dishes are served at the Vedang Jan Restaurant.  The hotel also has a bistro.  You can order pizza at Sandros, and grilled dishes at Chess.  On the beach there is a bar called The Jukung.  In the evenings, a variety show disco opens its doors.  She also has a bar ‚ÄúClub Tabun‚Äù. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nusaduahotel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Nusa Dua Beach Hotel &amp; Spa 5 * - restaurant" class="if uuid-3221330" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3221330.jpg"></div><h2>  Nusa Dua Beach Hotel &amp; Spa 5 *: breakfast reviews </h2><p>  About morning meals reviews are 100 percent positive.  Firstly, breakfast time satisfies both those who like to meet the dawns and ‚Äúowls‚Äù.  At the same time, even if you come to the end of the meal, there will be exactly the same assortment of dishes.  The room is completely crowded, because the inhabitants of the suites have breakfast in a separate restaurant.  As for the quality of food, it is beyond praise.  Juices here are not made from powder, but exclusively fresh, not only traditional (apple or orange), but also exotic (watermelon, guava, mango, etc.). </p><p>  In the reviews, tourists with nostalgia recall the delicious pastries, as well as several varieties of coffee.  Unlike many other hotels, the assortment of dishes here every day is slightly different - either vegetable stew instead of mashed potatoes or beef sausages are replaced with chicken cutlets.  By the way, you can already upgrade breakfasts to the all-inclusive system on the spot.  But most tourists went to stall at Bali Collection Square, which is a kilometer from the hotel.  This is a cluster of shopping centers, fruit market, cafes and boutiques. </p><h2>  Beach and Pool </h2><p>  All tourists as one claim that the coast at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel &amp; Spa 5 * (Indonesia, Bali) is the best among the surrounding hotels.  Nobody forbids you to relax on the beaches of other hotels and even take loungers there.  But the Beach Hotel guests preferred to sunbathe near their hotel.  Beach towels give as much as you want without any cards, you can change them at least several times a day.  The coast is cleaned every two hours, up to tiny leaves that fell from the trees. </p><p>  The beach is very landscaped, it is possible to relax not only under the umbrella, but also under the canopy of palm trees.  It‚Äôs even more interesting there, because you can chat with small nimble chipmunks.  There are ebbs, but they did not interfere with swimming.  The hotel has three swimming pools, with fresh and sea water).  One is for a relaxing holiday, the second is for active (there are classes in water aerobics and play polo).  A third is reserved for children. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Nusa Dua Beach Hotel &amp; Spa 5 * - beach" class="if uuid-3221325" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3221325.jpg"></div><h2>  Services on site </h2><p>  From morning to evening, from Nusa Dua Beach Hotel &amp; Spa (Indonesia, Nusa Dua) ‚Äã‚Äãthere is a free shuttle bus to the Bali Collection every hour.  The hotel has a currency exchange, a tour desk, laundry and dry cleaning, a doctor's office.  Animation is provided for both adults and children.  Every evening, guests are invited to watch a variety show, and after it begins a disco.  But the amphitheater, where the action takes place, is located away from the buildings and does not interfere with the peace of guests. </p><p>  Separately, you need to mention the hotel's spa.  He is considered the best on the island.  In addition to various baths, there is a mineral water pool, as well as ‚Äúwaves‚Äù, ‚Äúwhirlpool‚Äù, Balinese and Thai massages using heated stones, aromatic oils, herbs and flowers, thalassotherapy services. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nowbali.co.id" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Nusa Dua Beach Hotel &amp; Spa 5 *: reviews" class="if uuid-3221334" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3221334.jpg"></div><h2>  General reviews about Nusa Dua Beach Hotel &amp; Spa 5 * (Indonesia, Bali) </h2><p>  In this hotel you will find a truly chic vacation, tourists unanimously assure you.  The whole staff is very friendly, beaming with smiles, trying to help in everything.  The cleaning of the rooms, on the territory, on the beach is excellent and does not depend on the tip.  The only thing tourists are warned against is a holiday in Bali in February.  On dates close to the celebration of the Chinese New Year, hordes of citizens of the Celestial Empire call at the hotel.  They are very noisy and leave a lot of trash behind them.  The rest of the time, the rest of the hotel is mainly residents of the USA, Australia and Western Europe. </p>
