  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Xiaomi Power Strip Extender: reviews and comparisons with competitors</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Chinese corporation Xiaomi is a young company that has gained wide international fame thanks primarily to its gadgets: smartphones, smart bracelets, household electronic devices and other devices. </p><p>  The company did not bypass its attention and such a common device as an ordinary electric extension cord.  What is so special about this Xiaomi device that is simple in purpose?  The main ‚Äúchip" of the device from the Chinese manufacturer can be attributed to the presence of three USB ports, which can be used to recharge mobile gadgets.  We analyze the functionality of the Xiaomi Mi Power Strip extension cord in the article and see if it is worth buying. </p><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  <span>Xiaomi Mi</span> Power Extender comes in a long rectangular box made of white cardboard.  The packaging design is simple, without any decorations, on its upper side there is a logo of the manufacturer.  At the bottom of the package, you can read information about the main characteristics of the device. </p><p>  The delivery set of the device is not rich.  In addition to the extension cord itself, packed in a plastic bag, the manufacturer put in the box only brief instructions for using the device.  However, all the questions regarding the configuration of the device from Xiaomi disappear, it is worth recalling the very affordable price of the extension cord: in China, it is something around 8 US dollars.  Of course, when shipping to Russia and buying here, the price is not so attractive, but this can be read below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Xiaomi Power Strip Package Contents" class="if uuid-2236844" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60925/2236844.jpg"></div><h2>  Appearance of Xiaomi Power Strip Extender </h2><p>  The design of the gadget is simple and that is why it looks fresh and interesting.  All elements of the device, including the power button, are made in white.  The corners of the extension casing are rounded, and the entire side surface of the device along the perimeter is glossy, which for many users seems a controversial design decision.  But the upper and lower parts of Xiaomi Power Strip are made of nice matte plastic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the top panel of the extension cord there are three sockets for connecting electrical appliances (they are universal, suitable for any type of plug), three USB sockets and a switch (equipped with a backlight).  It should be noted that the openings of the sockets are protected from children by special sliding shutters, eliminating the <span>risk of electric shock.</span> </p><p>  The only drawback of the design of this gadget, and even that, rather far-fetched, is the plug.  It has three pins located at different angles (Asian version) and is not designed to connect to a European-style outlet.  You will have to buy some kind of adapter or adjust another plug yourself. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.aalibangla.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Extension cable appearance" class="if uuid-2236703" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60925/2236703.jpg"></div><p>  It is worth noting the use of a high-quality three-core power cord. </p><p>  The dimensions of the extension cord are as follows: 225x41x26 mm.  The weight of the device is 300 grams. </p><h2>  Product Specifications </h2><p>  Here is a list of the main technical parameters of the Xiaomi extension cable with USB: </p><ul><li>  ultimate power - 2500 W; </li><li>  voltage - up to 250 volts (operation is supported at a voltage of 110 volts); </li><li>  current - up to a maximum of 10 amperes; </li><li>  the presence of USB outputs with a voltage of 5 volts and a current of up to 2 amperes (depending on the number of connected energy consumers). </li></ul><h2>  Dismantling the Xiaomi power strip: what's inside? </h2><p>  In order to disassemble the extension cord yourself (for example, if the user wants to completely change the power cable to a similar one with a suitable plug), it is necessary to remove the plugs on the bottom panel of the device and unscrew the screws hidden under them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.aalibangla.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Extension cable disassembly" class="if uuid-2236845" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60925/2236845.jpg"></div><p>  The first thing that pleasantly surprises when examining the inside of the device is the materials used.  For contacts, only copper is used, and not some conductive substitute for it. </p><p>  Also pleased with the overall accuracy of the assembly of the internal part of the device and the amazing quality of soldering.  I just can‚Äôt believe that such a well-made device can have a low price. </p><h2>  Comparison with similar devices from other companies </h2><p>  For comparison, two devices were selected, most similar to Xiaomi Power in functionality.  So, we meet! </p><p>  First, let's get acquainted with the Orico DPC-4A-4U extension cord.  The design of the device is simpler than that of the hero of the review.  The device from Orico shape is a regular rectangular block of chopped shapes.  It is both larger and heavier than a similar device from Xiaomi.  But the DPC-4A-4U boasts the presence of four USB ports for connecting external devices.  There are also four electrical outlets, their design is the same as that of the extension cord from Xiaomi, that is, you can use plugs of European, Chinese and American standards.  But the plug to be included in the Asian standard electrical network will have to look for an adapter.  The advantages of the gadget include the high power of the USB ports (the output current is up to 2.4 amperes). </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Extension cord Orico DPC-4A-4U" class="if uuid-2236848" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60925/2236848.jpg"></div><p>  Ntonpower‚Äôs second extension cord, MPS-EU5U4, is truly gigantic.  Its dimensions are 242x84x44 mm.  But this is justified by the presence of two rows of connectors: five electrical outlets and four USB ports.  The power cable is very thick and solid.  In this, competitors from Xiaomi and Orico are clearly losing to him.  And the device‚Äôs power is rather big, it amounts to 2.4 amperes per USB port.  The obvious advantages of the device over competitors include the use of sockets and plugs of the European standard.  Someone can attribute the disadvantages, is it often required to connect a plug other than European? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rosenblut.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Extension cord Ntonpower MPS-EU5U4" class="if uuid-2236851" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60925/2236851.jpg"></div><p>  All the presented devices are good in their own way, and the price corresponds to their capabilities: from $ 12 for Xiaomi (although you can find cheaper) to 28 for the Ntonpower MPS-EU5U4. </p><h2>  Gadget Reviews </h2><p>  Users respond positively about the device.  The advantages of the device were described above, therefore, for the objectivity of the review, here are the disadvantages of the gadget: </p><ul><li>  short length of power cord (1.5 m); </li><li>  use of a fork of the Asian standard; </li><li>  when connecting a European plug through an adapter, grounding will not be involved; </li><li>  bright illumination of the power button, in the dark a little distracting from work; </li><li>  squeaking from the Xiaomi extension cord in the absence of load; </li><li>  under load, the prior is noticeably heated; </li><li>  lack of USB power for some demanding customers; </li><li>  the inability to connect devices with the new USB standard - Type-C. </li></ul><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  The Chinese corporation Xiaomi turned out to be an interesting and useful device that combines the functions of an extension cord and a universal charger for a variety of electronic gadgets.  The extension cord has an interesting design, supports the connection of electrical appliances with plugs of various modifications. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.aalibangla.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Using Xiaomi Power Strip Extender" class="if uuid-2236864" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60925/2236864.jpg"></div><p>  The disadvantages of the extension cord include the manufacturer's use of the Asian standard plug, as well as a cable of insufficient length.  And the price of the device in the realities of the Russian market is not as attractive as in Chinese auctions. </p><p>  But in any case, judging by the reviews on the Internet, the device is quite popular among users.  Its analogues, although they can offer advanced functionality, are much more expensive and have a less attractive design. </p>
