By and large, this is a narrow strip of land that separates the mountains from the sea.  However, the nature of the foothills is so amazingly diverse that to go to Goa is considered a golden dream of every traveler.  Lakes and waterfalls, islands covered with mangroves, palm groves, which are home to a huge amount of amazing living creatures - all this made this exotic destination popular for recreation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Palmarinha Resort 3" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1039791.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  India, Goa </h2><p>  Hotels in this state are very different from each other.  Geographically, the region is divided into North and <span>South Goa.</span>  The first, characterized by a high population density, offers tourists accommodation in a few hotels, mainly having a category of 2-3 stars.  Due to the fact that the beaches in this part of the Indian coast are covered for the most part with grayish unsightly sand, and the sea is by no means transparent, rest in the region is considered very inexpensive.  More lovers of economical holidays come here, as well as foreign students and the poor local population. </p><p>  Rest spent here is much cheaper than in the south.  North Goa is famous for its Arambol beach, which was once chosen by hippies for its natural beauty - virgin sands and stunning sunsets, which can be observed in the month of February. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In South Goa, the sea is cleaner and the sand is golden.  There are expensive hotels, buried in the greenery of gardens and with a minimum of 4-5 stars.  Here, the rest is relatively expensive, especially judging by Indian standards.  Here you can meet the local elite and wealthy foreigners, including Russians. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Palmarinha Resort 3 Goa" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1039786.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  As in any resort in the world, in India, and in Goa in particular, a place to stay must be selected taking into account many factors.  This is the location of the hotel, a set of services provided in it, a food system, remoteness from the beach and much more.  Despite the fact that Goa is the smallest state in India, there are a great many hotels here, so their selection must be approached with great care. </p><p>  North Goa, a beach that became popular thanks to hippies, has changed a lot since the late sixties of the last century.  On its largest beaches - Vagator and Calangute - annually a huge army of youth gathers, for which neither expensive apartments nor developed infrastructure are important.  Five star hotels in North Goa are a rarity.  But it is full of hotels for two or three stars with a small territory and low prices.  Among them, Palmarinha Resort 3 * occupies not the last place. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  general information </h2><p>  This hotel is a good option for those who choose their vacation in an exotic country such as India.  Palmarinha Resort 3 * is relatively close to the best Calangute beach.  Many tourist sites - restaurants, nightclubs, etc. - are just a ten-minute walk away.  According to reviews of tourists, the hotel has a friendly, welcoming atmosphere. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="North Goa" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1039788.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <p>  Location Palmarinha Resort 3 * was chosen quite well.  It is located in the very center of Bardez in North Goa, fourteen kilometers from the capital, in a small but very green area.  The nearest international airport is fifty-five kilometers away, and Thivim Railway Station is a fifteen-minute drive away.  Located along Calangute Mapusa Road, the hotel is a kilometer north of attractions such as St.  Alex Church. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Palmarinha Resort 3 * (Goa) offers its guests the services of a small business center and conference room with a maximum capacity of one hundred and twenty people, free parking for mopeds and cars, and a currency exchange office.  In addition, there is a supermarket and a small souvenir stall on the small but well-groomed area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel.  India has always been famous for its cheap gold products.  Residents of Palmarinha Resort 3 * are given the opportunity to purchase jewelry in a small store right at the hotel.  There are also laundry services and a doctor‚Äôs office (at an additional cost). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The reception is open at any time of the day or night.

    <h2>  Housing stock </h2><p>  The appearance of the Palmarinha Resort 3 * (North Goa) hotel, whose name is translated from Portuguese as ‚Äúpalm swing‚Äù, is very attractive.  It includes one hundred thirty-four rooms, of which eighty are Deluxe, thirty-six are One-Bedroom Suites, and eighteen serviced apartments.

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Palmarinha Resort 3 * (Calangute) works according to the following concepts: breakfast, half or full board.  Meals are organized according to the "buffet" system in the main restaurant.  There is also a cafe and poolside bar on site.  The Palms √† la carte bar-restaurant requires reservations in advance with the receptionist.  Here visitors will be treated not only with Indian dishes, but also with continental and Chinese cuisines more familiar to Europeans.  You can sit not only in the hall decorated in a national style, but also on the terrace of The Deck, where guests can dine outdoors. </p><p>  Those who prefer breakfast only can eat at nearby facilities the rest of the time.  Judging by the reviews, there are many inexpensive cafes and restaurants near the hotel where you can have a tasty and satisfying lunch.  Upon request, you can get the service "room service." </p><h2>  For children </h2><p>  Since Palmarinha Resort 3 * is more suitable for youth recreation, there are few services in its infrastructure for the youngest customers.  On the territory there is a small playground, as well as a children's section in the pool. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The famous bathing area of ‚Äã‚ÄãCalangute is two kilometers from the hotel.  Every half hour, a bus leaves for this sandy beach.  The entrance to the sea is gentle, which allows tourists to swim without fear. </p>

At the beach bar, you can enjoy a cocktail or soft drink and, sitting on a sunbed, sunbathe under the gentle rays of the local sun.  Periodically, a light fresh breeze blows, giving great pleasure in the heat.  Here you can often meet tourists collecting starfish along the surf line, whom the waves throw from the depths to the shore.

    <h2>  Additional Information </h2><p>  On the territory of the Palmarinha Resort 3 * (Calangute) there are three pools, two of which have children's sections.  They are located very close to each other, so that parents, not distracting from bathing, can keep their babies splashing in the next compartment in sight.  On the terraces around the pools, there are sun loungers with umbrellas.  Those tourists who like to combine relaxation with the knowledge of the outside world, the tour desk working in the main building invites you to take excursions in the surroundings of Bardez or Calangute, Panjim or Mapus. </p><p>  The hotel provides those who wish both a guide and transport.  Those who want to explore local attractions on their own can rent a car.  The landscape of the hotel contributes to long walks along the paths along lush plantings. </p><p>  Every Friday, animators arrange discos for residents, DJs are invited to them.  In the evenings, when the illumination of the swaying palm trees is turned on and the fairytale illumination repaints the hotel building in amazing colors, turning it into a golden palace, the atmosphere of real magic descends on the Palmarinha Resort 3 *. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Palmarinha Resort 3 North Goa" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1039795.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Those traveling to Goa for the first time need to be aware that this is not Turkey or Egypt with their all-inclusive system.  India, and especially Goa, is a country with a completely different mentality, with other people and other ideas about the rest. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, the hotel Palmarinha Resort 3 * appealed to many Russians.  The staff speaks not only Hindi, but also English.  The rooms are very comfortable, they have everything you need for a carefree stay, including a refrigerator.  Plumbing works without interruption. </p><p>  The food is quite varied, one breakfast per week may not be repeated.  Lots of local sauces, vegetables and fruits.  Many Russians chose to eat in shekels - a cafe located on the beach, paying only breakfast for their stay with the hotel. </p><p>  Among the shortcomings, tourists note a certain remoteness of the beach, as well as paid Wi-Fi and the lack of Russian channels on TV. </p>
