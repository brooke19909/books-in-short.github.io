This is a large suburban resort complex, whose buildings are located directly on the seashore.  It was built in two thousand and seven.  Therefore, the hotel is equipped very modernly, and its concept takes into account all the requirements for the leisure of tourists of the twenty-first century.  Until two thousand and thirteen, the hotel belonged to the Iberostar chain.  But do not think that with the change of ownership, the level of services in this tourist complex has decreased.  Of course, it is often written that after the revolution the hotel business in Tunisia began to fall into disrepair.  But let's see what those who have visited this hotel say about the level of service and comfort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Safira Palms 4 * (Tunisia), reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1569523.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Djerba and Zarzis </h2><p>  The southernmost island of Tunisia with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than five hundred kilometers begins to take vacationers much earlier than other resorts in the country.  Unlike Hammamet and Sousse, you can sunbathe and swim here in March.  Hotel Safira Palms 4 * <span>(Tunisia, Djerba) is</span> also located in one of the most famous resort areas of this area.  It is called Zarzis (as well as the only hub that is located on Djerba).  It is a city and a major port.  But they come here exclusively overseas, the sun and thalassotherapy.  Staying on Djerba may seem boring to some.  But in fact, it is here that one can feel a real unity with nature.  Zarzis is not part of the island of Djerba, it is located on the mainland.  However, it is located closest to this resort area.  Therefore, administratively Zarzis refers to Djerba.  The island is within easy reach, and the climate and conditions for a beach holiday are approximately the same.  True, it is very close to the Libyan border, so some tourists are afraid so far to go here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Safira Palms 4 (Tunisia Zarzis) reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1569525.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is located on the island of Djerba.  You can get here from Monastir, but it will be much longer.  And the thing is that there are not so many direct flights to Djerba.  Most often directly to the island from Russia planes of the Tunisian company Nouvelair arrive.  She carries tourists from Moscow, Yekaterinburg and Tyumen.  But mainly charters fly here to from Europe.  Serves the airport and internal lines of the country.  Reviews of the hotel Safira Palms 4 * (Tunisia, Zarzis) say that the hotel is located at the very beginning of the resort area.  A shuttle bus travels this distance in about an hour.  Tourists from this hotel are ‚Äúunloaded‚Äù first, and taken last. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Safira Palms 4 (Tunisia Djerba)" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1569524.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Everything that can be offered to tourists is available in the Hotel Safira Palms 4 * complex (Tunisia).  Reviews mention that there is a large conference room, a number of shops, a laundry and dry cleaning service, an exchange office and a hairdresser.  A lagoon-style pool with a stylish bar is located in the heart of the hotel.  The territory is small, but very clean, well-groomed, the buildings, the park and the garden are cleaned in the same style.  Lots of relaxation areas.  Everything you need is inside the hotel, because it is far from any active life, and here you really relax, and not just spend the night. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews about hotel Safira Palms 4 Tunisia Zarzis" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1569520.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  The beach near the hotel Hotel Safira Palms 4 * (Tunisia, Zarzis) reviews are described as clean and snow-white.  Here you will find a lot of water sports - and riding on the "bananas", catamarans and canoes, and windsurfing.  By the way, using them for free is the property of the hotel.  But the sea on Djerba is such that tides often bring in algae.  They are removed from the beach, but they are in the water.  By the way, the entrance is good, a little rocky, but immediately the sand begins.  In principle, algae are not a problem for swimmers, because you walk two meters and swim in clean water.  But if you are used to taking sea baths off the coast, you will have to wait for another occasion.  The water in the season is very warm.  The sea itself is calm and not as salty as in Turkey or Egypt.  On the right hand side of the hotel, if you walk about two hundred meters, you will find another beach, which almost every review of the Iberostar Safira Palms hotel (Djerba, Tunisia) calls ideal and similar to the ocean.  It is closer to the Sango Hotel.  Safira Palm Hotel's buildings are surrounded by a large, elegantly shaped pool with varying water levels.  Swimming there, you see the sea.  So if there are waves or algae come, your vacation will not be spoiled.  You can also play water polo here.  There is also an indoor pool.  A special reservoir for children also works.  There are always enough sun loungers both by the sea and on the terrace by the pool.  If they unexpectedly end, then the staff at your request will bring more.  So there is no need to occupy sunbeds.  Beach towels can be secured with ten dollars. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Safira Palms 4 hotel reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1569521.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Well, suppose that tourists were tired of sitting at the hotel all the time, and they wanted to ride around the neighborhood.  What can I advise those who are going to the Safira Palms Zarzis 4 * hotel (Zarzis, Tunisia).  Reviews say that you can also go to the city by taxi.  It costs about fourteen dinars.  It is quite interesting there, because these places have been known since Roman times.  In addition, it is here that you can look at non-tourist Tunisia and understand how people live in this country.  There is also a functioning Jewish synagogue.  In addition, from Zarsis you can go on a boat trip to the famous Carthage and the island of Djerba itself.  And the most popular excursions with travel companies are, of course, the Sahara (ATV rides with a visit to the village of nomadic Berbers) and Tatooine - the village that served as the set for Star Wars. </p><h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  And what to bring from rest in the Safira Palms 4 * hotel (Tunisia, Jerba)?  The reviews mention that the local market is very cheap and high-quality olive oil (which is not surprising, since almost all the inhabitants of the city are engaged in its production).  Visit the traditional bazaar.  He is in every Tunisian city and, as a rule, is called "bitches."  Here you can buy any souvenirs, as in the stores at the hotel.  Only you pay for them many times less.  You can take a little taxi - to the neighboring coastal town of Gabes.  It is famous for its real Tunisian spices market. </p><h2>  Hotel Safira Palms 4 *: hotel reviews </h2><p>  Tourists praise this hotel primarily for its excellent location (especially proximity to the sea), cleanliness and well-groomed area.  Everything you need is within walking distance.  And the distance from the village and other hotels is considered by some people to leave reviews as an additional bonus.  The guests liked the cheerful and sociable animators, a nice beach and pool.  And almost everyone noted tasty food.  The local population is very friendly, people are completely not arrogant, traders are not intrusive, do not molest.  Visitors to many countries note that Tunisia is a cross between Turkey and Egypt.  Some tourists, who were afraid to go here for safety reasons, were surprised to note that it was completely calm and they had nothing to fear.  There are some guests who have become regulars at this hotel. </p>
