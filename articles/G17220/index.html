Buying tours at an unverified street agency is a very risky prospect, although tickets are cheap.  There is a risk of dropping "not there" (you will just be sold the wrong tickets).  In fact, large tour operators and local agencies have the same quality of tours if they simply assemble a group for an excursion, and organize and conduct it by a Thai tour operator. </p><p>  The cost of excursions for children is usually 10-15% lower than for adults. </p><p>  Temples of Thailand can be easily visited on their own, entrance tickets cost no more than 50 baht. </p><p>  Prices for excursions in Thailand also depend on which beach and in which area the tour was purchased.  For example, in Patong it will be cheaper than on Kata Beach.  Prices can be knocked down by bargaining.  If you buy an excursion on the street to Similan, the cost can be about 2300 baht without spending the night, to the James Bond Islands - about 2000 baht. </p>
