  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Potassium sorbate and its use</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Currently, the food industry uses a lot of various additives that can improve the taste of products, and are designed to reduce costs and simplify the production process.  Naturally, such a significant area for humans as the food industry should carefully approach the issue of introducing any additives and products. </p><p>  Recently, people have begun to actively discuss all kinds of supplements and the effect of the use of GMOs in food.  Almost all the additives that are used in food have been affected.  This is especially true for group E supplements, which include potassium sorbate. </p><p>  The problem is that on the world food market, as well as on the markets of individual countries, there is a need to simplify the production of products.  This is due to the fact that the products must be delivered over long distances, while their quality must be preserved.  One of the possible ways to solve the problem is the use of a variety of preservatives, which are designed to increase the <span>shelf life</span> without loss of quality. </p><p>  Among the elements used, the salt of sorbic acid, or simply potassium sorbate, has proven itself well.  It has long been used in the global food industry.  <span>Sorbic acid,</span> from which this ingredient is obtained, has long been subjected to rigorous research.  As a result, strong antibacterial properties of this acid were discovered.  In the second half of the 20th century, <span>food additives</span> began to be obtained from it <span>.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Features of the preservative E202</strong> </p><p>  The main advantage is that this substance can be obtained from plants.  This speaks in favor of using this preservative and confirms that potassium sorbate is safe for the human body. </p><p>  Preservative E202 does not destroy microbes and other microorganisms, it just stops their vital activity, but at the same time leaves useful bacteria that are necessary for a person. </p><p>  Preservative E202 slows down the vital activity of harmful microorganisms, but at the same time leaves beneficial bacteria that are contained in the human body and are responsible for the natural metabolism.  In their absence, natural biorhythms are disrupted in a person, dysbiosis begins to develop, which ultimately leads to a violation of the remaining functions of the body. </p><p>  In world practice, the <span>preservative E202 has been</span> known for a long time.  For a long time, numerous independent studies were carried out, on the basis of which it was possible to establish the basic properties of the substance and the possibilities that potassium sorbate has.  It is absolutely safe for humans, so it can be freely used in the food industry without endangering people's health.  After it, no <span>harmful substances</span> or foreign <span>substances</span> remain in the human body, since it naturally decomposes into carbon dioxide and water. </p><p>  Although periodically appear publications and scientific articles that potassium sorbate is harmful to humans.  They are associated with general discussions about the appropriateness of the use of food additives, and, as a rule, have nothing specific against potassium sorbate.  In reality, each individual supplement should be tested independently, because they have too different properties to be able to talk about them in the same study. </p><p>  As for the possible harm to E202, it is primarily an allergic reaction.  In some people, a potassium sorbate preservative can cause skin irritation.  However, in other respects it is absolutely safe; over 50 years of using this preservative, not a single case of mutations or carcinogenic effects has been recorded.  Even major critics of nutritional supplements admit that sorbic acid and the preservative number E202 receive a top safety rating. </p>
