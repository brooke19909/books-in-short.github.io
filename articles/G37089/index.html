Amazingly beautiful nature, interesting history, unique architectural monuments, many healing springs for those who came to improve their health - each tourist will find something to his liking and will be able to satisfy his needs. </p><p>  The legend explains the origin of the name of the city by the name of the Czech king Karl, who, while hunting, injured his leg and washing his wound in a local source with salt and <span>hot water,</span> lamented that there was no other normal reservoir.  But, noticing after some time that the sore leg began to heal quickly, I realized that the source was with ‚Äúliving‚Äù water, and ordered the construction of a hunting lodge near it.  Since then, the city of hot springs has the worldwide fame of the resort, where people with diseases of the musculoskeletal system, gastrointestinal tract, and other health problems come. </p><p>  Curious tourists will surely devote their holidays to Kalovy Vary to acquaintance with the history of the city, and learn that in the 19th century the resort became very popular due to the rapid development of the city and the frequent visits of the European aristocracy to it.  Vacation in Karlovy Vary at that time was a very fashionable pastime, high-society life was seething in it, and the treatment was not burdensome and burdensome: drinking water, walking in nature, taking baths - these were signs of a good form and a symbol of involvement in higher classes. </p><p>  Since then, a lot of water has flowed, including mineral water, but the glory of the spa town has not become less loud, and affordable prices for treatment and leisure in Karlovy Vary still attract thousands of people here. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  History connects many famous people with Karlovy Vary, including Peter I. His visit to this city for water treatment was marked by his inherent enthusiastic enthusiasm in everything, including the approach to therapy.  Legend has it that the Russian Tsar drank 30 cups of mineral water per day, which by today's standards is considered a shock dose, and can lead to undesirable consequences.  Therefore, last-minute tours to Karlovy Vary, purchased for the course of treatment, should be carried out under the strict supervision of a doctor and taking into account all his recommendations and wishes, in compliance with all requirements and regimen.  The success of treatment depends on the duration of the course of treatment, which should be at least 3 weeks. </p><p>  Karlovy Vary has 12 hot healing springs, one with cold mineral water.  Basically, water from the mineral springs of Karlovy Vary is used for drinking treatment.  And the water of Vrzhidlo spring is used as the basis for all balneological procedures practiced at the resort.  Among them are different types of therapeutic <span>baths: radon,</span> pearl, oxygen, carbon dioxide.  Also, pools are filled with this water, and it is also used for washing, irrigation, rinsing.  Water produced from the Mill Spring is bottled; you can buy it and take it with you. </p><p>  The well-known <span>Karlovy Vary salt is</span> obtained from the mineral waters of Karlovy <span>Vary by</span> evaporation of the liquid.  This salt contains <span>sodium</span> and potassium <span>sulfates</span> , sodium <span>bicarbonate, sodium chloride,</span> as well as a small amount of salts of magnesium, calcium, lithium, iron, bromine and fluorine. </p><p>  In addition to water, there are sources of natural gas, peat and mud.  The thirteenth source of Karlovy Vary is called the world famous Becherovka drink.  Therefore, for those who bought a tour or last-minute trips to Karlovy Vary, saw this wonderful city, you should definitely try this Czech liquor, which is infused with herbs, has a great taste and smell, and was previously used as a medicine for problems with the gastrointestinal tract.  Its strength is 38 degrees, it contains syrup and extracts from medicinal herbs, as well as spices.  You will remember the rest in Karlovy Vary for a long time, and each time, at the first convenient opportunity, you will come here for recreation and for an interesting pastime. </p>
