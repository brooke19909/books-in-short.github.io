Visitors are offered four types of rooms: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  double room of standard type; </li><li>  triple room of the same type; </li><li>  penthouse located on two floors; </li><li>  two bedroom apartments with separate kitchen. </li></ul><p>  The institution is mainly focused on family vacations.  The rooms are located in two buildings, which are located on a quiet street, there are no nightclubs or noisy discos nearby. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="guest house olga lazarevskoe shevchenko" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11239/2133125.jpg"></div>

In Lazarevsky it is located on the same Shevchenko street, house 8. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="guest house mom olga in lazarevsky" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11239/2133146.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The place is very cozy and just surrounded by greenery.  From it to the airport "Adler" 71 km.  Within walking distance of this guest house are such popular establishments as an amusement park, as well as water parks Nautilus and Starfish.  You can walk to them in 10-15 minutes.  The hotel consists of ten rooms, each of which must have a TV, a bathroom and air conditioning.  For tourists there is a free private parking.  Visitors can prepare food in the shared kitchen, where there is everything necessary for this. </p><p>  It is good to come to such a place as a family.  While parents are resting, children can have fun on the playground.  The road to the sea takes no more than 10 minutes.  This is quite a bit compared to how much time the tourists who rent apartments in the center of Sochi spend on such a trip.  Yes, and staying at the Mama Olga Hotel is relatively inexpensive.  For a day, guests have to pay only 1600 rubles.  Moreover, if you wish, you can book a room in advance. </p>
