    <p>  The settlement received its modern name relatively recently, in 1964.  Prior to this, the village, located at the mouth of the Inogua River, was called Fake Gelendzhik because of a similar coastal outline.  Another, Adyghe name Mezyb, is translated into Russian as "woodland".  Indeed, the village, located far from sea and transport highways, is surrounded on all sides by mountain slopes.  It is from here that the famous pine forest of Pitsunda begins.  Unlike the Big Gelendzhik (which includes the Divnomorskoe Sea), there is an open coast and a cleaner sea, fewer noisy bars and night discos.  When choosing a <span>vacation (in a boarding house)</span> with young children, it is advisable to look for a place that will be located slightly away from the waterfront.  After all, it is here that the majority of institutions are located in which night festivities are held with singing in karaoke and incendiary dances. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Family pension </h2>
