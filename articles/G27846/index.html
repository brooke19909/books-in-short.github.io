    <p>  There are still many disputes regarding the primacy of these two skyscrapers.  And the thing is that the Taiwanese building has a spire, which is part of it.  So without it, the skyscraper loses to the opponent in height. </p><h2>  Pinan </h2><p>  <span>In fairness, it‚Äôs worth recalling the international financial center Pinan, which could very well become the tallest building in China.</span>  <span>However, in 2005, a spire was removed from his project, which could become an obstacle to aviation.</span>  <span>If initially the height of the skyscraper was to be 660 meters, then subsequently it was reduced to 600 meters.</span>  <span>Because of this, the tower took only second place in China.</span> </p><h2>  "Lakhta Center" </h2><p>  <span>In St. Petersburg, in the Primorsky district, the construction of an ultramodern complex called Lakhta Center is underway.</span>  <span>Its area is 400 thousand square meters.</span> <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="international financial center pinan" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2148800.jpg"></div>
