Historians determine its time interval from 1054 to 1073.  What was this time, what was it characterized by, we will consider further. </p><h2>  Testament of Yaroslav the Wise </h2><p>  Before freeing the throne due to death, Yaroslav the Wise left a will in which he highlighted important points in the political structure of Russia: </p><ul><li>  the throne should pass according to seniority, and the <span>Kiev prince</span> retains the status of the main ruler of the country; </li><li>  the sons of the prince receive certain areas in control; </li><li>  all the old Russian lands cannot be divided, they belong to the princely family. </li></ul><p>  According to these principles, the throne passed to Izyaslav, who was older than his brothers.  He received the Kiev volost, as well as Novgorod and Turov.  The next brother, Svyatoslav, received Chernihiv, Tmutarakan and Murom.  Vsevolod received Pereyaslavl, Rostov and Suzdal.  Smolensk left Vyacheslav.  And the youngest, Igor, is Volyn. </p><p>  Thus, the three older brothers received the main thrones in neighboring cities (Kiev, Chernigov and Pereyaslavl), which were previously actually Russian land. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="triumvirate of Yaroslavich" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52853/2115493.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Why is this period called the triumvirate </h2><p>  It is interesting why the time period under consideration is called the Yaroslavich triumvirate?  The word itself from Latin translates as "union of three husbands." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Who was part of the Yaroslavich triumvirate?  This system of government was established after the death of Yaroslav the Wise among his three eldest sons: Izyaslav, Svyatoslav and Vsevolod. </p><p>  If we talk about the essence of the Yaroslavich triumvirate briefly, then it consisted of the following.  The brothers remembered their father‚Äôs covenant and did not enter into disagreements and civil strife, at least at first.  They fought against enemies together.  Such opponents included the side lines of the Rurik dynasty, as well as external enemies. </p><p>  In 1060, the Turkic peoples invaded Russia, which was successfully repelled by the Yaroslavich triumvirate.  After this defeat, the Turks for a long time did not dare to approach the southern borders of Russia. </p><p>  However, in 1061, the Polovtsy attacked Russia; the Yaroslavichs did not manage to organize their military forces and failed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="in what year did the triumvirate of Yaroslavich" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52853/2115508.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Princely riots </h2><p>  Soon, the Yaroslavich triumvirate had to solve another serious problem associated with the princely rebellions.  Their nephew, Prince Rostislav, was the first to revolt, unhappy that Volyn had passed into his possession.  In 1064, the prince captured Tmutarakan, expelled Gleb from there.  Yaroslavichi decided to teach Rostislav a lesson, but he suddenly died at the hands of the Byzantines. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 1067 there was a riot of Prince of Polotsk Vseslav, who went to Novgorod, overthrew Mstislav and seized his wealth. </p><p>  In response, the Yaroslavichs went on a campaign against Vseslav and defeated him.  The prince in fear fled from the battlefield.  Some time later, the Yaroslavichi called the treacherous prince to negotiate.  But while he was driving, the Yaroslavichs seized the prince and imprisoned him.  And the throne was given to Mstislav. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yaroslavich triumvirate briefly" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52853/2115511.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Hard trials for the triumvirate </h2><p>  In 1068, the southern borders of Russia were attacked by the Polovtsian peoples.  Khan Sherukan with the army raided and was able to defeat the Yaroslavich squads on the Alta River. </p><p>  The runaway Izyaslav and Vsevolod returned to Kiev, where they were met by the indignant Kievites.  They demanded to give them weapons and horses, but the princes refused.  The Kievites rebelled, killed Bishop Stephen, defeated and plundered the princely possessions of Izyaslav, and put Vseslav in the place of the great Kiev prince. </p><p>  Such a powerful rebellion was of great importance to history.  Scientists, analyzing the event, highlight such moments: </p><ul><li>  the uprising showed the leading political role of the city council; </li><li>  vividly embodied the conflict between the people and the authorities, in which the upper hand was won by the city assembly. </li></ul><h2>  Further events </h2><p>  Let's consider how events developed further and in what year the triumvirate of the Yaroslavichs broke up. </p><p>  The escaped Prince Izyaslav decided to return the throne of Kiev and gathered a military campaign, with the support of the Poles.  Prince Vseslav first came out to meet, but then, frightened, fled to Poland.  The people of Kiev repented of their rebellion, and Izyaslav sent his son to them, who punished the people for rebellion. </p><p>  In 1069-1073, Izyaslav again ruled Kiev and Russia.  At this time, there are two more major riots. </p><p>  In 1072, the princely congress convenes, which makes the most important decisions: </p><ul><li>  reburial of the remains of Boris and Gleb; </li><li>  create the second part of the ‚ÄúRussian truth‚Äù, which abolished <span>blood feud</span> and imposed fines for crimes against the princely family. </li></ul><p>  However, not all historians hold such an opinion regarding the princely congress.  Some of them cannot give an exact answer of what the princely assembly was engaged in at that time.  The role of princely congresses has not yet been fully studied by historical science. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the triumvirate of Yaroslavich who entered" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52853/2115514.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  The fall of the triumvirate </h2><p>  In 1073, Izyaslav, after a quarrel with his brothers, was again expelled from Kiev, Svyatoslav took the throne.  This year is considered the end date of the reign of the three brothers.  Now we know in what year the triumvirate of the Yaroslavichs broke up. </p><p>  Vsevolod goes to Chernigov, and Pereyaslavl was given to Davyd Svyatoslavovich.  The following years are characterized by princely enmity, a frequent change of power. </p><p>  In 1076, Svyatoslav dies, and later in the battle Boris and Izyaslav die.  In 1078, power passed to Vsevolod, who ruled until 1093, establishing a monarchy. </p>
