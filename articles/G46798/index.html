  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Real estate is the base of any country in the world</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p><strong></strong>  <span>Immovable property, the</span> definition of which was given back in the days of Roman law, already contained such modern concepts as easement, that is, restriction of the rights to use real estate, and <span>mortgages, pledges of</span> property owned by a person, without changing the owner.  All operations with real estate then represented a simple contract between two parties, without the participation of third parties. </p><p>  In modern conditions, real estate is property that is recognized as real estate under current law.  If you determine the objects that define this concept, then real estate is land owned, including land and any other property attached to the land, firmly connected with it, for example, houses, buildings, structures and other objects.  From the point of view of legal law, real estate is the basis without which the very existence of no developed state or society is possible.  There is another definition of the interpretation of this definition, real estate is real tangible and landed property, which includes tangible property that can be below the surface of the earth, attached to the ground, and also located above the surface of the earth. </p><p>  In Russia, the first mention of the very term on movable and immovable property appeared during the progressive reign of Peter I.  In 1714, the first Decree ‚ÄúOn the Inheritance Procedure in Movable and Immovable Property‚Äù was issued, in which immovable property included land, houses, factories, factories, estates, shops and warehouses.  Also, real estate was recognized as subsoil located in the <span>ground, buildings</span> towering above the ground, such as bridges, mines, dams. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Almost three hundred years have passed since then, and the very concept of real estate in our country, as well as other countries of the world, remains the most debated in scientific and political circles.  Sometimes the laws of the <span>developed countries of the</span> world are so different from each other that in one country the same property can be recognized as real estate, and in another country <span>movable property.</span>  Therefore, in international legal practice, membership is defined by definition as movable or immovable property under the law of the country where the property is currently located. </p><p>  Real estate and its types may also affect the preparation of civil contracts.  For example, only after determining the type of property can you know exactly what form of donation will be applied.  The state registration of property necessary from a legal point of view also depends on the type of real estate. </p><p>  From an economic point of view, real estate is considered as an effective tangible asset, a reliable tool for income and investment.  The main elements of real estate from the point of view of economic attractiveness are its price and value, usefulness and liquidity, as well as the ability to satisfy the interests and various needs of the population.  Real estate can also act as a filler of local or municipal budgets, due to the permanent taxation of real estate transactions or deductions for its rent or sale. </p><p>  From a social point of view, the role of real estate is to meet the various needs of the population, such as physiological, intellectual, psychological and many others.  Not to mention that the possession of real estate in any form and in any country in the world is an indicator of prestige and affluence, which ultimately forms the social layer and the division of society into classes. </p>
