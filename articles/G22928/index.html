However, until recently, the city did not have a large indoor pool with attractions.  Today the situation has changed, because more recently a water park was opened in Barnaul in the shopping center "Europe".  It is in this place that we will go on a virtual tour today. </p><h2>  Attractions and extreme entertainment </h2><p>  Only a significant percentage of lovers of water parks go to water entertainment centers only to calmly swim in the pool.  Many visitors are primarily interested in slides and other entertainment.  The water park in Barnaul offers its guests traditional family slopes and extreme attractions.  In the largest pool is a complex of five slides.  These are two Tobogans, Kamikaze, a closed hydrotube and a classic wide direct family descent.  Small slides are also available in the children's pool.  The large pool has refreshing spray fountains; they are very popular with children and adults. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Water park in barnaul" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/1108421.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Waterpark in Barnaul: photos of the water area, pools and saunas </h2><p>  If you manage to miss the gentle sea, the wave pool will lift your spirits.  And for the young guests of the complex there is a shallow children's “paddling pool” with safe slides, splashing fountains and bright inflatable toys.  An artificial beach invites you to relax and dry on comfortable sun loungers among palm trees.  But these are not all the surprises that the water park in Barnaul prepared.  On the second floor of the complex there is a quiet area with a large artificial lake, where you can relax from the hustle and bustle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Water park barnaul europe reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/1108428.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Of course, the complex is difficult to compare with the huge open water parks in the southern regions.  But for his category he is quite good and interesting.  Children like the slides and the abundance of water splashes very much, but not every adult agrees to ride on extreme slides.  Not all guests like local prices, but do not forget that there are still no other options in the city.  You will be very surprised if you ask a local resident how many water parks there are in Barnaul?  Pools with hydromassage and slides are available in some private hotels and saunas.  A large public water park in the region today is one.  Many residents of the city visit it regularly, if you wish, you can have a great rest with your whole family or even celebrate some personal holiday. </p>
