Under the reign of Khan Mengu-Timur, it gained independence and only formally depended on the emperor.  What is the story of the Golden Horde?  What are its boundaries?  And what was the way of life?  Let's try to figure it out. </p><h2>  origin of name </h2><p>  In eastern sources, as well as in the Golden Horde, a single name for the state was not found.  There were a number of designations using the additional “ulus” or the names of land owners.  In Russia, the phrase "Golden Horde" first met in 1566 in the composition "Kazan History".  Prior to this, Russian sources used only the word "Horde", which usually meant an army or a mobile camp.  There were other names of the state - Tatarstan, Company, Land of the Tatars, Tatars. </p><h2>  "Steppe Polovtsian" </h2><p>  From the III century BC, tribes called Kipchaks (according to the annals - Polovtsy) lived in Northern Altai.  In the period from the 7th to the 8th centuries they were subordinated to the <span>Turkic Kaganate,</span> and later became part of the western part of the Kimak Kaganate.  After the weakening of the state’s power (starting from the 11th century), the Kipchaks supplanted the Pechenegs and Northern Oguzes, taking their lands.  Soon the tribe became the owner of the Great Steppe from the Danube to the Irtysh.  This area of ​​land is called Desht-i-Kipchak.  Subsequently, it was divided into two parts.  Its western region was owned by Khan Bonyak, and the eastern by Togur Khan. </p><h2>  The rebirth and defeat of Desht-i-Kipchak </h2>

Different nationalities that were part of the Great Steppe were united, the number of inhabitants increased markedly.  A feudal hierarchy was established, in which the khan was at the head, the sultan was with his right hand, the next in importance was the bek.  The final step was the title of bi.  The classification was strictly adhered to.

In 1223, the tribe lost the battle.  And soon the Great Steppe became the main land of the Golden Horde. </p><h2>  Ulus education </h2><p>  The state of the Golden Horde was one of the largest territories of the Middle Ages.  It was founded in 1243 by the son of Jochi - Batu Khan.  One of the few sources of information of that time was the <span>Lavrentievsky Chronicle.</span>  It tells about the arrival of Grand Duke Yaroslav to Batu Khan for a <span>label on reign</span> in the summer of 1243.  The case shows that the khan was already at the head of the new state.  After the death of Batu, Berke came to power.  He conducted a census of the entire population of Russia and other uluses, and also paid increased attention to improving the military training of soldiers. </p>

His tenth son, Khan Uzbek, began to gather meetings at which issues of state administration were considered.  They were attended by close relatives and influential temniks.  Before referring the problem to the khan, it was decided by the council, which consisted of four ulus emirs.  Khan Uzbek streamlined local government and centralized public administration.  The rulers of the Golden Horde were distinguished by their wisdom.

The military composition of the Golden Horde was impressive, the soldiers were engaged in improving their skills.  Wise rulers, such as Khan Uzbek, Janibek, Tokhtamysh, were able to significantly increase the level of development of the state.  The cities were distinguished by majolica and mosaic monumental architecture.  During the reign of the khans poetry flourished, the most famous representatives were Kotb, Khorezmi, Saif Sarai.  The influence of the Golden Horde was manifested in active trade with many countries.  For example, China imported cotton, silk, porcelain, Crimea brought glass and weapons, and Russia imported furs, leather, walrus fangs and bread.  Jewelry, ceramics, glass and bone objects and much more were exported.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Beginning of destruction Ulus Jochi </h2><p>  Since the end of the XIV century, the Golden Horde began to disintegrate.  Mainly due to religious beliefs, the Tatar elite began to be destroyed, and repression began.  After the death of Khan Uzbek, the throne was captured by his middle son - Janibek.  He did not rule for long.  After his death in 1357, his brother Mukhamet-Bardybek came to power.  Civil strife began.  For 18 years, the rulers of the Golden Horde have changed 25 times.  The state broke up into independent khanates with centers in Kazan, Astrakhan, Sarai, and the Meshchera Khanate was formed.  During this difficult period, the military leader Mamai began to acquire power, and in 1377 he finally seized it.  The leader was not recognized by the people of the Golden and White Horde, as well as by the Cossacks and Nogais, so he was forced to seek support.  And he found her in the person of the Lithuanian prince Jagiello.  Since then, a war began with Moscow and the Golden Horde elite.  The result of the struggle with the Russian princes was the Battle of Kulikovo in 1380, in which Mamai lost.  After the defeat, he again begins to collect troops.  At this time, another conqueror appears. </p><h2>  The reign of Tokhtamysh and Tamerlane </h2>

Having received the news of the loss of Mamai in the Battle of Kulikovo, he sends his trusted Tokhtamysh against the commander.  The latter captured Sarai and went to Mamaia, who was killed during the battle.  Tokhtamysh became the khan of the Golden Horde.  He restored the national religion and the idea of ​​the unity of his people.  The influence of the Golden Horde began to return.  Khan wanted complete submission to the Russian population and organized military campaigns.  During his reign, Tokhtamysh destroyed Moscow, Serpukhov, Kolomna, Pereslavl.  Having strengthened his power, the khan began to react negatively to his mentor Tamerlan, who did not tolerate arrogance and attacked the Golden Horde.  The Tatars did not hesitate to defend their territories.  After a long struggle, Tamerlane won.  Part of the defeated state was ravaged.  A few years later, the battle broke out again, and again the Tatars lost.  Tamerlan put Khan of the Golden Horde Mengu-Kutluk.

    <h2>  The collapse of the great state </h2><p>  After the death of the main khan, the Golden Horde was the following khanates: Sarai, Kazan, Astrakhan, Cossack and Crimean.  The Cossack state was considered independent, the power of the khan did not extend to it.  In 1438, the <span>Kazan Khanate</span> declared its independence <span>.</span>  His ruler Kichi-Mahmet expressed a desire to become the main khan of the Golden Horde.  The internecine war began.  For the main power began to fight the khans of Saraysk, Crimea and Kazan. </p><p>  The sultan of Turkey began to exert a great influence on the events.  So, he appointed Khan of Crimea Mengli-Giray.  The Sultan extended his power not only to the <span>Crimean Khanate,</span> but also to the territory of Kazan.  Mengli Gray continued to fight the rulers of the Golden Horde.  In 1502, he joined the battle with Shikh-Ahmed and won the war.  The capital of the Golden Horde, Sarai-Batu, was destroyed.  The Great State once ceased to exist. </p><p>  And what happened next with the vast territory?  At this time, new peoples were isolated - Kazakhs, Nogais, Crimean Tatars, Bashkirs and others.  In all the states of the former Golden Horde, the tradition of inheritance of power has been preserved.  At the head of the government of various independent regions was the steppe elite - Genghisides.  Some peoples did not have their sultans, so they were invited from the Kazakh Khanate.  The inheritance of the throne by the rulers of the "white bone" has not changed for a long time.  In the XV century, the following states took shape: <span>Nogai Horde,</span> Crimean, Uzbek, Kazan, Siberian, Kazakh Khanates.  In the XVI century, Ivan the Terrible occupied the Kazan state, took Astrakhan and the capital of the Nogai Khanate - Saraichik.  In 1582, Ermak with his detachment of Cossacks captured the Siberian state.  Since that time, Russia began to expand its territory, conquering more and more the number of cities of the former Golden Horde. </p><h2>  Coat of arms of the Golden Horde </h2>

And at the same time great fights were fought between the Romans and Caesars, and the Caesars beat the Romans three times and took two banners from them, or two eagles.  And from that the Caesars began to have a double-headed eagle in their banner, sign and seal. ”  In modern language, Byzantium fought with the Romans.  And she won the battle.  As a winner, the state has appropriated the flag of a losing empire.  In 1273, Beklarbek Nogai married the daughter of the Byzantine emperor Euphrosyne, Paleolog.  Before the wedding, he adopted the Orthodox faith.  The coat of arms of Byzantium was the double-headed eagle, which Nogai recognized as the emblem of the Golden Horde.  During the reign of the khans Dzhanibek and Uzbek, the image of a new coat of arms was actively used on state coins.

    <p>  There was another emblem that was often found during archaeological excavations.  It depicted a bird with a swastika on its chest.  This emblem of the Golden Horde was present on the ring and on the throne of Genghis Khan.  The swastika was the personification of the sun, happiness and life.  Her image was used on belts, carpets, clothes.  The symbol was considered a religious sign with great power. </p><h2>  Emblem of the Great Steppe and Astrakhan province </h2><p>  If you look at these two symbols: the emblem of Russia - the emblem of the Golden Horde, you can see that they are much similar.  In 1260, the city of Tsarev was built, which was the capital of the Horde.  His other name is Saray-Berke.  The coat of arms of the Golden Horde was an image of the crown (shamrock), under which is located a saber (moon sickle).  Joint images of the cross, sickle and sun were a common religious symbol before the separation of adherents of Islam.  During the period of feudal fragmentation of the state, power passed to the Astrakhan kingdom, and with it the coat of arms of the Golden Horde.  Photos of similar emblems available to historians today confirm the fact of its adoption by Astrakhan.  However, there is another symbol of this great state. </p><h2>  Golden Horde.

The latter was an image of a black owl on a yellow shield (some historians believe that this was another coat of arms).  There are a number of manuscripts that mention this banner.  For example, "World Geography", the Dutch table of flags of the early XVIII century, "Book" by Marco Polo.  There is another symbol - a black dragon on a yellow background.  This emblem also belonged to the flag of the Golden Horde by some historians.  The image of the red crescent over the crown was also considered the banner of the ancient state.  The flag used black and yellow colors.

    <p>  A true story is always based on evidence found.  Unfortunately, Ulus Jochi has existed for a long time, many sources of information have been lost or destroyed.  The question remains of the existence of the Mongol-Tatar yoke and what role the Great Khanate actually played.  But what you can be sure of is that the history of the Golden Horde and Russia is closely intertwined.  Many customs and objects were adopted from each other and are still used. </p>
