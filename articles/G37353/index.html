Not each of us knows the truly great achievements of this person, his life path and discoveries in the world of data transfer.  No one even knew that in a few years this small, but out of years smart kid would become an inventor and would bring his contribution to the formation of the modern world.  Despite the disagreements with their parents that arose during the youth of Marconi, they did not cease to be proud of their son. </p><p>  Guglielmo told the public about his invention only after more than two years.  What moved him when he hid his achievement, no one knows.  Perhaps he sought to improve it or did not consider it necessary to show it right now.  Nevertheless, it was on the day of his experiment that he conducted the so-called radio session with the French, while in the territory of modern England.  Naturally, the discovery made the French nervous, because they considered themselves the main inventors. </p><h2>  Guglielmo Marconi: biography </h2><p>  The inventor was born in an ordinary family of a middle-income landowner in April 1874.  At that time, none of his relatives knew what this boy would achieve in just a few years.  The family at the time of the birth of Guglielmo lived in Bologna, and the boy‚Äôs father was already married for the second time.  Guglielmo was the second son, and therefore the attitude of his parents towards him was supportive and almost all his petty pranks were forgiven.  Noticing his son‚Äôs desire to learn about the world around him, his father decided not to send the boy to a regular school, but to leave him at home.  Thanks to the available funds, the father of the future inventor Guglielmo Marconi was able to hire him good teachers and educators.  Throughout the training, teachers noted the boy‚Äôs extraordinary mind, craving for exact sciences and his persistence in studying subjects. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Disagreement with Parents </h2><p>  Until a certain moment, the father considered his second son to be a very intelligent and educated boy, but the hasty decision of his child very upset his father.  The fact is that, despite all the exhortations of his parents, Marconi Guglielmo decided not to go to university, but submitted his documents to the most ordinary technical school.  Naturally, this greatly undermined his authority in the family, because his father, however, like his mother, saw him either as a lawyer or a businessman. </p><h2>  Experiments with electricity </h2><p>  Young Marconi Guglielmo really liked the experiments with electricity that they conducted in practical classes at a technical school.  The guy was especially impressed with the experiments of such famous people as James Clerk Maxwell, <span>Heinrich Hertz,</span> Edward Branly and, of course, Oliver Lodge.  However, the greatest surprise and delight was caused by experiments with two balls that were electrified, and an electric spark slipped between them.  During this experiment, small <span>periodic oscillations</span> and pulses appeared, called the Hertz waves.  Even then, the young inventor was thinking about using such waves to transmit any signal. </p>

    <h2>  Years after graduating from technical school </h2><p>  Since, after graduating from a technical school, the young inventor did not have the necessary funds to study and diagnose oscillations and impulses, he had to rush to England in a hurry.  This decision was due to the fact that in his homeland he could not reach the heights to which he had always sought.  The inventor could not even think that for several decades he would spend on painstaking study of oscillations and periodic impulses. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Customs and early days in England </h2><p>  However, as soon as a young and inexperienced immigrant from Italy entered the territory of England, he was seized by the local customs with rhinestones.  Particular attention was drawn to his huge black suitcase, in which Marconi Guglielmo kept his invention.  At the request of the young inventor to be careful with the contents of the luggage, the customs of England did not react in any way.  In an attempt to explain in broken English what is there, Guglielmo again failed.  All the contents of the black suitcase were gutted, broken, and thrown into the nearest bin. </p><p>  Few people know that the inventor came to England on the advice of his supervisor Augusto Riga.  Since his mentor was a professor at the Institute of Physics at the University of Bologna, he could not give up his job and break into the <span>Foggy Albion.</span>  For some time, the inventors communicated and passed on to each other information obtained during the experiment. </p><h2>  Italy's reaction to the flight of Marconi Guglielmo </h2><p>  Upon learning that their citizen had relocated to another country, the Italian authorities responded instantly.  Literally a few days later Guglielmo received a <span>summons to the army</span> and the requirement to report to the indicated place without fail.  How did the young inventor react? </p>

    <p>  Thanks to the ingenuity of his mentor Riga, Marconi was able to rub in confidence in the leadership of the Italian Naval Academy and promised to cooperate with the authorities.  The main promise of the inventor was the creation in the near future of something that would surely play a role in the speedy promotion of the head of this school along the career ladder. </p><h2>  Thomas Edison as Marconi Guglielmo </h2><p>  Having promised his boss success, Marconi began to work hard on his invention.  Literally after some time, the head of the school invited Guglielmo to the territory of the naval base to demonstrate his invention.  When preparations were in full swing, the participants in the process were appalled by the news that the king and queen of Italy would soon arrive in order to familiarize themselves with the invention. </p>

    <p>  For the first time it turned out to raise the signal to a distance of 18 km, which sincerely hit the king of Italy.  Being still impressed by what he saw, the head of the country arranged a dinner and an entertainment program in honor of the inventor.  A few days later, an amount of ¬£ 15,000 was received in Marconi's account in exchange for the right of the Italian fleet to use his invention. </p><h2>  Marconi Guglielmo: Radio and Royal Attention </h2><p>  Over the following years, the inventor equipped the Prince of Wales yacht with special radio equipment, after which he transmitted daily telegrams to Walt Island.  At that time, the queen was disturbed by her son‚Äôs trauma on the island, but the <span>invention of the radio by</span> Guglielmo Marconi helped her to receive information about her child‚Äôs health every day. </p><p>  After the competition, <span>Prince Edward</span> presented this yacht as a gift for Marconi Guglielmo.  Until the end of his life, the inventor used this gift as his own floating laboratory. </p><h2>  Marconi Guglielmo: interesting facts </h2><p>  Literally 110 years ago, a data signal stepped across the English Channel.  After this successful operation, the inventor received the favor of the authorities and fame.  After 6 months of hard work, Marconi was able to increase the transmission distance of radio frequencies to 150 miles.  And in early 1901, he established wireless contact between settlements on the coast of England. </p>

    <p>  In 1902, the inventor transmitted a signal from west to east across the Atlantic.  Thanks to successful work and long trials, in 1907, the inventor opened his own company of the transatlantic data transmission service.  For hard work, Guglielmo and his friend Ferdinand Brown are awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. </p><h2>  Navy Commander </h2><p>  During the First World War, the inventor received several military missions, and was soon appointed to the post of commander of the Italian Navy.  Since, without proper education, it is impossible to fully manage the fleet, Marconi Guglielmo, whose inventions enabled him to manage the program for transmitting and receiving telegrams, used his skills during the war.  And after 10 years of hard work, Guglielmo establishes the first radiotelephone microwave connection. </p>
