If you like to collect seashells on the sea coast, and then do not know where to put them, then you will like this idea.  How to beautifully decorate a flower pot with your own hands?  Decorate it with shells.  For this purpose, not only smooth, but even cracked and damaged shells are suitable.  Let's start decorating.  Apply a primer to the surface of the pot.  You can use the material that is sold in stores for creativity, but keep in mind that the construction primer is practically no different from it.  Unless in it it is necessary to add white pigment to ennoble color.  Press the shells into the primer.  You can lay them out in a chaotic manner, or you can create a picture.  If you want to create a more natural version of the product, you do not need to tint the shells.  But if you like the avant-garde, you can pre-color the shells, and then lay out any drawing that you like. </p><h2>  Broken Tile Decor </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beaten shawl" class="if uuid-2421518" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2421518.jpg"></div><p>  Do you like mosaic?  Then decorate flower pots at home you will not be difficult.  You can decorate any container with broken tiles.  Before you start working with the material, you need to create a sketch.  You can find any image and edit it.  Now take the colored tile and pin it into squares.  If you decide to create flowers, you can make their petals from pieces of a rectangular shape with rounded edges.  Cut the tile with a special knife or use nippers.  When the workpieces are done, you can begin to work.  Coat the pot with a primer and begin to lay out the drawing.  Work needs to be carried out sequentially, laying out layer by layer.  Be sure to ensure that the pieces of the tile are buried equally.  Otherwise, the surface of the pot will be uneven, and therefore not very aesthetic.  When finished, let the product dry.  You can leave the pot in this form, or you can use the grout for the tiles and give the overhanging primer the desired shade. </p><h2>  Button decor </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="button decor" class="if uuid-2421520" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2421520.jpg"></div><p>  One of the very simple ways to decorate any product is to attach bright decorative elements to it.  For example, buttons.  How to decorate flower pots?  For this purpose you need to type the right material.  It is advisable to choose flat bright buttons of different sizes.  When the material is collected, you can begin to work.  Coat the surface of the pot with glue, and then apply buttons to it.  You can lay them out in a chaotic manner, pressing them tightly against each other.  Do you like this decor option?  Then you can create an image from the buttons.  For example, a landscape, portrait or decorative ornament.  To do this, you will need to draw a sketch in advance.  Decide what you want to see on the pot.  Perhaps it will be trees, or maybe flowers and birds?  Now break the image into elements.  According to this scheme, it will be easy to spread it.  To make your task easier, you can draw with a pencil a sketch directly on the pot itself.  What for?  The image on paper will be slightly different from what you plan to do.  Why?  For the reason that the pot has a bend, but the paper does not.  Fill the outline with buttons, and then erase the pencil lines. </p>
