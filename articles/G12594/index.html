Of course, in neither case can one fully guarantee the safety of things.  But if you insure them, then in the case of the bank it will be easier to get a cash equivalent.  We will talk more about this in more detail.  It should also be noted that a cell in a bank can provide not only anti-burglary, but also fire protection.  Also, when remodeling your home, you do not need to think about where to move the safe.  Also, a cell in a bank usually has two layers of protection, which allows it to withstand not only hacking, but also various cataclysms like a fire.

Another significant advantage is the organization of bank security.  So, a serious problem for potential attackers will be a separate room where the cells are located, as well as the fact that in which case a quick reaction detachment will be called up.

Therefore, to open someone else‚Äôs cell with dishonest employees and create the appearance of legality will not work.  It is also important that you can choose a store for the required size of the thing, indicate the lease term, and also take care of access to anyone who wants it if you wish.  Deposit boxes can also be the subject of even a <span>tripartite agreement.</span>  In such cases, the cell can only be opened if both partners are present.  It is also possible to draw up a cell for a legal entity.  This will allow you to pay for it at the expense of the enterprise, and only those employees who were previously designated as <span>proxies</span> can get access <span>.</span>  There must also be samples of their signatures.  In this way, unauthorized access to documents of great importance can be prevented. </p><h2>  How much does it take to remove safe boxes? </h2>

So, this is about 40-50 rubles per day (for a cell designed to store documents).  In order not to beat around the bush and guess on coffee grounds, let's turn to the country's largest financial institution - that is, Sberbank will help us.  Safe boxes in it fit into the range presented above.  If they cannot satisfy you in terms of size, then this financial institution will lease entire safes!  True, they have an appropriate price - starting from 100 rubles for one day, but the size is such that almost everything that is needed will fit.

Moscow, Ryazan, St. Petersburg, Vladivostok, Tver - it will be difficult here to come to the first branch of the bank and order a small store.  Therefore, the possibility of remote access is also popular.  It consists in the fact that a person who is looking for deposit boxes for his purposes, contacts the support service of a financial institution and is provided with information about where to use this service.  Moreover, the branches are indicated on the basis of how convenient it will be for the client to get to him to check the contents or pick it up. </p><h2>  What do banks offer their customers? </h2>

    <p>  So, if there is something valuable that you do not want to lose, then strangers may be present.  For example, an insurance agent whose task is to make sure that the client has really put the thing that is insured there.  And the fact that this is the original, not a fake.  Also, in order to regulate your visits and to avoid the ‚Äúunexpected‚Äù loss of things, visits will be recorded by a bank employee.  This, as a rule, applies to cases when a person wants to preserve ‚Äúwhite‚Äù jewelry or simply valuable things for himself (in such cases, moral damage is insured). </p><h2>  What is stored in safe deposit boxes? </h2><p>  As a rule, these are documents, jewelry, securities, money, works of art, photographs - in a word, everything that provides value to some person who has a desire to hide it.  There is a list of what is forbidden to be stored in safe boxes.  As a rule, this is understood as weapons, drugs, perishable food products (such as fish or meat).  According to the rules of banks, they are not entitled to mandatory verification of what is stored in the store.  But with each person an agreement is concluded, which stipulates that there will be nothing illegal and forbidden in the safe by the rules of a financial institution.  In order to ‚Äúmotivate‚Äù to act according to the rules, as a rule, it is stipulated that in case of breach of the contract a significant penalty will be imposed on the client, the amount of which ranges from tens to hundreds of thousands of rubles, and this is relative to those depositories that are accessible to ordinary citizens. </p><h2>  Unauthorized access </h2>

This implies that the person who rents the safe draws up a document according to which, besides him, access to the cell has a certain list of persons, which must be attached.  Admission conditions and a number of smaller nuances may also be prescribed. </li><li>  Access of bank employees.  Despite the fact that they have one key, if the client loses his own, then the only way to gain access to the cell is to crack it.  As a rule, this process consists in calling up a special wizard who, with the employee and owner of the contents, drills the lock (less often the safe itself cuts it). </li><li>  Access on behalf of a legal entity.  This option involves the preparation of a certain agreement with a certain company, which stipulates that a number of persons can access the contents of the storage.  Usually this option is used for documents, which are important for the functioning of the company.  Persons who have access are usually registered with the director, his deputy, chief accountant, as well as a number of other people. </li></ol><h2>  What does a citizen need to rent a cell? </h2>
