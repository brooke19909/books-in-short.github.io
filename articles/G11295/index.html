Thanks to this organ, which is the most complicated in its structure, we are able to observe and marvel at the whole variety of colors, which both occur in nature and are artificially created by people.  The importance of color is very high, and this fact has long been proven by psychologists.  Therefore, many designers, planners, artists, and all those whose work is at least a bit related to colorism, are greatly helped by Itten's color circles, making it easy to achieve harmony in all kinds of combinations of shades.  Even if a person does not work in these areas, knowledge of this tool will allow you to properly equip your home, successfully create your own clothing style, select appropriate accessories for each other, etc. </p><p>  <strong>Who is Johannes Itten?</strong> </p>

Want to know why Itten's color circles are so important?  It is known that when a person focuses his efforts on a subject for a long time, he inevitably becomes a professional in him.  So, Johannes Itten devoted his whole life to research on the topic of color, and for 50 years he taught the author‚Äôs course on this topic in the Bauhaus and European <span>private schools.</span>  He wrote the beautiful book ‚ÄúThe Art of Color‚Äù (1961), which became the basic textbook for everyone involved in colorization.  You must admit that all these facts indicate that the conclusions of this wonderful person are really worth reading.

    <p>  The construction principle begins with coloring the parts of the triangle and the donut sectors opposite its corners in three primary colors: yellow, red and blue.  They are basic, and all other shades are obtained from their combinations.  If you mix them in pairs, you get the colors of the second order: purple, orange and green.  They color the remaining parts of the hexagon, which Itten's color circles contain inside, as well as sectors opposite these vertices.  The last thing left to do is get the remaining shades in the empty parts of the outer circle.  This is achieved by mixing the tones of the sectors that are directly nearby. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="itten color wheel how to use" class="if" height="283" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7400/265209.jpg" width="424"></div>

Consider some of the most popular ways: </p><p>  1. Selection of a complementary <span>(optional) color.</span>  It is made by finding the main color on the outer ring and determining the shade, which is located opposite.  Such contrasting combinations look very harmonious and perfectly complement each other.  For example, orange and blue. </p><p>  2. The choice of a combination of three opposite colors.  It is produced by constructing an equilateral triangle with vertices in the sectors of the outer circle.  The resulting combination may seem quite bold, but in fact in fashion it looks very elegant. </p><p>  3. The combination of 3 adjacent colors.  Shades located in close proximity to each other are selected.  Such a combination is, compared with the previous one, more calm and restrained.  Example: fuchsia, blue, purple. </p><p>  4. The combination of three complementary colors.  This option is similar to the first one in that the main shade is also selected here first.  But instead of one supplementing it on the opposite side, two are taken, located next to it on both sides.  The solution is quite daring, but at the same time not as contrasting as when using the first method. </p><p>  As you can see, Itten's color circles are pretty easy to use.  Being the basis for almost any creativity, they allow you to select the most successful combinations, bringing to life even greater harmony and beauty. </p>
