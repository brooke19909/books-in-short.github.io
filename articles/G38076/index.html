Features of the local autumn</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Autumn <span>in the Dominican Republic</span> can be considered a transition period.  Prices are smoothly changing, from too low to very high, the temperature of air and water drops slightly, and the number of tourists increases sharply.  September in the Dominican Republic is still a very hot month, very humid and not quite acceptable for most tourists.  But closer to November, the weather becomes much nicer, and prices for accommodation and recreation are higher. </p><h2>  September heat </h2><p>  The first <span>autumn month</span> in this tropical country is not much different from a long summer.  September in the Dominican Republic is a period of heavy rain, cloudiness and windiness.  The column of the thermometer in this period still goes over the mark of 30, however, that summer heat, which lasted here the previous three months, is already gone.  Here at night it is very cool (so to speak), the temperature drops to 23-21 degrees.  For many tourists, September in the Dominican Republic is an unacceptable vacation option, since here at this time extremely high humidity.  Permanent showers, albeit short-term, have a very strong effect on atmospheric pressure, and this, alas, is far from everyone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="September in the Dominican Republic" class="if" height="280" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/478570.jpg" width="350"></div>

    <h2>  The sea is worth it to go here in the fall </h2><p>  But what really will please everyone during this period in the Dominican Republic is the sea temperature.  It is in September that the water warms up here more than in all other months.  During your stay in the sea, you get the feeling that you are taking a bath, because the local waves are warmed up to 32 degrees, and sometimes even more.  And even despite the fact that sometimes September in the Dominican Republic is windy, the water temperature does not decrease, it just gives vacationers more extreme and extraordinary.  By the way, it is thanks to the high and warm waves that you can windsurf here in early autumn.  If you are new to this sport, finding a suitable instructor will not be a problem.  Well, for professionals there is all the necessary equipment, which is rented both daily and hourly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dominican Republic in November" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/478572.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  High temperature drop </h2><p>  At the end of the first autumn month in this tourist country there is already a gradual decline in such high temperatures.  But the humidity remains at its level - the rains do not stop, they just only become less long.  In principle, the Dominican Republic at the end of September does not change, except that you can notice a slightly larger number of people on the beaches and in hotels.  And all because mid-autumn is the eve of the beginning of the swimming season in the country.  Tourists from the USA, Canada, as well as from many Latin American countries who prefer to relax in cooler conditions than their place of residence begin to come here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dominican Republic at the end of September" class="if" height="347" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/478569.jpg" width="580"></div>

    <h2>  The beginning of the tourist season </h2><p>  The hotels of this wonderful country are filled to capacity in the very middle of autumn - in October.  And this period the heat subsides, the amount of precipitation decreases, the clouds seem to fly apart and leave behind a clear and clear sky over the most famous resort areas of the region.  But at the same time, it is worth noting that the Dominican Republic in October is already an expensive pleasure, since all hotel owners increase room rental prices, many local delicacies become less accessible in restaurants, and travel in Dominican transport becomes more expensive.  Even plane tickets from Moscow to Punta Cana this month are much more expensive than in the summer or September. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Local coolness will not cool tourists </h2><p>  November is a cold and calm month in this region.  Of course, for a Russian tourist 27-29 in the afternoon and 19-21 at night - the temperature is quite normal for a good rest, however, locals believe that this period is extremely cold, and absolutely not suitable for swimming in the <span>Caribbean,</span> which, incidentally, is also cools down.  Paradoxically, the Dominican Republic officially opens the swimming season in November.  This is accompanied by an incredible increase in prices for accommodation, food, entertainment and other services used by tourists.  Vouchers for this period to this country are very expensive, even plane tickets can be said to reach their maximum price. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  In general, choose which autumn month is best to go on holiday to the Dominican Republic, of course, to you.  If you prefer heat, summer heat, scorching sun and unpredictability, then go there in September.  The weather will delight both with hot clear days and cloudy evenings, and sometimes with small hurricanes that will allow you to catch the highest waves on the board.  If you do not want to overheat under the southern sun, you will have to stock up with a lot of money and go to the Dominican Republic in November.  At the end of autumn there are no winds, no storms and rains.  The sea is always calm, calm, a little cool.  However, the number of tourists just rolls over, therefore you will have to choose a hotel, book a room and buy a plane ticket in advance.  But in general, rest in this country is pleasant and simply divine at any time of the year, regardless of the weather. </p>
