    <p>  Hotel <span>Induruwa Beach Resort 3 *,</span> located on the island, annually receives thousands of tourists from Russia who leave here with vivid impressions and promises that they will definitely return here next year. </p><h2>  Holidays in Sri Lanka </h2><p>  Indeed, a vacation on this wonderful island is a true relaxation.  That is why this tourist destination is so in demand among Russian tourists who are tired of the daily bustle, noise and din, reigning in large cities.  The islanders never make noise, and do not allow themselves any unnecessary movements, haste, fuss, etc. Of course, this does not apply to maintenance personnel.  They do everything quickly, but silently.  Indeed, for them, the convenience of guests is above all.  In addition, the weather is hot here for 12 months, the sun is shining, tropical evergreens grow, cool waterfalls rustle in the mountains, and the ocean is always warm and gentle - all this makes this area just the perfect place to relax.  Therefore, if you are a lover of all of the above, then, without hesitation, buy a tour to one of the comfortable hotels in Sri Lanka.  And it‚Äôs not necessary that it be 4- or 5-star.  Even in the good ‚Äútroika‚Äù you will find service at the highest level.  So, for example, in <span>Induruwa Beach Resort 3 * (Induruwa)</span> you will find impeccable service, delicious cuisine and a chic beach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="induruwa beach resort 3 sri lanka reviews" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/1072395.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Climate Sri Lanka </h2><p>  As already noted, the island is always warm, if not hot weather.  The average temperature is +29 degrees, and water in the ocean - up to +27.  However, as in any tropical country, there are two seasons here: dry and rainy.  Precipitation falls mostly in the summer months.  But from the end of October to the beginning of April, it is just perfect weather for a beach holiday.  However, if you bought a tour to the Induruwa Beach Resort 3 * hotel in the rainy season, then do not worry too much, because precipitation mostly falls at night, and in the morning the weather is already fine.  In addition, depending on the time of year, you need to choose among the resorts of the west and south (in winter) and east (in summer) coasts. </p><h2>  How to get to Sri Lanka from Russia? </h2><p>  There are no direct flights between the two capitals, Moscow and Colombo.  However, in season you can fly here with a transfer in Male, the Emirates, Qatar, etc. The approximate flight time is about 14 hours (if you take into account the time for connecting).  When you buy a tour at any of the country's hotels, you will be asked to pay a transfer from the airport to your destination.  By the way, holiday packages to 5-star hotels include delivery, but a ticket to a hotel of a category lower, for example, to 3 * Induruwa Beach Resort 3 stars, this service is not included, and you need to pay extra for it.  As a tip: it‚Äôs better to use this offer so that you don‚Äôt have any problems on arrival. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="induruwa beach resort 3 hinduwa" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/1072393.jpg" width="600"></div>

Here, tourists are waiting for incredible beauty of landscapes, wonderful white sand beaches, turquoise waters with an amazing underwater world, plus the opportunity to get acquainted with the life of the local rural population.  Until recently, there was only a fishing village on the site of this resort, and today there are beautiful hotels, well-groomed, but not without pristine beaches.  Nevertheless, families of fishermen continue to live in their modest dwellings and provide tourists with the opportunity to observe their lives.  Moreover, this area is located in close proximity to the city of Colombo (64 kilometers), which means that it is not far from civilization.  You can always go on a tour or shopping in the capital.  Every year, the popularity of this resort in the eyes of Russian tourists is increasing, which is associated with the ideal ratio of "price-quality".  Unlike many expensive tourist destinations, here you can relax with great comfort for a relatively low fee.  So, for example, in 3 * Induruwa Beach Resort the cost of the tour is from 90,000 to 100,000 rubles per person for 11 nights, and this despite the fact that 25% of the total amount is the cost of the ticket. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel induruwa beach resort 3" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/1072389.jpg" width="469"></div>

The distance from Colombo Airport to this hotel is about 70 km.  The four-story building Induruwa Beach Resort 3 * (Sri Lanka) (photo can be viewed in the article) is buried in a tropical evergreen garden with unusual beauty of exotic flowers.  Most rooms have ocean views.  Tourists from Russia are attracted by the consistently high quality of service, the friendly reception of the staff, and the atmosphere of comfort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sri lanka hotel induruwa beach resort 3" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/1072392.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  The hotel has 90 beautifully decorated and furnished rooms of two categories.  84 of them belong to the category of ‚Äústandard‚Äù and only 6 - ‚Äúsuites‚Äù.  All rooms have air conditioning (where without them, because the weather is hot and stuffy all year round), satellite TV, and, of course, a plasma TV, a telephone with direct international dialing, a minibar, a radio, a refrigerator, a set for making hot drinks (tea and coffee).  The bathroom is equipped with a shower, toilet, washbasin.  Toiletries and bath accessories (soap, shampoo, hair conditioner, towels) are constantly added, etc. Room service is available 24 hours a day (for a fee), cleaning is daily (do not forget to leave a tip). </p><h2>  Infrastructure and Services </h2><p>  At 3 * Induruwa Beach Resort, tourists will find a huge range of services that will make their stay in Sri Lanka comfortable, eventful and interesting.  To store valuables, guests can use the cells in the storage room, and for rented cars, secure parking is available.  By the way, the hotel also offers car, motorbike and bicycle rental.  For corporate guests who came here not only for a beach holiday, but also for business meetings, there is a business center, a conference room and a meeting room equipped with the necessary office equipment.  For the convenience of tourists, a shopping center operates on the territory of the hotel, where you can purchase clothes, groceries and all sorts of necessary things.  Laundry, dry cleaning, medical room, currency exchange, excursion bureau - all this is also available in this hotel, and this is not a complete list of services available in it.  The biggest plus is nevertheless the ayuvedic spa, where guests will feel complete relaxation, having received a wide range of spa services: wraps, various types of massage, natural masks, etc. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Depending on the type of tour package, tourists can receive the following types of food: BB (breakfast only), HB (half board) and ALL (three meals a day).  The spacious restaurant serves a buffet in the morning, but during the rest of the meal there is an √† la carte system, that is, dishes are prepared by prior order from the menu.  Here you will be treated to both fairly familiar dishes of European and exotic local cuisine. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="3 induruwa beach resort 3" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/1072390.jpg" width="583"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  The 3 * Induruwa Beach Resort provides a fun entertainment program for guests in the evenings.  Although in these parts noisy parties are not held in high esteem.  Of course, the hotel has a disco, both for children and adults, but this is not at all what we used to see, for example, in Thailand.  On the territory there is an outdoor pool with several slides, but guests, as a rule, prefer to swim in the sea rather than in it.  But there is a delightful bar serving fresh and <span>exotic cocktails.</span>  For lovers of outdoor activities, of course, there are plenty of sports opportunities: a gym, a soccer field, volleyball, ping-pong tables and billiards.  There is a playroom for the kids. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="induruwa beach resort 3 sri lanka photo" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/1072391.jpg" width="592"></div>

    <h2>  Induruwa Beach Resort 3 * (Sri <span>Lanka): reviews</span> and ratings </h2><p>  Unfortunately, not all reviews about the Hotel Induruwa Beach Resort are positive.  Tourists from Russia most often complain about the scarcity of breakfast.  There can be no talk of any buffet.  In the mornings, guests are given a choice between two dishes, and there are only a few snacks.  Dairy products are extremely rare, and this is becoming a big problem for families with children.  As for the service, then this is a complete order.  Only some guests complain about the unceremoniousness of the staff, who right before their eyes begin to recount the tip.  And everything else - the beach, entertainment, spa services, excursions - at the highest level.  This is evidenced by the grateful reviews of tourists who visited this, albeit modest, but very nice hotel. </p>
