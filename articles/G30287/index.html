Still, all wildlife lovers should visit them.  Water cascades are located only 30 km from Sudak and 65 km from Alushta.  The tourist route starts from the small village of Zelenogorye (Sudak district).  This village is surrounded by mountains on three sides.  Within walking distance is a picturesque mountain plateau, baptized by paths, gorges and mountain ranges.  It is here that the protected tract Panagia is located.  Crimea is a place where one day you can visit the mountains, green valleys and sandy beaches.  On the tract Panagia begins a hiking trail leading to the gorge.  During this walk you can see water cascades, rapids of a turbulent river and natural baths.  This place seems to be created for lovers of hiking and camping.  The trail is landscaped for tourists, in difficult places stairs with railings and railings are installed.  During this walk, travelers will be able to see with their own eyes a relict forest, a large waterfall and many small ones, a mountain lake and some other interesting natural sites.

The water in this natural pond is incredibly clean, you can even swim here in the warm season.  Going further along a mountain trail, you can admire the stormy river Arpat.  Its channel runs along the bottom of a small gorge, forming rapids and water cascades.  One of the main pearls of these places is the large Arpathian waterfall.  Its height is about 10 meters.  Water flows down into the ‚ÄúBath of Love‚Äù - a natural depression in the shape of a heart.  It is believed that these places should be visited in the spring, during the period of snowmelt or after heavy rains.  The river at this time becomes full-flowing, so water cascades look especially picturesque.

Only a person who passed such a test could become an Amazon husband. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Travel Tips </h2>

And yet, even a walk to them as part of a tourist group cannot be called a simple and safe walk.  The route runs along mountain trails.  And this means that this tour is recommended for adults and schoolchildren with the necessary stamina.  It is best to choose comfortable clothing and shoes to visit the area.  You can get to the tract Panagia and the Arpathian Falls on your own.  Near the conservation area there is a parking lot and a small cafe.  Some tourists prefer to relax in this area with tents.  No less interesting are day hikes.  It is almost impossible to get lost here, for the convenience of holidaymakers on the hiking trail there are direction signs to the main attractions.

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Green mountains arpathian waterfalls" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/1908341.jpg"></div>  A trip to the Arpathian Falls leaves no one indifferent.  You can stroll along the picturesque gorge, feeling your own unity with nature.  Lovers of outdoor activities prefer to bathe in natural baths.  It is worth noting that the Arpathian Falls (Crimea) have an average level of popularity among tourists.  If you go to them early in the morning, most likely, you will not meet a large number of people here.  Visiting the tract of Panagia and the Arpathian Falls is absolutely free today.  This route can hardly be called extreme, but still it will be difficult to overcome for children under 6-7 years old and elderly people.  It is advisable to take replacement shoes and a swimsuit with you on a trip to the waterfalls.  On a hot day there is nothing more pleasant than plunging into a cool mountain river.  Do not forget to take a camera.  Against the backdrop of fantastic natural landscapes and seething water cascades, the photos are very interesting.
