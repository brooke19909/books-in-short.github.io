It ends with the construction of the residential complex "Kantemirovsky."  We will provide reviews about it below. </p><h2>  Developer </h2><p>  The CDS group of companies (CC CDS) has been on the real estate market of the Leningrad Region for more than eighteen years.  She carries out construction work on a full cycle.  Today, the company is among the top five developers in the region in terms of rental housing.  Projects developed by the organization are in different market segments: from economy class apartments to luxury residential buildings and commercial buildings. </p><p>  The main mission of the developer is affordable housing.  It was this company that suggested the concept of full-fledged apartments of small footage, which would satisfy a buyer with modest income.  Almost all the <span>residential complexes of the</span> CC CDS have decent apartments at a low price with a mandatory balcony and a kitchen of 8 m <sup>2</sup> . </p><p>  In addition, the developer was the first in the region to switch from sealing to integrated construction, which makes it possible to create a comfortable living environment in the complex being built.  Vivid examples of such buildings - LCD "Pargolovo", "Murino" and "Kudrino".  The company is proud of each of its forty projects with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 3.5 million m <sup>2</sup> . </p>

But in any case, the floors and walls are made of porcelain tiles, the ceiling is painted.  The walls in the common corridors on all floors are covered with shagreen leather.  At the same time, the ceilings are painted, and on the floors - porcelain tiles. </p>

    <h2>  Checkout </h2><p>  For the convenience of customers in sales offices, schedules for viewing apartments have been compiled.  Based on its results, an act of construction readiness is drawn up, on the basis of which documents for the sale of the apartment are drawn up. </p><p>  A detailed list of documents is presented on the official website of the developer.  Phone numbers are also indicated on which you can contact the manager to clarify the information. </p><p>  In the case of an increase in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe purchased apartment compared to the declared, the owner is obliged to pay the missing amount by bank transfer (the terms are specified in the additional agreement).  If the area has decreased, then the developer of the residential complex ‚ÄúKantemirovsky‚Äù returns the difference to the current account specified in the contract with the owner. </p><p>  On the basis of the signed documents and mutual settlements, including payment of the service contract, keys are issued to the owner. </p><h2>  Post scriptum </h2><p>  New settlers are extremely active online.  A lot of reviews on the official portal of the developer and other sites.  Most of the residents talk about the repair, which was quick and easy thanks to the quality work of the construction crews. </p><p>  Acceptance of apartments was organized at a high level.  Payment of all bills passed through the application, which saved a lot of time. </p><p>  All doors, windows and various technical units are operational.  Many newcomers separately thank the developer for an even floor screed. </p><p>  Infrastructure in the residential complex "Kantemirovsky" is just getting better.  But construction is proceeding at such a pace that the residents of the new quarter are confident that the promised school, kindergarten, clinic, shops and shopping centers will open wide soon. </p><p>  Pleases the owners of apartments, even the smallest, the presence of a balcony.  An undoubted plus is the location of the complex, of course, this is not the city center, but also far from the outskirts. </p><p>  Slips in customer reviews and the theme of the cost of apartments.  Many people think that in Kantemirovsky the prices are very attractive, especially in comparison with the nearby complexes. </p><p>  A significant part of the new settlers noted in their reviews the reliability of the builder.  Some do not like the one-sidedness of two-room apartments of 52 m2. </p><p>  There are also negative points.  The transport situation is considered by residents of the complex rather complicated.  The nearest stop is almost half a kilometer away.  Any metro station is 1.5 km away.  And this, according to residents, is 25 minutes in an average step.  And, by the way, there is no metro station near this residential quarter, even in the long-term plans. </p><p>  The streets adjacent to the LCD are almost always in traffic jams, especially the Kushelevskaya road and Marshal Blucher ave.  Departure from Kantemirovsky is possible only on one side of the Kushelevskaya road going north.  That is, those who need to go in the opposite direction will need to overcome the entire overpass for a U-turn.  The situation will not be resolved until the city authorities extend beyond Bestuzhevskaya Street, which should pass along the northern border of the quarter.  But the timing of these works is unknown.  It is also unclear when the work to create an intra-quarter road network, sidewalks and bicycle paths will be completed. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews of the owners of the apartments, the developer in the brochures and on the website does not warn about the proximity of the concrete plant.  It is also unknown to buyers that the territory with a gas station, garages and a snow melting point adjoins the residential complex on the north side.  If you look at the map farther north, you can see the railway with the Theological Cemetery located behind it. </p><p> Also, few people know about future significant expenses before buying.  In addition to the surcharge for the increased area (this is prescribed in the contract), no one warns that, for example, to spend electricity in a one-room apartment costs about 12 thousand rubles, in a two-room apartment - 15 thousand. For a car place, you need to pay 500 thousand rubles, and then a thousand every month. </p><p>  Another topic of reviews is the conditions of purchase.  To purchase housing, you must join a housing cooperative.  The contract, signed at the same time, does not make it possible to make claims in case of non-compliance with the terms of settlement, transfer of keys or delivery of the object.  <span>The share fee is</span> equal to the cost of the purchased apartment.  Plus to this (it is spelled out in the contract), an entry fee (10 thousand rubles) is necessary, which, by the way, according to clause 5.5 of the contract is not returned under any conditions.  The amount of the target contribution varies from 11 800 to 22 400 rubles.  If a shareholder, for his reasons, terminates the contract, then the unit contribution returned to him is reduced by 15%. </p>
