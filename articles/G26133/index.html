Nearby attractions include the Temple of Apollo and the Acropolis.  Places worth visiting include the Yeni Hammam, Diagoras Stadium and the Kollakium district, and you will have to drive about 10 km.  Diagoras Airport is just a stone's throw away - a couple of minutes by car.  On the one hand, it is convenient, but on the other hand, no.  After all, residents of hotels almost around the clock hear the noise of taking off and landing aircraft.  It interferes with both sleeping and just relaxing.  The hotel windows offer a gorgeous view of the beautiful garden with exotic trees. </p><p>  The hotel has three stars.  It has 259 rooms, including standard rooms and studios.  There are no rooms for one person in the hotel. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  There is a reception, where you can always come up on any issue.  You will be politely served and solve your problems.  Guests among the positive moments of their stay at the hotel note that you can communicate in English and Russian, which is very convenient.  Near the hotel there is a free secure parking. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Margaret Hotel 3 * (Rhodes) reviews receive both positive and negative.  Many residents complain about the presence of cockroaches in the rooms.  They are trying to fight them, but so far without success.  Another indisputable minus of the hotel can be called poor soundproofing, because all the partitions are made of drywall.  In the evenings, people gather in the hotel lobby, there is a bar for everyone, even for those who do not live in the hotel.  They play billiards, music sounds, and everyone just talks loudly.  It lasts until late at night.  It is useless to complain to the administration, because they themselves often rest there. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>
