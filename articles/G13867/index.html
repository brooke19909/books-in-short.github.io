    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Of the negative aspects of living in this hotel, the most significant are the following: </p><ul><li>  it‚Äôs very inconvenient that there is no full-length mirror in the hallway; </li><li>  since the hostel is located in an ordinary apartment building, the walls are very thin with poor sound insulation (especially the elevator interferes); </li><li>  breakfasts are very modest - only oatmeal and pancakes; </li><li>  if you check into an individual double room, then bath and cosmetic accessories will be provided for only one guest (you will be offered to buy a second set); </li><li>  despite the general cleanliness, dirty window sills spoil the impression; </li><li>  it is very inconvenient that the hostel and the reception are in different places. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  We can say that the Aurora hotel is an attractive option for accommodation in Tyumen.  This is a budget hostel that compares favorably with institutions of this type.  Here, new and beautiful furniture, a full shared kitchen, as well as absolute cleanliness.  You can also relax in a pleasant friendly atmosphere.  It is important that smoking and drinking alcohol, as well as loud music in the hostel are strictly prohibited.  There is a full kitchen with all necessary appliances and utensils.  You will also enjoy unlimited tea and coffee. </p><p>  If we talk about the negative aspects of this hotel, then this is, of course, the location on the 11th floor of an apartment building.  If this is your first time in the city, then it will be difficult for you to find this place among the yards.  Another inconvenience is that the reception is in a completely different house.  And, of course, the biggest drawback is the breakfast.  It would be better if it were not included in the price at all.  For this money, each guest can afford something more than porridge and a bland pancake.  And the surcharge for the bath set for the second guest is completely beyond the scope of any hotel rules. </p>
