The best practices and innovations are constantly applied in the work, which allows creating unique living spaces for prosperity and development.  Management often claims to strive to recruit exceptionally strong and responsible employees, true fans of their field.  Here, professionals who love their work, are eager to constantly develop and learn, are interested in bringing best practices to their professional activities and company. </p><p>  A large number of employees are currently required at Glorax Development.

Work in a stable company, which is one of the leaders in the development market, a friendly working atmosphere, a developed corporate culture that focuses on the development of comprehensive cooperation, a modern and beautiful office located in the very center of the business capital - Moscow City. </p><h2>  Impressions of workers </h2><div class="photo" data-original="m.glorax.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Olympus" class="if uuid-2957721" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2957721.jpg"></div><p>  In the reviews of employees about the employer Glorax Development you can find a lot of positive.  In particular, those who have already managed to really work in this company note a well-established adaptation system for new employees.  Immediately you find yourself in an interesting, young and friendly team.  There is no dress code, which immediately makes the situation more comfortable.  In addition, the office is located very conveniently, in the immediate vicinity of the metro.  The whole salary is white, registration takes place in full accordance with labor legislation.  All conditions are created for comfortable work. </p><p>  Also, many are attracted by the opportunity to work with really interesting projects, a democratic atmosphere, an adequate team.  In the reviews of employees about Glorax Development LLC, many note that various privileges and motivating factors are provided for specialists.  In addition, bureaucratic issues are almost completely absent here.           ,         . </p><h2>  Negative </h2><p> It should be noted that there are a lot of negative reviews of employees about Glorax Development LLC.  They often complain that local leaders often do not have the slightest idea of ‚Äã‚Äãeither management or development, dreaming only of quickly finalizing them to retirement.  Because of this, the attitude towards everything is as superficial as possible, and in some cases openly disregard.  As a result, more or less professional employees strive to find a new place.  Because of this, poorly debugged business processes can be observed, in fact, all management is carried out in manual mode, and it is done incredibly poorly. </p><p>  In the reviews of employees about Glorax Development, a big minus is the constant staff turnover.  For example, they regularly seek out a specialist for the position of marketer, constantly updating vacancies. </p><p>  Also, many consider the lack of a voluntary health insurance policy to be a clear drawback.  In addition, in reviews of employees about Glorax Development you are surprised to learn that many people in employment encounter a situation in which the HR department and personnel search specialists work extremely poorly.  The interview is held in a torn and nervous pace, after which they promise to call back the next day, in reality, you have to wait for an answer much longer, while experts do not answer calls and emails. </p><h2>  Customer reviews </h2><div class="photo" data-original="novostroika78.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Review company Glorax Development" class="if uuid-2957718" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2957718.jpg"></div><p>  More and more customers of this company are interested in feedback on the developer Glorax Development, as recently proposals for objects of this company can be met more and more often.  Those who have already encountered their work, note that hardworking professionals work here. </p><p>  Reasonable doubts are caused by the fact that a young and little-known developer immediately started implementing several large objects.  This always looks suspicious, since there is a chance that it will simply not be possible to realize all the projects on time due to the lack of proper experience and resources. </p><p>  At the same time, the company, through its work, is trying to persistently refute all claims of skeptics.  In reviews of the developer Glorax Development in St. Petersburg, it is often emphasized that, despite doubts and concerns, the company is delivering most of its facilities on time, does not have problems with their implementation at a time when many around it say that the crisis and not the season . </p><p>  As a positive point, potential residents of the houses that this company is building underline that it is fulfilling its obligations to design and build social facilities.  The construction of schools and kindergartens begins in a predetermined time frame, which, ultimately, should attract new interest holders and buyers, since residential areas with full social infrastructure look much more attractive than residential buildings located far from these important facilities. </p><h2>  Negative opinions </h2><p>  The fact that the developer is young and not very well known leads to a lot of negative reviews about Glorax Development. </p><p>  For example, they note the poor quality of work.  Almost all the materials specified in the agreement on shared participation in the construction were replaced by unequal.  As a result, the final result turned out to be several orders of magnitude simpler and cheaper than the originally promised object.  All this leads to negative reviews about the developer Glorax Development, some of which directly accuse him of fraud and outright dishonesty. </p><p>  If we talk about specific objects, you can meet many opinions about one of the very first projects of the company - the English Mile residential quarter.  In reviews of Glorax Development in St. Petersburg, residents and real estate investors emphasized that many of them frankly regretted that they decided to contact this residential complex.  Although it was built without delay and on time, immediately after it unforeseen problems began.  Due to numerous errors in the documents for a long time they could not put on the cadastral register ready-made buildings.  As a result, the residents were not able to draw up their ownership right for a sufficiently long time.  In addition, the very quality of construction left much to be desired. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews of Glorax Development, the problems of the new settlers began to arise regularly.  Condensation constantly accumulated on the ceiling, the walls were wet, in almost every apartment there was a violation of SNiPs.  Under the guarantee, the developer is obliged to eliminate all defects identified even after settlement.  In practice, this is done for a very long time - it takes two to three months for each part.  In addition, the company imposes its own management company in new buildings.  As many believe, this is done so that it by all means conceals the shortcomings made during the construction. </p><p>  As a result, many equity holders simply refused to sign acts of transfer and acceptance of apartments until all deficiencies were eliminated in them.  At first, in the houses of this residential complex there was no electricity and water, the elevator did not work, which made the start of the repair campaign extremely difficult. </p><p>  Summing up, we can conclude that the main disadvantage of this company remains its low fame, as it has been operating in this market quite recently.  But the reputation in development is one of the key factors. </p>
