    <h2>  TC "Zyablikovo" </h2><p>  <span>This shopping center is located very close to the Oblaka complex at the address: Orekhovy Boulevard, building 24. Zyablikovo shopping center consists of two buildings.</span>  <span>The shopping center has over 30 stores.</span>  <span>On the third floor there are several fast food enterprises.</span>  <span>Reviews about the shopping center, as well as about the one described above, are mostly negative.</span>  <span>However, it is worth saying that residents of Moscow extremely rarely share positive emotions regarding a particular complex, <span>cafe, restaurant.</span></span> </p><h2>  Zyablikovo District </h2><p>  <span>This is a pretty picturesque area.</span>  <span>Perhaps that is why it is the most densely populated in Moscow.</span>  <span>According to 2017, more than 130 thousand people live here.</span>  <span>Like many other areas located outside the Garden Ring, Zyablikovo arose on the site of the village of the same name.</span>  <span>In the northwestern part of it - where today beautiful tall buildings rise, once there was the village of Borisovo.</span>  <span>In the rest of the territory there were wastelands.</span> </p><p>  <span>The village of Zyablikovo was located in a deep ravine, where today Guryevsky passage and Voronezhskaya street are located.</span>  <span>The village, blooming garden strawberries, was demolished in the early eighties.</span>  <span>This place after the collapse of the USSR for several years was a rather bleak picture resembling a garbage can.</span>  <span>Gradually, the area was improved.</span>  <span>Already at the beginning of the two thousandth situation has changed.</span>  <span>Zyablikovo became one of the most prestigious sleeping areas of Moscow.</span> </p>
