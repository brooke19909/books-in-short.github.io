More than once, the country is in first place in the ranking of the best standard of living.  The climate here is temperate, despite the fact that in the north of the state in winter a polar night prevails.  The country is famous not only for its pristine nature, but also for many interesting places. </p><h2>  Border town of Imatra </h2><p>  The sights and nature of this village are sung by many poets in verses.  This city was interesting even to Catherine the Great.  Imatra in 1743 became part of the Russian Empire.  However, the settlement became truly popular only in the 19th century, when rich residents of St. Petersburg began to come here. </p><p>  The city itself is located only 7 kilometers from the border with Russia, the nearest city is Svetogorsk.  That is why there are most Russian tourists here. </p><p>  The settlement itself received the status of a city only in 1971.  About 30 thousand people live here.  Railway communication between the Russian and Finnish cities appeared back in 1960, and 10 years later a highway was built.  In the 90s of the last century, they began reconstruction of the <span>border crossing</span> and created a modern automobile checkpoint, however, it only started working in 2002, and a 24-hour schedule has been established since 2006. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.alarabiya.net" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.alarabiya.net/ar/arab-and-world/2016/12/04/%D9%85%D9%82%D8%AA%D9%84-3-%D9%86%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A5%D8%B7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%82-%D8%B1%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%B5-%D8%A8%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D9%81%D9%86%D9%84%D9%86%D8%AF%D8%A"><img itemprop="image" alt="Border with Imatra" class="if uuid-2443524" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2443524.jpg"></div><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Imatra is a fairly modest settlement, even by the standards of Finland.  But the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city is quite large, it occupies about 191 square meters.  This is due to the fact that most of the territory is occupied by forests and a lake. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The most popular ski resort in Finland among the Russian population is Myllymaki.  Located between the cities of Imatra and Lappeenranta.  The longest descent is 600 meters.  And the height differences are up to 70 meters.  Only four descents, there is a children's.  There is also the opportunity to snowboard in a designated place.  And travelers who are not quite sure about skiing are given the opportunity to enjoy a snowmobile safari and even play golf on ice or go fishing in the winter. </p><p>  And this is not the only ski resort in the area, another 20 kilometers is working - Freeski.  The height of the slope is 500 meters, 6 runs and 2 lifts.  Here you can ride a sleigh. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hotellirento.fi" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.hotellirento.fi/recreation/in-winter/item/79-ski-resorts"><img itemprop="image" alt="ski resort" class="if uuid-2443512" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2443512.jpg"></div><h2>  Relaxation </h2><p>  The sights of Imatra and Finland are not only ski resorts.  The magic world water park operates in the city, where you can see a unique man-made phenomenon - the effect of thunder and rain on the territory of the Imatran Kulpulia hotel complex. </p><p>  The water park itself has warm water, a large and a small pool, activities for children, a Turkish bath and a traditional Finnish sauna. </p><p>  In addition to the water park in the city there is a water center "Imatra Kulpula Spa".  There is not only water fun, but also the opportunity to sunbathe, visit the gym and play table tennis.  The complex offers all kinds of wellness treatments: from herbal baths to acupuncture. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.hrs.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="City Central Hotel" class="if uuid-2443530" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2443530.jpg"></div><h2>  Waterfall </h2><p>  There is a main attraction in the city of Imatra - a waterfall that works on schedule.  Back in 1929, a hydroelectric station was built.  Today it is not only an enterprise for the generation of electric energy, but also a place where tourists come.  The water is drained exclusively during the summer season (from June 08 to August 25, at 19:00 and on Sundays at 15:00) and lasts only 20 minutes.  When the dam opens, tons of water fall into the canyon and all this happens against the background of Sibelius music.  According to tourists, this is a great sight to see.  In the old days, this waterfall was natural; Catherine II herself came to see it. </p><p>  If you could not get here in the summer, then do not get upset.  During the New Year holidays, a beautiful show with illumination and fireworks is held here. </p><p>  The waterfall is surrounded by a reserve and monuments: hydroelectric turbines, the Virgin Imatra (located at the <span>bridge piers)</span> and others. </p><p>  By the way, the monument "Virgin of Imatra" is the only monument to suicides in the whole world who have taken their own lives.  And it stands not just near the hydroelectric power station bridge, it was here that after the dam was built, many people committed suicide, even Russian tourists.  Around 1972, it was just the peak of the arrival of Russian tourists who committed suicide on the bridge.  It was then that they stopped selling one-way tickets: from St. Petersburg to Imatra, but the restrictions were soon lifted. </p><div class="photo" data-original="angi-findingfinland.blogspot.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://angi-findingfinland.blogspot.com/2011/08/little-about-imatra.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="Imatra Waterfall" class="if uuid-2443487" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2443487.jpg"></div><h2>  Kruununpuisto Park </h2><p>  Photo sights of Imatra (reserve) always turn out beautiful.  After all, this is the oldest reserve in the whole country.  It was founded during the reign of Nicholas I in 1842.  Even then, the aristocracy of Russia came to the waterfall to rest, and therefore it was decided to establish a park in the district. </p><p>  Today the reserve is located in the very center of the city.  On its territory, it was possible to preserve the site where a real <span>Karelian forest</span> grows with moss and boulders.  Rocks remained, the potholes of which were formed in the ice age. </p><p>  In the park you can sit in the pavilions that were built during the reign of Nicholas I and which allow you to have a picnic.  In addition, the territory is the only hotel in the whole country, built in the form of a castle.  It is called Imatran Valtionhotelli. </p><p>  According to tourists, this is a great place to relax.  There are many signs, so even without a guide you can‚Äôt get lost. </p><h2>  Church of the Three Crosses </h2><p>  This attraction of Imatra is one of the most unique.  Although the church was built relatively recently, in 1957.  It is unique not only because of its architectural form, but because 3 crosses are installed on the altar, which is why the church got its name.  This is a peculiar symbol of Mount Calvary with crosses.  The building itself has more than 100 windows, of which only two are of the same shape.  This approach of the architect made it possible to get unique lighting inside. </p><p>  According to travelers, this place should be visited, but it is worth remembering that all services are conducted in Finnish. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hiveminer.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of the Three Crosses" class="if uuid-2443504" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2443504.jpg"></div><h2>  The only Orthodox church </h2><p>  Not far from the Three Crosses church is another attraction of Imatra - the only Orthodox church in the city of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker.  It is also relatively young, erected in 1956.  Initially, it was conceived and built as a chapel, but in the 80s it was re-consecrated to the church. </p><p>  The building was created in a restrained style, has wooden decor and a bell tower.  Inside, everything is arranged as it should be an Orthodox shrine, there is a traditional altar and icons.  However, there are no shrines in the church. </p><p>  According to tourists, the church is attractive because it is located in a picturesque place, where in the warm season the whole district is surrounded by greenery. </p><div class="photo" data-original="elevation.maplogs.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The only Orthodox church" class="if uuid-2443496" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2443496.jpg"></div><h2>  Museums </h2><p>  Despite the fact that Imatra is a fairly small town, there are many museums, interesting and beautiful places in it and in the district. </p><p>  One of the most visited attractions of Imatra is the Karelian House Museum.  It is located in the suburbs of Pyassiniemi on the banks of the Vuoksa River.  This is an open-air museum where you can find out how the ancient Finns lived, what their way of life was, what they were interested in and what kind of houses they built.  You can visit the museum from May to August. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="61.1695977" data-lng="28.764546300000006" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="11"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/2/8/3/5/2835.png"></div><p>  There are sights of Imatra in winter, which can also be visited.  In addition to spas, it is a fine art museum in the very center of the city.  Most of the exposition consists of works by Finnish artists who created in the last century.  In summer, it is recommended to visit the Lammassaari Island beach, where you can not only take water and sun baths, but also organize a picnic, for this special places are provided on the shore. </p>
