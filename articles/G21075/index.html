    <p>  Horizontal dispersion depends on the phase inverter.  It is mainly used in frontal type.  The subwoofers of the model are used with various parameters.  On average, the sensitivity should not exceed 80 dB.  Microchips for speakers are used with regulators.  Resistors for devices are selected on two terminals.  To enhance the sound, capacitors are used. </p><p>  Emitters are often installed midrange series.  The vertical dispersion parameter is usually in the region of 50 degrees.  The energy consumption indicator depends on the power of the bass reflex.  A two-channel horn is rarely installed.  For the receiver, these <span>speakers</span> are not the best way.  The maximum crossover frequency is on average 130 Hz.  Various filters are used to combat harmonic vibrations.  In the store, high-quality two-way passive speakers are sold at a price of 63 thousand rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Multiband models </h2><p>  Multiband devices are used for home theaters.  They are also great for mixers.  Acoustic selection should begin with the performance of the device.  The power parameter is on average 150 watts.  Harmonic distortion protection is not installed on all devices.  Special attention should be paid to the sensitivity of the bass reflex.  As a rule, this parameter lies within 70 dB. </p><p>  To connect the system, the RA and PC connectors are used.  Good bass is primarily provided by the <span>subwoofer.</span>  <span>The amplifier for</span> him is more appropriate to select immediately with a filter.  Phase inverters on the model are installed different.  To improve the sound quality, some manufacturers use a vibration isolation layer.  The horizontal dispersion index is on average 30 degrees.  Electricity consumption largely depends on the power of the speaker system. </p><p>  Emitters for devices are selected series midrange.  12 cm speakers for a home cinema will work great.  Chips are used with a thyristor unit.  For receivers, multi-band modifications are rarely used.  A removable grill on models is welcome.  The case is more appropriate to choose with a Kevlar coating.  You can buy a quality model on the market at a price of 75 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Floor models </h2><p>  Floor standing devices are suitable for home theaters as well as personal computers.  The choice of acoustics is better to start with an examination of the parameters.  However, the appearance of the device also plays an important role.  If you look at a simple model, then the power must be in the region of 40 watts.  The horizontal dispersion of a good system is 20 degrees.  The average electricity consumption is 300 V. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  To combat harmonic distortion, directional filters are used.  The PAC system is not used on all models.  Due to it, the bass quality is significantly improved.  Subwoofers on devices are installed with sensitivity from 50 dB.  Coating is most often used lacquer type.  Labyrinth systems are not common.  The adapter for the model must be with a speaker.  To connect the device, connectors of various diameters are used.  The most common is a <span>linear output of</span> 3.5 mm.  Devices with emitters of the midrange series are in great demand.  The sound quality is quite high.  However, it is important to consider the high cost of goods.  Models with CH emitters are produced without phase inverters. </p><p>  The threshold conductivity parameter for them is not more than 4 microns.  Amplifier matching usually takes a lot of time.  Also, models often have problems with harmonic distortion.  The horizontal dispersion in the devices is about 40 degrees.  Cases are made of plywood and fiberboard.  The maximum crossover frequency, as a rule, does not exceed 120 Hz.  The user is able to buy a high-quality floor model of low power at a price of 35 thousand rubles. </p>
