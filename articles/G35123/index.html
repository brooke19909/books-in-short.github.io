Technical staff constantly cleaned up, collected garbage, looked after the garden.  Tourists noted a quick check-in.  Sometimes rooms were provided earlier than the time set by the administration.  Many were unsatisfied with the inflated prices in the hotel bar. </p><p>  Parents praised the location of the hotel.  The mountains could be seen from the windows.  The abundance of greenery visually cut off nearby buildings.  It was always quiet at night.  No loud music and animation. </p>
