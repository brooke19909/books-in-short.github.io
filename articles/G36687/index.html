This language is the largest of the representatives of the Indo-European family of linguistics of the German group.  More than 400 million people on planet Earth consider English their native language.  And more than 1 billion people speak this language as an additional language.  The vocabulary of the English language is considered one of the largest and has more than 800,000 words.  But, despite the uniqueness and uniqueness of the English language, its grammar has all the same norms, <span>parts of speech,</span> language rules and nuances as other languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the world. </p><p>  A verb in any language is a unique part of speech that defines any action that will be performed, is being performed at the moment, or has already been committed in the past. </p><p>  A verb in English is a specific part of speech that shows possession, action, and the presence and condition of an existing subject. </p><p>  The <span>verb in the English language</span> has several characteristics: </p><p>  1. Time.  This characteristic shows when a condition or action that is described by a given verb occurs. </p><p>  2. Pledge.  This characteristic is used to identify the dependence of the action itself on the performer of this action. </p><p>  3. The view.  This characteristic shows whether this action is completed or is still being performed. </p><p>  4. Inclination.  <span>The mood of the verb</span> helps to identify the speaker's attitude to the given verb and determine the type of <span>sentence, narrative</span> or indicative. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Irregular verbs occupy a large niche in the English vocabulary.  Many of these verbs are the participle form of the past tense, and the simple form of the <span>past tense,</span> which are formed not according to the rules, past participle and past simple. </p><p>  Other formulations of irregular verbs in the vocabulary of the English language are formed according to general rules.  The form from a single person and the third number in the present tense with the endings ‚Äìs and ‚Äìes, as well as the participles of the present tense with the endings ‚Äìing, are formed according to generally accepted laws. </p><p>  Defective English verbs can also be attributed to the group of exceptions, defective verbs.  These are such irregular verbs that lack some conjugations, for example, in some moods or tenses.  These verbs include: shall / should, must, can / could, will / would, ought to, may / might. </p><p>  Many irregular English verbs are native words of the English language.  They originate from the ancient English language old English.  But there are many exceptions to this series, for example, foreign-language words.  Thus, from the French language from the word cachier came the word catch. </p><p>  Irregular verbs are always a significant problem for people who learn this language, as they are widely used in everyday English vocabulary.  If you select the ten most used verbs from the English language, they will be incorrect. </p><p>  Most of the words borrowed from foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äãand newly formed verbs, as well as verbs that are nouns but are used in a different capacity, are considered regular verbs.  All forms of this kind of verb form by adding standard endings and suffixes. </p><p>  Almost all known irregular verbs of the English language are formed according to the old rules, and earlier in the ancient language they were considered correct. </p><p>  Irregular English verbs can be divided into several types depending on the way the forms are formed: </p><p>  1. The vowel is fundamentally changing to the sound "o". </p><p>  2. The vowel fundamentally changes to the sound ‚Äúou‚Äù. </p><p>  3. Vowels do not change. </p><p>  In order not to get confused in the pronunciation of the verbs right and wrong and not make mistakes, irregular verbs need to be remembered. </p>
