Once upon a time, even with our grandmothers, such jewelry was held in high esteem.  They have always been considered the central part of the entire outfit and impressed with their splendor.  Currently, the brooch made of beads has again become very popular.  They pin her on dresses, jackets and even handbags.  Bead brooches are able to give a new sound to the most familiar and ordinary thing and cope with this task much better than any other jewelry.  Nothing will enliven an outfit like beaded brooches made of beads.  Schemes are not required here, on the contrary, in such a work it is worthwhile to show your personal imagination as much as possible.  There should be many similar accessories.  So why not get the maximum pleasure from the creative process, as well as save a lot of money and time and not create magnificent brooches from beads yourself? </p><p>  To perform such work, two types of wire will be required - thick, for the frame, and thin, for the rest of the weaving.  Nippers and pliers will also be required to cut and form the necessary curls.  Any pebbles, multi-colored beads and beads can serve as decoration.  Everything at hand.  And of course, when creating a brooch from beads, you need to stock up with a <span>safety pin.</span> </p><p>  Having prepared everything you need, you can begin to create a brooch from beads.  Schemes or basic ideas must first be reproduced on paper in order to follow them approximately.  The main thing in this work is the creation of a base from thick wire, on which the remaining jewelry will be attached.  Its configuration can be made in the form of anything.  By bending the wire, you can give it a shape, for example, a treble clef, or just a flower.  The main thing here is to bend the ends of the wire well, so that later they could not catch on clothes.  Having achieved the necessary configuration of the base, you can begin to decorate the brooch from beads.  To do this, it is necessary to fix one end of a thin wire on it and stringing various beads and beads on it, to braid the frame.  When doing this work, the thin wire needs to be tightly tightened, so it will not only decorate the brooch from beads, but also give its design even more rigidity.  All jewelry is wound on only one side, leaving the back side smooth.  Smaller beads and beads are located in the lower layer, and several large stones are attached on top, giving the brooches a bright accent.  The remaining end of the thin wire is trimmed and attaches well to the base.  If the result of the work done is completely satisfactory, it remains to fix the safety pin with a thin wire on the frame of the brooch.  Show all your imagination, experiment!  You can cover the stones with varnish and sprinkle with sparkles, or you can add elements of fabric, velvet and leather to them. </p><p>  Such work will take no more than thirty minutes.  Having created the first product, it will be difficult to stop.  Necessarily there will be new ideas and ideas that require immediate implementation.  You can come up with several basic forms, picking up stones and beads of different colors to them.  Then in the jewelry box there will be many different brooches for any occasion and for any outfit.  Nowadays, there are no strict rules in this regard and the only thing worth remembering is that donning a chic bead brooch does not need to overload your image with additional jewelry.  This product loves to be in the very center of global attention and will not want to share it with anyone. </p><p>  Add a riot of bright colors to your life by creating a magnificent brooch from beads, and remember that originality has always been highly valued! </p>
