This republic had two stages in history.  The first of them began shortly before the Great Patriotic War.  At the very end of 1936, a new Stalinist constitution was adopted.  It contained the provisions according to which the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Region was withdrawn from the North Caucasus Territory.  So the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was formed, then the decoding of the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic became known. </p><p>  Shortly after the outbreak of World War II, an insignificant part of this region was occupied by German troops, and remained in this position throughout 1942 and 1943. </p><div class="photo" data-original="likorg.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Deportation of Chechens" class="if uuid-2941820" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2941820.jpg"></div><p>  In 1944, one of the most unpleasant pages in the history of Chechens and Ingushs opened, when the authorities officially accused them of collaborationism.  They were suspected of deliberate and voluntary cooperation with the enemy to the detriment of their state and in its interests.  As a rule, this term is used in a narrower sense, implying cooperation with the occupiers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As a punishment for <span>this, the local population</span> was massively deported to Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan as part of the Lentil operation.  And in March of the same year, the Chechen-Ingush Republic was abolished, and the decryption of the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was temporarily forgotten.  As a result, the Grozny district appeared, which became part of the Stavropol Territory.  The structure of the Dagestan Republic included Nozhai-Yurtovsky, Vedensky, Cheberloevsky, Sayasanovsky, Sharoyevsky and Kurchaloevsky areas.  By decision of the Presidium of the RSFSR, the district was abolished, and the former territory of the republic became the Grozny region.  The abolition of the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was officially approved by a decision of the Presidium of the Supreme Council; its mention was excluded from the 1937 constitution. </p><h2>  Second Life </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Grozny region" class="if uuid-2941815" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2941815.jpg"></div><p>  In fact, the second life of the republic began shortly after the death of Stalin, in 1957.  It was restored by decrees of the <span>presidiums of the Supreme Councils of the Soviet Union</span> and the RSFSR.  It is noteworthy that this time it was formed in significantly larger boundaries than during the abolition.  In particular, it included the Shelkovsky and Naursky districts, which were transferred in 1944 to the Grozny region from the Stavropol Territory.  Mostly the Russian population lived there.  It is interesting that the Prigorodny district, which was previously part of it, remained within the borders of North Ossetia.  After restoration, the <span>area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe republic</span> amounted to 19,300 square kilometers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The decision of the Presidium was approved by the Supreme Council in February 1957, the corresponding article was returned to the Soviet Constitution.  It issued the restoration of the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. </p><h2>  Mass riots </h2><p>  It should be noted that the situation in the region remained extremely tense.  For example, in the mountains.  Terrible Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in August 1958 there were riots, which lasted about a week.  The reason for them was murder on a national basis.  It all started with a fight between representatives of different nationalities. </p><p>  On August 23, in a suburb of Grozny, where the workers at the local chemical plant mainly lived, a Chechen company, which included one Russian guy, drank alcohol.  There was a quarrel between them during the feast.  Chechen Lulu Maltzagov stabbed in the stomach of Russian Vladimir Korotchev.  After that, the company went dancing to the House of Culture.  There was another conflict.  This time with the factory workers Ryabov and Stepashin.  Stepashin was beaten, inflicted five stab wounds, from which he died.  There were many witnesses around who called the police.  The suspects were detained.  At first glance, the domestic crime received publicity due to interethnic tension.  All this led to actions against the Chechen population. </p><p>  Rumors of the murder of a factory worker spread quickly.  The youth reacted unusually violently.  The killers were demanded to severely punish, but the authorities did not react to this at all.  The situation was aggravated by the general political and economic situation in the country, causing Chechens to behave towards Russians. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  On August 25, workers asked to organize an official farewell at the factory club, but authorities considered this inappropriate, fearing a further aggravation of the situation.  Farewell was organized in the garden in front of his bride's house.  It turned into a mass protest rally, spontaneous actions began near the coffin of Stepashin.  Everyone demanded that measures be taken to stop hooliganism and killings by the Ingush and Chechens. </p><h2>  Speeches against the Soviet government </h2><p>  On August 26, a mourning rally was banned.  Then a group of 200 people moved to Grozny with the coffin of the deceased.  He was supposed to be buried in the city cemetery, the road to which went through the city center.  It was planned to stop near the building of the regional committee and hold a mourning rally there.  Many people joined the procession.  Gradually, the procession turned into an anti-Chechen demonstration.  Authorities blocked the passage to the center of the mountains.  Terrible Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic.  However, the cordon was broken. </p><p>  In the evening, the aggressive part of the crowd broke into the building of the regional committee, staged a pogrom in it.  It was possible to suppress the riots only in the evening of August 27, when troops were brought into the city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ghalghay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ingush rally" class="if uuid-2941814" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2941814.jpg"></div><p>  Once again, the situation escalated in 1973, when a rally of Ingush continued for several days in Grozny, demanding that the issue of territorial rehabilitation be resolved, for example, to return the Prigorodny district, which was inhabited by just the Ingush, to the republic.  The rally was dispersed by troops using water cannons. </p><h2>  The collapse of the republic </h2><div class="photo" data-original="deskgram.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Areas of the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic" class="if uuid-2941816" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2941816.jpg"></div><p>  The events that began in 1990 led to the next disintegration of the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, this time final.  The Republican Supreme Council adopted a declaration of state sovereignty.  In May 1991, amendments were made to the constitution, confirming the formation of the Chechen-Ingush Soviet Socialist Republic. </p><p>  In June, at the initiative of Dzhokhar Dudaev, delegates of the First Chechen National Congress gathered in Grozny to proclaim the formation of a nationwide congress of the Chechen people.  Almost immediately after that, the Chechen Republic of Nokhchi-cho was proclaimed, the leaders of the Supreme Council were declared usurpers. </p><h2>  Aggravation of the situation </h2><p>  The August events in Moscow became a catalyst for a socio-political explosion.  After the failure of the Emergency Committee, there were demands for the resignation of the local Supreme Council, the holding of new elections.  Supporters of Dudaev took parliament, a television center. </p><p>  During the capture of the Supreme Council, a meeting of the parliament was held in it, which was assembled in its entirety, including consultations with business leaders and the local clergy.  Dudaev and his supporters decided to take the building by storm.  It began about a quarter of an hour after the capital‚Äôs emissaries left the Supreme Council. </p><p>  As a result, about forty deputies were beaten, the separatists threw the window of the chairman of the city council of Grozny Kutsenko.  Then he was finished off in the hospital. </p><p>  Moreover, in fact, the structures of legal authority in the republic remained for several months after the completion of the coup.  For example, the regional State Security Committee and the police were abolished only at the very end of 1991.  The prosecutor of the republic spent about a week in the basement, who was captured by the rebels when he called Dudaev‚Äôs actions illegal. </p><p>  After negotiations with the participation of Khasbulatov, who at that time was the acting chairman of the Supreme Council of the RSFSR, a provisional authority was formed - the Provisional High Council. </p><p>  On October 1, it was officially announced the division of the republic into the Chechen and Ingush. </p><h2>  Administrative division </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.avtonomer.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Residents of the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic" class="if uuid-2941818" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2941818.jpg"></div><p>  After the formation of the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, the republic included 24 districts and one city of regional subordination - Grozny.  In 1944, Novogroznensky and Goragorsky districts were created, which were then liquidated in 1951. </p><p>  After the restoration of the region in 1957, it included only 16 districts and two cities of republican subordination.  The second after Grozny was Malgobek. </p><p>  In 1990, there were already five cities of republican subordination in the republic - these were Grozny, Nazran, Gudermes, Malgobek and Argun.  There were also 15 districts of the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic.  These are Achkhoy-Martan, Vvedensky, Grozny, Gudermes, Itum-Kalinsky, Malgobek, Nadterechny, Naursky, Nazranovsky, Nozhay-Yurtovsky, Sunzhensky, Urus-Martanovsky, Shalinsky, Shatoevsky, Shelkovsky. </p><h2>  Population </h2><div class="photo" data-original="wsport.su" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Restoration of the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic" class="if uuid-2941819" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2941819.jpg"></div><p>  The <span>population of the Chechen-Ingush</span> Autonomous Soviet <span>Socialist</span> Republic increased throughout the entire 20th century.  If in 1939 about 700 thousand people lived on the territory of the republic, then in 1959, shortly after the restoration of the region, the number of local residents remained at about the same level. </p><p>  According to the results of the 1970 census, more than one million people have already settled in the republic; the peak was reached by 1979, when one million 153 thousand residents lived in the republic.  According to the 1989 census, one million 275 thousand people were in Chechen-Ingushetia. </p><h2>  National composition </h2><p>  As of 1959, most of the local residents were Russian, about 49 percent, against 34 percent of Chechens.  The situation changed dramatically in 1970, when about 48% of Chechens already lived and 34.5% of Russians remained. </p><p>  In 1989, almost 58% of Chechens, 23% of Russians, about 13% of Ingush, a little more than one percent of Armenians lived on the territory of the republic. </p><h2>  The terrible </h2><div class="photo" data-original="varlamov.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="City Grozniy" class="if uuid-2941835" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2941835.jpg"></div><p>  Throughout this time, Grozny was the capital of the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. </p><p>  During the Great Patriotic War, the Germans were not able to take it.  But they bombed the oil storage and oil fields.  The fires that arose due to this were put out for several days.  Local authorities managed to restore the operation of industrial facilities as soon as possible in order to send the necessary petroleum products to the front and rear. </p><p>  After deportation, Grozny in the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic turned into the center of the Grozny District, which was part of the Stavropol Territory.  However, a few weeks later the Grozny region was formed.  After the rehabilitation of the Ingush and Chechens, the city again turned into the capital of the autonomous republic. </p><h2>  Gudermes </h2><p>  This city for many years was actually the second most important in the republic.  At the same time, the settlement acquired the status of a city only in 1941.  At that time, more than ten thousand people lived in it. </p><p>  Toward the end of the existence of the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, almost forty thousand inhabitants already lived in Gudermes.  Currently, the population has increased by fifty-three thousand people.  The overwhelming advantage of local residents is Chechens.  They are more than 95 percent.  About two percent of Russians, almost one percent of the inhabitants are Kumyks. </p>
