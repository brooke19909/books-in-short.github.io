Then you need to swim in the warmest sea in the world.  This is exactly that piece of the world's oceans, where a person feels comfortable and cozy.  Let's see where the Red Sea is.  Why should it be included in the ‚Äúlist of priority areas‚Äù? </p><h2>  Object geography </h2><p>  This beautiful corner of nature is a tectonic hollow, </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the red sea" class="if" height="216" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15236/399699.jpg" width="300"></div>  filled with warm waters.  It was formed by planetary standards not so long ago, about thirty million years ago.  Located between Africa (the northern tip of the mainland) and the <span>Arabian Peninsula.</span>  If you wish, using the map of the oceans to find out where the Red Sea is, then pay attention to the Indian.  The described reservoir refers to the inland waters of this particular ‚Äúdepartment‚Äù of world waters.  This is not a closed sea.  It exchanges waters with the Arabian - in the south and the Mediterranean - in the north.  The system of seas is interconnected by the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the <span>Suez Canal.</span>  Despite the fact that this object is not large, eight countries are located on its shores, among which Egypt and Israel can be called.  It is these states that create the conditions for people from all over the world to find out where the Red Sea is.  They make a lot of efforts to create a continuous flow of tourists to its shores.

    <p>  There are not so few colored seas in the world.  The Russians previously knew more about the southern - Black and northern - White seas.  They are ours, washed their native shores.  About where the Red Sea is, they began to learn at the end of the last century, thanks to changes in the country.  Naturally, many went on an exotic tour to admire its beauties.  And what did they see?  Wonderful warm pond, which is filled with many corals and algae, which has mostly brownish-red hues.  When you look at it from the shore, it slightly casts red.  That's where the name comes from.  The sea is recognizable visually.  It is clear that this has been noticed since ancient times.  The name was fixed even before the creation of the first cards.  Interestingly, from space, you can immediately determine where the Red Sea is by the color of the surface. </p><h2>  Resorts </h2><p>  The most famous recreation areas are located in Israel and Egypt.  They work year-round.  Although the periods differ from each other in temperature conditions.  In winter it is somewhat cooler (up to twenty warm), in summer it is very hot.  The sea is known for its perfectly transparent water.  It is believed that this phenomenon was due to the lack of rivers flowing into it.  For tourists there is a lot of entertainment.  But the most popular is the study of the flora and fauna of its depths.  A large number of divers flock here at any time.  That's who does not need to explain where the Red Sea is located.  All lovers of underwater nature consider it an honor to admire the local wonders.  Those who still can‚Äôt dive with a mask, </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the red sea" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15236/399702.jpg" width="500"></div>  It is recommended to start with this particular reservoir, taking advantage of its gentleness and relative safety.  There are many famous resorts on the seashores, we will name only one: Sharm El Sheikh.  That will be all said.

    <h2>  What to fear </h2><p>  A few words for those who decided to go on a long journey, becoming interested in descriptions of the virtues of this sea.  Keep in mind that these chic shores and clear waters can hide dangers, sometimes fatal.  There are several species of poisonous fish in the sea.  Among them, one can distinguish a <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãurchin,</span> scorpion, lionfish.  All of them have poisonous spikes.  Sami will never attack.  They can be pricked if you accidentally step on them.  It is difficult to cope with such poison without a doctor.  Therefore, it is recommended to go into the water where there is no algae and the bottom is clearly visible. </p>
