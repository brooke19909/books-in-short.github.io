This is one of the basic knowledge that is pretty easy to master.  The main thing is to clearly know the sequence of actions and practice.  After a couple of trial series, the addition and reduction of loops with a hook will be obtained automatically. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet loops" class="if" height="287" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44196/1862766.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Why do you need to decrease and add loops </h2><p>  People who already held the hook and knitted any products or crafts know that using the hook you can create just extraordinary things.  It can be lacy complex patterns of delicate work, there can be things and souvenirs of different shapes and sizes. </p><p>  By adding and decreasing crochet loops, you can create various geometric shapes - a perfectly even circle, square or triangle, trapezoid, rectangle, etc. The flight of fantasy is unlimited here.  The creation of amigurumi crochet toys is very popular among masters.  Very conveniently and quickly they can be tied out a nose, eyes, paws, ears and other small parts for future animals.  And here you can not do without the ability to correctly add or reduce loops. </p><h2>  Ways to reduce loops </h2><p>  The first method is to skip the loop connected in the previous row.  That is, in the row of reduction, the necessary loop or column is knitted, and the next is already pulled out of the loop going through one from the working thread. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet knit stitch" class="if" height="329" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44196/1862763.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the very beginning of the row, you can reduce the loop, knitting the right amount just with single crochet.  They are so small that they will not visually catch the eye.  Accordingly, at the end of the row, do not tie as many loops as you need to reduce.  In this case, an uneven edge of the product appears, but it can be easily fixed by tying each loop with crochets.  Then the product will immediately get a neat and tidy appearance. </p><p>  Another way that you can use to reduce loops is to connect two loops into one.  That is, not tying the desired loop to the end, proceed to the second, and at the last step connect them with a common ‚Äútop‚Äù. </p><h2>  Single crochet: how to reduce </h2><p>  A single crochet is the easiest knit loop.  Making crochet loops by knitting this column is also absolutely not difficult.  It is necessary to come to the point where three loops remain on the hook before the last capture of the thread.  That is, first we grab the thread and pull it through one loop, then through the next.  So we got three loops.  Then we crochet and pull the hook at once through all the loops.  So, from two loops of the previous row we get one single crochet. </p><h2>  Decrease in a half-column </h2><p>  The first thing to do is to put the working thread on the hook, then insert it into the next loop and pull out a new one.  Repeat these two steps again.  There must be five loops on the hook.  Now another yarn is made and all the loops on the hook are combined with it.  This is how easy and simple the crochet loops occur. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Single crochet reduction </h2><p>  In order for crochet reduction of the loops to be neat and inconspicuous, you must clearly follow the instructions.  Here, for example, for a single crochet column, you need to start with the fact that two columns are not completely knitted, and then they are knitted immediately with a single loop.  It fits in this way: first, the <span>crochet, the hook is inserted</span> into the loop, we pull out a new one.  Now we have three loops on the hook, we need to double crochet and knit two of them.  It turned out one unfinished column.  Do it again.  There should be two loops on the hook.  And we throw the thread on the hook and knit one loop. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="loop crochet" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44196/1862759.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to add a loop inside a row </h2><p>  To make the addition of loops in the middle of a row, you just need to knit the desired number of loops from the same loop.  So that such an addition does not catch the eye, you should make 2-3 new ones from one loop, otherwise you can get the "hump" effect at work at the place of addition.  Or stretch the loop too much, and visually it will look like a hole in the work.  You can knit from one place loops of any complexity.  Depending on the pattern of the pattern, additions can also be made by dialing air loops within the row.  And in the next row, these new loops are already knitted according to the specified pattern. </p><h2>  The addition of a large number of loops at the beginning of a row </h2><p>  If you need to expand the knitted fabric at the beginning of the row, then at the end of the previous one you need to dial additional air loops.  Then in the next they will be the beginning.  It is worth noting that having typed the right number of loops to add, you need to remember about the lifting loops, depending on which column will be the first in a new row. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet loops" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44196/1862754.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The addition of loops at the end of the row </h2><p>  Having finished the row, the hook must be led under the lower left thread or right, if knitting a left-hander, the last loop.  And from it we knit out the necessary loop.  In this way they move to the side, the desired number of loops is typed. </p><h2>  Circular knit </h2><p>  The basic principles of adding and decreasing loops in a loop in a circle do not change.  You can use any of the methods presented above.  The only thing you need to remember about the so-called law of the circle.  As you know, this is a regular geometric figure, it is symmetrical.  Therefore, the number of loops in each row should be distributed evenly so as not to violate the symmetry of the figure.  Accordingly, increments and decreases of loops must be done at equal intervals of loops. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="adding and decreasing crochet loops" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44196/1862758.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As stated at the very beginning of the article, learning this is not at all difficult!  These are the basic techniques and methods for reducing and adding loops in crochet.  To be able to knit the main types of loops and columns, reduce and add loops, learn the schematic designations of loops - and that‚Äôs all, you can begin to carry out any work crocheting.  These are three basic skills, without which you cannot learn to knit. </p>
