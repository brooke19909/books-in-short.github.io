Few galleries in the capital evoke such admiration and interest. </p><p>  The Kremlin Diamond Fund is a unique collection <span>of jewelry</span> from the 18th and 20th centuries.  His collection also includes nuggets of stunning precious metals, examples of the rarest gemstones.  Each of the objects of the exhibition is of great scientific and artistic interest, as well as huge material value. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kremlin Diamond Fund" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/456331.jpg" width="585"></div></h2><h2>  A bit of museum history </h2><p>  The collection of the foundation began to be created in the eighteenth century.  Peter I, taking an example from the monarchs of Europe, issued a decree stating that the treasures that are kept in the tsar‚Äôs chambers are not recognized by the property of the Russian tsars, they belong to the state, being a national treasure.  After Peter‚Äôs ‚Äúrent‚Äù, valuables were stored in the premises allocated for this, and since 1839 - in the Winter Palace (in the Diamond Office).  Jewelry and regalia were given to reigning persons only ‚Äúfor temporary use‚Äù. </p><p>  Wishing to overshadow the luxury of foreign rulers, the Russian tsars and tsars tried to increase the wealth of their court.  Under Catherine II and Elizabeth, particularly large contributions were made. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kremlin Diamond Fund tickets" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/456330.jpg" width="600"></div>

They were admitted to the Moscow Kremlin (the <span>Armory),</span> where they remained in obscurity and lay there for about eight years. </p><p>  After the October Revolution, the Hermitage collection and treasures of the Kremlin miraculously survived.  At the beginning of the last century, not a single country possessed a similar stock of jewelry and jewelry like Russia. </p><p>  Five years later, the commission began to work on the examination and identification of jewelry and applied art.  Thanks to them, the unique artistic and historical value of the former Diamond Cabinet was confirmed.  In addition, the commission noted the need to preserve and study the collection intact, including it in the State Vault. </p><p>  Despite this, a total sale of relics began.  So, 1923 was the most dramatic in the entire history of the foundation.  At that time, due to Russian jewelry that appeared at auctions in London, Berlin, Amsterdam and Antwerp, a real political scandal arose.  Further, in 1925, in the House of Unions it was decided to open an exhibition of unsold relics returned from abroad to demonstrate them unharmed and intact, to hush up the scandal, thereby convincing the world of its own solvency. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="excursion to the Kremlin" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/456329.jpg" width="510"></div>

From 1925-1936  most of the pieces with unique gems and diamonds were sold.  These masterpieces will remain only in photographs, while they will never return to Russia. </p><p>  In 1967, the Diamond Fund exhibition was opened.  At the same time, everyone was interested in an excursion to the Kremlin.  The exhibition aroused incredible interest and was extended several times, without becoming a museum.  The inviolable part of the country's gold and foreign exchange reserves remained subordinate to the Ministry of Finance. </p><p>  Every leader of the USSR considered it necessary to launch a hand in the Diamond Fund of Russia.  Khrushchev almost gave Monomakh a hat to one of the young developing countries, and under Brezhnev one of the orders with diamonds disappeared.  In 1989, a huge number of valuable icons were sold at auctions. </p><p>  Of course, the jewelry of modern jewelers, collections of platinum and gold nuggets, Yakut diamonds were also received.

    <h2>  Kremlin Diamond Fund today </h2><p>  Currently, the historical part of the collection is about seventy items.  The main part of the exposition since 1967 was replenished after the discovery of diamond deposits in Yakutia, and also after the decision made by the government to send stones weighing more than fifty carats for storage to the Kremlin Diamond Fund. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For museum visitors, viewing the exposition usually begins with a display case in which precious minerals are exhibited.  At this place, large technical and jewelry stones with a total weight of tens of thousands of carats are represented.  In addition to diamonds, an excursion to the Diamond Fund involves viewing sapphires, emeralds and other jewelry, as well as ornamental stones and Ural gems.  Excursions, which daily flow into the halls in a continuous stream, also stop at the exhibits of ‚Äú7 Wonders of the Diamond Fund‚Äù.  This includes the Shah diamond (88.70 carats), which retained its natural form, the Count Orlov diamond (189.62 carats), which previously occupied an honorable place on the emperor‚Äôs scepter, a unique flat diamond, blue sapphire (258, 18 carats), as well as the largest chrysolite in the world. </p><p>  The main among the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the treasury of Russia is rightfully considered the Great Imperial Crown.  Jeremiah Posier, a court jeweler, made it in 1762 by order of Catherine II.  The crown is framed with pearls and loose diamonds, but its most valuable part is a huge ruby ‚Äã‚Äã(398.72 carats), which is one of the 7 unique stones of the fund. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kremlin museums diamond fund" class="if" height="492" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/456327.jpg" width="444"></div>

    <p>  Many guests of the capital are extremely interested in the <span>Kremlin museums.</span>  The Diamond Fund, for obvious reasons, has become one of the most visited. </p><h2>  Imperial crown </h2><p>  This is a crown created in 1762 by Eckart (jeweler) and Jeremiah Pozier (diamond craftsman) for Catherine II.  The master set 4936 diamonds in silver, emphasizing the sparkling lace of them in two rows of matte large pearls.  The noble design of the crown is beautiful, but it is filled with the deepest meaning.  The grid of hemispheres from below is supported by laurel branches, which are symbols of glory and power.  And between the hemispheres in the garland drawing are placed acorns and oak leaves, symbolizing the strength and strength of power.  Also on the crown is <span>noble spinel, a</span> very rare gem of rich red color.  This is one of the most important works of art that the Kremlin Diamond Fund contains. </p><h2>  Small Imperial Crown </h2><p>  It was created in 1856 by the jeweler Zeftigen for the coronation of Maria Alexandrovna.  It is made in the likeness of a large crown;  on both sides of the lattice are decorated with four-leafed, a diamond cross rises in an arc, while the lower edge of the crown is decorated with 22 large diamonds.  It attracts the attention of everyone who visited the Kremlin Diamond Fund (photos can be seen in this article). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="excursion to the diamond fund" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/456326.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Imperial scepter </h2><p>  It was made for Catherine II in the early 1770s.  Materials used: Orlov diamond, gold, diamonds, enamel, silver. </p><h2>  Imperial power </h2><p>  Was created in 1762 G.-F.  Eckart (court jeweler) for Catherine II.  Materials: gold, sapphire, diamonds, silver, diamond.  In the early seventies of the eighteenth century, it was decorated with two stones that changed its appearance.  A huge sapphire (200 carats) was placed between the semi-hoop and the diamond openwork cross surrounded by diamonds, and at the junction of the girdle with the semi-hoop was a large diamond (46.92 carats), exceptionally clean, with a slight bluish tint.  The state acquired its present form under Paul I. A huge sapphire appeared under the cross, while a large diamond was placed between the diamond belts. </p><h2>  Diamond "Shah" </h2><p>  This is a diamond from India at 88.7 carats.  A completely transparent, slightly brownish-yellowish stone.  The groove on it indicates that they wore it instead of a talisman.  3 names of its owners are clearly visible, engraved on it, as well as the corresponding dates. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kremlin Diamond Fund photo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/456325.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  "Caesar's Ruby" </h2><p>  A stone of pinkish-raspberry juicy color, with which green enamel perfectly combines with gold leaves located on a forked stalk neatly covered with black and white enamel.  The stone is faceted by a bunch of grapes. </p><h2>  Diamond sign with a star of the Order of St. Andrew </h2><p>  The first time the appearance of the Russian order, which was until 1917 the highest award of the empire.
