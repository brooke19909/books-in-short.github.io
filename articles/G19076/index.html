People have long been creating beautiful things in many ways.  Among these methods - beads, which is used for embroidery, weaving and other features.  Children using bead weaving can not only take their free time, but also develop in many directions.  However, this is not all, because the creation of a unique accessory by a child is his motivation for working with beads, so the weaving process is carried out with pleasure and enthusiasm.  This article will help in choosing the material and tell you how to weave a heart from beads. </p><h2>  Base selection </h2><p>  The basis for future crafts is a thread, fishing line or wire.  The thread is mainly used for embroidery with beads, because it is not suitable for creating a three-dimensional result.  In this she was replaced by fishing line.  It has many advantages and, in addition to durability, there is a transparent look among them, due to which the base is not very noticeable.  It is she who gives confidence that the product will not tear from a careless jerk.  The same can be said for wire for beads.  On sale it is represented by a choice of colors with a metallic sheen with a thickness of 0.2 to 1 mm.  Most often, the wire is used to create decorative jewelry, as it holds its shape perfectly.  However, its minus is that as an accessory during frequent use, the wire bends, twists and is rubbed, which leads to its breakdown. </p><h2>  Bead selection </h2><p>  When choosing a bead, you should immediately imagine the effect of the created craft.  It depends directly on the beads.  Glass beads are popular, however, on the shelves of the store you can find plastic, wooden, metal and stones.  The main manufacturers of beads are Japan and the Czech Republic.  It is Czech and Japanese beads that are quite high quality.  In addition to the fact that the beads are different by the manufacturer, it can also be divided by volume and shape.  The most common form of bead repeats the appearance of a slightly flattened ball with a hole.  Their size is from 1 to 6 mm.  Often you can see elongated cylindrical beads with smooth edges from the side of the hole.  As something fabulous for crafts, it is worth highlighting glass beads or chopped beads.  It is similar to a cylindrical, but has a different size and sharp edges.  Beaded colors and coatings are very extensive.  In addition to simple colored beads, you can purchase mother-of-pearl, with a metallic sheen, matte, shiny, transparent with a painted hole and so on. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.instructables.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="heart on hand" class="if uuid-3032635" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22293/3032635.jpg"></div><h2>  Basic weaving patterns </h2><p>  There are many ways of weaving, however, it is necessary to highlight the main patterns, from which it is worth starting from. </p><p>  Parallel weaving is the simplest of the basic patterns.  This technique is as simple as its name.  The required number of beads is put on a fishing line or wire, and then a similar second row is intertwined on both sides.  The result is two rows lying parallel to each other.  This technique is most often initially studied by children.  It is very simple in its execution, which saves the time and interest of the child when creating crafts.  Another important advantage of this technique is the interweaving of several beads at once, depending on the size of the desired part. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Parallel weaving technique" class="if uuid-3032070" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/114991/3032070.jpg"></div><p>  Buttonhole weaving is also considered a simple technique.  It is based on the creation of loops.  Most often it is used in creating petals or leaves for trees.  Each of them as a result is intertwined with each other or with a branch, and the result is a beautiful decorative craft.  Using this technique, you can create a canvas, but you should be careful, because it will not be dense enough. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Weaving pattern" class="if uuid-3032067" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/114991/3032067.jpg"></div><p>  The monastic weaving is a technique of dense work with beads, which are based on four beads connected to each other at an angle of 90 degrees, forming a semblance of a cross.  In the end, thanks to the cross-shaped image, the woven craft fabric has the appearance of a mesh.  For this technique, it is desirable to use beads of the same size, otherwise the crosses will turn out to be crooked, and the fabric is uneven.  A similar weaving technique is now very common due to its ease of execution and effective result. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Monastery weaving technique" class="if uuid-3032071" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/114991/3032071.jpg"></div><h2>  Symbolism of the heart </h2><p>  The most common symbol that inspires many can be called a heart of beads.  This symbol shows the love, affection, respect and many other pleasant feelings that the master experiences.  It is worth noting that it is also quite diverse, because this symbolism is important on any holiday, and not just, for example, on Valentine's Day.  That is why, creating a laconic heart from beads, a person can please not only himself, but also his family.  Indeed, many will be pleased to carry a donated heart bead keychain on their bag.  This is really very touching.  And with the help of the above techniques, you can figure out how to make a heart from beads. </p><h2>  Heart - parallel technique </h2><p>  This technique is easy when weaving a bead heart for beginners.  It is most convenient to use wire for such a product, since it holds its shape well.  You need to start work with one bead, which will serve as the bottom corner of the future heart.  It will be her first number.  For the next row you will need three beads that are intertwined on both sides with wire.  The third row will be five beads, which, like the previous row, are interwoven on both sides.  Weaving must continue to be conducted on this principle.  Each row is slightly larger than the previous one to create the base of the heart in the shape of a triangle.  Little difficulty arises when it comes to weaving the ears of a symbol.  On the eighth row, the triangle made from beads needs to be fixed.  With the help of parallel weaving, two more details are created, which will be the ears of the heart.  They can easily be attached to the main triangle.  The heart of beads is ready! </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Heart weaving pattern" class="if uuid-3032068" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/114991/3032068.jpg"></div><h2>  Heart - looping technique </h2><p>  Such a heart is woven from identical circles, the number of which increases or decreases, depending on the number.  In one circle there are six beads, and the first row consists of it.  Only one bead is interlaced, after it five beads are strung on the right side of the fishing line or wire, and the last of them is interwoven from two sides.  This eyelet begins the second row, which consists of two circles.  The right side of the fishing line is threaded through another bead, which is part of the bottom row.  Four beads are already worn on the same side, and the last of them is threaded through the left side of the fishing line.  As a result, our heart weaves in identical circles in a zigzag fashion.  One row weaves to the right, intertwining with the bottom, and the next row - to the left.  And so on, weaving with beads continues.  The heart in this technique does not oblige the ears to make separate parts.  After creating the seventh row, which plays the role of the right eye, both sides of the fishing line or wire can simply be passed through the upper beads of the lower row, skipping one circle.  After that, according to the previous looping principle, the second ear is woven.  To attach the key fob, you can make an extra loop.  The heart of beads is ready! </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Heart weaving pattern" class="if uuid-3032069" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/114991/3032069.jpg"></div><h2>  Heart - monastery technology </h2><p>  For monastery weaving, it is best to use fishing line.  The technique is based on crosses consisting of four beads.  Accordingly, the ranks of the future heart also consist of them.  Almost the same as in the loop weaving, in this case the rows are woven in a zigzag pattern.  One cross of four beads is woven in such a way as to weave one convex bead from the bottom row and the last of the strung beads.  After weaving one ear of the heart, the fishing line is threaded through the lower rows and goes where you need to start weaving the other side of the heart.  Such a heart of beads can be left flat, or can be made voluminous.  For the latter option, you will need two parts that play the role of two created flat hearts.  As well as a few beads to fill.  Two details are applied to each other and already with the help of the studied technique of monastery weaving are connected on the sides.  Between the two parts you need to put the beads, and then completely weave them.  Before fixing the fishing line, you can make a loop for the base of the keyring or chain.  The heart of beads is ready! </p>
