    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  In addition to the positive aspects, there are also negative aspects of relaxation in the Muine Paradise Resort 3 *.  Reviews about this resort hotel contain a number of negative comments, comments, and complaints: </p><ul><li>  the hotel is located very far from the international airport (approximately 6 hours drive), which is very tiring after a long flight; </li><li>  the curtains in the apartments, apparently, did not wash for a very long time, or they are too old, because there are terrible spots on them; </li><li>  to the beach you need to go down the steep descent along the stairs, which creates quite serious difficulties when returning to the hotel; </li><li>  since the sea is quite turbulent, the waves constantly bring to the shore a lot of algae and jellyfish, which sting painfully; </li><li>  despite the fact that the beach is private, local fishermen very often come to it with boats and all their equipment, which is why there is practically nowhere to swim and sunbathe; </li><li>  if the key is lost, a very high fee is charged - as much as $ 35. </li></ul>
