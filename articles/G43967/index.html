Conflictology is a branch of knowledge at the intersection of various sciences, but first of all, it operates on the methods and developments of philosophy, psychology and sociology.  This science is currently becoming more and more autonomous in nature, but it originated in the depths of these disciplines.  Conflictology is a branch of knowledge (of a character that will be defined at the end of the article), which was formed at the junction of many disciplines - applied, theoretical and applied. </p>

    <h2>  Different approaches to conflict </h2><p>  First you need to figure out what conflictology is studying and what are the different approaches to the subject of this science.  These views are due to various views on the nature of man.  For example, T. Hobbes believed that it is natural for a society to be in a state of hostility, he belongs to the phrase "the struggle of all against all."  The interests of the individual will always clash with the interests of society for various reasons.  This is an unequal distribution of benefits, and a different understanding of justice among people. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the other hand, the ancient Greek scholar Aristotle believed that the interests of society should be preferred over the interests of man.  After all, man is its integral part and in solitude in almost the majority of cases is doomed to death. </p><h2>  Conflict Studies and Western Society </h2><p>  Man has always looked for ways to effectively resolve disagreements.  Conflictology is a branch of knowledge that has arisen from a desperate need to maintain peace between different social and ethnic groups and, as a result, many human lives.  At the end of the nineteenth century, the theory of Marxism became very widespread in European countries.  Its main postulates are reduced to the issue of the struggle between different economic classes.  Therefore, since that time, European civilization has been studying serious approaches to resolving conflicts and taking into account the interests of various parties.  The main feature of European politics is the ability to compromise. </p><p>  Erasmus of Rotterdam rightly pointed out: "War is sweet for those who do not know it."  Therefore, conflictology is gaining such importance today. </p><h2>  Conflictology in Russia </h2><p>  The main principle on which it was necessary to rely in resolving conflicts in Russian history was the principle of collegiality.  A person is always part of the whole, and disagreements are heretical and must be strictly punished. </p><p>  The 1917 revolution brought a new attitude to the conflict: it encouraged the struggle for their interests, the restoration of justice.  In socialist times, on the contrary, a person had a very weak degree of voting right - he was part of his larger system, which worked for its own good. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If we talk about the Russian mentality as a whole, including the views of modern society, then it is characterized by the ideals of altruism and sacrifice, neglect of their own interests to please the public.  The main features of national consciousness in relation to the conflict is silence and denial.  This, scientists believe, largely explains the fact that Western methods of working with differences very poorly take root in Russian society. </p>

    <h2>  Disagreements and Paul Macklin's Theory </h2><p>  Conflictology as a branch of scientific knowledge affects such seemingly remote areas of human cognition as anatomy and physiology.  How do these disciplines relate to it? </p><p>  To answer this question, it is necessary to consider what happens during a conflict at the level of processes in the central nervous system, and also consider the structure of the latter.  As you know, one of the differences between the human brain and animal brain is the presence of a neocortex - the cerebral cortex.  This part is responsible for the processes of logical thinking, adequate perception of reality, drawing up correct conclusions.  The neocortex, or the new cortex, is responsible for self-awareness, critical perception, analysis of the situation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The theory of the three-component brain was developed and proved by the American scientist Paul Macklin.  It is directly related to the processes that conflict studies. </p><p>  The next part is the limbic, or emotional, brain.  This part is already more ancient and is responsible for social status, emotions.  The limbic brain is present in mammals and birds. </p><p>  And finally, during the conflict, activity goes into more ancient sections, the so-called reptile brain.  This department is formed in a child under three years of age, and he is responsible, as the name implies, for the most primitive functions.  In its most general terms, it is the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain.  This system in an adult is responsible for satisfying feelings of hunger, searching for a sexual partner, reaction of attack or flight. </p><p>  Therefore, human behavior is largely determined by what part is active at a given time.  When in conflict, you must be aware that this process involves the most ancient parts of the brain.  Numerous recommendations for behavior in a conflict situation are associated with this understanding - it is necessary to focus on mathematical calculations, analysis of the environment, and remember any logical tasks.  Such a <span>shift of attention</span> helps to redirect the focus of excitement to more ‚Äúhumanized‚Äù zones. </p><h2>  Conflict Object Definition </h2><p>  This is the most important point in resolving any disagreement.  And at the same time it is the most difficult.  The object of conflict can often be veiled by one of the parties or both.  Also, it is sometimes substituted due to the pursuit of one's own goals and carrying out manipulations.  For example, in the vast majority of cases, the object of the struggle between politicians is power.  However, this motive is often replaced by another.  For example, a struggle can take place under the guise of caring for a population.  So the noble pretext disguises the deeper motives. </p><p>  Conflictology as a branch of psychological knowledge is designed to isolate the true motives of differences between people. </p><p>  <span>The object of conflict</span> must be distinguished from the subject.  The latter is the contradiction that pushes the parties to the conflict to enter into disagreements. </p><h2>  Conflict structure </h2><p>  There is no doubt that, to some extent, conflictology is a branch of theoretical knowledge, since it cannot but rely on the methods and developments of theoretical sciences.  Abstracting from a specific situation, the researcher isolates those components that are common to any conflict.  Scientists based on such abstraction have identified several stages of the disagreement situation. </p><ol><li>  Pre-conflict phase.  It is characterized by an increase in tension between the parties not yet in the confrontation.  The reasons for the beginning of this stage are either a real infringement of the interests of one of the parties, or a distorted perception of behavior, or false information about the behavior of one of the opponents. </li><li>  Then the conflict escalates.  This is a very dangerous stage, since during confrontation the process will only intensify, thereby exacerbating the conflict.  At this stage, it is necessary to apply the knowledge that is available in the arsenal of conflict management and to prevent a further increase in conflict. </li><li>  Stage of permission.  The achievement of this stage occurs when the parties understand that it is necessary to be aware of the situation as it really is.  You need to consider factual information, understand that the price of success can be prohibitively higher than possible losses. </li><li>  Conversation.  At this stage, the differences are final.  Possible solutions to the remaining issues are being clarified, necessary papers are signed, and certain agreements are reached. </li></ol><p>  As already mentioned, the most sensitive part of the conflict process is the escalation stage.  Disagreements on it can go according to a completely different scenario. </p>

    <h2>  Conflictology and Law </h2><p>  At the junction of two sciences - conflict studies and jurisprudence - another private branch of the science of discord was formed: legal conflictology.  This is a branch of knowledge that is studying ways to prevent the resolution of conflicts arising from a clash of subjects of law.  It is designed to identify patterns that are specific to this category of disagreement. </p><p>  Legal conflictology is a branch of knowledge of the character, both psychological and legal.  This duality is due to its inseparability from both disciplines.  The scope of its application demonstrates the uniqueness of legal norms.  It also operates with sociological and psychological knowledge and is for the most part an applied discipline. </p>

    <h2>  Types of Conflict in Psychology </h2><p>  In appearance, the following types of conflicts are distinguished: intrapersonal, interpersonal, between an individual and a group, between groups, as well as international conflicts. </p><p>  Intrapersonal conflict is a disagreement between various elements of a person‚Äôs internal structure.  It carries simultaneously motives of a different nature, which contradict each other.  Conflicts of this kind are the cause of neurotic conditions. </p><p>  Interpersonal conflicts can arise for a variety of reasons.  Their course largely depends on the psychological characteristics of individuals entering into disagreement, on the degree of their compatibility. </p><p>  The conflict between the individual and the group is due to the divergence of the views of the group and an individual person.  It can be both destructive and creative. </p><p>  Intergroup conflicts are also very diverse.  This type of conflict is notable for its scale.  They can arise for various reasons: political, economic, social. </p><p>  International conflicts arise between countries or groups of states. </p><p>  Conflict examiners also distinguish two more types of disagreements.  These two subcategories are distinguished depending on the infringed needs of one or both parties: conflicts of interest and cognitive conflicts.  The latter are connected with disagreements of opinions and points of view on various issues.  Conflicts of interest are of an excellent nature.  They are associated with a violation of immediate needs. </p>

    <h2>  Ways to resolve the conflict </h2><p>  Conflictology is a branch of theoretical knowledge, on the one hand;  but on the other, it is aimed at solving quite applied issues.  And its main goal, of course, is the elimination of conflicts and the restoration of peace.  In total, several such methods are distinguished. </p><ol><li>  Compromise.  It is characterized by mutual concessions of the parties. </li><li>  Avoiding the problem.  At the same time, one of the participants in the conflict begins to ignore the conflict and refuses to realize his interests.  This method, rather, will not speak of resolution, but of the extinction of the situation of disagreement. </li><li>  The concessions of one of the parties.  In fact, this is an adaptive way of solving, but with large losses it is inevitable and more profitable. </li><li>  The involvement of third parties.  People or social groups who are not interested in the object of disagreement help resolve a conflict situation.  Often this is the only way out. </li><li>  Cooperation.  The most productive way.  It is characterized by the ability to discern the interests of the other side and help the opponent achieve his goal.  This happens on a reciprocal basis. </li></ol><p>  The revealed methods of conflict resolution, on the one hand, can be applied to many types of conflict situations, that is, they are theoretical in nature.  On the other hand, conflict management is aimed at solving specific real problems.  Therefore, in part, it can be said that also conflictology is a branch of applied knowledge.  But, as you can see, this is only a partial characteristic of it. </p>

    <h2>  Coercion as a conflict outcome </h2><p>  This method is the worst, since in the process of its action the interests of one of the parties are completely ignored.  This type of conflict resolution - although it is very difficult to call a way out of the situation - is often inherent in married life.  One of the partners may consider that he has the right to force the other to carry out any actions at his discretion - for example, to wash clothes at the time intended for rest.  Of course, the second spouse may agree to carry out this order, but inside himself he will feel humiliation, which gives rise only to a series of responses and a desire to take revenge. </p><p>  The method of coercion is also often used in the relationship between the leader and the subordinate.  Unfortunately, many managers do not recognize the boundaries of their authority or their motives do not really coincide with the productive values ‚Äã‚Äãof certain companies.  Unjustifiably infringing on the interests of the employee, the manager will not receive anything but a constant turnover of personnel, poorly performed work or sabotage. </p><p>  Further, the next area where coercion is applied is the relationship between parent and child.  And here, as in the previous examples, the authoritarian parent will not achieve any positive results by constantly imposing his will.  He either brings up a personality with many psychological complexes, which is what he signs in his own insolvency as a parent and adult in general.  Or - in the near future or more distant - he will face the fact that the child will begin to show rebellion. </p><p>  Conflictology is a branch of knowledge, theoretical understanding and practical application of the information received.  Therefore, it is possible to apply the methods for resolving disagreements developed by conflict experts in any specific field - from international relations to family ones. </p>

    <h2>  Conflict Action </h2><p>  In conflict, there are two types of actions.  They stand out on the basis of their relationship to the achievement of the goals of each of the parties.  These are the main actions and auxiliary.  The main ones are directly aimed at obtaining the desired result.  Supporting actions are those that are complementary to the first type: for example, distracting the attention of the enemy, attracting allies. </p><p>  All actions that are aggressive or violent in nature are called conflicting. </p><p>  So, it is necessary to answer the question: is conflictology a branch of knowledge of what nature?  Is it completely theoretical or does it deal only with private conflicts? </p><h2>  Is conflict management a branch of theoretical or applied knowledge? </h2><p>  It is much easier to find a solution in other disciplines.  Mathematicians study abstract numbers.  The subject of studying physics or chemistry is also the phenomenon of the real world.  But when it comes to conflict management, it is very difficult for a researcher to even confirm his status as a scientist.  However, from this, this science is no less (and maybe even more) important than other branches of scientific knowledge.  After all, who knows if humanity will be able to take advantage of scientific and technological progress wisely, using knowledge of how to avoid conflicts? </p><p>  Conflictology is an industry (of whatever nature - applied or theoretical, follows from the focus of its research), which has its origins in philosophy and psychology.  She uses the methodological apparatus of these sciences.  Conflictology is a branch of knowledge of a theoretical and applied nature.  It is aimed at solving specific problems, solving social problems, practical issues related to politics, economics, and law. </p>
