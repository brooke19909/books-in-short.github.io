  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Bear Valley" in Nizhny Novgorod: description, infrastructure</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Most residents of the Far North and the Far East, having spent some part of their lives in harsh climatic conditions, tend to move to more favorable regions.  For various reasons, hot areas are not suitable for many people, but only a temperate climate.  One of the cities most favorable for living in just such conditions is Nizhny Novgorod.  ‚ÄúBear Valley‚Äù is a residential complex of the capital‚Äôs buildings, which is ideal for those who have moved to a permanent residence. </p><h2>  A bit about the city </h2><p>  Nizhny Novgorod ranks among the five largest cities in the Russian Federation in terms of population.  More than a million inhabitants live in it, and their number continues to increase, since the city is a large industrial, commercial, scientific, educational and cultural center.  Many people prefer to live in an urban environment and developed infrastructure without changing their usual way of life.  For such residents, developers are building high-rise residential buildings and entire neighborhoods.  One of them is LCD "Bear Valley" in Nizhny Novgorod. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Residential buildings" class="if uuid-3188396" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/3188396.jpg"></div><p>  The construction of the complex began many years ago.  Back in 2004, the first slab of an apartment building on Rodionova Street was laid.  Currently, it is already a fully populated residential complex, with a developed territory. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Description of the complex </h2><p>  The Bear Valley in Nizhny Novgorod is nine 17-story and three 9-story residential buildings of a typical metropolitan area.  The construction customer was the Ministry of the Interior in the Nizhny Novgorod Region.  Therefore, a number of apartments were received by police officers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Complex &quot;Bear Valley&quot;" class="if uuid-3188397" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/3188397.jpg"></div><p>  High-rise buildings are made of bricks and panels.  To implement the project for the construction of 17-story houses in the Bear Valley in Nizhny Novgorod, the developer acquired special equipment for work at the specified height.  The company also used the most advanced materials and technologies. </p><h2>  Apartments in the complex </h2><p>  Apartments in the Bear Valley in Nizhny Novgorod for rent were offered turnkey.  This greatly helped to save future residents strength and money when moving, since no additional investment was required for repairs.  Wallpaper, skirting boards, interior and exterior doors, metal-plastic windows with triple glazing, linoleum, plumbing - all this is included in the concept of finishing a turnkey apartment.  Glazing of complex figured loggias is also provided.  The developer did not save on materials for the decoration of residential premises, acquiring only high-quality and expensive. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Houses in the complex" class="if uuid-3188399" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/3188399.jpg"></div><p>  The complex provides premises of various sizes: one-, two- and three-room apartments up to 44 m <sup>2</sup> , 66 m <sup>2</sup> and 83 m <sup>2,</sup> respectively. </p><p>  When designing three-room apartments, the developer chose a modern layout with a trihedral wall and a trapezoidal panoramic window. </p><h2>  Location of the complex </h2><p>  LCD "Bear Valley" in Nizhny Novgorod was built in its most successful area - Sovetskoye, which is located almost near the city center.  A major transport route (Belinsky Street) leads to Rodionov Street and the complex itself.  A large number of public transport systems make the accessibility of the LCD "Bear Valley" very convenient and fast.  More than twenty buses and taxis pass through a stop near which a residential complex is located. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Night view of the complex" class="if uuid-3188955" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12424/3188955.jpg"></div><h2>  Infrastructure internal and external </h2><p>  The residential complex is located almost next to the city center, which allows its residents not to experience a lack of social infrastructure.  Shops, gyms, medical and educational institutions, beauty salons and even your own notary public - in the Bear Valley in Nizhny Novgorod, all conditions for comfortable living, solving everyday problems and organizing leisure activities are created. </p><p>  The first floors of buildings, as in many complexes, are given for non-residential premises to accommodate various objects of social infrastructure.  This includes kindergartens, hairdressers, pharmacies, shoe repair, dry cleaning, etc. </p><p>  Owners of their own cars and guests of the LCD "Bear Valley" do not experience inconvenience with parking.  A little away from the houses is a whole garage complex.  Thanks to him, car noise does not break the silence, and the yards remain free from cars. </p><p>  A large shopping center with a cinema for several halls and a night club was built right on the road.  In it, residents of the complex can purchase everything you need, things and products, relax, watch a movie.  The mall has furniture stores, a supermarket, cafes and many different retail spaces.  So the residents of the residential complex ‚ÄúBear Valley‚Äù do not even have to go somewhere for groceries, things or other necessary household goods. </p><p>  Excellent transport accessibility of the complex allows you to quickly get anywhere in the city, and get the necessary service or purchase what you want.  We can say that people who bought housing in this microdistrict acquired good living conditions in the city. </p>
