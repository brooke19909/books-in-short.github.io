There are some tourists who, for reasons independent of them, decided to change Egypt and Turkey to domestic sea resorts.  Be that as it may, in Russia there are still places that have been ignored by the masses.  Not far from such famous resorts as Sochi, Gelendzhik and Anapa, the villages of Vityazevo, Gizel-Dere, Nebug, Sukko live their quiet lives. </p><p>  Hotel "Victoria", which will be discussed in this article, is located in this last village.  For the Slavic ear, the name Sukko sounds exotic, but emphasis should be placed on the last syllable.  The name of the resort village was due to the river.  ‚ÄúSu‚Äù in Adyghe means ‚Äúwater‚Äù;  Kkyo is ‚Äúcool.‚Äù  The river forms a valley that captivates tourists with its beauty.  Several in the depths of the mainland, three kilometers from the coast, there is a freshwater lake, and near the sea - a village.  All of them are called Sukko. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Victoria Succo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1508006.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Victoria (guest house): where is it </h2><p>  It so happened historically that there are no buildings directly at the beach in the village.  All housing is located in the interior of the mainland.  Getting to Sukko is not a problem.  The village is located thirteen kilometers south of Anapa.  And this city can be reached both by air and by land - by train, by car.  Minibus 109 runs from <span>Anapa bus station</span> to Sukko. Victoria Guesthouse provides transfers to / from <span>Anapa</span> Airport or <span>Train Station</span> for an additional fee <span>.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the village itself there is a large children's recreation camp (where every summer shoots of the regular scenes of "Jumble" are held), as well as many private guest houses.  "Victoria" (Sukko) is located at: st.  Central, house ten.  The name of the street itself indicates a strategically advantageous location of the hotel complex.  It takes about seven minutes to stop the intercity minibus.  To the beach - fifteen.  A grocery store is located very close.  Around "Victoria" is in full swing.  There is a choice of cafes, in the local market you can buy fruits and vegetables. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Victoria Succo Anapa" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1508007.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sukko, Victoria (guest house): description </h2><p>  The hotel complex consists of two buildings of three and four floors, connected by a passage.  They are designed in such a way that between them is a cozy patio.  It is perfectly obscured by climbing grapes.  In the middle of the courtyard a small fountain murmurs monotonously.  The territory of the hotel complex "Victoria" (Sukko) is small, but perfectly equipped. </p><p>  Reviews say that the owners are trying to create the atmosphere of an exotic resort.  Here, even kiwi is grown.  Everything is very functional.  There is a playground and a shallow pool.  In the guest house, the buildings are painted white and blue, which, together with the bright southern sun, evokes associations about Greece.  The territory is small, but still vacationers with a car have a place to attach their iron horse in the parking lot.  Behind the courtyard and buildings of "Victoria" is a round-the-clock video surveillance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sukko Victoria Guesthouse" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1508026.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Building number 2. Room categories </h2><p>  In the Victoria Hotel (Sukko) you can find a room for any wallet.  The hotel has thirty-nine rooms.  Not all of them are ready to receive guests year-round.  Economy rooms are designed to accommodate guests in the spa season - from early May to late September.

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The hotel complex "Victoria" (Sukko) has its own cafe with a summer terrace.  There is karaoke there in season.  The administration does not include meals in the price of the hotel.  But you can pay for meals separately.  Breakfast in 2016 cost one hundred and thirty rubles, lunch - 170, and dinner - one hundred and fifty.  Reviews say that the cook in the cafe prepares very tasty and high-quality products.  The portions are large and the dishes resemble homemade food. </p><p>  The cafe has an area available for vacationers who do not want to pay for food, but prefer to cook themselves.  There is a four-burner stove, a microwave, a set of necessary kitchen utensils and tableware.  A grocery store is located next to the hotel.  Most of the tourists who have left reviews have preferred dining in a hotel cafe.  They argue that cooking in the heat, and even on vacation is too difficult.  And the prices for meals at the hotel are low, as for such a quality of service. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel victoria succo" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1508003.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Services </h2><p>  In the hotel complex "Victoria" (Sukko, Anapa), guests can park a car for free.  Upon request, again, it is absolutely free to take an iron and an ironing board.  At the disposal of tourists there is a kitchen where you can cook your own meals.  Cleaned rooms on request.  Sheets are changed once a week, and towels are changed every four days. </p><p>  For an additional fee, you can order a transfer from Anapa.  At the airport or at the train station you will be greeted with a sign and hoisted with a breeze to the very gates of the hotel in some twenty minutes.  The complex has a pool for babies.  The shady courtyard has seating areas. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Hotel Victoria (Sukko) is separated from the sea by some eight hundred meters.  A pebble beach stretches between the resort villages of Bolshoi and <span>Maly Utrish.</span>  Unlike Anapa, the relief is hilly.  After all, this is the foothills of the Caucasus.  In this regard, the climate here is a bit different.  Sukko has less wind, lower humidity (only ten percent), July heat is milder. </p><p>  In addition to all this, the village is surrounded by hills overgrown with juniper.  This is a real bush of life, because in its cones, needles and wood contains healing essential oils.  Air itself can already be called a healing factor.  The well-equipped pebble beach of the village is regularly cleaned.  Water is much cleaner than in Anapa.  Therefore, it is not surprising to see dolphins here.  But a steep entry into the sea forces parents to be on the alert all the time and look after the children.  Already one and a half meters from the coast, tangible depth begins. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sukko Hotel Victoria" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1508029.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Resort Activities </h2><p>  You should not think that you will find yourself in the outback if you choose the Victoria Guesthouse (Sukko) for relaxation.  Anapa is a noisier and, most importantly, more expensive resort, located only fifteen kilometers away.  But in Sukko you can find enough entertainment.  Right on the shore is the Golden Beach water park with the interesting Storm ride.  Artificial waves reach three and four points.  Reviews are advised to go to the lake and look at the <span>swamp cypress trees</span> that grow directly in the water.  As for the Victoria Hotel (Sukko), reviews say that they insistently ask to respect the rights of other guests for a relaxing holiday. </p>
