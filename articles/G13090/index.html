    <h2>  Agoy: general information </h2><p>  The name of this settlement, according to experts, means: "located in the heart of the mountains" (approximate translation from Adyghe).  Indeed, the settlement is located in the valley of the Agoysky pass, in the immediate vicinity of Tuapse.  The village was built at the mouth of the river of the same name.  According to historical documents, this settlement has been leading its modern history since 1915.  Until recently, the village was considered "wild" and was popular only among tourists who choose extreme travel away from civilization.  Today Agoy offers a quite comfortable vacation, there are shops, cafes and quite modern hotels, you can easily rent a room with local residents.  A lot of tourists come here in the holiday season, but despite this fact, the situation in the village is not at all the same as in the large resort cities. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

Here you can see more than 1000 species of wild plants, many of which are listed in the Red Book, including 30 varieties of various orchids.  In the forests live exotic animals for many residents of our country: raccoons, foxes, Caucasian cats, wolves, roe deer.  However, do not worry - wild animals rarely visit the village itself. </p><h2>  What to do during the holidays? </h2><p>  From the green valley, the village gradually descends to the Black Sea coast.  The beaches near Agoy are different - there are rocky, there are covered with sand and small pebbles.
