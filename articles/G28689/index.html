There is an architectural monument at almost every step in the city, so there are always many tourists here.  Translated from the <span>Crimean Tatar language, the</span> name of the settlement means a palace-garden.  Indeed, the splendidly preserved ancient buildings are almost buried in unique Crimean greenery. </p><h2>  Three roads </h2><p>  The city is located at an altitude of 140 to 350 meters above sea level, in the Churuk-Su valley at the foot of the Inner Ridge of the Crimean Mountains.  To explore the sights of Bakhchisarai, you can choose one of 3 existing roads. </p><p>  It can be reached through the Ai-Petren Pass, from the south coast.  There is a pass in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe village of Sokolinoe (Kokoz Valley).  However, this is one of the most difficult roads, where there are many descents and ascents, turns.  By the way, the longest is 78 kilometers. </p><p>  You can come to Bakhchisaray from Sevastopol, having left the northern part and moving further along the valley near the Kacha river.  You can also drive along the valley along <span>the Belbek River.</span>  There will be many vineyards and towns along the way. </p><p>  The third option is from the <span>capital of Crimea,</span> Sevastopol.  This is the shortest way, you have to overcome about 30 kilometers. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="44.74609100000001" data-lng="33.861564300000055" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/2/8/1/7/2817.png"></div><h2>  Khan's Palace </h2><p>  Attraction Bakhchisarai and a real tourist Mecca.  The palace is part of the reserve.  It is here that you can feel and understand how the Crimean Tatar rulers lived.  The building is located on an area of ‚Äã‚Äã4.3 hectares.  And once under the palace was occupied 18 hectares of land. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The palace was built in the XVI century, under the rule of Khan Sahib I Giray.  The oldest building - the mosque portal "Demir-Kapy" - dates from 1508. </p><p>  As the number of inhabitants of the palace increased, new buildings appeared.  And each new khan wanted to perpetuate his memory.  However, during the Russo-Crimean war, the palace complex was almost completely destroyed.  But Field Marshal Minich made a full description of the complex, according to these old records, the palace was later restored.  Huge restoration work was carried out before the arrival of Catherine II (1787). </p><p>  For visiting the sights of Bakhchisaray - the Khan's Palace - the price varies depending on the exposure.  For visiting the historical department, ethnographic and art museum you will have to pay 270 rubles (children - 130 rubles).  The rest of the exposition (bathhouse, khan's box and others) is 100 rubles each (a children's ticket costs 2 times cheaper).  But it is better to purchase a comprehensive ticket, the price of which includes visiting all the exhibits.  Its price is 500 rubles, a children's ticket is 250 rubles. </p><p>  Here, at the entrance to the palace, you can see the old stone pointer "Catherine Mile" (northern entrance).  Similar structures were erected throughout the peninsula in order to indicate the path of Catherine, who was supposed to arrive at the Khan's Palace. </p><p>  Reviews about visiting these places are just amazing, because it is here that you can see a vivid example of ancient architecture, learn the history of the peninsula.  No wonder this place is captured on the canvases of the great painters. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Khan's Palace" class="if uuid-2441552" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2441552.jpg"></div><h2>  Holy Assumption Monastery </h2><p>  Another attraction of Bakhchisarai, which will not leave a single visitor indifferent.  This is one of the oldest shrines of the Crimean peninsula.  It is believed that it was built around the VIII-IX centuries.  The founders were icon worshipers who fled from Byzantium, hiding from the persecution of iconoclasts. </p><p>  Once in these places, the laity and monks gradually began to rebuild the cave monasteries.  There was a Holy Assumption Monastery until 1778, but when Christians were forcibly displaced to the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov, the walls of the holy place were empty.  Only in 1850 did the revival of the monastery gradually begin.  Later, after the Crimean-Russian war, it began to be built up with new buildings.  And by the beginning of the last century it was the largest complex, which included 5 churches.  During the Soviet period, the shrine was closed, the monastery stood empty and gradually collapsed.  Only in recent years have carried out some restoration work and opened a monastery. </p><p>  There are also many positive reviews about this place. On the way to the monastery you can admire the beautiful mountain nature of Crimea.  Photographing is prohibited inside buildings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="it.tripadvisor.ch" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holy Assumption Monastery" class="if uuid-2441549" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2441549.jpg"></div><h2>  Miniature Park </h2><p>  Fairly ‚Äúyoung‚Äù sight of Bakhchisaray and Crimea.  The park was opened only in 2013.  Now in a short period of time you can visit all the interesting places of the peninsula at once.  Here are miniatures of the Sudak fortress, the Vorontsov and Livadia palaces, the Khan's palace and others.  Also in the park you can see the monuments and sights of Ukraine and the whole world.  There are 53 exhibits in total and they were made on a scale of 1:25. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For children there is a separate part - the fairy tale park, where you can see almost all the characters of popular cartoons. </p><p>  The reviews are good about this place, but it should be remembered that there are no shops and cafes in the area, so you should take care of the availability of water in advance.  And do not forget to look at the zoo, which is located right there. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Miniature Park" class="if uuid-2441554" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2441554.jpg"></div><h2>  Chapel of St. Michael the Archangel </h2><p>  This is another attraction of the city of Bakhchisarai and a monument to the heroes of the Crimean War.  There is a chapel in the Russian settlement.  This area was named after the war, when the hospital was located here, a cemetery was arranged.  The chapel was erected in honor of the 40th anniversary of the Crimean War and erected over the mass grave in 1895. </p><h2>  Chufut-Kale and the Karaite cemetery </h2><p>  At 3.5 kilometers from the Khan's Palace is an ancient cave fortress called Chufut-Kale.  During the construction it was planned that it would be a fortification settlement on the border with Byzantium. </p><p>  The most interesting thing is that there is a secret gate, that is, you can notice them only when you come close to the fortification wall.  In front of the fortress there are 10 caves in 3 tiers. </p><p>  Not far from the fortress is the Karaite cemetery - the largest churchyard in all of Europe.  It acted in the period from VI to XIII centuries.  They buried here the deceased, professing Judaism.  A distinctive feature of the burial is that all the graves are located from north to south.  This is inherent in the ancient religion of the Karaites. </p><p>  Everyone who visited this place says that along with the fact that the cemetery is a little creepy, it‚Äôs very interesting that ancient inscriptions are completely preserved on some tombstones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mapofukraine.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Chufut-Kale and the Karaite cemetery" class="if uuid-2441556" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2441556.jpg"></div><h2>  Cave city </h2><p>  In the district of the city there is another attraction of Bakhchisarai - the ancient <span>cave city of</span> Mangul-Kale.  The ancient fortress is located on the plateau of Baba Dag Mountain.  The slope itself is inaccessible, which was an additional defense against enemies.  The fortification has a length of 1.5 kilometers. </p><p>  Researchers believe that Scythians and Sarmatians populated these places.  And it was back in the 3rd or 4th century before the advent of our era.  During the period of the appearance of the Alans on these lands, fortifications appeared, and this was in the 5th century BC.  For several centuries the city passed from hand to hand.  In 1475, it was under the Ottoman Empire, and it was then that the most ambitious construction work began.  During the Second World War, the city was an observation post. </p><p>  According to travelers, this is a beautiful place in Crimea, but for some people, climbing a mountain will seem quite difficult. </p><div class="photo" data-original="adonis-crimea.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cave city" class="if uuid-2441567" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2441567.jpg"></div><h2>  Crimean Astrophysical Observatory </h2><p>  Description of the sights of Bakhchisaray and Crimea should begin with the fact that the observatory has a long history.  During the existence of the USSR, it played a dominant role in scientific life.  Located at an altitude of 600 meters. </p><p>  It is clear that it is better to come here in the evening, when it is possible to see celestial bodies through a telescope. </p><div class="photo" data-original="itog.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crimean Astrophysical Observatory" class="if uuid-2441559" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2441559.jpg"></div><h2>  Sphinxes of the Carales Valley </h2><p>  This is one of the most interesting sights of Bakhchisarai and its environs.  This monument, created by the hands of nature itself.  Sphinxes are located near the village of Zalesnoye.  These are 5 stones towering above the ground to a height of 13 to 15 meters.  Outwardly, they are very similar to the statues located on Easter Island, but in contrast to them they are the result of natural processes. </p><p>  Experienced tourists recommend climbing from the side of the village of Tankovoye.  First of all, from here it is easiest to climb and spend no more than 40 minutes on the road.  You should not postpone the visit to the Sphinxes in the fall, as a rule, all roads and trails are very washed out by water. </p><p>  By the way, the local population gave each stone its own individual name, and this complex is called "Dolls".  The largest stone is called "Pregnant," followed by "Pointed," "Chest," and so on. </p><p>  According to some visitors to this place, from the side of a donkey farm, the sphinxes do not look at all.  To see their beauty, you need to look at them from a certain angle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tourprom.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sphinxes of the Carales Valley" class="if uuid-2441563" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2441563.jpg"></div><h2>  Martian lake </h2><p>  The reservoir is located along the route from Simferopol to Bakhchisaray.  During the Soviet period, it was a place for the extraction of limestone.  At some point, a powerful source was discovered at the bottom, which flooded the quarry in an instant.  However, there was too much need for limestone, and pumps were installed to pump water, production did not stop. </p><p>  Already in the 90s of the last century, production was stopped, and the quarry was again completely flooded with water.  Now it is a lake with a 10-meter depth.  Tourists come here to admire the blue waters of the reservoir. </p>
