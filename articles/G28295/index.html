Baikal is able to provide the traveler with an extreme form of relaxation that can cause him a special surge of emotions and adrenaline.  This is especially promoted by the dynamic rafting along the mountain rivers of the territory of Lake Baikal.  Such water travels are noteworthy in that, after such a trip, the tourist is not indifferent to this type of rest. </p><p>  It is worth at least once to see the wild nature of the Siberian taiga, rafting along a stormy river with a group of comrades.  Memories of the euphoria of such a trip will accompany many years.  So, remember that mountain rivers originate in the upper reaches of the mountains.  River layers of water rush down from there - to the plateaus and plains.  Due to sudden changes in altitude, the flow rate of mountain rivers ranges from 25 to 30 kilometers per hour.  The number of obstacles encountered along the course of the course (rocks, waterfalls) determines the category of complexity of the water alloy. </p><p>  The first category includes calm water, the sixth - obstacles with waterfalls and rapids reaching up to 15 meters.  Tourists can conquer such mountain rivers on rafts.  This is the most popular boat for such an extreme form of recreation.  It is an inflatable boat.  Its bottom contains holes for draining the water that has got inside the boat. </p><p>  Raft differs from ordinary inflatable boats in that its design is reinforced with a durable shell, special fastenings for travelers' legs and two-layer balloons.  Raft is used when passing water obstacles of 1-5 category of difficulty. </p><p>  To get more acute emotions when passing rapids, tourists use a catamaran.  These are two inflatable balloons made of very durable material, which are interconnected by an aluminum partition.  A catamaran on the water is well stable and gives a stronger feeling than a raft. </p><p>  To control the catamaran, more precise actions are needed.  Usually it accommodates 2-4 people.  On such a device, the passage of water obstacles from 1 to 6 categories of complexity is possible. </p><p>  If you ask yourself where to go to Lake Baikal, then you should make a trip to the top of Mount Munku - Sardyk.  Such a trip can be unforgettable, as this place is considered the highest point in Eastern Siberia.  Tourists who have reached the snow-white summit will enjoy stunning views of the lakes frozen under the ice.  At this moment, the <span>nature of Lake Baikal</span> will seem incredible!  The best time to enjoy such beauty is April and May. </p><p>  Tourists who have visited Baikal more than once note that, most likely, this trip will change a beginner.  The mystery of this Siberian place can affect the subtle soul strings of a person, awakening in him a sense of novelty and harmony. </p>
