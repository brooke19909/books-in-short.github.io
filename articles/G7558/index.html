There is such and not far from Voronezh.  We are talking about the <span>Cretaceous Lake</span> in Semiluki.  In the last century, in the 80s, in these places there was a chalk quarry, in which chalk was mined for household needs.  In 1985, the development of the facility was discontinued.  Years passed, and in 2003 the question arose of what to do next.  There were two options: to rehabilitate the quarry by investing a lot of finances in it, or to equip its territory for sporting events.  And so the “White Well” arose - Voronezh received a new sports complex. </p><h2>  What are they doing here </h2>

    <p>  Firstly, it should be noted that the sports complex was created at the expense of initiative people who invested their own funds in this business.  And now this facility is the only such complex located in the Central Black Earth region.  In addition, IC “White Well” (Voronezh) has become almost the main center of Russian motor sports.  Every year, athletes from all over Russia gather here to show their skills at official starts in the following disciplines: rally cross, karting, drag racing, drifting (since 2013) and cross.  All routes were built in full compliance with the requirements of the Russian Federation, including safety.  They are equipped with safety fences in visual places, special fences and chippers.  They host many different competitions, such as the stages of the Russian Rally Championship, the White Well Cup in drag racing, the Total Extreme Fest drifting stage and others. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In order for athletes to maintain their athletic form at a high level, regular trainings are held here.

    <p>  Due to the fact that the sports complex is located at a distance of 12 kilometers from the city limits, it is preferable to get to it by car.  We do it as follows.  We leave the city on the Kursk highway A144 and drive towards the traffic police post.  We pass him, then through <span>the Don river,</span> pass the turn to the city of Ostrogozhsk and drive about two more kilometers.  Before reaching the village of Devitsa, you will see a road sign to the White Well sports complex.  Voronezh has already held several sporting events there this year.  On October 5, the final - stage of the Russian Championship in auto racing.  The Champion of the country will be determined, therefore a sea of ​​impressions from the fight is expected.  Come! </p>
