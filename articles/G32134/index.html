    <p>  Dulles‚Äôs plan is presented by his supporters as a strategy carefully designed at the beginning of the Cold War by US intelligence agencies to undermine the moral foundations of Soviet society, and then bring the Soviet people to their knees with its negative population growth, high crime rate, drug addiction, low educational level, and so on. .  Moreover, to achieve these trends - the decomposition of Soviet society - the CIA was going through the imposition of base values ‚Äã‚Äãthrough mass culture: cruel films, pornography, a cult of drugs, violence, base music, cheap life priorities and landmarks.  It is easy to notice <span>that such a</span> plan by Dulles to destroy Russia is fully correlated with the domestic reality of the last two decades.  And therefore it is even easier to believe in him, clutching his head from the suddenly revealed truth.  However, <span>this is falsification.</span>  Very popular, having accumulated a certain semblance of <span>evidence,</span> and yet falsification. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In fact, in 1945, there was no report by the director of the CIA to the American Congress referenced by the hoaxers.  For the first time this text was published already in independent Russia in 1993 in Russian in the publication "Soviet Russia".  Very soon, the ‚Äúdocument‚Äù, blaming all the blame for the people's corruption on foreign ill-wishers, was picked up by other national publications, politicians and public figures of national-patriotic views.  Among them, for example, Vladimir Zhirinovsky and Mikhail Zadornov.  However, this whole plot has a number of inconsistencies.  First of all, the fact of the report of the CIA director in 1945 does not make sense already because the CIA was created only two years later.  Moreover, Allen Dulles became its head only in 1953.  The US policy on maintaining the secrecy of documentation has a limit of 50 years, so all documents of the 1940s have already been declassified.  As the reader guesses, there is no such plan there.  In addition, the stake in these years in a likely hypothetical confrontation was made more on <span>nuclear weapons,</span> which in 1945 the United States already had, but the USSR did not.  Of course, all this does not yet seem sufficiently convincing exposure.  The true falsity of the text was revealed when it was discovered that it was almost completely and literally taken from the fiction novel ‚ÄúThe Eternal Call‚Äù by the Soviet writer Anatoly Ivanov, an exciting but completely fictional one.  Giving the right context and gave that passage </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dulles plan for the collapse of the USSR" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/267782.jpg" width="245"></div>  the shade that excites the minds of our compatriots today.

    <p>  Acts, although it does not exist </p><p>  People love beautiful conspiracy theories (of which Dulles‚Äôs plan is without a doubt) - alien plates hidden by the government, incredible technology of medieval Slavs, Egyptians, Indians.  Plots can be found for every taste.  And at the same time, a real scientific approach is distinguished by criticality, healthy skepticism and repeated cross-checking of the proposed ideas and facts.  Like many similar alternative theories, the Dulles plan crumbles like a house of cards, you just have to dig deeper, listen to critics, and not just sweethearted hoaxers, who can read the story without a clear methodological justification and try to find real historical sources.  At the same time, the fact that such a seriously developed concept never existed in the plans of the CIA (as far as one can judge from available and real sources) does not cancel out many deplorable trends in our country.  Moreover, this, perhaps, even exacerbates them.  After all, the blame for the moral corruption of the Russians lies not with some special services, but more with domestic politicians, oligarchs, and the people who allow this. </p>
