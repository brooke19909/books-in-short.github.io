Diapers, strollers, diapers, crib ... And what about the crib?  Mattress, bedding, sides, canopy ... Does <span>a child</span> need a <span>canopy for a crib?</span>  Or is it better without him?  Yes, and it costs a lot.  But for my crumbs I want all the best! </p><h2>  Canopy: Pros and Cons </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.labellesophie.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Canopy tent of 3 canvases" class="if uuid-2435627" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2435627.jpg"></div><p>  Canopy - a piece of fabric, fixed above the bed and covering it like a curtain.  It has a number of advantages and disadvantages.  The benefits include the following: </p><ul><li>  Insect protection.  In the summer, it is simply necessary, especially if the child has a tendency to allergies. </li><li>  Protection against bright light.  A newborn child gradually gets used to the presence of light in his life, so for the first time he will be uncomfortable under bright light.  And to sleep in direct sunlight is not always possible even in adults. </li><li>  Noise protection.  Despite the fact that the canopies are made from light translucent fabrics, they still muffle sounds a bit, which contributes to a sound sleep of the child. </li><li>  Dust protection.  Although many mothers are sure that canopy dusting is its main drawback, it is still a plus, since otherwise this dust would be inside the crib on bedding, toys and the little one. </li><li>  Draft protection.  Even in winter, it is necessary to ventilate the room in which the child is.  In the presence of a canopy, you can not worry that the child will blow, even if you open the window while the baby is sleeping.  In this case, it is not necessary to completely close the bed, it is enough to fence off it only from the side of a possible air flow. </li><li>  Protection against the cold.  In a small enclosed space, heat is easier to keep than in a large room, therefore, at a low temperature in the room, the canopy will help maintain a comfortable temperature within the crib. </li><li>  If the room has dry air, you do not have to buy a humidifier or hang batteries with wet towels.  It is enough to spray the canopy from the spray bottle with water, this will increase the humidity not only in the whole room, but inside the crib. </li><li>  Creation of comfort.  A small child is often uncomfortable in a large room.  The canopy allows you to create a cozy nest in which the baby will be comfortable.  In addition, it can become one of the most important elements of the decor of a children's room, creating a fabulous and airy atmosphere. </li></ul><p>  But, like any thing, a canopy on a crib also has some disadvantages: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Dust collection.  It really retains a lot of dust on itself, so it must be washed every week.  Due to this, additional work is created for mom, the time for which is usually not so much. </li><li>  Difficulty in air intake.  Like any fabric, the canopy prevents oxygen from entering the enclosed area. </li><li>  Space reduction.  The canopy takes up a lot of space, focusing on the crib.  Therefore, in a small room it is better not to use it, since it will visually make it even smaller. </li></ul><p>  If you still decide to decorate the crib with a canopy, you must choose what it will be. </p><h2>  Types of canopies </h2><p>  There are a lot of curtains on the bed, their shape and fastening depend on the design of the bed, its location and the functions of the canopy itself.  The following types can be distinguished: </p><ul><li>  By appointment: decorative, protective, dimming. </li><li>  By location above the head, in the center, around the perimeter. </li><li>  In the form: curtain, tent, scarf, scarf, skirt. </li></ul><h2>  Fabric selection </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Original canopy" class="if uuid-2435631" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2435631.jpg"></div><p>  The fabric for the canopy on the crib should ideally be made of natural fibers, but this is not always possible, therefore, along with satin and cotton, a veil and organza are used.  They allow you to make an air curtain that will better pass air and will not clutter the room visually.  As for color, it will depend on the overall design of the room.  As a rule, the color of the canopy is combined with the tone of the curtains, bedspreads, pillows or other textile elements.  The second option is a shade close to the color of the wallpaper.  In this case, he will fully fulfill his mission, while not greatly distorting the space of the room. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  And yet, how to sew a canopy on a crib?  Consider the process and patterns in more detail. </p><h2>  Canopy skirt </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.dhgate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Classic canopy" class="if uuid-2435595" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2435595.jpg"></div><p>  This is a classic canopy that can be bought at any store.  However, there is nothing better than doing it yourself with a love canopy on a crib. </p><h2>  Fabric consumption </h2><p>  In order to sew a canopy, the following measurements will be required: </p><ul><li>  The perimeter of the crib. </li><li>  Height from mount to bottom of crib. </li><li>  The perimeter of the upper part of the mount on which the canopy is worn. </li><li>  The height of the decorative elements. </li></ul><p>  Based on them, we make the following calculations: </p><p>  The length of the canvas = the perimeter of the crib + 10 ... 20 cm + allowances for the seams. </p><p>  Web height = height from attachment to bottom + seam allowances. </p><p>  Decor: length = perimeter of the top of the mount * 1.5 ... 4, depending on the desired volume of folds.  If you make several rows of decor, their length should vary by 1.5-2 times, otherwise all layers will fold into one fold and will not be visible. </p><p>  In addition, you will need a lace ribbon, the length of which is equal to the sum of the lengths of 2 tiers of decor + allowances for seams. </p><h2>  Pattern </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Classic canopy pattern" class="if uuid-2436421" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2436421.jpg"></div><p>  The pattern of such a canopy is very simple.  It consists of 3 rectangles, 2 of which are cut out from a plain veil, and the third from lace or a veil with embroidery. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Manufacture </h2><p>  Consider the process of making your own canopy on a crib step by step: </p><ol><li>  Process the edges of all paintings with an overlock. </li><li>  Hem the bottom cut and the side edges of the main fabric, departing from the edge of 1 cm. </li><li>  Sew a lace ribbon to the lower edges of the decor, sew the sides of both parts, not reaching the top edge of 4 cm, to get two circles. </li><li>  Sew the top of the main canvas and a wide strip of decor with a wide step or manually and, pulling the thread, pick up the fabric to the perimeter of the upper part of the mount. </li><li>  Lay folds on a narrow strip of decor, its length should also be equal to the perimeter of the mount. </li><li>  Fold 2 details of the decor and sweep them together along the upper edge, and sweep the main fabric 4 cm below the upper edge, positioning it so that the seam on the decor matches half the length of the canvas. </li><li>  Bend the upper edge of the decor by 2 centimeters and stitch so that the upper edge of the main canvas is inside the bend.  The ends should remain unstitched. </li></ol><p>  The canopy for the crib is ready.  To install it, it is necessary to remove the upper part from the mount, pass it through the upper bend of the decor.  Then fix it on the rack so that the <span>canopy holder</span> on the crib remains under the main canvas.  Distribute the main fabric along the perimeter of the crib. </p><h2>  Canopy curtain </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.bandbsnestinteriors.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Closed-top canopy with lambriken" class="if uuid-2435686" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2435686.jpg"></div><p>  This type of canopy for cots requires a certain design.  Usually the lateral racks of berths for babies are initially elongated and connected by horizontal rungs to which the fabric webs are attached.  With such a canopy, more air will flow into the crib, but it will be less protective against dust and insects. </p><h2>  Fabric consumption </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.mediumitalic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Canopy curtain" class="if uuid-2435666" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2435666.jpg"></div><p>  To sew a canopy on your crib with your own hands, the photo of which is higher, you need 2 fabric cuts, their width should be equal to 0.75 of the length of the front crossbar + allowances for seams, and 2 cuts of a width of 1.5 lengths of the side crossbar.  You can choose any canopy length. </p><h2>  Manufacture </h2><p>  Step-by-step process: </p><ol><li>  Carve 4 parts of a rectangular shape. </li><li>  Treat the sides and bottom of each part with an overlock or hem with a double hem. </li><li>  Bend 1 cm from the top, and then another 5 cm, stitch.  The edge of the cut should remain inside the hem. </li></ol><p>  The canopy is ready.  The upper rails must be removed, put on the curtains and set back.  Decorate with a knot or pickups. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.loversiq.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Canopy on a semicircular mount" class="if uuid-2435681" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2435681.jpg"></div><p>  Using the same principle, you can sew your own canopy on a crib on a semicircular mount, the role of which can be played by a flexible metal-plastic tube or half of a gymnastic hoop. </p><h2>  Canopy scarf </h2><div class="photo" data-original="img.etsystatic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Canopy imitation" class="if uuid-2435654" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2435654.jpg"></div><p>  This type of canopy has the simplest manufacturing process.  They can be of 2 types: decorative (as in the photo), which is attached to the wall, or more practical, it is fixed on a bracket protruding 30-50 cm from the wall. </p><h2>  Fabric calculation </h2><p>  For a decorative canopy on a crib, the photo of which is presented above, you will need a piece of fabric equal to two distances from the attachment point to the side rack + 2 crib heights.  Or make it from 2 cuts, which will save fabric.  Connect them then at the attachment point.  The cut width is 50-75 cm. </p><p>  For the second species, the length will be the same, but the width is from 1.5 to 2 meters.  This will allow you to completely close the crib in front, if necessary.  In this case, the back wall will remain open. </p><h2>  Manufacture </h2><p>  For the first option, it is enough to process the edges, the second option of such a canopy will need to be fastened.  To do this, the cut must be folded in half, if it is made of 2 parts, then sew them, then fold along the seam line with the front side out and stitch one more time, departing from the edge of 5-6 cm. </p><p>  For mounting, a bracket from a bookshelf with the end bent upwards, or, for example, a piece of a round curtain, attached with an end to the wall, is suitable.  The main thing is that the free end of the pipe is closed or bent so that the canopy does not move out. </p><h2>  Canopy tent </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.tosave.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Canopy tent" class="if uuid-2435607" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2435607.jpg"></div><p>  This type of canopy is gaining popularity recently.  The shape of the top, it resembles a tent, the basis of which is a gymnastic hoop, and to fix the product, you need the same fastening as for a chandelier, for example, a mounting hook.  It must be fixed on the ceiling in the place where the canopy will be located. </p><h2>  Pattern and calculations </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Canopy tent tent" class="if uuid-2440714" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2440714.jpg"></div><p>  The pattern consists of 10 elements: the main canvas of the tent, 8 parts of the dome and the fastening tape. </p><p>  To make the tent look most attractive, you must carefully calculate the size of the dome sections.  To do this, according to the first triangle in the photo, using the formula for the dependence of the hypotenuse on the legs in a right triangle: c <sup>2</sup> = a <sup>2</sup> + b <sup>2</sup> , where c is the hypotenuse, or the height of the section, and b and the legs, or the height of the dome and the radius of the hoop.  Then, on the second triangle using the same formula, calculate the side of the section.  Here the legs will be the section height and 1/16 of the circumference of the hoop.  For allowances for seams, add 1-1.5 cm on the sides and 3 cm from the bottom. </p><p>  The length of the fastening tape depends on how high the dome of the tent should be.  This can be from 3 to 20 cm. Accordingly, the length of the tape should be 2 times longer + allowances for seams.  Its width is usually 3-5 cm. Instead of it, you can use a slanting inlay or dense braid. </p><h2>  Manufacture </h2><p>  To make the product the way it was intended, it is better to use step-by-step instructions.  The canopy in the shape of a tent is the most difficult of all types. </p><ol><li>  Process the edges of the main fabric with an overlock and hem.  Sew the top with a wide step on a typewriter or manually and seize to the circumference of the hoop. </li><li>  Cut out the details of the dome, work on the edges.  Sew 4 parts together, then sew on the fastener tape, forming a loop from it, and then connect all the dome parts together. </li><li>  Sew the main fabric to the dome in a circle so that the seam is inside the product.  Sew adhesive tape or tape to it to secure the hoop.  They are best placed on each junction of the dome sections. </li><li>  Decorate the canopy as desired, for example, with pompons, ruffles, lace and other accessories. </li></ol><p>  Such a canopy will not only decorate and protect the crib in the first year of the baby‚Äôs life, but then it will become a secluded place for games of already grown children. </p><div class="photo" data-original="freddieandava.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Canopy Use Case" class="if uuid-2435647" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2435647.jpg"></div><p>  Do-it-yourself canopy on the crib is very interesting.  In the process of sewing, the product is filled with love and maternal protection, because it was not for nothing that all the things for children were sewn only manually by future mothers and their relatives.  In addition, this is a wonderful way to create exactly the canopy, the parameters of which will fully meet all the criteria that are important for a particular woman. </p>
