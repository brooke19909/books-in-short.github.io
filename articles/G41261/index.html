Especially when it came to comparing devices made in the candy bar form factor.  Today we‚Äôll talk about the Samsung Duos 3322 phone.  A description of it will be given below, but we will start, perhaps, with the main parameters. </p>

    <h2>  Brief Specifications </h2><p>  Samsung 3322 is equipped with a screen with a diagonal of 2.2 inches.  There is one camera here.  Its <span>resolution</span> is two megapixels.  The amount of internal memory is fifty megabytes.  The device supports two SIM-cards.  Battery capacity is at 1,000 milliamps per hour.  With other weight and size characteristics, the mass of the device itself is 89 grams. </p><h2>  A little bit about the history of creation </h2><p>  Samsung Duos 3322, the technical characteristics of which we just disassembled, was the response of the South Korean developer to the solutions offered by the Finns.  As Nokia has been losing ground as a world leader in the form factor segment, Koreans have gained in popularity, earning a reputation for applying the new pricing policy they are pursuing now.  And what are the goals set by the developers when creating this device? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Firstly, <span>Samsung</span> believed that appearance plays an important role.  In principle, this is logical.  As we like to say, they are greeted by clothes.  Secondly, the Koreans decided to play a quality performance card.  The supervision of the absence of backlash and other marriage was simply colossal.  Thirdly, the company emphasized functionality.  According to the plan of the company's employees, it was precisely due to these three fundamental factors that the new candy bar was supposed to become more popular than the solutions of the Finnish company.  Did the Koreans succeed?  Let's get a look. </p><h2>  Exterior </h2><p>  People who previously used the <span>Nokia 6300</span> model immediately recognize it in Samsung 3322.  Just what they say, on the go.  In general, copying the appearance from competitive devices is a fairly common move in the market of earlier phones, and now smartphones.  And no one sees anything shameful in this.  Of course, the original design is always a plus and all that, but copying is simply left without attention, without making this a drawback.  Although this also needs to be careful.  Samsung 3322 is in many ways similar to the Finnish solution, but there are still distinctive features. </p><h2>  Materials of manufacture </h2><p>  So, Samsung 3322 received a noble appearance thanks to the textured front panel disguised as metal.  Its designers decided to decorate in silver color.  The back cover is made of corrugated plastic.  It is very nice to hold the phone in your hand, no negative feelings arise.  Drop is also unlikely to succeed.  On the right side, you can find the connector standard MicroUSB.  Its developers covered a stub made of plastic. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  A little lower you can find a key that allows you to quickly switch between SIM-cards.  Above is a jack for connecting wired headphones.  It is designed according to the standard 3.5 mm. </p><h2>  Dimensions and usability </h2><p>  This model has the following dimensions: in height it reaches 113.9 mm, while in width and thickness - 47.9 and 13.9 mm.  With these indicators, the mass of the device is 89 grams.  The device lies well in the hand, which has already been noted.  Thanks to the use of high-quality materials, it will be difficult to drop it.  The device is an ordinary "workhorse".  Her developer wanted to give an acceptable appearance that would at the same time correspond to market trends and company traditions. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The display has a TFT standard matrix.  It produces a picture in QVGA quality, with a resolution of 240 by 320 pixels.  The diagonal of the display is 2.2 inches.  Color reproduction at the level of 65,000 shades.  Of course, the quality of the picture leaves much to be desired, since it consists of individual grains.  Well, what to expect from a budget phone?  In principle, everything is typical here.  You can display up to eight text lines and three service lines.  It is impossible to sin on the font, since the size is large enough, it reads well. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Now we are talking about dialing and texting.  The only minus is that the screen fades in sunlight.  However, the text remains readable anyway, for which many thanks to the Koreans. </p><h2>  Keyboard </h2><p>  In terms of functionality, the keys are comfortable and executed efficiently.  The buttons are large, so erroneous touches should not occur.  The navigation key is designed for four positions.  She also excelled.  The digital keyboard has an average stroke, it is quite soft and comfortable.  There is a <span>keyboard backlight,</span> which is made in white.  It is somewhat pale, so it will be distinguishable only in complete darkness.  In sunlight, we will not notice it.  Nevertheless, this can not be called a disadvantage. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  A lithium-ion battery is built into the device as a source of battery life.  Its capacity is 1,000 milliamps per hour.  The manufacturer previously stated that such a battery will be able to "feed" the phone for up to 500 hours in standby time.  And if we talk about the mode of conversation, the figure is much more modest, but it is acceptable - 11.5 hours.  Such a capacity (in the conditions of European cellular networks) is enough for about a couple of days.  This is if you combine voice calls and listening to music.  If you remove one SIM-card, the operating time can be increased by thirty percent. </p>

    <h2>  Communication modules </h2><p>  The Bluetooth module is built into the device.  It supports multiple profiles.  Its version is 2.1.  Such a routine, nothing special.  Wireless headsets are supported.  You can connect your phone to a computer or laptop using a USB-MicroUSB format wire.  In parallel, the device will charge.  It is perfectly perceived by a computer without third-party drivers.  The data transfer rate is at the level of 950 kilobits per second.  In a cellular network it works under the EDGE standard. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  The amount of internal memory is 49 megabytes.  It is almost completely accessible to the user from the very beginning of work with the phone.  To expand the volume, you can install an additional memory card.  To copy files from or to an external drive, you can use the built-in file manager.  But to replace the memory card, the developer provided for the possibility of "Hot swap". </p>

    <h2>  Camera and photographic features </h2><p>  Of course, to call a module with a resolution of 2 megapixels an excellent solution is simply impossible.  It is hardly worth further talking about the fact that the pictures are obtained of mediocre quality.  This should not be stopped.  Video is shot at a resolution of 176 by 144 pixels (minimum).  Frame rate - 15 frames per second. </p><h2>  Equipment set: phone "Samsung Duos 3322" </h2><p>  Instructions, wired headphones, a phone and a battery for it, as well as a charger - that's all that was included in the package of this unit. </p><h2>  Phone Samsung Duos 3322: customer reviews </h2><p>  What do users who purchased this phone say in their reviews?  Among the positive aspects is the quality of communication.  It, in principle, is traditionally in the first place among the South Korean developer.  There are no problems with communication modules.  By audibility, everything is also normal.  The volume is not bad, although not at the highest level.  Nevertheless, the incoming call is heard absolutely under any conditions, even under those that do not have this.  But the average vibrating alert can still be skipped.  Perhaps the Koreans should work in this direction. </p>

    <p>  On the territory of the Russian Federation <span>, Samsung 3322</span> Duos, reviews of which the reader can find in the article, at one time went beyond the price of 3,500 rubles.  Alternative solutions were severely limited.  These were mainly devices from LG, as well as Phillips.  Yes, the Finns offered their options, but they cost significantly more.  Therefore, there is no way to talk about competition within the segment.  However, if you do not need a phone with dual SIM support, you should pay attention to other devices.  Among the disadvantages of the device, buyers allocate a small amount of internal memory.  Yes, and applications do not collapse, they have to be launched in a new way.  The rest are no complaints. </p>
