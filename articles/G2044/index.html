Indeed, in this urban-type settlement, harmony was achieved between developed infrastructure and wild untouched nature.  Kirillovka is located on the cape, and from it two braids diverge into the Sea of ​​Azov - Fedotova and Peresyp.  There is also the <span>island of Biryuchiy,</span> which is a nature reserve.  It is good to lie on a soft sand under a hot sun.  But such a pastime quickly becomes boring.  It diversifies the rest with events and energizes the guests of the resort called Kirillovka Water Park "Treasure Island" with positive emotions.  It opened recently, but has already become <span>a byword.</span>  Besides the fact that this is the largest <span>water park in Ukraine,</span> what else can this town of water entertainments amaze visitors with?

    <h2>  Security, infrastructure </h2><p>  The rides on Treasure Island are impressive (especially for adults).  But with all its tortuosity and height, they are absolutely safe.  You don’t like pools, because it smells like bleach?  But this does not apply to the tanks that are in the resort, known as Kirillovka.  The water park has its own well.  Water is supplied from a depth of one hundred and fifty meters.  Before being fed to the pools, it undergoes double cleaning: through various fractions of hydrous anthracite and <span>quartz sand</span> .  Therefore, water in its composition meets all sanitary requirements and is equated to drinking.  All paths on the sides of the pools are made of special tiles that do not slip when wet.  The water park has a video surveillance system.  There are dressing rooms, lockers, safes, a pharmacy, a first-aid post.  At the entrance to the water park there is parking.  At the pools and at the rides, qualified lifeguards are constantly on duty. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kirillovka water park treasure island" class="if" height="307" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1165127.jpg" width="585"></div>

These prices were relevant in the summer of 2015. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kirillovka water park treasure island" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1166170.jpg" width="600"></div>
