    <p>  In the town of Pieva there is another attraction - the church of St. Giovanni and Stefano.  That's not all.  Not far from Lido di Camaiore, there is another historical monument - St. Peter's Abbey, which was built in the eighth century. </p><p>  Experienced tourists definitely recommend visiting the Tuscan islands and the town of Carrara. </p><h2>  Tuscan archipelago </h2><p>  The Tuscan archipelago has seven islands: Pianosa, Montecristo, Gorgon, Giannutri, Giglio and Elba.

    <p>  Montecristo Island has been a nature reserve since 1971.  This is the wildest and most unpopulated area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe archipelago.  There are no buildings on the island, except for a villa of the era of the XIX century, which once belonged to a certain Englishman. </p><h2>  Elba </h2><p>  The island is quite small.  Its length is only 27 kilometers and a width of 18 km.  Elba is famous for its stunning beaches, of which there are more than 70. All of them are framed by stunning cliffs and diverse Mediterranean vegetation.  No less impressive and underwater world of the island.  Along the coast stretch "underwater gardens", which are always of interest to divers. </p><p>  The largest beach is called Barabarka.  The water in the local lagoon is crystal clear.  It offers beautiful views of Stella Bay.

In summer, the Algotherapy Center, popular in Europe, operates, practicing sunbathing with healing algae. </p><h2>  Resort reviews </h2><p>  Lido di Camaiore, according to tourists, should be attributed to the quiet and peaceful resorts.  If you want to have a good time on the beautiful coast and enjoy the beauty of the Mediterranean nature, then you simply cannot find a better place.  Much has been said and written about the local beaches.  They are truly beautiful in every way.  For those who wish to visit the wilder and unaffected beaches, it is worth going to the Tuscan islands.  No wonder tourists divers love them very much. </p><p>  In general, all kinds of entertainment and attractions are enough in Lido di Camaiore itself, which is very important if you come on vacation with a baby.  And with older children, you can safely go on all excursions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lido di camaiore reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1921440.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The resort is so beautiful that perhaps the whole season is not enough to fully enjoy it.  What are the most beautiful local gardens, consisting of fruit trees that give coolness on hot days.  In the evenings, you can spend hours walking along the cobbled streets, admiring the flowers and fountains. </p><p>  Experienced tourists who have visited the resort more than once say that the choice of hotels in the city is very diverse.  Of course, it is better to give preference to one of the institutions on the waterfront.  However, other areas of the city are good.  As a place of residence, you can choose not only one of the hotels, but also one of the many villas, among which there are completely secluded houses in picturesque places.  Housing should be selected depending on which company you come from and how you plan to spend time.  Experienced travelers recommend diversifying a beach holiday with a visit to the attractions of Lido di Camaiore. </p>
