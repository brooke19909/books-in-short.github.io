But the Kherson region borders on the Republic of Crimea and is washed by the waters of the same Black Sea.  The sights of the region do not end there, because in the southeast it borders on the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov, add 6 rivers and a reservoir to this.  A number of unique parks, reserves and reserves provide an opportunity for active and informative recreation.  The abundance of reservoirs fulfills the dreams of all vacationers in the summer. </p><h2>  Geographical position </h2><p>  Kherson region is located in the south of Ukraine, within the Black Sea lowland.  Its western part borders with the Mykolayiv region, the eastern part - with the Zaporizhzhya region, and the northern part - with the Dnipropetrovsk region.  The southern part overlooks the Crimea and, as already mentioned, is washed immediately by two seas.  Along the sea coast stretches of sand spits, bays and islets.  This region occupies a large territory, about 30,000 km <sup>2</sup> .  The landscape here is quite monotonous, far from tropical delights.  Plain terrain, salt marshes, mostly steppe.  But the abundance of water sources creates lush green oases, so pleasing to the eye. </p>

This is one of the most beautiful and fertile regions of Ukraine.  In addition to agriculture, industry is well developed here, a small region provides a third of the country's mechanical engineering.  And, of course, tourism, - no other region of Ukraine can boast of such an influx of tourists.  The affectionate coasts of the Black and Azov Seas, as well as reasonable prices, bring people here from all over the former Soviet Union.  Rest in the Kherson region will be remembered for a long time. </p>
