Foreigners mastered new raw material bases, so it was logical to observe the emergence of new workers' settlements on the territory of the Russian Empire.  The city of Stalin was originally called Yuzovka. </p>

    <p>  The village developed very quickly.  From 1870 to 1901, the number of residents of Yuzovka increased from 164 to 54718 people.  Such demographic growth is associated with the constant creation of new metallurgical enterprises and the opening of coal mines.  The Stalin region essentially appeared due to the formation of workers' settlements, which already in the 20th century became large cities of miners and metallurgists. </p><h2>  Creation of Donetsk region </h2><p>  In the 1920s, in the USSR there was an administrative-territorial division of land, adopted even under tsarism.  Provinces, counties and volosts existed practically within the old borders.  The country's leadership absolutely justifiably considered the continued functioning of such a division of territories to be an element of backwardness. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the early 1930s, a reform of the administrative structure of the state was carried out.  Donetsk region was formed in the summer of 1932.  At that time, it was the largest region of the Ukrainian SSR, because it included the lands of the present Donetsk and <span>Lugansk regions</span> (including those controlled by the DNI and LNR organizations).  Managing such a huge area was very difficult, especially in the face of repression and the lack of a developed communications network.  Donetsk region in the old format lasted six years. </p>

    <h2>  Stalin region </h2><p>  This region was actually created within the borders in which the Donetsk region functioned before the advent of the DPR.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe region was 26.5 thousand square meters.  km  As of 1971, the population of the region exceeded 4 million people.  The region was created by order of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of June 3, 1938.  Under this name, the Stalin region lasted until 1961.  Then the region was returned to its old name. </p>

    <p>  The region with the center in the city of Stalin (Donetsk) is a large industrial region.  In principle, this was originally conceived by English entrepreneurs who created the village of Yuzovka.  In the city itself there were more than 20 coal mines, as well as well-known metallurgical plants. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The administrative structure of the region is very clearly visible as of September 1, 1946.  At that time, in the Donetsk (Stalin) region there were 28 cities (12 of them were of regional subordination) and the same number of districts, 94 villages, 356 village councils (the structure of these councils included 1756 villages).  The region was bordered by Kharkov in the north, with Dnepropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhya in the west, and Lugansk in the east. </p><h2>  Districts of the Stalin Region </h2><p>  We list all the administrative districts of this region alphabetically: </p><ul><li>  Avdeevsky (existed from 1923 to 1930, and also from 1938 to 1962 with a center in the village of Avdeevka); </li><li>  Aleksandrovsky (formed in 1923, located in the north-west of the region, the district center is Aleksandrovka); </li><li>  Amvrosievsky district with a center in the city of Amvrosievka (the population of the district is 45 thousand people); </li><li>  Andreevsky district; </li><li>  Artyomovsky (the district center Artyomovsk is known as the location of a large salt plant); </li></ul>
