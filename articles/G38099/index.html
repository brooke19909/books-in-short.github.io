    <p>  In addition, the year of foundation of Moscow is reliably unknown.  Presumably according to the Pantheon of Russian Sovereigns, Moscow was founded in 880, at the end of the ninth century.  According to historical data, it was in this year that Oleg, who was not yet the guardian of Igor‚Äôs throne, but was only Prince of Urmansky, came to the Moscow River, then called Smorodina or Samorodinka.  Here, at the mouth of <span>the Neglinnaya River,</span> he laid the town, which was named after the river - Moscow.  After that, for more than two and a half centuries, or rather 267 years, nothing was known about Moscow. </p><p>  It was first mentioned on the pages of the <span>Ipatiev Chronicle</span> in 1147.  This year, a meeting of Suzdal Prince <span>Yuri Dolgoruky</span> with his ally, Novgorod-Seversky Prince Svyatoslav Olgovich, took place here.  It is worth noting that for a long time the foundation of Moscow was attributed to this particular year.  Then Moscow was a small settlement owned by a rich and famous man, Stepan Ivanovich Kuchko, and it was called Kuchkov. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow foundation date" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10436/14314.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In historical documents, it was noted that the house of Stepan Kuchko at that time was located near modern Chistye Prudy, and in the place of the Kremlin an impenetrable dense forest was noisy.  In total, at that time there were six Kuchkovo villages: Vorobyevo, Vysotsky, Kudrino, Kulishki, Simonovo and Suschevo.  There is an assumption that Stepan Kuchko was from Novgorod, as his name is quite common in connection with the mention of Novgorod zemstvo. </p><p>  The founding of Moscow, the date of which is still unknown, despite the fact that the 850th anniversary was celebrated in 1997, causes a lot of controversy among historians.  Discussions among experts are even caused by the name of the Russian capital - ‚ÄúMoscow‚Äù.  There are many versions.  The main one is the name given to the river that flowed in this place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="year of foundation of Moscow" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10436/14341.jpg" width="303"></div>

    <p>  According to linguists, in ancient times there was a Slavic word, which had the root "mosk", which means "viscous, marshy."  In Russian speech, words with this root include ‚Äúmosquito‚Äù, which has derivatives ‚Äúmosquito‚Äù (wet).  That is why it is said about the "brainy", "dank" weather.  According to this version, the name "Moscow", which was the original "Mosca", comes from the ancient Slavic word "moisture". </p><p>  Despite the fact that there are no reliable data on such an event as the founding of Moscow, they are successfully compensated by the mass of legends that are both popular and not very true, and little resemble the truth.  There are eight main legends that describe the foundation of Moscow.  We talked about some, more believable, above, others remain a mystery to many generations in the future.  However, in spite of everything, the small town, once founded at the <span>mouth of the river,</span> was able to grow to gigantic proportions. </p>
