    <p>  Sri Lanka is an island of Buddhist worship.  Locals are very jealous of their religion and shrines.  It‚Äôs easy not to offend the feelings of faithful Buddhists: it‚Äôs enough when you enter the Buddha‚Äôs temple to not turn your back on his images and statues.  Before entering, make sure that the length of the sleeves of your clothes reaches the tassels, and your feet are bare - this is the traditional form that allows you to visit the temple. </p><p>  Only here is it possible to taste real <span>Indian tea,</span> which is grown in Sri Lanka.  Nothing beats its scent. </p><p>  Also, these lands are famous for their precious stones, products from which can be purchased at specialized factories or in stores officially representing them.  Buying at these points of sale can save you from the difficulties associated with the export of jewelry at customs.  Only here are certificates confirming the purchase issued. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Speaking of Sri Lanka, is it possible to forget about the magnificent batik made here?  The best quality fabric, the lowest prices for it.  Magnificent Indian silk and chintz, and especially products from them, are famous all over the world. </p><p>  More about the prosaic nuances of relaxing in Sri Lanka: how much to fly to Sri Lanka from Moscow?  Which flight to choose?  Do I need a visa?

    <h2>  How much to fly to Sri Lanka from Moscow? </h2><p>  The answer to this question is not only known to birds.  Detailed information on how much to fly to Sri Lanka from Moscow can be clarified at the box office of the selected airport. </p><p>  Today it is possible to carry out a flight ‚ÄúMoscow - Sri Lanka‚Äù both with a direct flight and with a transfer.  In addition, you can overcome the path to a distant country with charter flights, which are the most comfortable, but also the most expensive type of air service.  It is also difficult to buy a ticket for these flights, as they are mainly sold through a network of various travel agencies. </p><h2>  Moscow - Sri Lanka: direct flight </h2><p>  A direct flight from the capital of our country to Sri Lanka is possible only on Fridays and Tuesdays.  How much fly to Sri Lanka from Moscow by direct flight?  A distance between the start and finish points of a flight of approximately six and a half thousand kilometers can be covered in about 9 hours. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  How much does a flight cost?  From 21.5 thousand Russian rubles to 26.7 thousand.  The Moscow-Sri Lanka transfer route, with a flight time of up to nineteen hours, is carried out via Germany, the UAE or various <span>Indian airports.</span>  Such routes are very exhausting and tiring. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow-Sri Lanka.

    <h2>  Visa to Sri Lanka </h2><p>  A visa will cost no more than twenty US dollars.  It is issued directly at the Colombo airport in Sri Lanka upon preliminary submission of an application for its receipt or is ordered on specialized sites in advance. </p><h2>  A little more prose about Sri Lanka, or What should a tourist be afraid of? </h2><p>  With all the splendor of a holiday in Sri Lanka, there are several nuances that need to be taken into account.  If the desire to relax in the sea resorts of this blessed island arises in the middle of summer, then the weather will surely ruin the vacation.  The rainy season is here at this time.  The tourist season begins in October. </p><p>  The second trouble that can befall a tourist is the heat.  Not only can it provoke serious complications in the state of core health, but heat is often the cause of infectious diseases.  Carefully wash the purchased <span>exotic fruits</span> and do not drink tap water.  Having refused to buy food on the streets, it will be easier for you to maintain the health of your gastrointestinal tract. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow_Sri Lanka.

    <p>  But the most dangerous thing that can lie in wait for an ignorant tourist is monkeys!  Cunning animals strive to steal everything that has been left unattended, climb into the window of your room, turn everything upside down in your absence and cause trouble.  What to do?  A little vigilance and attentiveness to valuable things, tightly closed windows - and the problem is solved. </p><p>  However, these pranks - a rather funny and exotic nuisance - are capable, in addition to their harmful pranks, of unprecedented quick wits, resourcefulness and tricks that can bring our tourist to tears of laughter. </p>
