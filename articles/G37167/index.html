    <h2>  Sevastopol </h2><p>  Almost all cities of Crimea have a lot of advantages.  But it is this settlement with the passage of time that is becoming more interesting and more attractive for vacationers.  What is the reason?  As it turned out, the reason lies not only in a convenient geographical location, favorable weather and an amazing history.  People come here because most of them can afford a vacation in this city.  There is cheap, but not bad housing.  In addition, everyone can have fun in the most attractive way for themselves, while not completely emptying their wallet.  And the beaches located near cozy bays pleasantly surprise with their beauty and cleanliness. </p>

    <h2>  The most beautiful places </h2><p>  Tourists and locals simply love places like Balaclava, Lyubimovka, Cossack Bay, Uchkuevka, as well as Cape Fiolent.  And this is not surprising, because they are all attractive in their own way.  Many do not even know what cities in Crimea ... Only Sevastopol knows, and that‚Äôs enough for them.  How wrong they are! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In Uchkuyevka there are many small hotels, villas, surrendering houses, health centers, as well as boarding houses.  In general, everyone can choose a vacation to their taste. </p><p>  Lyubimovka is located near the river called Belbek.  Everyone comes here: young people, families, and divers.  The most beautiful that is in Lyubimovka is pebble-sand beaches. </p><p>  Fiolent is a cape in the southwest of the peninsula.  It is also located in Sevastopol.  In addition to the cape itself, locals call this name the whole area, spread over 10 kilometers, where there are small hotels and luxury hotels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how many cities in crimea" class="if" height="298" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/387772.jpg?1399102142925" width="479"></div>

    <p>  Balaclava is a small but picturesque village.  Previously, it had the status of a separate city of Crimea, but now it is part of Sevastopol.  Without exaggeration, the local bay can be called one of the most comfortable and beautiful on the Black Sea.  It is rather deep and narrow, so it is not surprising that there are no emergency incidents. </p><p>  Cossack Bay is perfect for family people who want a measured rest.  Almost on the seashore erected pensions and small hotels. </p><p>  The blue bay is notable mainly for the ruins of the 35th battery.  The <span>mass grave of</span> soldiers is located in this place, and it is already planned to build a memorial complex. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Saki </h2><p>  This city is located on the western <span>coast of Crimea,</span> a few kilometers from the Black Sea.  It is also small, but very cozy and welcoming.  And who needs the large cities of Crimea when there is such a calm and picturesque place? </p><h2>  Therapeutic mud </h2><p>  It is no secret that local dirt is useful in many diseases: it is chronic and acute rheumatism, diseases of the nervous system, aches caused by sexually transmitted diseases and colds, scrofula.  In addition, this treatment is useful for those who have old wounds or fractures.  And this is not the whole list of ailments from which the Saki mud heals. </p>

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  Also in this city there are pebble-sandy beaches and brine.  An inquisitive tourist can visit the Church of St. Elijah, Resort Park and the City Museum.  Separately, it should be said about the temple: it stands on the main square and invariably attracts the attention of vacationers.  It was built in the Russian-Byzantine style.  Also, citizens are proud of their park, founded in 1890.  Usually everyone is happy with the surroundings, but if someone is not happy with something, he can always choose other places to relax.  By the way, do you know how many cities in Crimea?  Eighteen.  So the choice is great enough. </p><h2>  Local lake, Scythian settlement </h2><p>  But back to the Sakas.  The local salt lake is a storehouse of brine and healthy mud.  In the warm season, many tourists come here to heal with it.  No other cities of Crimea attract so many people with any kind of disease.  Mud favorably affects important body functions: respiration, metabolism, excretion, and blood circulation. </p><p>  Are you a fan of history?  Between Yevpatoria and Saki there is an ancient settlement of the Scythians Kara-Tobe, which was built around the 4th century BC. </p><h2>  Zander </h2><p>  All the cities of Crimea are magnificent, but this one is just a godsend for the tourist.  Here you can do whatever your heart desires: just relax, be treated, go sightseeing, of which, believe me, there are many.  People begin to swim in early May, and end in mid-autumn, when grape harvesting is already in full swing. </p><h2>  Bay </h2>

    <h2>  City development </h2><p>  In the 20s of the past century, Sudak began to develop as a resort town.  And after the war, health resorts were actively erected here.  Sudak is the only place on the peninsula that is famous for its unusual beaches.  The fact is that the sand here is not simple, but quartz. </p><p>  Now you know which cities belong to the Crimea, and you can choose the most attractive for recreation.  The peninsula, like a magnet, attracts tourists.  Visit and you are a wonderful place. </p>
