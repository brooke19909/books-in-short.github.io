It is not surprising that the coins of Sweden are of great interest to numismatists and collectors of historical objects, because money has always been a "mirror" of history, you can learn a lot of interesting things about this or that era in the country. </p><h2>  Short story </h2><p>  The national currency of Sweden is the <span>Swedish krona,</span> which the state does not intend to refuse, even though it has joined the European Union. </p>

    <p>  <span>The Swedish krona</span> is divided into <span>exchange coins of</span> Sweden - the era, which will be discussed in this article.  By the way, in the country, coins are used not only of a sample era, but also of the crown. </p><p>  The Swedish krona itself was put into circulation in 1873, but the era began to be used on the territory of the country much earlier.  Today, the number and variety of coins in Sweden is so great that even enthusiastic collectors-numismatists can collect them all their lives, but never collect everything. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Today, coins in Sweden are circulated in the following denominations: one, five and ten kroons, and even money issued in the 19th century is considered an official means of payment. </p><p>  A coin in denomination of 2 kroons was issued between 1876 and 1971. Since 1972, it has been withdrawn from circulation, and now it represents only collectible value. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Until recently, swap coins of the era were used in Sweden, but in 1972 <span>metal coins</span> of one and two era denominations were withdrawn from circulation.  Then, in 1985, the use of Swedish coins in denominations of five and twenty-five era was stopped, and in 1992 the production of ten era was finally stopped. </p><p>  In two stages, there was a rejection of the use of coins in denominations of fifty era.  Initially, they refused to use the money produced in the period from 1875 to 1991, and later in 2010 completely abandoned all coins of this denomination. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="coins sweden photo" class="if" height="233" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47468/1838000.jpg" width="448"></div>

    <p>  Thus, all metal coins of the specimen era were completely withdrawn from circulation gradually.  Such a phasing out of the use of these coins smoothly prepared the population and economy of the country for changes in the financial system of the state. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Due to the huge number and incredible variety of coins in Sweden (you can see some of them in the photo), it is difficult to describe their appearance as a whole, since each can have a completely different design. </p><p>  As a rule, on the front side of the coins a denomination was depicted, over which the crown flaunted.  This is typical for coins of the second half of the XX century.  However, this is not characteristic of all coins, but only for some of them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Not only is the appearance of the coins varied, the material from which they were made is also different.  They were often minted in bronze, however, there are often specimens made from an alloy of copper, zinc and tin.  There are also iron coins of Sweden. </p><p>  In general, there are a lot of difficulties associated with collecting Swedish coins, so far from every numismatist takes this matter seriously.  Indeed, not everyone wants to constantly encounter their features. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Few people wonder what kind of coins are in Sweden.  And the one who nevertheless became puzzled by this and decided to start collecting a collection of Swedish coins should be ready for considerable difficulties in this difficult matter. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what coins are in sweden" class="if" height="301" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47468/1838001.jpg" width="594"></div>

    <p>  The peculiarities and duration of the historical path of Sweden, and together with the whole country and coins, made the process of collecting state coins of this kingdom a very difficult task, which sometimes even experienced numismatist collectors are stupid. </p><p>  However, such a great variety and originality of Swedish coins not only repels, but, on the contrary, attracts the interest of many people who want to plunge deeper into the history and culture of this wonderful Scandinavian country. </p>
