According to legends, in the 14th century, the king of Bohemia, <span>Charles IV</span> (aka the emperor of the Roman Empire) discovered a healing spring while hunting a deer.  The wounded animal plunged into a small body of water and rushed to run with new strength, hiding from its pursuers.  The ruler was astounded and gave the order to found a city where, with the help of wonderful water, he and the nobles regained health and regained strength.  The city was named after him, Carlsbad (later renamed Karlovy Vary), and the symbol was a deer or chamois. </p><h2>  To whom and why it is useful to visit </h2><p>  Today, rest in Karlovy Vary for recovery is chosen by people with digestive tract problems and excess weight, diseases of the spine, joints, to restore the nervous system.  Modern methods of treating with water from thermal springs are based on many years of experience, works and research of balneologists.  Mineral water is used internally for therapeutic purposes; it is used to make water massage and take baths. </p><p>  Sources of the city are arranged in small groups: </p><ul><li>  Three - in the Garden Colonnade: Serpent Spring, Park, Freedom. </li><li>  Six - in the Mill Colonnade: Rock, Libushe, Prince Wenceslas I, Prince Wenceslas II, Mill Spring (radon), Mermaid. </li><li>  Two - in the Market Colonnade: Source, Source of Charles IV. </li><li>  Two - in the Castle Colonnade: Lower and Upper Castle. </li><li>  One is in the Geyser Colonnade (Vrzhidlo). </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.thermal.cz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Thermal source" class="if uuid-2346513" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68143/2346513.jpg"></div><p>  The chemical composition is similar in all sources.  For those who remember the periodic table, it is carbon dioxide-sulphate-sodium water with calcium, lithium iron, bromine, potassium.  The water in the springs differs in temperature (from 30 ¬∞ C to 72 ¬∞ C) and carbon monoxide content (0.3 - 0.7 g / l), which has a different effect on the body and is taken into account when prescribing treatment. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Sources are not a panacea, moreover, under certain conditions, treatment is prohibited.

This is its pluses.  If stories about magic water and healing air, which give health, did not add optimism to your offspring, organize an entertainment program for him in Karlovy Vary with outings in the area. </p><h2>  Amusement park "Plon" </h2><p>  Located near the Czech-German border, the distance to Karlovy Vary is 72 kilometers, but the trip is worth it.  Behind the gate you find yourself in the world of German fairy tales.  Puss in boots, sleeping beauty tell their stories, trees talk, dragons growl and blow smoke - not only children will be impressed.  It is better to arrive in the morning, as the choice of attractions is rather big: a children's railway, a roller coaster, go-karts, trampolines, a walk on the river on a raft, an obstacle course, a maze.  Reindeer, donkeys, goats walk with pleasure in the park and enjoy talking with children. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.freizeitpark-plohn.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amusement Park Plon" class="if uuid-2346547" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68143/2346547.jpg"></div><h2>  Observation tower and funicular ride </h2><p>  Not a single child will refuse to take the Lanovka Imperial or Lanovka Diana funicular to the observation decks "Deer Jump" and "Diana", from where the city will appear, in full view.  Of the interesting things on Diana, kids will find a mini zoo with ponies, goats, pigs and peacocks. </p><h2>  Loket Castle </h2><p>  In the medieval castle of Loket, children can feel like real knights and princesses.  The torture chamber can be skipped, and the wedding and ceremonial halls, the arms room cannot but interest a curious teenager. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bohemianshuttles.cz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Loket Castle" class="if uuid-2346541" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68143/2346541.jpg"></div><p>  Add to a family vacation in the Czech Republic in Karlovy Vary, a trip to Pilsen to visit the Dino Park and the zoo, where the young naturalist will definitely like it.  Two hours away - Prague with an aquarium, a zoo and other activities.  Visit the pools of Karlovy Vary - open with mineral water at the Hotel Termal, closed complexes in Lazne.  Kids will be delighted with the trip on a carriage drawn by three horses. </p><h2>  Which hotels to stay for families with children </h2><p>  You should carefully consider the choice of hotel when traveling with children for treatment.  The fact is that not all sanatoriums are ready to accommodate families with children up to a certain age.  In the specialized hospital, Manes accept children older than two years.  If the kid is five years old, Carlsbad Plaza Medical Spa &amp; Wellness hotel, SmetanaVy≈°ehrad, Krivan hotels are waiting for you.  After another year, from six years old, you can go through the procedures at the Tchaikovsky Hotel and Ostende.  The main group of sanatoriums will accept children 10-12 years of age and older.  Therefore, if the plans are only relaxation, the best choice would be an apart hotel or a good hotel. </p><h2>  Especially for men (and not only) </h2><p>  While mothers relax in the spa and have fun with children, dads can diversify their holidays in Karlovy Vary by stopping by the European Center for Natural Beer Baths, which is located just six kilometers from the city along a picturesque forest road along the river.  The interior of the first half of the 19th century was recreated in the building.  In the courtyard there is a reservoir with carps, which even an inexperienced fisherman can easily catch.  Nearby is another pond with the trout that lives in it.  The catch is baked according to an old recipe in a beech wood stove. </p><p>  Beer, which is brewed here on German equipment, is poured into special wooden containers for procedures.  Beer heated to a comfortable temperature brings an amazing effect: the skin becomes soft, the body is saturated with vitamins, acids and trace elements.  Toxins are removed and a person is charged with energy.  Beer baths are recommended for strengthening the circulatory system, cardiac activity, weight loss and restoration of potency. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.aeroprague.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beer baths" class="if uuid-2346529" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68143/2346529.jpg"></div><p>  Where else is there the opportunity after a walk in the woods with a fishing rod over your shoulder to take a beer bath with an air massage and a glass of fresh beer, which each guest is treated to, have dinner with homemade dishes with a smoke?  Rest and treatment in Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic) will undoubtedly bring benefit and pleasure to all family members. </p>
