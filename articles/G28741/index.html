It was a time of great discoveries and historical feats, both man and technology. </p><h2>  History of creation </h2><p>  In early 1916, it was decided to create another icebreaker, which in terms of its performance will be equal to the cruiser Ermak, which was then part of the Russian fleet.  An English shipbuilding company took up production, she was able to assemble a new vessel in a little more than 6 months.  The brainchild received the proud name "Svyatogor" and in January 1917 it was ready to go out into the open waters, but the tests were postponed.  The reason was the possibility of a threat from German submarines.  And on March 3, the Svyatogor icebreaker was finally able to leave the port and go to sea, but after 15 miles the captain turned the ship back, substantiating his decision with the fact that the steering had serious flaws and errors.  And only on March 31, 1917 the ship - after finalizing and adjusting all the instruments - was able to enter the Russian fleet.  And on August 3, 1927, the icebreaker gets a new name - “Krasin”. </p>

    <h2>  Feats </h2><p>  The icebreaker Krasin is located in St. Petersburg.  It stores many fascinating stories about the heroic achievements of the ship, unique archival and documentary information. <strong> </strong>  During his entire service, he was repeatedly involved in many rescue operations and scientific, research expeditions.  It took place in places where the rest could not reach.  So, in 1928, the icebreaker Krasin took part in the search for the crew of the airship General Umberto Nobile, which crashed during an expedition to the <span>North Pole.</span>  Due to his patency, he was able to get to the crash site and save people by tearing them out of ice captivity.  Once the crew received a distress signal from the battleship Monte Sevantes and immediately rushed to the rescue.  It turned out that the ship received a hole, which was successfully managed to finish off, thanks to the joint efforts of the sailors of both ships.  During World War II, an icebreaker constantly escorted caravans of ships across the North Atlantic waters to protect them from the attack of German cruisers and submarines.  Repeatedly this ship saved the lives of many crews of other ships, for which in the post-war period more than 300 sailors of the ship received state awards for their courage. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Icebreaker krasin in St. Petersburg" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/395442.jpg?1399979200962" width="500"></div>
