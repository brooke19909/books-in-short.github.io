    <p>  The azure sea has shelled a myriad of <span>marine life.</span>  Thanks to the clean water surface, the inhabitants of the deep sea are visible at a glance.  You don‚Äôt even have to dive, just go into the water and watch. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Cafes, bars, discos and souvenir shops are found at every step.  In general, a paradise for tourists.  Of course, there are obsessive sellers, but what to do, these are the traditions of trade in this region. </p><p>  Excursions - this is another area of <span>educational tourism,</span> very common in Sharm El Sheikh.  Historical, archaeological, natural and cultural attractions are located outside the resort.  Within an hour, by any type of land or water transport, you can reach the Monastery of St. Helena, climb Mount Moses, within an hour's drive of the Color Canyon, ordering a boat trip, you can visit the coral islands, go down into the sea depths with scuba gear.  The cost of each of these excursions does not exceed $ 50. </p><p>  Using one of the profitable systems offered by the tour operator, every tourist can, having saved on housing, enjoy the beauties and mysteries of Sharm el-Sheikh to the maximum. </p><h2>  What is Fortuna 4 *? </h2><p>  Tour operators offer a variety of leisure systems that significantly reduce the cost of the tour.  In Spain, for 15 years, agencies have been actively using this system.  What gives this <span>kind of relaxation?</span>  At the minimum cost, a tourist gets the opportunity to book a hotel of a certain category (in this case four stars), without knowing his name in advance. </p>

    <p>  The place of deployment is announced on the eve of departure or only upon arrival, it already depends on the agency.  What causes the cost reduction?  Many hotels of famous resorts are not always 100% full by the beginning of the tour, and then the administration reduces the cost of the room to the minimum border.  Much depends on luck: if you are lucky, you will stay in the most expensive hotel in the <span>Fortuna 4 * Sharm el Sheikh</span> category at the lowest price.  In any case, the client is the winner, as a tour of the system will be cheaper than the cheapest trip to mysterious Egypt. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Pros and cons of relaxation </h2><p>  The benefits of such a vacation are many, the main one is the cost.  Choosing between booking a specific tour from the 4-star category and similar in the system, the Fortuna 4 * hotel wins in price.  By and large, the risk is minimal.  Many hotels in a certain category do not differ much in terms of service, amenities, menus, etc., especially for European resorts, which is why this system was the first to take root in Spain.  Why overpay for the name of the hotel?  It is better to spend the money saved on entertainment and excursions. </p>

    <p>  In Sharm El Sheikh, hotels with four stars offer almost the same living conditions.  There are, of course, ‚Äú4+‚Äù and those hotels that are closer to C grade.  Today, many tour operators as an advertising move offer some choice in the Fortuna 4 * system.  Egypt, namely Sharm El Sheikh, is famous for its hotels and quality of service.  Our operators offer tourists almost identical hotels, and you should not be afraid of unpleasant surprises.  Keep in mind, the higher the category of the hotel, the lower the risks, the higher the discounts. </p><p>  Do not expect fabulous conditions, varied food and soundless air conditioning if you choose a low category tour.  Conditions will be tolerable, but not ideal.  An unpleasant moment may lie in the distance to the sea. </p><h2>  Fortuna 4 * Hotels in Sharm El Sheikh </h2><p>  This resort is famous for its infrastructure - hotels, discos, bars, restaurants, shops, spice shops, shopping centers and, of course, the sea.  Especially popular is Naama Bay - a cozy area with sandy beaches, which especially attracts tourists with children.  There are no corals at the bottom of the sea, there is no need to enter the water in special shoes.  Another advantage is the many discos and nightclubs starting to function from 18:00. </p>

    <p>  <span>4 * hotels</span> in Sharm el-Sheikh guarantee tourists comfortable rooms with air conditioning, refrigerator, bathroom, hairdryer, safe.  The rooms are simple but comfortable and clean.  Some hotels in this system consist of small bungalows.  There are often walking areas, a pool, a bar and animators.  The Fortuna 4 * Sharm el Sheikh system includes daily room cleaning and linen changes.  Travelers indicate the type of food and starry when booking a tour. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  If you decide to take a chance and use one of the systems that allow you to save money, you can safely choose Fortuna 4 *.  Reviews of tourists are contradictory, but for the most part they are positive.  The main condition is that this type of vacation is ideal for adventurers, noisy companies or romantic vacations together.  But you should not choose it if you are going on a trip with a child or expect something supernatural. </p><p>  Many of our compatriots use the Fortuna 4 * system for trips to warmer climes, especially to Egypt.

    <p>  If this is your first visit abroad, then perhaps with a rest on some system it is worth taking a while.  The start must necessarily be positive, then taking risks the next time will be easier.  Use only the services of trusted managers.  Often, travel agency employees have information about hotels in the Fortuna 4 * system before the departure of the client and can share it with their regular customers. </p><p>  In favor of "Fortune" is the fact that the managers themselves use this service, which means that the system shows itself mainly from the best side.  Believe in luck - and you will surely be able to relax in a good hotel at the lowest cost. </p>
