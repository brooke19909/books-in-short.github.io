    <h2>  Historical events </h2><p>  The High Middle Ages began with large-scale conquests.  The states of the ancient world have sunk into oblivion, and in their place a lot of new ones have appeared.  The conquest of Britain began in the eleventh century.  Before that, it was controlled by various pagan tribes.  The Normans were the first to land in England.  Local Britons showed them fierce resistance.  But primitive weapons could not defeat steel and iron.  England and almost all of Ireland were mastered in a few years.  Then the conquerors subjugated Scotland. </p><p>  Serious changes have also taken place in northern Europe.  The ancient way of life of the Vikings was destroyed.  The population adopted Christianity.  The Scandinavian kingdoms were united into one state.  The development of the Baltic states began.  However, by the thirteenth century, a single power split into several principalities.  Similar processes took place on the territory of modern Germany and France.  The birth of dynasties began, which for the following centuries sat on the thrones of <span>Western Europe.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Slavs </h2><p>  The High Middle Ages proved to be a favorable period for the development of the Old Russian state.  At that time it was one of the largest in the world.  Culture and craft were superior to European.  This is due to the earlier ethnogenesis of the Eastern Slavs, who back in the fifth century ceased to lead a tribal lifestyle and united into one Russian people.  The same processes took place in the Balkans.  However, the natural development was hindered, not seen before, by the invasion of the underdeveloped nomadic tribes - the Mongols.  The weakening of central power prevented the Russian princes from uniting and they all fell under the onslaught of the horde.  After that, the development of culture, architecture and crafts was greatly slowed down. </p><h2>  The development of Christian culture </h2><p>  The High Middle Ages was characterized by the complete victory of Christianity in Europe.  Even in an earlier period, many influential countries converted to monotheism.  However, by the eleventh century, ancient pagan beliefs were still strong.  In Britain and Scandinavia, the population very slowly converted to a new faith.  The isolation of these regions contributed to this.  The lack of a land connection with the mainland made migration extremely problematic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="high middle ages in western europe" class="if" height="442" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1508631.jpg" width="394"></div>  However, this factor helped to avoid the invasions of nomads, who, due to their underdevelopment, could not build ships in sufficient numbers.

From now on, strict prohibitions and moral principles appeared, according to which one had to live.  Most of all, the life of Europeans was affected by changes in the institution of the family.  By the beginning of this historical period, in many places (especially in Scandinavia), stable polygamous relations remained.  Christianity forbade this.  The institution of marriage has led to a change in the role of women in society.  Firm patriarchal principles determined family relationships.  The very same family, consisting of a husband, wife and children, destroyed the clan ties.  The power structures in the form of a church had a high influence on the daily life of the population. </p><h2>  Cultural Change: Developing a Hierarchical System </h2><p>  The culture of the High Middle Ages predetermined the division of the people into classes and castes.  The castes of rulers, military, clergy, peasants, and slaves clearly stood out.  The poor and uneducated population have a culture of awareness and rethinking of personal freedom.  In many countries, management systems are changing.  In England and the Holy Roman Empire appeared their parliaments.  The privileged class had its own traditions and rituals.  But similar phenomena were in the early historical periods.  The culture of the High Middle Ages was seriously affected by scholasticism. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="high middle ages" class="if" height="352" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1508633.jpg" width="307"></div>  And her guardians were just a new class - the clergy.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Painting </h2><p>  In the visual arts, painting was the most developed.  From now on, several directions and ways of writing pictures were clearly distinguished.  The Romanesque period of the high Middle Ages was characterized by the weak development of painting.  This type of art was assigned the role of painting, that is, auxiliary processing of the walls of the temples.  But by the beginning of the thirteenth century, the attitude towards artists had changed.  In France, orders of painters were created.  They decorated the thrones in the temples and created panels, murals, icons. </p><p>  Artists began to systematize their skills.  There are new tricks.  For example, the concept of depth and perspective.  Giving objects volume and reality has become the most difficult task for medieval masters.  They failed to fully master the skill of depth.  This contributed to the creation of a generally accepted style, which would later be called Gothic.  Painting and icon painting gradually replaced the frescoes.  This type of art was extremely difficult and long.  In addition, the creation of one small mural required significant resources.  And many professing humility and living in poverty, the orders simply could not afford this. </p><h2>  Sculpture </h2><p>  The High Middle Ages in Western Europe were marked by dramatic changes in sculpture.  If other <span>types of fine art</span> developed relatively smoothly, then the sculpture received a real breakthrough.  The main motive was biblical scenes.  A high concentration of sculptors was on the territory of modern Italy.  The famous sculptures that appeared in the Renaissance are still direct continuers of the <span>Gothic style.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Romanesque High Middle Ages" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1508331.jpg" width="450"></div>  In the Roman period, bronze and copper products appeared.  For example, the doors to the Hildesheim Cathedral.

    <h2>  Methods </h2><p>  For the first time, new thread materials were applied.  In Germany, rethinking woodcarving.  However, due to the specific properties of wood, these works of art almost did not survive to this day.  Also, Germanic peoples were famous for making large-scale triumphal arches.  They were in a Romanesque style, but with a strong Gothic tint.  In many cities of modern Germany, these works of art still attract tourists. </p><p>  The concept of relief on sarcophagi and tombs appeared only at the beginning of the twelfth century.  In a short time, this processing method has become extremely popular in Western Europe.  In all the works, the spirit of that era was especially sharply felt.  Mysticism and daydreaming, awareness of transience and finiteness of being.  Of course, this is due to the fact that the period of the High Middle Ages was under the rule of scholastic philosophy. </p><h2>  Cultural Coup and Early Humanism </h2><p>  The early periods of the Middle Ages are called "dark".  Religious persecution, crazy rulers, wild laws, etc. left a serious mark on the history of mankind.  But by the thirteenth century, the old way was completely rethought.  Huge population growth has allowed large cities to appear in each region.  Aesthetic forms of entertainment were very popular in cities.  One of these was the theater.  By the beginning of the tenth century, small pantomimes were put at divine services.  Then it grew into a separate art form.  The theater began to touch on everyday topics, thus moving away from Gothic and scholasticism. </p><p>  The first works on the value of human life appeared.  Philosophers allowed in their reasoning to depart from the scholastic predestination of being.  More attention was paid to the role of human choice.  These were the first rudiments of humanism.  Urban culture was most prone to such trends.  Personality development replaced the humility and humility. </p><h2>  Architecture </h2><p>  The High Middle Ages in Western Europe was marked by a new Gothic style in architecture. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="high middle ages in europe" class="if" height="463" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1508627.jpg" width="600"></div>  At that time, temples and churches were the center of knowledge.  And any kind of <span>art was</span> inextricably linked with charitable motives.  After the end of the era of Romanism, new methods of stone processing, geometric solutions, and construction tools were invented.  In economic life, the role of the urban sector is growing.  Workshops and communities of free masons appear.  <span>European cathedrals of the</span> High Middle Ages are the best symbols of the era.

    <p>  The pomposity and scope of the construction surprise modern researchers.  The construction of the cathedral could last more than a hundred years.  And near the construction sites, a unique <span>cultural environment of</span> workers' communes appeared, which actually regulated their social life themselves. </p><h2>  Various styles </h2><p>  The classic difference between Gothic architecture is the presence of two elongated towers.  Belfries could be located both inside them and between.  The western facade was generously decorated.  The entrance was supported by columns.  After developing the wireframe method, they were just an element of decoration.  The classic Gothic style is considered to be the French model.  Cathedrals of the High Middle Ages in Germany were distinguished by strict proportions.  Noticeable perfectionism was also in the design of the facade. </p><p>  In Central Europe, the so-called brick Gothic dominated.  Brick cathedrals resembled Romanesque architecture.  They were installed on the squares of large cities.  Huge round towers were a hallmark.  The Cathedral of St. Barbara and the Church of St. James are a classic example of Czech architecture.  Dutch Gothic was notable for the construction of temples with one high spire tower. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="European high medieval cathedrals" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1508628.jpg" width="330"></div>  The vaults were made of wood, which brought a romantic and even earlier atmosphere.

    <h2>  Western European Culture of the High Middle Ages </h2><p>  For the first time, since the time of the Roman Empire, science began to exert its influence on the <span>culture of Western</span> Europe.  The development of medicine, geometry, philosophy and other sciences has led to transformation into separate industries.  The control of the church was too great, so scholars were forced to obey the bulls of the Pope.  But at the same time, the ascetic worldview was called into question. </p><p>  A new feudal culture appeared among the people.  Huge closed-loop farms appeared.  The land was seigneur.  Feudal lords ruled as governors.  The peasants were completely dependent on them.  They did not take any part in economic life and could not influence political decisions.  Nevertheless, the development of trade relations has allowed "ordinary" people to break out into an elite society. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="high medieval cathedrals" class="if" height="428" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1508630.jpg" width="600"></div>  Ship institutes appeared in France, England, and parts of Spain.  Some pluralism was also allowed in the circle of royal advisers.

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The High Middle Ages in Europe had a unique culture and lifestyle.  The development of feudalism affected social relations.  Church control began to weaken.  If the early High Middle Ages was characterized by a complete absence of the development of new trends in art, then by the thirteenth century more than a dozen such directions appeared.  Painting and especially architecture had a decisive influence on the figures of the subsequent Renaissance.  Population growth has led culture to the poorest. </p>
