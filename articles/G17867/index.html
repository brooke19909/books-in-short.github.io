How does it differ from a regular hotel?  The fact that each room is equipped, if not with a full kitchen, then at least a small corner where the guest can cook his own meals.  And how does a rented apartment of this type differ from an ordinary apartment building?  In such hotels there is a reception, a centralized cleaning of the rooms takes place.  There is a swimming pool for guests, animation programs are held.  Some apart-hotels along with kitchens offer their guests meals in the restaurant - breakfast, half board or three meals.  In Europe, where food prices at the supermarket and cafe differ many times, the opportunity to cook hot food at home is a salvation for the budget tourist.  In this article we will consider one of the apartments and studios type hotels.  It is called Primavera Beach Hotel Studios &amp; Apartments 3 *, and it is located in the homeland of the god Zeus, on the sunny and beautiful island of Crete (Greece). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Primavera Beach Hotel Studios &amp; Apartments 3" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2114745.jpg"></div>

And from it to Malia - only 31 kilometers.  So the transfer will take only half an hour.  You can independently get by taxi or by bus, which goes around the neighborhood from the hub to Hersonissos.  The village of Malia itself, although it is considered to be seaside, is located a little off the coast.  The entire first lane is occupied by hotels.  And "Primavera Beach Studios &amp; Apartment" is among them.  Thus, guests can enjoy the ideal location of the hotel.  The beach is fifty meters away, the center of the old village is 800 meters, and a kilometer to its port.  The resort's attractions, such as the Lichnostatis Open Air Museum, Lake Voulismeni and the Crete Golf Club, are within walking distance.  The center and focus of the nightlife of this part of the island, the resort of Hersonissos, is located seven kilometers away.  And next to the hotel there is a bus stop.  In the reviews, the location of the apart-hotel is characterized as very successful. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Primavera Beach Hotel Studios &amp; Apartments 3 Crete" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2114815.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What do tourists say about the rooms? </h2><p>  The guests liked the fact that the maids were cleaned in the studios and apartments of the hotel every other day.  But they do not wash the dishes for the guests.  Every day, maids replenish their supplies of tea, coffee and sugar.  And they change bed linen twice a week.  Also in the rooms of the Primavera Beach Hotel Studios &amp; Apartments 3 * hotel (reviews confirm this) there are facilities for self-cleaning. </p><p>  The rooms have one wide or two separate beds.  Tourists notice that the pool is adjacent to the end of the building.  But because the cries of swimmers and music from the bar do not reach the rooms.  And the soundproofing in the apartments is excellent.  After all, the hotel specializes in the resettlement of lovers and honeymooners. </p>
