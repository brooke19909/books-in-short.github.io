The concept, types and properties of homeostasis</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Homeostasis is the ability of the human body to adapt to the changing conditions of the external and internal environment.  Stable work of homeostasis processes guarantees a person a comfortable state of health in any situation, maintaining the constancy of vital indicators of the body. </p><h2>  Homeostasis from a biological and environmental point of view </h2><p>  In <span>biology, the concept of</span> homeostasis is applied to any multicellular organisms.  At the same time, environmentalists often pay attention to a balanced external environment.  It is believed that this is the homeostasis of the ecosystem, which is also undergoing changes and is constantly being rebuilt for further existence. </p><p>  If the balance in any system is broken and it is not able to restore it, then this leads to a complete cessation of functioning. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.objetos.unam.mx" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The essence of homeostasis" class="if uuid-2308298" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72034/2308298.jpg"></div><p>  Man is no exception, homeostatic mechanisms play a crucial role in daily life, and the permissible degree of change in the basic indicators of the human body is very small.  With unusual fluctuations in the external or internal environment, malfunctioning of homeostasis can lead to fatal consequences. </p><h2>  Why do you need homeostasis and its types </h2><p>  Every day a person is exposed to various environmental factors, but in order for the basic biological processes in the body to continue to work stably, their conditions should not change.  It is in maintaining this stability that the main role of homeostasis lies. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is customary to distinguish three main types: </p><ol><li>  Genetic. </li><li>  Physiological. </li><li>  Structural (regenerative or cellular). </li></ol><p>  For a full-fledged existence, a person needs the work of all three types of homeostasis in a complex, if one of them fails, then this leads to unpleasant consequences for health.  The coordinated work of the processes will allow you not to notice or transfer the most common changes with minimal inconvenience and feel confident. </p><h2>  Genetic homeostasis </h2><div class="photo" data-original="blogs.3ds.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Genetic homeostasis" class="if uuid-2308311" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72034/2308311.jpg"></div><p>  This type of homeostasis is the ability to maintain a single genotype within the same population.  At the molecular-cellular level, a single genetic system is maintained, which carries a certain set of hereditary information. </p><p>  The mechanism allows individuals to interbreed, while maintaining balance and uniformity of a conditionally closed group of people (populations). </p><h2>  Physiological homeostasis </h2><p>  This type of homeostasis is responsible for maintaining the optimal vital signs: </p><ul><li>  Body temperature. </li><li>  Blood pressure. </li><li>  Digestion stability. </li></ul><p>  The immune, endocrine and nervous systems are responsible for its proper functioning.  In the event of an unforeseen malfunction of one of the systems, this immediately affects the well-being of the whole organism, leads to a weakening of protective functions and the development of diseases. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Cellular homeostasis (structural) </h2><div class="photo" data-original="wccftech.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cell homeostasis" class="if uuid-2308303" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72034/2308303.jpg"></div><p>  This species is also called ‚Äúregenerative‚Äù, which probably best describes the functional features. </p><p>  The main forces of this homeostasis are aimed at restoring and healing damaged cells of the internal organs of the human body.  It is these mechanisms that, when properly operated, allow the body to recover from illness or injury. </p><p>  The main mechanisms of homeostasis develop and evolve with a person, better adapting to changes in the external environment. </p><h2>  Homeostasis functions </h2><p>  In order to correctly understand the functions and properties of homeostasis, it is best to consider its effect on specific examples. </p><p>  So, for example, when playing sports, human breathing and pulse become more frequent, which indicates the desire of the body to maintain internal balance under altered environmental conditions. </p><p>  When you move to a country with a climate that is significantly different from your usual one, you may feel unwell for some time.  Depending on the general health of a person, the mechanisms of homeostasis allow you to adapt to new living conditions.  Someone does not feel acclimatization and the internal balance is quickly adjusted, someone has to wait a bit before the body adjusts its indicators. </p><p>  In conditions of elevated temperature, a person becomes hot and perspiration begins.  This phenomenon is considered direct evidence of the functioning of self-regulation mechanisms. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tabatatimes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Heat reaction" class="if uuid-2308304" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72034/2308304.jpg"></div><p>  In many respects, the work of basic homeostatic functions depends on heredity, genetic material transmitted from the older generation of the family. </p><p>  Based on the above examples, you can clearly trace the main functions: </p><ul><li>  Energy. </li><li>  Adaptation. </li><li>  Reproductive. </li></ul><p>  It is important to pay attention to the fact that in old age, as well as in infancy, the stable operation of homeostasis requires special attention, because the reaction of the main regulatory systems in these periods of life is slow. </p><h2>  Properties of Homeostasis </h2><p>  Knowing the basic functions of self-regulation, it is also useful to understand what properties it has.  Homeostasis is a complex interconnection of processes and reactions.  Among the properties of homeostasis are: </p><ul><li>  Instability. </li><li>  Striving for balance. </li><li>  Unpredictability. </li></ul><p>  The mechanisms are in constant change, testing conditions to select the best option for adaptation to them.  This shows the property of instability. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sherman.edu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Body self-regulation" class="if uuid-2308300" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72034/2308300.jpg"></div><p>  Equilibrium is the main goal and property of any organism; it strives for it constantly, both structurally and functionally. </p><p>  In some cases, the body's reaction to changes in the external or internal environment may become unexpected, leading to realignment of vital systems.  The unpredictability of homeostasis can cause some discomfort, which does not mean further detrimental effects on the state of the body. </p><h2>  How to improve the functioning of the mechanisms of the homeostatic system </h2><p>  From a medical point of view, any disease is proof of a malfunction in homeostasis.  External and internal threats constantly affect the body, and only the coordination in the work of the main systems will help to cope with them. </p><p>  The weakening of the immune system does not occur for no reason.  Modern medicine has a wide range of tools that can help a person maintain their health, regardless of what caused the failure. </p><p>  Changes in weather conditions, stressful situations, injuries - all this can lead to the development of diseases of varying severity. </p><p>  In order for the functions of homeostasis to work correctly and as quickly as possible, it is necessary to monitor the general condition of your health.  To do this, you can consult a doctor for an examination to determine your vulnerabilities and choose a complex of therapy to address them.  Regular diagnostics will help to better control the basic processes of life. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thedailymeal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Body maintenance" class="if uuid-2308306" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72034/2308306.jpg"></div><p>  At the same time, it is important to independently follow simple recommendations: </p><ul><li>  Avoid stressful situations to protect the nervous system from constant overvoltage. </li><li>  Monitor your diet, do not overload yourself with heavy products, do not allow meaningless starvation, which will allow the digestive system to more easily cope with its work. </li><li>  Choose suitable vitamin complexes to reduce the effects of seasonal weather changes. </li></ul><p>  A vigilant attitude to one's own health will help homeostatic processes to respond to any changes in a timely and correct manner. </p>
