    <p>  How to call "Tele2" absolutely free from your mobile phone?  To do this, you can use a combination of 611. Dial the number, then press the "Call" button.  This is the easiest and most popular method used by subscribers.  By this number you can get advice or connect / disconnect certain services. </p><p>  Remember, the call is absolutely free.  No matter how much you talk, no one will charge you money.  You can call at any time!  That‚Äôs how it‚Äôs so easy for Tele2 to communicate with the operator.  Number 611 is multi-channel, which allows you to speed up the process of <span>establishing contact</span> during a call. </p><p>  Please note: the robot voice will ‚Äúcommunicate‚Äù with you.  To contact the live operator, after establishing contact, press the "0" key. </p><h2>  From any phone </h2><p>  The next answer to the question about how to call Tele2 is to use the technical support number for <span>landline phones, a</span> combination that allows you to talk directly with people and not with an answering machine. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To call a support service from any region of the country, dial 8 800 555 0611 on your gadget. By the way, this combination is also suitable for making calls from a mobile phone.  The conversation, as in the previous case, will be completely free. </p><p>  Not the most popular method of solving a problem.  Typically, users use a combination of 611 to call Tele2 from a mobile phone.  And the previously proposed phone is used only in rare cases. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tele2 communication with the operator number" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1318309.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  In roaming </h2><p>  But this is not all the possibilities of Tele2.  Communication with the operator from a mobile phone can be carried out even when the subscriber is in roaming.  A very convenient feature, important for travelers. </p><p>  If you are in roaming, you can use the following combination: +7 951 52 00 611. Please note that the dialing format must be international.  A call to this number is charged according to your chosen tariff plan. </p><p>  It is not recommended to use the combination of 8 800 555 0611. It will require you to pay for communication.  Therefore, when traveling outside of Russia, it is advisable to forget this number for a while. </p><h2>  By region </h2><p>  Tele2 is a company that has branches in various regions of the country.  It is not difficult to guess that in every city where there is this connection, there are own support services. </p><p>  Therefore, if you need to find out the <span>phone number of the</span> Tele2 <span>mobile operator</span> , go to the official page of the company and see the landline number available in your area. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tele2 communication with the operator from a mobile" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1318311.jpg"></div>

    <p>  For example, in Tula you can get through with the help of 4 872 70 37 03, and in St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region 8 123 290 022 is used. You have every right to see all numbers on the official page of Tele2.  From a mobile phone, it is advisable not to call.  There is a separate short number for calling from a cell phone. </p><h2>  Other communication </h2><p>  But this is not all the possibilities of our today's operator.  What means of supporting communication with subscribers are used in practice?  Of course, besides phone calls! </p><p>  At Tele2, communication with the operator can be carried out through the official page of the company.  Not the fastest, but it does not require any calls method.  Find the feedback form there and fill in all the fields that appear.  This technique is good when you can clearly identify the problem that has arisen, and also take your time to solve it.  After sending the request, you will have to wait a while.  The answer will come to you by e-mail. </p><p>  By the way, e-mail is another method of maintaining communication with the operator.  Just write to russia.vopros@tele2.com.  You can also use the addresses: </p><ul><li>  t2info@tele2.com; </li><li>  infokz@tele2.com (for residents of Kazakhstan). </li></ul><p>  Write to your e-mail about your problem, wait for an answer.  It is noted that the wait for letters from "Tele2" in this case can last up to several days.  The method is good, again, if you do not need an instant solution to the problem.  Complaints and recommendations are also accepted at the above addresses. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mobile phone operator tele2" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1318310.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The last, albeit unofficial, way to keep in touch with Tele2 is to use groups on social networks.  For example, in VK there is an official community of this operator.  There you can ask any question that interests you.  They will answer you soon.  Moreover, information can be shared by both an ordinary user and an employee of Tele2. </p><p>  Now you know all the possible options for communication with a mobile operator.  Choose the one that seems most simple to you, and then bring it to life.  It is recommended to call "Tele2" through a combination of 611. </p>
