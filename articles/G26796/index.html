It cooperates only with manufacturers whose products have passed the relevant test and have GOST or TU certificates.  The range of products is constantly expanding.  Redmond employs only highly qualified personnel with specialized education.  They are able to advise consumers on any issue.  Although the company specializes more in multicookers, there are other household appliances in their assortment, for example, a Redmond RMG-1203 meat grinder.  We will present an overview of this model in this article. </p><p>  Before starting a detailed study, I would like to draw the attention of those buyers who do not really trust the products of a domestic manufacturer to the fact that this company was formed in the USA and has been on the market for several years (since 2007).  She has already earned a good reputation.  Due to the fact that its branches are located on almost all continents, there will be no problems with warranty service.  All household appliances of the Redmond trademark, the assembly of which is carried out in Russia, comply with European standards and are manufactured in compliance with all standards. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="redmond rmg 1203" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1215927.jpg" width="505"></div>
