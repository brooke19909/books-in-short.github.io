    <p>  To see the sights, you can contact the excursion point Aloe Hotel 4 * (Paphos).  The tours offered to tourists here are not limited only to the historical values ‚Äã‚Äãof Paphos - you can order any tour of Cyprus.  However, according to vacationers reviews, in order to fully see the whole island, it is better to rent a car in a hotel.  It will cost less, and you will be able to see more. </p><p>  Tourists should definitely see the <span>Tomb of the Kings.</span>  As you know, the weather in Paphos is hot, so it is better to inspect the ruins early in the morning or after five in the evening.  The tombs are interesting in that they are mottled with a whole network of passages and stairs.  They are exact copies of those houses and palaces in which the kings once lived. </p><p>  Aphrodite‚Äôs swimming pool, which according to legend, gives eternal youth, is popular with vacationers.  You can only get here on foot, and there is no charge for inspecting the fountain and the bathhouse.  But the temple of Aphrodite itself is located fifteen kilometers from Paphos.  It was built in the twelfth century. </p><p>  According to tourists, the bath of Aphrodite is a very beautiful and romantic place.  A beautiful sandy beach and clear sea are worth your attention. </p><p>  Not far from Paphos is the <span>monastery of St. Neophytum the</span> Recluse.  Once a monk chose a beautiful place and dug a cave in the mountain in which he lived for many years.  People came to him, and gradually a temple grew near his monastery.  It acquired a modern look only in the fifteenth century. </p><p>  Guests of Paphos can also visit the ancient settlement of Eroskipos, located in the east.  According to legend, it was here that the sacred gardens of Aphrodite were once located, where she indulged in love.  The main attraction of this place is the temple of St. Paraskeva. </p><p>  In addition to historical attractions, hotel guests can visit the famous water park, which is considered the most popular place among vacationers.  No less interesting is the bird park, in the amphitheater of which real bird shows are arranged.  Here you can see many exotic animals and birds.  Particularly popular among the female half is Petra tou Romiou.  This is perhaps the most picturesque place on the whole island.  According to legend, it was here at the very foot of the cliff of sea foam that Aphrodite was born. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel aloe hotel 4 paphos" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1430797.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Paphos is as if woven from legends and traditions.  For the sake of the goddess Aphrodite alone, many tourists come to Cyprus every year. </p><h2>  Aloe Hotel 4 * (Paphos): room reviews </h2><p>  Currently, <span>holidays in Cyprus</span> remain, as before, one of the most popular and budget options for spending vacations.  Now many tour operators are vying to offer tours to the island, including the Aloe Hotel 4 * (Paphos) - Biblio-Globus, Coral Travel and many others.  However, as practice shows, not all hotels correspond to the declared parameters.  What do vacationers say about Aloe Hotel 4 * (Paphos)?  Reviews about the complex are quite contradictory: from complete enthusiasm to discontent.  Let's dwell on the main points in more detail. </p><p>  According to tourists, the hotel has good staff.  Settlement is fast without any problems.  Get to the hotel for a short time.  It really is located on the first line, but it should be borne in mind that the road is located in front of the complex.  Therefore, rooms looking at the sea, of course, are located on the side of the roadway.  Perhaps for someone such a neighborhood will seem very noisy and uncomfortable.  The quietest apartments here are those overlooking the pool and side street with side sea views.  They are located on the shadow side, and therefore the sun does not fall here.  For a hot time, this is a very good option. </p><p>  The rooms have air conditioning, but it is clearly insufficient.  The apartment furniture is in good condition, old-style TVs (nineties).  As for cleaning, it is produced very high quality every day.  In this case, you can not leave a tip, such a bonus does not affect the quality of the process.  Towels are also changed daily, but bed linen is changed once every three days. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="aloe hotel 4 paphos tours" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1430798.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The building of the hotel complex is not old, but inside it is noticeable that in some places repair and replacement of equipment is required.  In general, the interior of the hotel is quite decent.  Everything is clean and tidy.  There are no cockroaches and ants in the rooms, which is very pleasing.  Of course, if someone expects to see a luxury hotel here, then do not be mistaken, otherwise you will be disappointed.  The complex is fully consistent with the ratio of "price - quality", so do not make excessive demands.  No wonder that Paphos, whose prices are quite acceptable, is considered a budget resort. </p><h2>  Reviews about the hotel </h2><p>  The hotel area is not very large, rather even compact, but at the same time very well-groomed, green.  There are many flowers, and in the shade you can always find a cozy bench.  A huge plus is that the hotel courtyard is always closed and outsiders are not allowed.  Children can be safely sent for a walk and not worry.  Many cats run around the territory, but they are harmless.  Of course, they beg for food, but they do not bother anyone. </p><p>  In pools, water is periodically chlorinated, which means that you don‚Äôt have to worry about cleanliness. </p><h2>  Food Impressions </h2><p>  As for nutrition, it is with respect to it that the opinions of tourists are radically different.  Breakfast includes omelettes, fried eggs, yogurts, bacon, cereal, cheese, honey, sometimes pancakes, rolls, croissants, oranges, grapefruits, juices, coffee, toasts.  For lunch, you can try several options for cooked meat, potatoes, fish, vegetables, herbs, olives, stews.  By all means, guests are offered sweets: cakes, mousses, jelly.  But grapes, plums, melons, apples were far from daily.  Indeed, the selection of fruits is sometimes small. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="aloe hotel 4 cyprus paphos" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1430806.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As for dinner, in the evening you can see about the same assortment of food as in lunch: three or four varieties of meat, fish, salads, etc. Perhaps, such a set will seem monotonous to someone, but no one is left hungry.  It's nice that the cooks do not forget about sweets.  For dinner, a surprise awaits guests.  The fact is that themed nights are arranged daily.  Therefore, guests are offered dishes of different cuisines.  All food is fresh and tasty.  In addition, during the day, vacationers can eat in the hotel bars. </p><p>  The hotel complex is a good vacation spot for those who do not know English.  A lot of hotel workers speak Russian, so there is no language barrier.  The attendants are very disciplined and responsive, helping to solve difficulties. </p><h2>  Beach Reviews </h2><p>  Most of the Cyprus coast is pebbles.  However, the beach opposite the hotel is sandy.  To the sea only five minutes at a calm pace.  The hotel does not have its own beach, since in Paphos the entire coast is a municipal property.  In the water, the bottom is also sandy, the water is warm and very clean.  About four hundred meters from the coast - shallow water, which is very convenient for children.  Umbrellas and chaise lounges are paid.  If you do not want to pay for them, then you can just sit on the sand - this is not prohibited. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="paphos aloe hotel 4" class="if" height="355" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1430801.jpg" width="480"></div>

    <p>  The <span>sights of Paphos are</span> worthy of special attention <span>.</span>  Resting here, you should definitely look at historical places filled with numerous legends and traditions.  It is the long history of the city that attracts many tourists every year.  According to vacationers, to see all the local beauty, it is better to rent a car.  Sightseeing tours will cost much more, and you will not be able to see a lot on them.  The machine also provides greater speed of movement, which allows you to save more time on the inspection of historical monuments.  Tourists are also advised to visit the water park in Paphos, which causes delight not only in children but also in adults. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Aloe Hotel 4 * is a wonderful place for those who want to find a calm and quiet place to relax.  There are no noisy parties, the evening animation is not so stormy, but this also has its charms.  The main contingent of vacationers in Paphos is German and French pensioners.  Therefore, young people may be bored here.  But for couples with children, the hotel is great.  Of course, children's animation is very weak (this is not Turkey), but if you come to relax on the sea, then it makes no sense to keep the child in the hotel.  In general, the complex is worthy of attention and can claim a place in the list of hotels for recreation.  We hope that our article will be useful to those people who are soon going to spend their holidays in Paphos. </p>
