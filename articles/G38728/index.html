The rooms are cleaned very unobtrusively: the maids wait until the guests go down for breakfast.  Towels are changed daily.  Shampoos and other hygiene items are updated with the same regularity.  Safes in the rooms are free, which is very rare for Turkish hotels.

    <p>  Many tourists are pleased that the hotel has such a service as the replacement of mattresses, blankets and pillows with a choice of material.  Of course, you need to pay extra for this, but for those who have a sore back or for those who are used to orthopedic options, this is true.  Residents of superior rooms are pleased that the minibar is replenished daily with no reminder or request.  The same applies to soaps, shampoos and gels, the quality of which is quite good. </p><p>  A lot of positive reviews about nutrition.  On the territory of this hotel there are several restaurants working on the principle of "buffet".  There are also very good paid ones, but those who buy the all-inclusive concept do not need extra food.  Breakfast includes a lot of yoghurts and cereals, scrambled eggs, sausages and cheeses, sausages, salads, honey comb, jam, granola, etc.  For lunch or dinner, you can watch how the cooks, right in front of the tourists, roast a delicious turkey or chicken, cut fruits and vegetables.  The menu has a lot of freshly caught fish.  This part of the coast is very rich in seafood.  Especially tasty dishes are served from horse mackerel. </p><p>  The main restaurant is large enough, so there is no crowds and fuss.  There are always a lot of empty seats, the waiters work very quickly.  Compliments from the administration pleasantly surprise many: a bottle of wine with a box of sweets when checking in is very helpful, and after a few days of accommodation, guests are presented with small gift souvenirs and a cocktail on the pier. </p><p> The vast majority of our compatriots are very satisfied with the Euphoria Tekirova hotel and find it one of the most worthy in its category on the entire Turkish coast.  The staff is attentive and friendly, many from the former CIS, so often the Russian language barrier does not arise.  There are many rave reviews of local attractions that abound in this historic region. </p><p>  Some are only complained that before leaving they are not given a lunch package in the form of breakfast, but are invited to eat in a restaurant and then leave.  There are discontent and remoteness from the airport.  But in general, opinions about the rest in this complex are unambiguous: I like it.  Therefore, many people dream of returning here again and again, especially on the birthday of the hotel, which is celebrated in July.  At this time, bonuses are offered to residents, holiday events are often organized, in a word, it can be a lot of fun at Euphoria Tekirova. </p>
