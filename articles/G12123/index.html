They conduct trainings, organize competitions of thematic drawings and posters, exhibitions of children's art.  Children's crafts on the topic "Fire Safety" always look interesting.  Such events are very important for every child and cannot be wasted. </p><h2>  Fire safety.  DIY crafts </h2><p>  Children learn to behave properly in case of fire, handle matches, gas and electrical appliances.  Because before you do something with your hands, you need to try to understand it with the mind.  Parents should not be aloof in preparing such events.  Moms and dads should not only help to choose and make a sketch of crafts, but also talk about how to use what the child will produce in miniature, for example, a fire truck. </p><h2>  Application in facing technology </h2>

    <p>  Crafts on the theme of "Fire Safety" can be made in a wide variety of techniques.  Parents own some of them.  Everyone will choose for themselves and their child what they like best. </p><p>  The cutting <span>technique</span> looks very beautiful and modern <span>.</span>  The manufacturing process is simple, under the power of a kindergarten kid. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You need to prepare corrugated paper.  It is sold in rolls and comes in different colors.  This material is useful for other crafts, if in this all will not be used.  You will need another sheet of cardboard, glue, a pencil and scissors. </p><p>  A future applique drawing requires a sketch.  Therefore, it must be applied on a sheet of cardboard.  The picture should be on the topic of fire safety: you can draw a fireman next to the machine.  Now that the sketch is ready, glue should be applied to the drawing, but not to the entire sketch at once.  Take the corrugated paper of the desired color (in accordance with the figure), cut out a small square from it, twist it around a wooden rod or pencil and wrinkle it with your fingers.  Now it remains to glue the workpiece in its place on the cardboard. </p><p>  Thus, having ‚Äúdrawn‚Äù the whole picture, you will get a volume application.  Kids will like this activity, they like to crumple something, and if a picture comes out of it, it gives them pleasure. </p><p>  As the contours of what is conceived appear in the drawing, you can tell the child about the appointment of the <span>profession of a fireman</span> and a special machine for fighting fires.  It should be reminded the baby why the fires occur and how to prevent them in the apartment.  At the end of the picture, you can put it in a frame. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY DIY fire safety" class="if" height="425" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/1042135.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  From semolina </h2><p>  Crafts on fire safety can play not only a good educational role, but also help to develop fine motor skills of the fingers of kids.  Hard work and perseverance requires work with semolina.  It is also often used when creating children's crafts on fire safety.  On the topic under study, you can perform a fire truck in a hurry to prevent disaster.  As always, a pencil with glue, a sheet of cardboard or thick paper, gouache and semolina will come to the rescue.  <span>Semolina is</span> pre-stained in the desired colors.  Then it should be dried on a newspaper or film.  Semka is ready, laid out in colors in separate containers.  Now you need to draw a contour of the machine, apply glue on them and fill them with semolina painted in red.  Then fill in all parts of the picture with the necessary colors. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  First, let the crafts on the topic "Fire Safety" be performed not quite skillfully and not take first place, the main thing is not that.  It is important that the child repeated all the rules, talked and listened to the parents, felt their help.  That is what is valuable.  Let crafts on the topic of "Fire Safety" try to bring children and parents together.  They will want to create together and do many more interesting things.  You can also read instructional books together and discuss them. </p><h2>  Fire shield </h2>

    <p>  The theme ‚ÄúFire Safety‚Äù is not so terrible.  DIY crafts in this direction can be made of plasticine, you can use modular origami.  And when performing a drawing on a topic somewhere in the corner of the drawing, it is necessary to depict a <span>fire shield.</span> </p><p>  Of course, it is necessary to draw the attention of the baby to the fact that he has already seen such a shield in a kindergarten or school.  Invite the child to remember what tools are needed to extinguish a fire.  You can offer to perform such a shield in miniature form.  This type of work will be remembered by the child for a long time and will be an addition to any work on the topic "Fire Safety". </p><h2>  Items </h2><p>  The bucket and all other elements of the shield will be made of paper, but you need to give them volume.  Twist the bucket with a cone and paint in red.  An ax, a shovel can be made of thick paper, and for tool handles twist it with cylinders.  A hose for water, that is, a fire hose, is made of foil.  The wire is suitable for a special hook, which is also used to extinguish fires. </p><h2>  Fire extinguisher </h2><p>  A fire extinguisher will be voluminous if performed in the old papier-m√¢ch√© technique.  It is very simple: take a small plastic bottle, cut and paste one half with scraps of newspaper.  After giving the desired shape and drying of the glue, paint the fire extinguisher in red and provide with small additional details. </p><p>  When performing all the tools, the child will be keenly interested in the purpose of each item.  It is necessary to answer in detail about each of them, because the knowledge gained will help him save his life in an emergency. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="children's crafts on fire safety" class="if" height="395" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/1042134.jpg" width="307"></div></h2><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  When the important topic of the article "Fire Safety" will be considered, a photo of them next to the baby will remind you of how the parents helped the child with the assignment received in the kindergarten.  These pictures will be a reliable reminder of the rules of conduct in case of fire.  It is necessary to take a bold approach to the implementation of any crafts on fire safety. </p>
