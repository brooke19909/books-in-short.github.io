Despite the shortcomings, OSAGO continues to develop.  Any vehicle owner is required to insure their liability.  When contacting the company, the premium is calculated.  The price of the policy depends on correction factors, tariffs, but is regulated at the legislative level. </p>

    <h2>  Limits </h2><p>  The law provides for restrictions on payments.  If harm has been done: </p><ul><li>  only to property - 400 thousand rubles; </li><li>  life and health - 500 thousand p. </li></ul><p>  Another limitation is that the amount of the penalty cannot exceed the <span>sum insured</span> under the contract.  The application for the CTP insurance penalty is submitted to the company as part of the pre-trial proceedings.  It indicates the details for the transfer of funds. </p><h2>  Examples </h2><p>  Insurance neglected the terms of compensation for losses and delayed payment for 20 days.  The amount of compensation is 120 thousand.  One day of delay costs 120 x 0.01 = 1.2 thousand rubles.  To receive the payment, the client must contact the company with the appropriate statement. </p><p>  After the accident, the car was damaged in the amount of 150 thousand rubles.  The full set of documents for the payment of compensation was transferred to the company on September 1.  As of September 30, no payment was received.  The total delay is 10 days.  For each day of delay, the company must pay 1.5 thousand rubles. </p>

    <h2>  The timing </h2><p>  Within 20 days from the receipt of the full set of documents, the insurance company is obliged to pay compensation, issue a referral for repair work or provide a reasoned refusal.  If a shortage of securities is found, the insurer is obliged to notify the client about this and provide a complete list of missing documents.  If the papers do not contain the necessary information or documents were not provided at all, the organization may not pay the penalty and other compensations. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The terms of payment of the penalty must be specified in the contract.  Although usually this item is missed by the company.  Therefore, after a month after the adoption of the relevant decision, you need to file a claim with the company and the courts.  Such cases are dealt with quickly.  Within 10 days after the decision is made, a penalty and compensation must be paid. </p><h2>  Arbitrage practice </h2><p>  If it comes to court, then you need to draw up two statements of claim.  The first is about the payment of compensation for damage, and the second is that the client is entitled to a mandatory liability insurance penalty.  Both applications must be considered in a single hearing.  The statement itself must indicate: </p><ul><li>  the identification code of the judicial authority to which the application is sent; </li><li>  all details of the defendant; </li><li>  all certificates concerning road accident; </li><li>  examination results; </li><li>  Amount of indebtedness for payment of compensation and forfeit. </li></ul><p>  The court most often makes a positive decision. </p>

    <h2>  Forgiveness insurance: nuances </h2><p>  The victim may demand compensation for the repair of his vehicle.  He himself chooses the method of compensation for damage: in cash or in the form of payment for repair work.  If both parties to the conflict are to blame for the accident, then the compensation is paid in the same amount. </p><p>  The procedure for notifying insurance about an accident has changed.  If two cars were involved in the accident, the owners of which have OSAGO and there are no injured, each of them turns to his company.  In other cases, you need to file an application with the company of the culprit. </p><p>  The procedure for <span>registration of accidents</span> according to the Euro Protocol has also changed.  Each party must notify its company within 5 business days.  Otherwise, the culprit will have to pay damages at his own expense.  If there is a video or photo of the accident, then the maximum amount of payment in the capital and the Leningrad region will be 400 thousand rubles. </p><p>  The victim must show his vehicle to the company within 5 days after the accident.  At the insurer's request, a third party is to blame.  She must also provide the vehicle for inspection within 10 days from the date of receipt of the application.  The guilty person is not allowed to dispose of or repair the car within 15 business days, otherwise the insurance penalty for compulsory motor third-party liability insurance and compensation will not be paid. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="forfeit payment" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1548052.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The insurer may demand the payment of compensation and forfeit in the pretrial order.  If the parties do not agree, then the penalty for compulsory motor third-party liability insurance and compensation will be carried out through the court.  Insurers are required to pre-trial all payments.  However, in fact, these amounts are less than those that are legally entitled to customers.  Therefore, most of these cases are decided through the courts. </p><h2>  Other sanctions </h2><p>  Penalty is another sanction that applies to the insurer in case of violation of the timing of payment of compensation.  Its size directly depends on the amount of charges.  In case of violation of the terms of payment of compensation, the company must compensate 1% of the amount owed per day of delay.  If the company has violated the terms for providing directions for repairs, then it will be necessary to compensate for 0.5% of the debt.  With any calculation method, installment payments cannot exceed the premium guaranteed by the contract. </p><p>  If customers have to file a claim in order to receive compensation, the court‚Äôs decision on the mandatory liability insurance contract will be supplemented by a decision on the mandatory payment of a fine.  This is the largest monetary compensation for late payment.  Untimely transfer of funds to the beneficiary is considered the most serious violation of obligations by the insurer. </p><p>  Article 16 of the Federal Law "On CTP" provides for a fine for the benefit of an individual for violation of compensation payments.  If the application is drawn up by the Consumer Rights Protection Society, then it shall be entitled to half the amount of the penalty.  The amount of the fine is 50% of the amount of compensation for the case in question.  At the same time, the amounts that were paid voluntarily in a 20-day period, penalties, and other compensations are not taken into account. </p><h2>  One more example </h2><p>  The total amount of payment by court decision is 50 thousand rubles.  In the statutory 20-day period, the company paid off only 10 thousand rubles.  The interests of the injured party in the case are represented by OZPP. </p><p>  The amount of the fine = (50 - 10) x 0.5 = 20 thousand p.  Of these, 10 thousand are taken by the victim, and the same amount is taken by the OZPP. </p>

    <h2>  Features </h2><p>  The total amount of the sanction may not exceed the maximum amount of payment for the corresponding type of insurance and the damage caused. </p><p>  If the company has committed several offenses, then sanctions can be requested for each of them. </p><p>  The court can reduce payments only on the basis of a statement by the defendant and only if the calculated penalties are disproportionate to the consequences of violations. </p><p>  All sanctions apply to recovering compensation from the PCA. </p><p>  Fulfillment of the court‚Äôs claim for the payment of compensation does not exempt the company from the payment of the penalty. </p><h2>  Underpayment </h2><p>  Almost always, the court understates the calculated amount of the penalty.  The exception is cases where the defendant did not appear at the court hearing, and absentee decisions.  If the amount of compensation is small, the delay is small, there is a chance that they will not reduce the amount. </p><p>  Still need to prepare for the trial.  For example, write written explanations in which to reflect: </p><ul><li>  his disagreement with the application for a reduction in compensation due to the lack of grounds; </li><li>  list all the necessary conditions for reducing the payment and separately indicate the items that were not met. </li></ul><p>  A copy of the written explanations must be attached to the case file.  When the court gives the floor for an answer, you need to briefly voice your position, focusing on the most important points. </p>
