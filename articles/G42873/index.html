Comedy has been shot for ten years, starting in 1974.  Eleven seasons were shot, in each of which Winkler was present. </p><p>  The Happy Days series (Henry Winkler played Fonzy) showed the idealized world in the United States of the fifties and sixties of the twentieth century.  The action takes place in Milwaukee - a city in Wisconsin.  At the center of the storyline is the teenage family of Richie, who owns a hardware store. </p><p>  Initially, the director of the series in the role of Fonzi represented another actor.  He saw the character as a man with an Italian type of appearance, such as Ron Howard.  However, Yale's student was able to reveal the image from a completely different perspective.  So Winkler successfully auditioned and reincarnated as Fonzy for ten years. </p><p>  Gradually, the character played by Henry ended up at the center of a television comedy.  At the same time, there were disagreements with the leadership of the channel on which the show was filmed regarding the appearance of the hero, namely his jacket.  So, the actor considered the option with worn leather clothes appropriate, and representatives of the channel believed that this makes the character similar to a criminal.  They wanted to see Fonzy in a green windbreaker.  The director intervened in the matter, who discussed the problem with the channel.  By common agreement, it was decided that the character can appear in a leather jacket in scenes with a motorcycle.  Since that time, the hero never left his motorcycle. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúDon't mess with Zohan‚Äù </h2>

    <p>  The actor‚Äôs collaboration with director <span>Adam Sandler</span> began in 1998, when he invited him to play in the film ‚ÄúSissy Mom‚Äù.  And in 2008, ‚ÄúDo not mess with Zohan‚Äù was released.  Henry Winkler played a major role in a comedy about the life of an Israeli commando named Zohan Dwire.  The hero staged his own death and moved to New York with the goal of becoming a hairdresser and not chasing the Arab terrorist Phantom anymore.  The picture makes fun of the conflict between Arabs and Jews. </p><p>  The plot of the picture ends happily, because the enemies (Zohan and Phantom) reconciled with each other and together decided to teach the racists a lesson in the United States.  Thus, representatives of both nationalities began to live in peace. </p><h2>  Awards </h2><p>  Henry Winkler was nominated four times for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor.  He was able to receive this award twice, for his role in Happy Days.  The same project allowed the actor to become an Emmy nominee three times.  In addition, nominations for Emmys were awarded work in Practice and the 1979 information program. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2>
