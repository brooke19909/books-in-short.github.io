At the time of release, it had a high price.  It is justified by the creation technology, the disclosure mechanism.  The device was sold in only one color option - black.  Color screen supporting up to 4096 tones.  The device also distinguished itself from its ‚Äúrelated‚Äù models in that it began to work with Java. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 8910i" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1766818.jpg" width="541"></div>

    <h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The phone has a size of 4.6 √ó 14 √ó 0.2 cm. The device fits perfectly both in clothing pockets and in a holster.  The mass of the device is 112 grams.  Some consumers consider this figure to be negative, but when viewed from the other side, the titanium case makes up the majority of the weight.  It <span>protects the phone</span> from scratches, deformations when dropped, and so on.  Coloring does not begin to "climb".  The disclosure mechanism is standard.  In order for the part of the device to extend, you must simultaneously press the two keys located on the side.  From the previous model (Nokia 8910), the 8910i differs in that its mass is 2 grams more.  At the same time, the described process has a rather slow disclosure process.  But it should be noted the fact that the owners never spontaneously opened the device.  The phone works with 2 SIM cards. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 8910i original" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1766819.jpg" width="600"></div>

The Nokia 8910i has a so-called wave.  Thanks to her, the device looks much more attractive.  The keys have side lighting.  Therefore, in the dark, neither numbers nor letters are visible, it is difficult to print.  The bottom row of buttons is uncomfortable.  This is due to the fact that when you click on them, the body touches. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 8910i how to distinguish fake" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1766820.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Display </h2><p>  The Nokia 8910i screen is capable of displaying at the same time no more than 4 lines of text.  If we compare the device with the previous ones from this manufacturer, then this figure is markedly reduced.  Unfortunately, the colors are dull, the brightness is small.  Because of this, the picture seems dirty and dark.  At first glance, the model in standby mode can recall the previous one - with an index of 8910. By the way, her display is much better.  The only plus of the screen is the presence of colors and the rejection of monochrome. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The manufacturer in the Nokia 8910i used a 750 mAh battery.  The developers claim that the device is able to function 300 hours in standby time.  If you actively talk on the mobile network, the device will be discharged in 4 hours. Comparing this version with the ‚Äúrelated‚Äù version, it must be said that the 8910 model showed much better performance.  If the 8910i modification lasts 4 hours, then the previous one with the same operating conditions is about a day.  Charging to 100% takes approximately 2 hours. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 8910 8910i" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1766821.jpg" width="600"></div>

The fact is that the Chinese prefer not to create new parts, but use old models.  A titanium case is not used in fakes, so it will seem different to the touch.  The original part is matte and rough, painted according to a special technology, the nuances of which are classified. </p><p>  Due to the fact that the case is not made correctly, the fake device feels like plastic.  The paint is applied in a thick layer and it is easy to notice that its color and texture is very different from the original version.  There is no feeling that there are metal parts in the Nokia 8910i. </p><p>  The original comes with gray letters on the keyboard.  If the purchased device has white and convex keys, then you can be sure - the front panel is fake. </p><p>  Sometimes consumers claim that a non-original phone is one that has an additional alphabet in addition to Latin letters on the keyboard.  However, this nuance cannot be considered an indicator of fake.  The manufacturer has released this phone for many countries, so there are models with Arabic, Chinese, Korean, French and other symbols. </p><p>  The company logo should not have gaps around.  In the original model, it occupies the entire area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe recess in which it is located.  Logos of small sizes have a corrugated (less often - glossy) design. </p><p>  In the original model, the metal elements are specially numbered.  We are talking about the battery cover, phone case and front panel.  To verify the authenticity, you have to disassemble the device.  On the battery cover, the number can be viewed without various manipulations, just remove it.  In general, this nuance does not guarantee 100% authenticity of the device.  Moreover, the manufacturer sometimes puts a number under a metal surface, and installs plastic on top. </p><p>  The rear logo should be chrome plated.  In the original model, it is even and smooth.  All letters are mirrored and clear. </p><p>  The genuine protective case on both sides has special buttons responsible for opening it.  There is a millimeter seam.  If it is convex or ‚Äúsuperimposed‚Äù on the center of the plastic part, then the case is fake. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="titanium nokia 8910i" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1766822.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Finally </h2><p>  The Nokia 8910i speaker shows itself on the good side.  Speech and sound are excellent.  The device pleased with the color screen and functionality, which was so lacking in the model 8910. </p><p>  On the one hand, the device has a good set of options, but on the other - a large number of disadvantages.  At a minimum, the manufacturer has built a low-quality display, the battery‚Äôs autonomous life is clearly not happy, and ‚Äúbluetooth‚Äù also works with some failures.  The design of the device is no different from the external design of the 8910. A small advantage is Java.  This cannot be called a global update, since the amount of internal memory is very small.  Even if there is enough storage for installing software, a poor-quality and dull screen is unlikely to allow comfortable work with the device. </p>
