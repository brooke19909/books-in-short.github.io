Its coast was divided between the Russian Federation and Ukraine.  Dolgaya and Belosaray spits separate the bay from the rest of the Sea of ​​Azov.  At the "butt" of this water area lies a large Russian city - Rostov-on-Don.  On the north coast - Taganrog, which gave the name to the bay, and Ukrainian Mariupol.  Of the more or less large cities at the southern end of the water area, we can name Russian Yeysk.  Taganrog Bay stretches for one hundred and forty kilometers.  Its width at the "entrance" is 31 km.  Of course, the bay is smaller than <span>the Sea of ​​Azov.</span>  <span>The average depths</span> are about four meters.  What is it like to relax on the Taganrog Bay?  This will tell our article. </p>

    <h2>  Climate </h2><p>  The map of the <span>Taganrog Bay</span> shows us that this water area is located in the north-eastern part of the Sea of ​​Azov.  Thus, we can say that the climate here is temperate continental.  In ordinary winters, the bay is covered with ice from December to March.  And this opens up opportunities for fishermen.  But in mild winters, which happen more often, the bay may not freeze at all.  Rest on the Taganrog Bay in summer is especially good.  After all, shallow water warms up very quickly.  The swimming season begins in early June (and in some years in May).  Water in the middle of summer warms up to twenty-eight degrees.  This is the peak season.  A gentle entry into the calm sea, wide beaches, warm waters - these are the prerequisites for an ideal family vacation.  In August and the first half of September, the velvet season in the Taganrog Bay.  In some years, it drags on for the entire first month of autumn. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Taganrog Bay has one feature.  The water in it is more fresh than in the Sea of ​​Azov.  This is because many rivers flow into this almost enclosed water area.  And it would be good if it were small streams, like Her, Mius, Kalmius.  But such a water giant as the Don flows into the bay.  Therefore, the salinity of the water here is quite low, especially near the estuary.  This leads to the fact that in warm periods, small green algae multiply.  Locals say that "water is blooming."  She really turns green for a while.  But in such water there are absolutely no jellyfish.  What you need to know about the Taganrog Bay for a tourist who dreams of a quality beach vacation?  Scythe - this is the best place: clear sea, sandy beaches with a small interspersed shell rock, pristine nature.  True, not all spits have developed tourism infrastructure.  If you are satisfied with the rest in the tent, then you can try to stay on Dolgaya. </p>

    <h2>  The resort city of Yeysk </h2><p>  It just so happened that it was from this place that vacationers began to develop the Taganrog Bay (at least its Russian part).  This city stands at the beginning of the Yeisk Spit.  It separates even smaller waters from the Taganrog Bay.  It is called Yeisk estuary.  It is very small and quite isolated from the sea.  Indeed, on the other hand, the estuary cuts off the Glafirovskaya Spit from the bay.  Yeysk city authorities do not consider this shallow water area as a beach holiday destination.  The water here often stagnates and “blooms”.  In addition, the bottom is sometimes covered with mud.  In a word, only the fishermen love the Yeisk estuary.  The catches in this almost freshwater pond are simply wonderful.  Beach lovers prefer the side of Yeisk that overlooks the bay.  Sea open spaces, great depths, currents that do not allow water to bloom - all this makes the city's embankments into wonderful places for recreation. </p><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Yeysk beaches </h2><p>  Naturally, the city authorities focused their attention and threw all financial assets to the development of the territory that overlooks the Taganrog Bay.  In recent years, the embankment has been completely reconstructed.  Now do not recognize Seaside Park.  It was not only equipped, but also filled with attractions.  Along the city promenade stretches the beach "Kamenka".  He is the most comfortable.  Here are located: water park "Nemo", an aquarium and a dolphinarium.  This beach stretches to the base of the Yeisk Spit and ends at the pier.  Behind it is the harbor for yachts and boats.  And then a scythe stretched with beaches such as Central and Youth.  From the Yeisk estuary there is only one equipped place for swimming.  It is called "Children's Beach", because the depths here are really for kids.  Water recreation infrastructure is developed on the side of the bay.  There you can ride a "banana", a water scooter, a catamaran, take a boat trip on a yacht.  Lifeguards are on duty at equipped beaches. </p><h2>  Housing </h2><p>  Yeysk is located only at the base of the spit.  Private housing is for rent everywhere.  But since vacationers are more in demand in the Taganrog <span>Bay, apartments</span> in this part of the city are more expensive than from the estuary.  On the braid itself, no one constantly lives.  All of it is filled with recreation facilities and pensions.  In addition to Yeisk, tourists also often go on vacation to the <span>village of Dolzhanskaya.</span>  It is located fifteen kilometers from the Long Spit.  Some tourists stay in the city of Taganrog. </p>
