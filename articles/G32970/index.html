Recreation facilities in Makhachkala have good conditions, and this is no exception.  The rooms are very comfortable, with all amenities, in each room there is a TV and a fridge, air conditioning, hot and cold water.  It offers guests a spa and wellness center.

    <h2>  Cost of rest </h2><p>  This is one of the most important factors by which recreation centers in Makhachkala are selected.  Dolphin is a place suitable for budget travelers.  Double junior suite will cost you only 1000 rubles per day.  A double superior room with air conditioning costs 1800 rubles, and a quadruple - 2500. For 3000 rubles you can rent a five-bed cottage.  Judging by the reviews of tourists, all rooms are clean and comfortable. </p><h2>  The recreation center "Anji" </h2><p>  Next, I would like to tell the reader about the Anji Hotel.  The recreation center in Makhachkala should be bright and sunny, just like this friendly land, and is fully suitable for these requirements.  It functions actively from May 1 to October, that is, throughout the summer season.  Another name for the hotel is Arena.  Adults and children have a great time here, so do not hesitate to choose this option for a family trip, as well as for fun corporate parties.  First of all, the guests, of course, are interested in the warm Caspian Sea and the golden sand, only after a few days tourists begin to be interested in other entertainments, and there are not so few of them here.  It has a modern bar and sauna, a huge pool with sun loungers, and a tour desk. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="recreation centers in Makhachkala by the sea" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1026795.jpg" width="600"></div>

At the recreation center "Anji", rest is somewhat more expensive, however, the rooms look much more interesting.  In addition, you can choose one of three options: standard, luxury or VIP.  The latter are especially good, with panoramic windows and a stylish interior.  Standard room rates start at 3,000 rubles, while VIP rates start at 5,000 rubles per day.  Tourists emphasize that the level of service here is much higher than at other bases, however, payment is not available to everyone. </p><h2>  Hotel "Jami" </h2><p>  We continue to consider recreation facilities in Makhachkala.  Jami is one of the most modern complexes, which is great for you to spend your vacation here.  Three spacious two-story buildings are presented to your attention, each of which consists of 18 superior rooms with balconies and loggias.

    <h2>  Sanatorium rest </h2><p>  The next on our list is the Malibu Recreation Complex.  The recreation center in Makhachkala is not very famous, the same tourists come here every year, but there are very few reviews about it.  Therefore, we decided to additionally tell you about the “Kizlyar Valley”, which is located on the shores of the Caspian Sea, in one of the most beautiful cities in the North Caucasus.  If the first recreation centers in Makhachkala by the sea are most often visited by youth companies and families with small children, then an older audience gathers here.  Here are the best mineral springs and healing mud, which means you can improve your health.  But that is not all.  The nature of these places is amazingly beautiful, which is probably why this number of tourists visits recreation centers in Makhachkala every year.  Near the sea there is a wide beach strip, an abundance of beautiful landscapes, natural monuments, a warm sea and ionized air - all this attracts the attention of all categories of tourists.  Judging by the reviews, I want to come back here again and again. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest in Dagestan" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1026791.jpg" width="448"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel Mayak </h2><p>  Today we are finishing to consider recreation facilities in Makhachkala.  By the sea here, any corner will seem like a paradise, especially if there are comfortable conditions for living.  This large hotel complex is located along the Sulak highway, four kilometers from the traffic police post.  The only inconvenience is that you have to get to the beach a little longer.  However, the price is also significantly lower, the luxury room here costs only 1,500 rubles.  At the same time, the room has all the necessary furniture, appliances and utensils, a refrigerator and air conditioning.  For a good rest in comfortable conditions, they take very little money.  Judging by the reviews of tourists, the location of the hotel is a very small minus, the coast can be reached very easily.  In general, an amazing hotel, where you want to be again and again. </p>
