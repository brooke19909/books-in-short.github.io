The conditions may vary depending on the institution with which the cooperation was established.  The key parameter of loan repayment is the date of deposit of funds and their amount. </p><p>  In the article we will consider what credit debts are. </p><h2>  Date of payment and maturity </h2><p>  The term of a credit debt is determined by the last concrete day of each month, for example, until the tenth, fifteenth, or twenty-fifth day.  In some situations, this date can be changed and tied to the time of receipt of wages.  Banks often meet their needs, as it is beneficial for them to pay salaries close to the day of debt repayment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flatworldsolutions.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="credit debts" class="if uuid-3077011" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3077011.jpg"></div><p>  It should also be borne in mind that, depending on the nature of the payment, the funds transferred may arrive at the bank account within a few days (usually from one to three days).  In the event that a person does not deposit money at the cash desk of the organization from which the loan was taken, payment must be made <span>in advance in order for the money to be credited to the account by the required date.</span>  <span>Against the background of a delay in the return of funds, even for one day many institutions impose fines in the form of fixed amounts or interest for each day of delay.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Consider the most famous - credit - debt. </p><h2>  Card debt </h2><p>  Credit plastic is a very convenient way to shop for goods and pay for services.  Thanks to this, you can withdraw cash at any time.  This makes it possible to purchase any necessary things almost immediately, without waiting for the moment when it will be possible to accumulate a sufficient amount of money for a particular acquisition.  But in this case, the contract is drawn up on certain conditions and requirements that the client should fulfill.  Otherwise, credit card debt may form. </p><p>  So, why can a person have card debt?  Such products have their own characteristics in each bank.  Despite the fact that the legislation regulates the action of bank structures for credit cards, the conditions in each organization can vary significantly.  In this regard, in the framework of drawing up a contract on a card, it is extremely important to pay attention to the conditions offered by a particular organization. </p><p>  Here are the basic concepts of credit debt that every borrower needs to own and know how they work.  So, we are talking about the payment, settlement and grace period.  As for the latter, you need to know about its timing, and in addition, about what financial transactions it applies to.  It takes into account, among other things, the obligatory payment and the features of its formation.  An equally important concept of credit card debt is the commission for depositing and withdrawing funds, along with the cost of service, fines and penalties provided for in the contract. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  These are basic concepts that need to be discussed with the manager before signing the agreement.  Thus, it will be possible to avoid unpleasant consequences in the framework of using a card tool and it is beneficial to carry out your personal financial activities. </p><h2>  Mandatory payment </h2><p>  This repayment of credit debt represents the amount that the bank expects from the borrower in the specified period.  Skipping an obligatory payment for at least one day will result in serious consequences in the form of fines and penalties.  For example, a person may be charged in the amount of five hundred rubles for not having fulfilled the condition of the document, and a fine from 0.1 to 1-2% daily of the amount of the overdue debt is calculated until the money is received in the bank. </p><p>  <span>Mandatory payment,</span> as a rule, is formed on the basis of the calculation period and is usually from five to seven percent of the total debt.  This figure includes part of the base debt along with the amount for using the loan, commission, fines and penalties. </p><p>  What other credit debts do banks have? </p><h2>  Card Maintenance Cost </h2><p>  As long as the credit card acts as an active tool, it accrues the cost of annual service.  This is a fee that must be paid once a year for the fact that the customer uses plastic.  Different prices are assigned based on the terms of the agreement.  Usually from five hundred to two thousand rubles. </p><p>  At the same time, it is extremely important to separate the concepts of blocking plastic and closing a loan agreement.  Many borrowers believe that since they blocked the card and did not use it at all, then no debt to the bank could arise. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  But money is usually charged not so much for using plastic as for the fact that the borrower has a card account in the banking structure.  Therefore, if a person decided not to use the card anymore, it is necessary to notify his banking organization about this and terminate the corresponding agreement. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cardrates.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="debt collection" class="if uuid-3077031" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3077031.jpg"></div><h2>  Credit debts to Sberbank </h2><p>  In the event that the client wants to find out his loan debt at a branch of the financial institution in question, he can use the following three methods: by phone, on the Internet, or make a personal visit. </p><p>  You can find out the debt through the Network only if the person has the Internet banking service activated.  In this case, detailed monetary statistics on loans can be seen on the official website directly in your account.  Among other things, at any time you can connect to your Internet bank.  To do this, it will be enough just to write a statement in the branch of the relevant organization or call the support service. </p><p>  In order to find out the debt on loans, you can simply call the department by calling the hotline, which can be found on the official website of this financial institution.  And finally, you can just visit the nearest office to contact the responsible employee, who will certainly make an extract on the debt. </p><h2>  What will be the consequences if the debt is not paid? </h2><p>  <span>Are credit debt courts held?</span> </p><p>  In the event that the client cannot repay his loan due to any specific life circumstances, and not just maliciously, then employees recommend not to be afraid of anything and immediately tell about the problem. </p><p>  If you do not pay at all, then the consequences for the debtor will be very deplorable.  It is well known that Sberbank does not stand on ceremony with debtors and, in cases of refusal to settle the situation peacefully, immediately sues this or that person. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cnbc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="loan term" class="if uuid-3077030" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3077030.jpg"></div><p>  However, in the event that the client has the opportunity to make a loan payment and he informs the bank about this, the organization may refuse to send bailiffs to the debtor in order to recover financial resources, even when the court verdict has been issued and the executive sheet. </p><p>  How is debt collection collected? </p><h2>  More on debt collection services </h2><p>  The customer troubled debts division deals with borrowers who do not pay loans, usually for more than six months.  Similar units are present in every city.  In order to contact this service, you must contact the contact general number listed on the site.  It is not possible to find out the personal phone number of the collection service, as these bank employees call debtors from different numbers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bankofjordan.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="credit debts to banks" class="if uuid-3077013" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3077013.jpg"></div><h2>  Does Sberbank sell debt to collectors? </h2><p>  The answer to this question will be positive.  Sberbank sells debts of individuals to collectors.  Usually they are given back only completely bad debts when the delay is more than one year.  Before this period, the financial institution tries to solve the problem on its own.  Debt is sold in the form of tenders, immediately in large quantities for many relevant agencies, which are sent an offer to participate in the repurchase. </p><h2>  Credit Debt Write-off Center </h2><p>  Such a service deals with the filing of bankruptcy of individuals.  Some are afraid that such a "ruin" will be a stigma for life, but this is completely not so.  The law establishes only three restrictions that completely disappear after five years.  Thus, after this period, the life of the borrower will literally begin from scratch. </p><p>  Credit debt write-off centers help citizens file bankruptcy to start all over again.  Such services specialize in such matters and are aware of all the pitfalls.  Lawyers work in them along with financiers and arbitration managers, which allows the procedure to be carried out safely and under control. </p><p>  As a rule, there are no unsolvable cases and for each there is a way out of the situation.  The center for writing off credit debts helps to get the maximum benefit from the legislation in the framework of bankruptcy.  The following organizations are usually contacted: </p><ul><li>  Various entrepreneurs whose business for some reason and circumstances did not go. </li><li>  Debtors burdened with consumer loans, microloans, etc. </li><li>  Borrowers from whom the subject of a mortgage was sold at the auction. </li><li>  Debtors for loans and receipts from individuals. </li></ul><p>  How to check credit debts? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dawrat.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="credit check" class="if uuid-3077014" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3077014.jpg"></div><h2>  Verification Methods </h2><p>  You can find out the amount of funds that must be returned in the following ways: </p><ul><li>  Contacting the office to any bank employee. </li><li>  Call banking specialists on line.  Usually it is free. </li><li>  Such information can always be found in your personal account on the site. </li><li>  It is possible, among other things, sending SMS with a request for the amount of debt. </li><li>  Checking through an ATM or terminal. </li><li>  Connection of SMS-mailing or electronic notification. </li><li>  Such information can be found on the FSSP website (this is relevant in advanced cases, when it comes to court). </li></ul><p>  How to find out credit debts is interesting to many.  Of course, everything directly depends on the banks.  In some of them you can always find out the debt in any of the above ways, and in <span>others, only if you contact the office.</span>  <span>In any situation, as part of the loan, the client must provide a memo in which all possible options will be given.</span>  <span>In the event that one is missing, you must go to any branch of a banking institution and ask for it.</span>  <span>How can you learn about your debts from the bailiffs if a person has not paid for a long time and the case has reached the court?</span>  <span>In a similar situation, you can find out how much and to whom a person owes money directly on the FSSP website.</span> </p><p>  How can I simplify the process of repaying credit debt? </p><h2>  Restructuring </h2><p>  As part of solving problems with credit defaults, Sberbank has a number of tools, including: </p><ul><li>  Prolonged contract. </li><li>  Providing a deferral of payment of funds. </li><li>  An individual repayment schedule. </li><li>  Conducting debt restructuring. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="magyartakarek.blog.hu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="debt relief" class="if uuid-3077012" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3077012.jpg"></div><p>  Extension is the extension of the loan agreement.  As part of the mortgage, the term can be extended by ten years, but not more than thirty-five in total.  For auto and consumer loans, validity periods can be extended by three years, but not more than seven years.  Due to this, the amount of the monthly payment is reduced, which gives the debtor the opportunity to return to the payment schedule.  Moreover, overpayment on loans, of course, will increase. </p><p>  Deferred payment of the basic debt is given, as a rule, for a period of up to two years.  This gives the debtor the opportunity to pay only interest in the form of the minimum amount necessary to fulfill their obligations to the bank.  The disadvantage of this method is that during the postponement period, the amount of debt does not decrease, and upon completion it will have to continue to pay the entire amount of debt and interest on it. </p><p>  An individual payment schedule is suitable mainly for businessmen whose income is associated with seasonal factors and circumstances of entrepreneurial activity, against which there are problems with payments in the so-called ‚Äúoff-season‚Äù.  Not monthly, but quarterly or minimum payments for several months or a large one at the end of the half year can be set.  Among other things, Sberbank may establish simplified payment conditions.  This financial institution also sometimes changes the schedule from differentiated to annuity, and vice versa. </p><p>  Restructuring of debt on loans in this institution allows conscientious borrowers to maintain a positive history even if they find themselves in a difficult life situation and are temporarily unable to fulfill obligations.  As part of the confirmation, the bank will require, in addition to a statement with explanations, documents in the form of a labor note with a note about dismissal, a medical report, a certificate of salary reduction, etc., depending on the situation. </p><p>  In the event that the debt appeared due to the fact that the client received too many loans and is now unable to make payments, the financial institution can go forward and give the opportunity for restructuring.  In order to confirm, the bank will require loan agreements and statements on making payments on them. </p><p>  Most applications for restructuring by Sberbank, as a rule, are approved if justified reasons related to the impossibility of payments were mentioned.  The maximum failure rate is observed among car loans, in which case the bank offers to sell the car (especially if it is very expensive) and pay off the corresponding debt. </p><p>  In order to find out all the requirements for this service in Sberbank, you need to call a special number, and it is best to immediately go to the office, collect the necessary documents and write a statement. </p><div class="photo" data-original="deltoroloanservicing.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="credit card debt" class="if uuid-3077017" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3077017.jpg"></div><h2>  Refinancing </h2><p>  Recently, lending rates are regularly reduced.  Twenty years ago, they were twenty-four, and now fourteen percent.  Refinancing has now become very profitable.  Recently, the Central Bank regularly reduces the rate, which leads to cheaper debts. </p><p>  The new financial institution extinguishes the client‚Äôs debt and concludes a new agreement with him.  This, as a rule, is done at a lower percentage, although sometimes for a longer period, so as not to be at a loss.  It will still be more convenient for the borrower, since he will pay several thousand less per month. </p><p>  This procedure is usually slow, takes a month and a half.  A citizen will have to re-collect all documents, as is usually the case in the framework of obtaining a regular loan.  You can refinance several loans at once and simply combine them into one. </p>
