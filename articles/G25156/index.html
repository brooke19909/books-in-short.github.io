    <p>  In order to weave a bracelet, it is worth using a machine tool.  Type two pairs on a column of 7 rubber bands each.  Move them with the hook one at a time.  When one figure is ready, you can proceed to the next.  As a result of simple actions, a stylish bracelet will be obtained. </p><h2>  Some recommendations to consider </h2><p>  As already mentioned, there are a lot of weaving techniques.  They will depend on the number of rubber bands, their color, the availability of a special machine and, of course, skills.  If you saw a beautiful bracelet with complex weaving, do not immediately try to repeat it, if you have not done this before.  Everything is recommended to be done gradually. </p><p>  What should be considered in the process of creating products? </p><ol><li>  How to make rubber figures?  On a fork, on pencils or knitting needles you can weave equally successfully.  But these tools can be used only if the weaving is simple.  Otherwise, you must use the machine.  Especially if the figure is extremely complex in the weaving pattern. </li><li>  You can weave on the fingers - index and middle.  To do this, you will first need to prepare gum, arrange them according to shades.  After that, we begin to put them on fingers and weave, guided by the pattern.  This weaving process may seem quite complicated.  But this is not so.  After gaining experience, actions will begin to be performed on the machine. </li><li>  More convenient compared to pencils or knitting needles is a slingshot.  She has the optimal thickness of the horns.  Yes, and hands remain free.  In addition, with the help of it you can perform medium in complexity of weaving. </li><li>  If a hobby could interest and captivate you, you should think about buying a mini-machine.  With it, it will be possible to create more complex products, where forks and knitting can not be dispensed with. </li><li>  Bracelets and figurines can be worn independently, but can be presented.  You can even create a variety of products for sale.  However, if the fantasy regarding weaving bracelets is over, then proceed to weaving a variety of shapes.  They can be very complex and simple.  Again, much will depend on the imagination. </li></ol><h2>  You can take part in numerous competitions </h2>
