If ten years ago, one loan in the family was a rarity, but today the bill goes to three, four or more.  Sometimes even a wife does not know if her husband has debts.  Today we‚Äôll talk about how to find out if there are loans on a person.  This can be important information for a young couple who are about to get married.  Is it possible to plan a happy future, if one of you has outstanding debt, and you plan to take another to organize a wedding?  This is a special case, but sometimes it can lead to divorce.  Consider ways to recognize this "dark" side of life. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out if there are loans on the person" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2131236.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  The first way - we check the history through official services </h2><p>  Since you can find out if there are loans on a person only he can, you will need to enlist his permission.  So, the first way, check your credit history through a special portal or credit bureau.  In the first case, you will need an electronic signature and basic information about the person.  In the second case, one cannot do without a power of attorney.  In fact, the request in this case does not sound like finding out if there are loans on a person, but he, through you, wants to check his data.  Of course, for this he provides all his data, signatures, and if necessary, he is personally present at the issue. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Verification through bailiffs </h2><p>  There is another option, which sometimes has to be resorted to.  If you are looking for a way to find out if there are loans on the person, and he voluntarily does not want to tell anything, then you can check the information through the bailiffs.  But this method is suitable only if there is an overdue debt. </p><p>  Is it possible to find out if a person has a loan simply by contacting a bank?  No, in this case, employees will be forced to refuse, because the information is closed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out if a person took a loan" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2131237.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Authorized Services </h2><p>  We emphasize once again that if he regularly pays the bills, then not a single bailiff will help to find out if a person took a loan from a bank.  Why might this be required?  For example, a father does not pay child support, but suddenly the ex-wife finds out that he took a loan.  Of course, if you find out in time in which bank he was given the money, you can seize the account through a bailiff.  But not a single bailiff will search all banks. </p><p>  Another thing is if a debt has formed.  In this case, there are two ways to determine the availability and amount of debt: </p><ul><li>  Personal appeal to the bailiff service. </li><li>  Online through the site. </li></ul><p>  Of course, in any of these two cases (if a debt is discovered) there will be an unpleasant conversation about how you will pay it off.  By the way, choosing the first option does not make much sense, because through the Internet you can find out equivalent information in a matter of minutes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it possible to find out if a person has a loan?" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2131235.jpg"></div>

Therefore, such information is most often of interest to employers and borrowers, as well as those who are worried about the machinations of fraudsters.  Is it possible for you to get a loan without your knowledge?  Yes, in recent years, scammers have stepped up and use any loophole.  If you have lost documents at least once in your life, then it is likely that they were used for such purposes.  So how do you know if a loan is hanging on a person?  You just need to make a request.  A printed story will show all the movements that were made by you, or on your behalf. </p><h2>  Where does it all start? </h2><p>  How is a database formed for borrowers?  From the first day, when you come to fill out a loan application, all information is collected from you.  Passport data, work experience, number of dependents.  Now, for many years, the credit bureau will store data about each person who once took a loan.  If you were a co-borrower or guarantor, you will not be an exception.  Moreover, even if you did not take the money, but only made a request about this, this information will also be reflected here.  As a result, it will be enough to take a printout and make sure that your story is completely clear. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="find out if a person took a loan from a bank" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2131233.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  What gives a credit history? </h2><p>  Can I find out how many loans a person has?  Yes, quite if you get access to this information.  A good story is the key to lending at a bank, and on favorable terms.  Therefore, if you plan to take a mortgage in the future, they recommend gradually increasing the bank's loyalty.  To do this, take a small loan for new shoes, household appliances.  Gradually, the bank will begin to offer better conditions. </p><p>  What is sanctified in history?  First of all, loans.  This also applies to what a person has already paid.  Separately, you can get information on existing loans.  Finally, you will see the dates of the appeal, as well as refusals, if any. </p><p>  I would like to immediately note that these data are not subject to adjustment, especially on their own.  Since it is possible to find out whether a person took a loan only with his consent, when applying for a loan, the bank will definitely let him sign a consent agreement.  If you refuse to sign it, then even a bank employee has no right to look into these data.  But will they approve a loan in this case? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it possible to find out how many people have loans" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2131239.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Credit history structure </h2><p>  This is an ordinary document that contains comprehensive information.  That is, the surname, name and patronymic of the borrower and his passport data.  Tax ID and insurance number.  Then follows the main part of the document, which prescribes all the information about the money taken.  The dates of all messages to credit organizations and the responses of banks will also be listed there. </p><h2>  If an error is detected </h2><p>  Unfortunately, it happens.  If you requested a story and found inaccurate data in it, or maybe just a typo, you need to contact to verify this data.  Now the task of the operator will be to find out at what stage it was allowed.  Perhaps they will require a printout from the bank in which you issued the loan.  The operator will verify the data and, on the basis of the statement, will change it if it really did not correspond to reality. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out if a loan is hanging on a person" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2131240.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Annual discharge </h2><p>  Not everyone knows that there is a free service to inform the public about the state of the credit history.  Once a year you can get the data for free.  If you want to get this information again in a few months, you will have to pay from 800 to 2000 rubles.  And again I want to emphasize that you can‚Äôt find out information about another person, even if this is your close relative.  All information is strictly confidential and not publicly available. </p><h2>  Sberbank of Russia </h2><p>  Today it is the most popular among the population.  Therefore, I would like to consider using an example how to find out if there are loans per person at Sberbank.  There is also a privacy law.  That is, only a person who has passed the identification can request information. </p><p>  To implement this request, the client must find an individual code.  Usually it is issued at the first appeal, but can be obtained later at any branch of the bank.  But if there is no time, then you can fulfill this request online.  Data can be in different bureaus, so first you need to find out where to look for it. </p><p>  This can be done using the online service of the Central Bank.  Here you enter the data in the questionnaire and after processing the data, the data will be sent to the mailing address.  There are other ways to get data: </p><ul><li>  Directly contact the bureau with a personal passport. </li><li>  Use the internet.  In this case, immediately indicate that you are interested in the history of loans taken from Sberbank. </li></ul><p>  Usually, there are no problems at this stage.  The request is processed quickly, and after a few minutes you get all the necessary information.  They can be presented as a certificate of absence of debts or for personal purposes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out if there are loans per person in a savings bank" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2131241.jpg"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  From the foregoing, it can be said that you will not be able to find out information about the loans of another person, unless his consent is obtained.  However, it turns out that even if you do not have loans, checking the data will never be superfluous.  This can be especially relevant if you have lost documents or stolen them from you.  Fraudsters do not sleep and may try to get a loan for you.  Today, more than ever, you need to be vigilant. </p>
