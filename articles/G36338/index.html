The hotel is located in the resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãCosta Adeje.  This is the very south of the Canary.  To the ocean coast from the hotel - about half a kilometer, so we can say that the hotel is located on the second line of the beach.  In truth, this resort complex is a serviced apartment, while at the same time, with the availability of funds, you can count on buffet breaks from dishes.  But the hotel is intended, rather, for independent tourists who want to cook for themselves and save on restaurants. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Laguna Park 2 Tenerife" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1486288.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get and when it is better to go </h2><p>  Queen Sofia Airport is a ten-minute drive from Laguna Park 2 Hotel (Tenerife).  If you do not have a transfer and a car, it is best to take the bus number one hundred and eleven, which goes from the airport to the city of Adeje.  They walk every half hour.  The climate on the islands is uniform, therefore, in the absence of a sharp change of seasons, you can go here all year round.  But still, it is the beach season that lasts, as in most European countries, from May to October.  It is here, in the south of Tenerife, most travelers seek.  In winter, young people travel to these places to stare at colorful festivals and carnivals.  But, according to the recommendations of tourists, the best time to visit this region of the Canary Islands is September-October.  This is the season when it is not too hot and not at all cold. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Costa Adeje </h2><p>  This resort appeared on the map of the island recently.  It used to be just the Las Americas region.  This is a rather hilly area, which affected the location of the Hotel Laguna Park 2 (Tenerife, Costa Adaha).  Photos taken from the mountain, however, are excellent and give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis resort.  The hotels that are built here are quite expensive, and prices are higher than in neighboring Las Americas.  The ancient town of Adeje itself, by whose name the resort is named, is very beautiful, with a variety of architectural attractions.  It is good to walk and go to local taverns to feel the real Canarian flavor.  Costa Adeje is considered the best in Tenerife for families with children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lagoon park 2 tenerife reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1486294.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the studios and apartments of the Laguna Park 2 Hotel (Tenerife) have equipped kitchens.  However, keep in mind that all products that are not in the refrigerator should be wrapped tightly in bags so that local ants do not come to visit you.  If desired, guests can eat in three restaurants of the complex.  El Chorro is rather a tapas bar, although there is also hot food.  But basically the institution is famous for its famous paella, pizzas, various Spanish spicy appetizers, sandwiches and sandwiches.  Good ice cream is also served here.  La Rotonda works in the style of a buffet.  There are delicious desserts and salads.  El Rincon is like a regular hotel restaurant, but there are good grilled dishes, and you can also order a special menu: children's, vegetarian, and so on.  If you take a room with good nutrition, you will not regret it.  Despite the fact that ‚ÄúLaguna Park 2‚Äù (Tenerife) (its rating, as already mentioned, is not very high), there are only two stars, the food here is excellent.  They make fine coffee (from the car), an excellent and varied dinner. </p>

    <p>  Pastries and sandwiches can be taken out of the restaurant from breakfast, no one will tell you anything.  At the hostel drinks at your own expense.  And for ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù you need to pay 22 euros per day per person. <br><br></p><h2>  Sea vacation </h2><p>  To get to the ocean, you need to go down the hill.  Some travelers see this as a kind of free fitness.  Although, of course, for older people or those with disabilities, this can be problematic.  Therefore, a free shuttle runs daily to the ocean from the hotel.  His schedule is at the reception.  Walk about fifteen minutes.  Sun beds are paid, but you can sunbathe on towels.  The closest to the hotel, Fanabe Beach is very good for children.  Virtually no waves, gentle entry into the water, shallow.  After all, the Costa Adeje resort is located in a bay closed almost from all sides.  The water is very warm.  A good coast and in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe beaches of Troy.  All of them are awarded with the Blue Flag, equipped, with showers, changing rooms, toilets and parking lots.  But tourists recommend not sitting all the time on the beach closest to the Laguna Park 2 Hotel (Tenerife).  Reviews are advised to stroll along the coast, both in the Adeje region and Las Americas.  The hotel has a swimming pool, where it is nice not only to freshen up, but also just to sit.  The water in it is not chlorinated, but real, sea.  She is pumped straight from the ocean. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  From walks on the sea, a trip to the island of La Gomera, as well as whale watching, are advised.  It‚Äôs best to buy an excursion on the street, it‚Äôs cheaper than in the Hotel Laguna Park 2 (Tenerife).  Photos of these walks will then remind you of the unforgettable minutes you spent on the islands.  The bonus of such an acquisition is the excellent organization of trips, and local travel agencies have at their disposal Russian guides.  If you want to visit the north of the Canary, especially Teide, then you will have to rent a car or rent it with a driver.  The cost of a car rental is about thirty euros per day.  Since most often the hotel offers open top convertibles for this purpose, do not forget to bring warm clothes with you.  If you go to the mountains, then the temperature there may drop to ten degrees or less.  For example, on <span>the Teide volcano it is</span> often quite cold - plus five. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Laguna Park 2 Tenerife Costa Adahe photo" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1486291.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where to go if there is no car </h2><p>  From independent travel without a car, tourists recommend Santa Cruz and La Laguna.  Moreover, the bus station is a quarter of an hour away from the Hotel Laguna Park 2 (Tenerife, Costa Adache).  Guest reviews contain some secrets of inexpensive travel.  In order to use local beads without a price, you need to buy a special card at the station (in the bar).  There is no cash desk here.  Therefore, cards are bought either in bars or directly from the driver.  The latter is much more expensive.  You can go to La Laguna from Santa Cruz directly by tram, whose stop is located near the bus station.  It is very nice to walk there, and the prices in the cafe are lower than in Adeje.  For lovers of hiking and trekking, a lot of opportunities open up, such as a trip to the so-called Hell's Gorge.  On the pedestrian path laid through the jungle, you can get to the only waterfall on the whole island.  Tourists, as a rule, share their admiration for the eternal spring reigning on the island, parks and relict forests, precipices, cliffs and the ocean. </p><h2>  What hotel guests say </h2><p>  Hotel Laguna Park 2 (Tenerife) receives good reviews from tourists.  The guests who visited the hotel praise the staff of the complex for their courtesy and attitude towards people.  The apartments are called very worthy, comfortable and even elegant.  There are few Russian-speaking tourists at the hotel, mainly the British love him.  Guests note that the hotel has delicious and hearty breakfasts.  Many recommend the hotel and promise to come again.  For budget accommodation, it fits perfectly, and the money saved can be spent on sightseeing on the island.  The rating of the hotel is different when judged by its guests, depending on the site - from almost four on ‚Äútop hotels‚Äù to 6.7 on ‚Äúbooking‚Äù.  And do not be afraid of the number 2 on the sign - after all, the stardom of a hotel in Tenerife is often determined not by the quality of service, but by its remoteness from the ocean.  Therefore, many who first visited the hotel were surprised that this was not a ‚Äúfour‚Äù. </p>
