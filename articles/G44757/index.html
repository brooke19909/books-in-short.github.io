    <h2>  Willow </h2><p>  The willow family includes a large number of plants, these are: </p><ul><li>  osokor </li><li>  rakita (laurel willow), </li><li>  willow (goat willow), </li><li>  almond willow </li><li>  vine, </li><li>  talnik (red flower), </li><li>  winds </li><li>  Sheluga. </li></ul><p>  Plants have different heights and lengths of branches.  Shrubs and huge trees 30 m high are found in nature. </p><h2>  Preparation for work </h2><p>  The first stage of weaving is the harvesting of vines.  There is no way to do without it.  Professionals harvest branches for the year ahead.  It will take a lot of energy and time, but the resources spent are worth it.  The optimal harvesting time for residents of the middle lane is August ‚Äì September.  At this time, the vine is already ripe, and the movement of juice on the bars comes to naught.  If you prepare the raw materials in August, there will be no problems with cleaning it from the bark (debarking) and splitting. </p><p>  Strongly do not engage in harvesting in June and July.  Last year's shoots at this time are scrubbed, and fresh shoots are not yet ripe.  Young shoots are grassy and loose, not suitable for work. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Picking vines </h2><p>  You can cut the vine while walking in the park or on the banks of a river or lake.  It is advisable to devote a few days to the collection.  Sliced ‚Äã‚Äãraw materials should be processed in the first few hours after slicing.  It will dry out later.  It needs to be cleaned and chopped.  If for some reason you could not do this right away, then there is a solution.  Boil or steam the rods for 40 minutes. </p><p>  Be careful, untreated rods should not be soaked in a snow-white bath, they will color it brown due to the release of tannins.  It will be very difficult to clean the bath. </p><h2>  The method of "revitalization" </h2><p>  If you have enough time and you don‚Äôt want to boil the vine, you can use the ‚Äúrevitalization‚Äù method.  Put the branches in the water, dipping the thick ends of 5-10 cm. Germination takes about 28 days. </p><h2>  Vine staining </h2><p>  Why do I need to stain the branches before weaving from willow twigs?  Sometimes, in order for a product to "fit" into the interior, it needs to be given a certain shade.  Masters for changing the color of natural raw materials use: </p><ul><li>  dyes </li><li>  mordants </li><li>  pigments. </li></ul><p>  In addition to changing the appearance, coloring protects the product from aging, burnout and precipitation. </p><p>  When collecting raw materials for weaving, pay attention to the fragility of the vines.  The main property of willow twigs is rigidity.  For weaving different parts of the product you will need raw materials of different degrees of rigidity.  For example, to weave the racks of a basket, you need more dense branches.  To weave the transverse elements, flexible rods are needed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is believed that the branches of annual bushes are more flexible, but less durable.  It is better to cut raw materials from several different trees and determine its stiffness in the process. </p><h2>  Master class "Wicker basket of twigs" </h2><p>  A basket of willow twigs is a beautiful and functional thing.  Traditionally, Easter cakes are put in them for lighting in the church on the eve of the Easter holiday.  With such a stylish basket, you can go to the market or to the store.  Craftsmen can store their materials in them.  Younger family members are happy to put toys in wicker baskets.  When you become a true professional in this matter, you can weave for children a large chest for storing children's treasures. </p><p>  Materials for work: </p><ul><li>  awl, </li><li>  sharp knife </li><li>  rods </li><li>  secateurs. </li></ul><p>  Take four branches and make a 3 cm hole in their center. Insert four more into these holes.  You will get a cross, which will be the basis for further work.  Insert two more rods into the cross and start braiding them.  Now it will be necessary to braid each branch individually.  Try to keep the elements flat and tight.  Gradually, you will get an even circle.  When you braid the first two circles, then you need to take two more elements and stick them between the first branches. </p>

    <h2>  The walls of the basket </h2><p>  To make the walls you need a willow rod of medium thickness.  To begin, we will build a base for the walls.  Along each rod of which the bottom consists, you need to put a new branch.  The ends of the old branches are removed.  We continue work with new raw materials.  We spend each new branch to the left and down, and then up.  Do the same with the rest of the elements.  The most recent rods cannot be bent.  They should be twisted around the branches that go in the beginning.  Now the weaving elements need to be securely fixed, otherwise the basket will not keep its shape. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Three new branches come into play.  The leftmost element is bent to the right in front of other branches that are located in close proximity.  We start them for the third element of weaving and return it to its place.  The other two rods should suffer the same fate. </p><p>  For each rack in a circle, add one branch.  Braid each element of the rack.  Add branches until the whole basket of willow twigs is braided.  Finish weaving will need using three elements.  All excess should be cut off.  The branches that end the racks must be bent down and weaved into the product. </p>

    <h2>  Handle weaving </h2><p>  Crafts from willow twigs, such as a basket, usually end with a pen.  Consider the stages of its manufacture.  For the base you will need a thick branch of blackberry or willow twig (vine).  Bend the element and imagine in your head what size the handle of the basket will be.  All unnecessary needs to be cut off.  This is an important stage, and here the rule is ‚Äúmeasure seven times, but you may not have to cut it‚Äù.  If you cut off the excess, then the basket will not come out neat.  Sharpen the ends of the rods with a knife and insert them into the places where you would like the handles to be. </p><p>  Take five thick branches and place them around the base of the handle.  Pass the extra length over the edge of the basket.  This will serve as an additional fixation of the handle to the basket.  This must be done on both sides.  Next, you will need a thin willow rod.  They wrap the handle in several places.  That's almost all you need to know about weaving baskets from willow twigs.  There is enough information to try to create your own masterpiece. </p><h2>  Vine wreath </h2><p>  For many nations, a traditional home decoration on holidays is a wreath decorated with cones, nuts, flowers, Christmas decorations, Easter souvenirs.  This decor is a talisman and has a sacred meaning.  In the process of weaving, you should have pure thoughts.  Wish all households health and good luck, and everything will come true. </p><p>  To create a wreath you will need: </p><ul><li>  twine, </li><li>  willow twig. </li></ul><p>  We will start working with pre-prepared branches.  Determine the size of the product.  Take four branches and dress them sequentially at a distance from the palm of an adult.  Thus, add branches and close the circle.  The foundation is ready. </p>

    <p>  Now add branches for a larger thickness of the product.  We knit all subsequent rods in a checkerboard pattern, as shown in the photo.  In order for the wreath to have a neat appearance, all sections must look in one direction.  If you plan to hang it on the wall, then they should be on the back of the product.  Fix the willow rod tightly between each other.  You can connect the elements together with twine. </p>

    <h2>  Christmas stars from vines in a rustic style </h2><p>  <span>Rustic</span> New Year's decor is suitable for a country house.  The emphasis here is on the rough texture of natural materials.  Shades of products, as a rule, are earthy, muffled, but at the same time they create an atmosphere of warmth and comfort.  In the article, we suggest learning how to make simple New Year's toys in a rustic style - stars made of twigs that can be hung on a Christmas tree or decorated with a fireplace.  Be careful with toys in this style, a large number of such decorative elements can create a difficult atmosphere. </p><p>  To make one toy you will need: </p><ul><li>  2-3 rods with a thickness of 6 mm; </li><li>  thin flexible vine branches with a thickness of 3 mm; </li><li>  copper wire; </li><li>  ruler; </li><li>  secateurs. </li></ul><p>  You can make a star of any size.  The optimum height is 12 cm. </p><p>  Take 5 thick sticks.  Wind two pairs with thick wire, leave one stick free.  Extend the ends of the wound twigs on one side.  Form a star from two pairs.  Wrap a loose wand. </p><h2>  Braiding a star </h2><p>  Holding the edge with your hands, remove the wire from one corner.  Take a thin willow twig and wrap it around a corner.  At the end, make several turns, securing it in this way.  Do the same with the rest of the corners.  You will get a little rough, but stylish toy in a rustic style. </p><h2>  Reviews on this craft </h2><p>  Weaving from a rod is an ancient type of craft.  Among the Slavs, it is passed down from generation to generation.  This type of needlework can be an additional source of income for the craftswomen.  Some are so addicted to this time-consuming, but creative process, that they make braiding the main job. </p>

    <p>  Many who begin to engage in this type of needlework say they have become calmer.  Occupation relieves irritability and sets in a meditative manner.  Harvesting raw materials is also an excellent occasion to spend time in nature and engage in physical labor.  This is especially true for people who weave large products or have an extensive customer base. </p><p>  Products of this type of raw material are environmentally friendly and durable.  Baskets and household items woven by professionals will last at least several decades.  A great gift to young parents is willow vine toys.  Children can calmly pull them into their mouths, lick.  Such a present will not bring harm.  In the manufacture of objects from the willow rod no harmful impurities are used.  No toxic fumes emit from products.  Food baskets can and should be stored in baskets of this raw material. </p><p>  The willow rod turns out stunningly beautiful furniture: whatnots, rocking chairs, cradles and much more.  Products are pleasant to the touch, carry the energy of wildlife, have pleasant shades.  They fit perfectly into almost any interior.  Wicker tables and chairs will decorate your veranda.  A wonderful gift for an elderly person and not only a <span>wicker rocking chair.</span>  Such a piece of furniture was also chosen by nursing mothers. </p>
