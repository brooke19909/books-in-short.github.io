  <section class="page js-page"><h1>In the XV-XVI centuries, the boyar thought was the highest authority</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  During the period of early feudal Kievan Rus, the princes, in need of discussion of social and political issues, convened the Council.  The prototype of the Duma consisted of princely entourage and had deliberative rights.  Another task of the Council was to limit the power of the prince, to control his decisions. </p><h2>  Duma of the XIV ‚Äì XV centuries </h2><p>  With the strengthening of the Moscow state, from the middle of the XIV century the Council was filled with rich and high-ranking boyars, it became boyar.  Its difference from the later authorities is the lack of an independent role of both the Duma and the Tsar.  Any decision was made jointly.  The increasing role of the Moscow principality contributed to the strengthening of the wealth and power of the boyars.  For this reason, the period from the middle of the XIV to the middle of the XV centuries is characterized by unanimity in the actions of the princely and boyar authorities, united by a community of interests. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikiart.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Boyar Duma A.Rubashkin" class="if uuid-3151103" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116115/3151103.jpg"></div><h2>  Preconditions for reform </h2><p>  Before Ivan IV (the Terrible), the rulers of Muscovy were Grand Dukes.  The first political decision of the seventeen-year ruler in 1547 was the decision to marry the kingdom.  Changing the status of the ruler contributed to the strengthening of the supreme power.  In addition to foreign policy (changing international legal status), Ivan pursued domestic political goals.  The wedding to the kingdom allowed him to become the sole ruler and enjoy unlimited rights. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The internecine boyar struggle led to the flourishing of lawlessness.  In the XV - XVI centuries.  The Boyar Duma was a hotbed of abuse and bribery.  The fire that destroyed Moscow became a boiling point for the people.  In the summer of 1547 uprisings broke out.  It became clear that the system of state power required fundamental transformations.  A number of reforms developed jointly with the Elected Rada (circle of associates) laid the foundation for the establishment of autocracy in 16th-century Muscovy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.redescoperaistoria.ro" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ivan IV V.Vasnetsov" class="if uuid-3151042" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116115/3151042.jpg"></div><h2>  Judicial Code of 1550. Composition and functions of the Boyar Duma in the 15-16 century </h2><p>  The first representative body of power in the Moscow state, consisting of nobles, clergy and servants, the Zemsky Sobor, was convened in 1549. The code of laws developed by him, Sudebnik, accurately discussed the higher legislative functions of the boyar duma.  Laws were subject to consideration and approval (sentence) by the boyars. </p><p>  In addition to performing legislative functions, in the 15-16 centuries.  The Boyar Duma was the highest executive authority. </p><p>  The tasks of the Duma included: </p><ul><li>  supervision of tax collection and public spending; </li><li>  control over the implementation of royal decrees; </li><li>  supervision of local government activities. </li></ul><p>  The judicial functions of the organization consisted in the consideration of land cases and lawsuits of civil servants.  In the XV - XVI centuries.  The Boyar Duma was a higher court: it dealt with cases received from local courts.  In addition to the functions of the legislative, executive and judicial powers, the Duma was entrusted with the tasks of the foreign ministry: through it, contacts were made with other states and conducting diplomatic correspondence. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the XV - XVI centuries.  The Boyar‚Äôs Duma was heterogeneous, especially under Ivan the Terrible: it included directly the boyars and immigrants from the middle boyar clans, roundabouts.  The most important government posts were still held by the boyars: they were appointed governors, ambassadors, governors.  Pupils were assigned to help them. </p><h2>  Fight with the boyars </h2><p>  The monarchy of the time of Ivan the Terrible was limited by custom, which required to take into account the views of the boyars when making government decisions.  Throughout the reign of Ivan IV tried to limit the rights of the Duma.  Being a strong legislative body by the end of the XV, in the XVI centuries.  the boyar thought was an opposition structure to the tsar. </p><p>  In 1553, he became seriously ill.  The boyars and members of the Chosen One were trying to promote his cousin to power, and not the son, who was appointed heir by the king.  Having recovered, Ivan dealt with members of the parliament and the Duma.  Those who disagree with tsarist politics were declared traitors by state, executed or deported. </p><p>  According to custom, the governors were appointed to know.  The basis of the Moscow army was the local army, which received land plots (estates) for service.  In order to lead the army himself and change the military leadership, the tsar needed to seize the land fund.  Blaming the boyars for the defeat in the Livonian War, he dealt with the feudal elite. </p><p>  Despite the persecution, the thought did not decrease, but even increased in composition.  The role of the feudal aristocracy decreased, and representatives of the ancient aristocratic clans were replaced by the untitled boyars, who obey the tsar unquestioningly. </p><p>  Unlike the XV, in the XVI century the Boyars' Duma was formal, especially the second half of the reign of Ivan the Terrible: the Duma did not participate in the discussion of bills.  The authoritarian autocratic power of Ivan the Terrible was established. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.m.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Oprichniki N. Nevrev" class="if uuid-3151033" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116115/3151033.jpg"></div><h2>  Oprichnina </h2><p>  Through innovations, Ivan seeks to limit the rights of the Duma and strengthen his own.  Now he single-handedly determines state traitors and chooses the punishment for them. </p><p>  In 1565, Ivan the Terrible divided the state into oprichnina and zemstvos.  Zemstvo management, as before, was carried out in conjunction with the Duma.  In the oprichnina, personal destiny, he became the sole ruler.  Landowners who did not want to enter the oprichnina had to vacate the land.  The possessions were crushed and distributed to the king‚Äôs close associates.  Having covered a significant part of the Moscow state, the oprichnina devastated the boyars and weakened their power. </p><div class="photo" data-original="community.artauthority.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ivan groznyj" class="if uuid-3151234" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116115/3151234.jpg"></div><h2>  The Duma of the late XVI - early XVIII centuries </h2><p>  After the death of Ivan the Terrible, the influence of the Boyar Duma increased.  Frightened by the actions of the tsar, the boyars and the Duma from 1584 (the death of Ivan the Terrible) to 1612 (the formation of the people's militia) tried to strengthen their positions.  The 17th century is characterized by calm relations between the Duma and the Tsar; none of them tried to occupy the first positions. </p><p>  The Boyar Duma lasted until 1711. The Senate, approved by Peter the Great on February 19, 1711, assumed the functions of the highest legislative and executive authority. </p>
