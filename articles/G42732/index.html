  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Do they give loans to pensioners?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The financial support of older people has recently become an increasingly relevant issue.  It may seem to some that pensioners never think about where to get the money, citing arguments of proportionate expenses, a quiet, modest life.  But in their life there are many reasons <noindex>  <span>take a loan</span> </noindex>  - This is treatment, dental services, trips to a sanatorium, home or equipment repair, utility bills.  Despite their considerable age, all the same needs remain, and the income level is low, so they also have to wonder where to get the money.  However, loans to unemployed citizens at the bank are reluctant, despite the lengthy consideration of the application. </p><p>  <strong>MFIs to help</strong> </p><p>  If banking institutions cannot meet, where to get money for a pensioner for vital expenses?  The best solution is microloans urgently.  In a microfinance organization, it is much easier to take a loan.  Moreover, they have several advantages that speak in their favor: </p><ul><li>  You can take microloans urgently for a small amount - it will be easier to pay off. </li><li>  Given for a short period, respectively, - the overpayment is small. </li><li>  You can get money without inquiries.  For this, you only need a passport. </li><li>  It is possible to choose a convenient way to transfer money - to an account, bank card or cash. </li><li>  It does not take much time.  Microloans are urgently transferred in any convenient way. </li></ul><p>  <strong>Online Services</strong> </p><p>  It‚Äôs worth adding to the list of listed advantages that you can apply for a loan online, eliminating the need to leave your home and stand in line.  At the mention of online services, Robot Seimer immediately comes to mind. <noindex>  <span>Online loan</span> </noindex>  anyone can take in the company.  This is especially convenient for older people - no need to go to the office, wait in line.  After filling out the application on the site, the service system itself analyzes all the data of the potential borrower and without the participation of a person makes a decision on approval.  Money comes to the card in an emergency mode in just a few minutes. </p><p>  The service works round the clock, without days off and breaks; you can arrange a loan online at any convenient time, saving yourself thoughts about where to get money.  However, there are no risks - Zaymer is officially registered as a microfinance organization. </p><p>  The general director of the company, Sergey Sedov, shared with us his observations that elderly people do not seek help very often - they are in third place in the number of loans paid.  This is about 12% of the total number of customers.  Sergei Sedov explains this by the greater responsibility of the past generation, their mentality.  These are really reliable customers - they consider it their duty to cover the debt and are doing their best to do it in a timely manner.  Another guarantee of return is the stability of pension payments.  Therefore, "Zaymer" always goes towards people who are on a well-deserved vacation, who do not know where to get money for basic needs. </p><p>  Based on materials https://www.zaymer.ru/ </p></div></article>
