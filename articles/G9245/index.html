Presents for every taste</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Holidays in Montenegro - an unforgettable pastime.  The country, surrounded by mountains, cliffs and the purest Adriatic Sea, seems simply fabulous!  It has a second name - Montenegro.  Today, there is not a single production, except for farms.  The country is one of the most environmentally friendly in the world.  What do tourists bring from Montenegro to their relatives and friends?  Naturally, local products, high-quality alcohol, clothing made from natural materials and much more.  It all depends on the preferences of the person to whom the gifts are intended. </p><h2>  Lovers have a delicious meal </h2><p>  In the <span>mountains of Montenegro</span> there is a small village called Negushi.  There are only no more than 200 inhabitants in it, but they were able to glorify Montenegro throughout the world!  Negush cheese is made from sheep or goat milk at home.  In taste, it is a bit like cheese, but not so salty. </p><div class="photo" data-original="martamontenegro.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Montenegrin cheeses" class="if uuid-2392360" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2392360.jpg"></div><p>  Everyone who came to Montenegro is obliged to try its national culinary treasure - they are prsut.  This is jerky, which is prepared in a special way.  Almost every villager does this, but it‚Äôs interesting that in every family his taste is a little different. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that outside the mountain village, meat does not turn out so exquisite.  Apparently, a mixture of continental and Mediterranean climate acts somehow especially on this process.  Start cooking it in the fall, when the air temperature drops to +10 ¬∞ C.  The cooking process takes 10-12 months. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Pay attention also to Montenegrin olive oil.  It is not inferior to Greek in quality, but much cheaper in price.  On sale there are both home and factory production. </p><h2>  Alcohol from Montenegro </h2><p>  Alcohol is usually included with delicacies.  This is included in the mandatory program of what is brought from Montenegro.  Montenegro has excellent wines and strong quality vodka. </p><p>  The most popular drinks from Montenegro: </p><ul><li>  red <span>wine "Vranats"</span> ; </li><li>  white wine "Krstach"; </li><li>  Montenegrin vodka "Rakia". </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="gastrogays.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Montenegrin wine Vranac" class="if uuid-2392610" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2392610.jpg"></div><h2>  Clothing from Montenegro </h2><p>  What is brought from Montenegro for the older generation?  As soon as you get to the market, the questions will disappear by themselves.  Bazaars here are full of handmade warm clothes made <span>of sheep's wool: vests,</span> socks, sweaters. </p><p>  There is something to please and younger fashionistas.  Advantageous neighborhood with Italy has made Montenegrin shops very popular.  Pay attention to products made of leather goods.  Shoes, jackets, accessories of excellent quality can be purchased here at a very competitive price. </p><p>  In Montenegro, there are almost no traditional shopping centers, so it is not so easy to find branded clothing.

The prices for Italian brands here are just wonderful! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Religious motives </h2><p>  What can be brought from Montenegro to believing people?  The famous thing is Montenegrin broyanitsa.  This is a bracelet made of sheep's wool.  Accessories are created by monks in monasteries.  In the process, 33 knots and seven intertwined crosses are obtained.  A bracelet costs about 2 euros.  They can also be purchased in souvenir shops, and they are cheaper there than in shops at monasteries. </p><p>  In Montenegro there are a lot of churches, temples, monasteries.  The most famous are in Ostrog and Cetinje.  From here, believers bring laudanders, icons, and crosses.  In church shops, also pay attention to the monastery honey.

In Montenegro it is a mouth guard.  A cylinder-shaped hat with a double-headed eagle with a shield on top.  It symbolizes the difficult historical path of the Montenegrin people. </p><p>  The first thing that catches your eye in souvenir shops is figurines of old spouses.  There are a lot of them.
