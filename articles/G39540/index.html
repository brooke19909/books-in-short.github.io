Rest here is a real pleasure, many tourists who have visited this place will definitely come back. </p><p>  But those who came to the Dominican Republic on business, it is better to find another option for housing.  After all, Punta Cana is located far from the center, so transport movements can cause a number of certain difficulties.  It is better to choose one of the hotels located in Santa Domingo, for example, the Barcelo Gran Hotel Lina complex. </p><h2>  Barcelo gran hotel lina </h2><p>  This hotel can be attributed to one of the most luxurious establishments.  The complex is assigned 5 stars.

    <p>  The hotel complex is equipped with several pools, which are not treated with bleach, but with a special solution without a specific smell.  You can safely swim with your eyes open.  Each pool has a bar.  Waiters quickly remember customer preferences and do their best to please.  A more lively poolside environment is closer to the ocean - there are daily animations. </p><p>  On the shore there is a restaurant that offers vacationers set lunches.  It is very comfortable. </p><p>  On the territory there are ponds with fish and turtles, herons and ducks walk freely.  The restaurants give loaves to feed them.  A train runs around the entire perimeter of the complex, which greatly facilitates movement when it is especially hot.  The territory itself is compact and very convenient for hiking. </p><p>  A place of honor at the Ocean Blue Sand 5 * entertainment hotel. </p><h2>  Animation </h2><p>  Days and evenings, vacationers are skillfully entertained by animators.  It is always fun and interesting.  In the evenings, live music sounds, guests are lured by incendiary Spanish dance motifs.  Then, exciting contests with songs and dances are held.  Every day, parodists, magicians, acrobats and other artists demonstrate their skills.  Sometimes they tell stories about the Dominican Republic.  Every day is like a holiday. </p><h2>  Travel Tips </h2><p>  Bicycle rental is available at the tennis court.  An hour of driving costs nothing, but you can‚Äôt ride around the perimeter of the complex.  But you can safely go towards the local city.  You can catch surprised looks on yourself, but as soon as you say hello in the local language, everyone immediately begins to smile and greet you.  Having made a circle on the highway, you can return back to the hotel.  Be sure to call in a nearby complex where mangroves grow.  Many birds live here. </p><p>  You should also visit the wild forest, which is located on the way to the Rio Hotel.  In these places very beautiful photos are obtained. </p><h2>  Minuses </h2><p>  Minor flaws will not spoil the rest, but they are still worth mentioning.  Some rooms have an unpleasant smell of damp, old furniture and not very fresh bedding.  But, as a rule, tourists spend little time in rooms, when there are so many interesting things around. </p><p>  The food is tasty, but too bad.  The food is designed for American customers who are accustomed to greasy fast food, but they cook it here excellently.  There are practically no Russian speakers among the staff; for many issues you have to turn to the guides.  But the main drawback is the space prices for excursions.  It‚Äôs better to take a taxi yourself and go where you need to.  Although the hotel has everything you need.  Many in pursuit of beautiful photos tend to get to the island of Samona, but this is not necessary.  The territory at the hotel is no less picturesque, and the pictures here are excellent. </p><p>  Do not bother too much with guests at a meeting.  Tired after the flight, tourists have to listen to incomprehensible Spanish speeches and independently look for their number, which is not very convenient and pleasant. </p><p>  But overall, the hotel deserves its status and stardom. </p>
