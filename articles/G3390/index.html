  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Free electricity: myth or reality</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Each person thought about how to receive "free" electricity, whether it be the director of a plant or an ordinary citizen.  Based on the fact that in many countries of the former Union only 3-5 kW are provided for an apartment and a house (oblenergo employees install 16 A - 25 A opening circuit breakers), and the average consumer uses much less than this limit, then the monthly payment is quite "raised "Even for senior citizens.  However, electricity is constantly needed, so a tangible amount is obtained per year, and tariffs are gradually increasing.  Now, if there was free electricity ... </p><p>  If you ask yourself this question, you can be sure that you are not the first.  Even old women at the porches are talking about how to get free electricity, and there‚Äôs nothing to say about the global Internet.  Sites simply burst with descriptions of ‚Äúdiscoveries‚Äù and ‚Äúrevolutionary‚Äù developments, and there are so many videos on the well-known video resource that it takes a lot of time and patience to review them.  The main thing is to correctly formulate the request: "free electricity." </p><p>  Perhaps, among all that information one comes across really worthwhile, but there is so little of it and it is simply drowning in pseudoscientific sensations.  Talking about this is an ungrateful task, so let‚Äôs leave the subtle matter to scientists, and we‚Äôll consider the very real ways to get free electricity. </p><p>  The most effective way (it is also the most famous) is a banal deception of the power supply organization.  It consists in the implementation of external effects on the meter: directional magnetic field;  formation of a high-frequency component ignored by the counter;  counterflow creation.  For obvious reasons, we will not dwell on this in detail. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A fully functional method to reduce consumption is the use of reactive power compensators.  They have been used in industry for a long time, but household models have appeared relatively recently.  As you know, electricity does the job.  It is for her that we pay.  But only one part of the work is useful, and the other is undesirable.  For example, the rotation of the motor shaft is a pure benefit, but its heating is a side effect, although also committed by electricity, for which you have to pay.  A household compensator is plugged into a home outlet and reduces the <span>reactive power</span> spent by powerful appliances <span>.</span>  Please note: the more motors (coils, capacitors, transformers) are used, the higher the efficiency. </p><p>  More serious options are <span>solar panels</span> and <span>wind generators.</span>  By installing any of the solutions, you can think about refusing centralized energy supply.  The service life of polycrystalline solar cells in <span>solar panels</span> is at least 20 years.  Newer panels based on amorphous silicon serve less - up to 20 years, at best.  With a sufficient amount of funds, the elements are collected in batteries.  In a private house, you can make a roof of them.  This increases the power output.  A wind generator is an equally attractive alternative.  Modern models work without vibration, so they can be placed next to the house. </p><p>  Of course, free energy is a relative concept.  Tesla came close to her, but, alas, did not manage to spread his achievements.  Solar and wind installations have a number of features that need to be considered: </p><ul><li>  Now the cost of equipment is such that the amount spent does not pay off at the time the device is decommissioned (although the increase in tariffs for centralized networks is not taken into account); </li><li>  the need to use <span>rechargeable batteries</span> to accumulate charge reduces usability.  The lead battery lasts up to 5 years, then it needs to be replaced.  The inverter circuit also has a shorter service life than the windmill or panel itself. </li></ul><p>  Electricity surrounds us everywhere, we just need to take it.  Perhaps at that very moment, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa simple and affordable way to get free energy is born in the head of a genius. </p>
