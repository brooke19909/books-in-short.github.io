Taganrog traces its history precisely from the moment of construction of this fortification, which began in 1699 and lasted as long as ten years.  A great stronghold has seen a lot in its lifetime, but, unfortunately, only a small part of this ancient building has survived to this day. </p><h2>  Foundation History </h2><p>  In the summer of 1696, when Azov was taken by Tsar Peter I and his mighty army, the sovereign went to these places to pick up a suitable place where you can build a fortress and build a harbor to thoroughly gain a foothold in the newly conquered lands.  He liked the Taganiy cape.  In the same year, he decides that there should be a <span>fortification.</span> </p>

Thanks to this, the Pavlovsk fortress appeared.  The Trinity stronghold began to settle down only a year later, after de Leval was arrested and taken to Moscow for interrogation.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The new project was developed by a talented engineer and urban planner von Borgsdorf.  All construction work was completed in 1709.  The church located on the territory of this building was consecrated in the name of the Holy Life-Giving Trinity.  In honor of her, the fortress got its name.  Trinity - so they began to call her. </p><h2>  What kind of stronghold was it? </h2><p>  Thus, in just one decade, a real <span>stone city</span> was erected on the cape, blown from all sides by Taganyem winds <span>,</span> which was the first Russian naval base.  The Trinity Fortress (Taganrog) on ‚Äã‚Äãits territory housed about two hundred public buildings, as well as about 1,500 residential buildings, where more than ten thousand people lived.  Here was a whole garrison, which had more than 250 guns in its armament.  In addition, ten more ships with command personnel were located in the harbor. </p><p>  The construction itself had an interesting shape.  The diagram shows that the Trinity Fortress (Taganrog) was built in the form of a pentagon.  The photographs depicting the maps of the stronghold that have come down to us since then show that it was surrounded by a large earthen rampart, which had a length of more than three kilometers.  There was no special strengthening from the sea side, since the entire stake in the construction was made on the high and steep banks of the cape.  On the territory of the fortification there were also a bazaar, a sovereign's yard, a dwelling for ordinary people and a temple.  In the center of all buildings was a large area. </p>

    <h2>  The destruction and revival of the fortress </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the further history of this stronghold is as sad as that of many similar fortifications of that time.  Troitskaya fortress was demolished to the ground in accordance with the signed agreement between Peter I and the Ottoman Empire.  A year later, the last Russian guard left this building.  And the Turkish army completely occupied this territory, having plundered everything that remained here. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Then the next quarter century, the Azov lands were ruled by the Turks.  Only during the next hostilities in 1736, Azov and Taganrog were again returned to Russia.  But the revival of the stronghold became possible only in 1770 - in the era of Catherine the Great.  Troitskaya fortress was quickly restored on the remains of the old foundation, and the base of the Azov Flotilla settled in the harbor. </p>

    <h2>  Decline </h2><p>  But after the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula to the Russian Empire, this fortification lost its original purpose.  All ships from the port were transported to Sevastopol, and the stronghold was abolished by order of the Russian empress.  In 1803, a battalion from Rostov arrived <span>in Taganrog</span> .  Therefore, the construction of new buildings for the military began on the territory. </p><p>  Thus, in the place where the majestic fortress was once located, ‚Äúexemplary‚Äù cells of the barracks for soldiers in the amount of ten pieces appeared.  All of them were surrounded by a massive two-meter fence.  In the future, Taganrog no longer developed as a military port, since trade relations with other states were built in its water area.  Therefore, the buildings remaining from the fortification and soldiers' barracks were used for various purposes, and eventually were completely demolished. </p>

    <h2>  Modern look </h2><p>  One ‚Äúexemplary‚Äù soldier‚Äôs cell is the only reminder that the Trinity Fortress (Taganrog) left behind after the complete destruction.  Where is this authentic building, every local knows.  It is located at the address: first Fortress Lane, house 46. These remains are an object of cultural heritage of federal significance.  In this form, the Trinity Fortress (Taganrog) has survived to this day.  How to get there, also tells any city dweller.  This cell is located at the beginning of the city on the cape.  And shuttle buses No. 19 and No. 56 run there. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  In addition <span>, this</span> fortification was immortalized in the book ‚ÄúFortifications of Peter on the Miussky Peninsula‚Äù thanks to the efforts of the local historical foundation.  Also in 2015, at the place where the third bastion of the stronghold was once located, a monument was erected by the efforts of the same non-profit organization.  This memorial looks like a cannon, installed next to a fragment of a fortification, for the construction of which materials from the recent reconstruction of the city were used.  During the grand opening of the monument, a message was heard that in the near future thirteen more such memorials should appear in Taganrog. </p>

Therefore, for many decades, these structures delighted with their rationality of construction and the audacity of all foreign builders.
