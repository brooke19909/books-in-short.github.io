Moreover, constant work brings a lot of problems and trouble, leading to depression.  The world becomes filled with sadness and longing.  What to do in this case?  That's right, go on vacation, where there is a beautiful beach, sun and sea. </p><p>  A good vacation will help you relax, have fun and reboot, increasing productivity afterwards.  Where to fly if winter is outside?  The choice is small relative to the summer time.  However, great options are available.  For example, the countries of Asia.  Thailand is a state in Southeast Asia with a huge number of incredibly beautiful beaches, magnificent palaces and artfully decorated temples.  Here you can relax on the beach and enjoy a historic vacation. </p><p>  Today we‚Äôll talk about the Hyton Leelavadee Resort.  We need to get acquainted with the location, infrastructure and number of rooms.  So let's get started. </p><h2>  Hotel Location </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.amoma.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Location" class="if uuid-3138916" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85188/3138916.jpg"></div><p>  So, let's find out where the Hyton Leelavadee Resort is located.  As we said, it is located in Thailand.  This country has long been developing in the tourism sector, so it can offer a huge selection of hotels for every taste and budget.  It is worth noting that this is due to access to the sea and a favorable climate.  Our hotel is located in Phuket. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.phsproperty.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phuket Island" class="if uuid-3138902" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85188/3138902.jpg"></div><p>  This is one of the southernmost provinces of the state.  It is located off the west coast of Thailand in the Andaman Sea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Indian Ocean.  Phuket is one of the first places in the country by territory.  It is connected to the mainland by three bridges.  It is worth noting that the island has always been quite developed and famous, before it specialized in the extraction of tin and rubber.  In addition, he was often mentioned by French, Dutch and English sailors, as it is located on the main trade route between China and India.  There are several more provinces near Phuket, for example, Phang Nga and Krabi. </p><p>  The climate in Phuket, despite its location in equatorial latitudes, is subequatorial in nature, which requires a clear division into two seasons: dry and wet.  The first lasts from November to April.  The second is from May to October.  The temperature is almost always the same - it ranges from 28 to 37 degrees.  It is worth remembering that during the summer months there are strong undercurrents, so it is often forbidden to swim on the beaches.  After all, the risk of death is great.  At this time, red flags are hung everywhere. </p><h2>  What rooms are available in the hotel? </h2><p>  So let's talk about the rooms at the Hyton Leelavadee Resort.
