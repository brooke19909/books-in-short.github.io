In this region, winters are moderately frosty and summers are warm.  On average, the annual air temperature does not rise above - 3.9 ¬∞ C.  The hottest month is July (+17.7 ¬∞ C), the coldest January (10.5 ¬∞ C).  The maximum temperature is +38 ¬∞ C, the minimum is -43 ¬∞ C.  No more than 500 mm of precipitation falls annually.  The thickness of the snow cover, which appears at the end of November and disappears in April, is 55 cm. </p><h2>  Relief </h2><p>  Terraced plain, gently sloping from north to south.  The terraces have been laid out.  A characteristic element of this relief of the central and northern parts of the reserve are karst funnels, which occur in places where coal limestones lie closely. </p><p>  The relief of the southern terraces is characterized by hills and sandy shafts that rise 10-15 meters above the lower, neighboring areas. </p><h2>  Hydrology </h2><p>  The reserve territory does not differ in a large number of reservoirs.  Several small rivers flow here, there are shallow lakes and a few swamps.  The largest rivers are the Ponikovka and the Todenka River, which originates outside the reserve, its length is about 9 km, its width is about 4 m. </p><p>  Of the lakes, the largest are Sirnovskoe and Protovskoe.  In the summer heat, the lakes almost completely dry out.  Marshes occupy an insignificant part of the territory (not more than 1%). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Prioksko Terraced Biosphere Reserve" class="if" height="389" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/599341.jpg" width="600"></div>

To restore it, in the Prioksko-Terrasny Reserve 2 pairs of these animals were introduced in 1948.  They were released in 1950.  By the beginning of 1957, the number of these animals in the reserve reached a record figure of 63. From that moment, roe deer began to be settled on the territory of the Chekhov and Serpukhov districts. </p><p>  In 1967, the restored Moscow roe deer population numbered 157 individuals.  In February 2008, the livestock already numbered 170 individuals.  This species is quite successfully reintroduced and returned to the hunting fauna. </p><h2>  Moose </h2><p>  Answering the question: ‚ÄúWhat is the Prioksko-Terrasny Nature Reserve famous for?‚Äù, We can safely say: ‚ÄúAn increase in the moose population‚Äù.  Before <span>WWII, animals of</span> this species were very few in these places.  After the war, there was a rapid increase in numbers.  Its peak occurred in mid-1961 - 1300 animals in the Serpukhov district, including 300 inhabiting the Prioksko-Terrasny Reserve. </p><p>  Due to the high population density of animals, problems appeared with the state of the forest, as well as with the condition of moose in the southern suburbs.  Mass death and the appearance of epizootics began.  After a detailed study of the situation, the zoologist of the reserve L.V. Zablotskaya insisted on regulating the number of moose with the help of shooting.  In the winter time of 1961, 101 animals were shot in the reserve and 128 in the Serpukhov district.  As a result, for several years the population remained at the acceptable level. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Prioksko Terraced Biosphere Reserve photo" class="if" height="395" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/599342.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The most common of the predatory inhabitants of the reserve is the fox.  In addition, 11 different species of predatory mammals live on its territory, 7 of which are constantly living on this earth. </p><p>  Bats (bats) are represented by 11 species.  Among them are Natterera's nightshades, ushany, water, pond, red, small and <span>red evening</span> and others. </p><p>  The population of the hare is quite numerous, less often you can meet the hare.  After a long absence, the beaver was returned, and he gladly settled on reserved rivers. </p><h2>  Bison </h2><p>  Among the mammals that inhabit the Prioksko-Terrasny Zapovednik, bison, or rather, one of their species - Bison bonasus L. - is listed in the International Red Book, as well as in the Red Book of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  In 1948, M.A. Zablotsky created a bison nursery.  Its purpose is to breed bison to restore a rare species.  The tasks were set for the nursery: </p><ul><li>  rearing young animals and releasing them in places of the former habitat of the species, transferring strong and healthy individuals to other zoos and nurseries; </li><li>  expansion and preservation of the bison gene pool. </li><li>  scientific research in ecology, biology, bison ethology; </li><li>  improvement and development of new methods of keeping and breeding bison in captivity, as well as in natural conditions. </li></ul><p>  The nursery is spread over an area of ‚Äã‚Äã200 hectares.  For bison, conditions here are as close to natural as possible.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe nursery is divided into equal pens.  They are surrounded by wire mesh and connected by long corridors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="animals of the Prioksko Terraced Reserve" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/599343.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Each pen contains a bison family.  It consists of a male, 5 (less often 4) females and young animals under the age of 10 months.  Then the bison are separated from their mothers and create a "youth" herd. </p><p>  At the end of 2009, 328 excellent purebred bison were raised and sent to different regions of Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and other countries in the nursery. </p><p>  The nursery conducts serious research on biology, ethology of the bison.  In addition, in the Central Bison Nursery, training and internship are conducted by highly qualified specialists, who then successfully work in other locations. </p><p>  For comparative studies, the nursery contains a group of American bison. </p><h2>  Flora </h2><p>  If you still do not understand what the Prioksko-Terrasny Nature Reserve is famous for, the photos posted in special publications will help you consider the luxurious nature of these places.  The reserve has more than 950 different plant species. </p><p>  Of the trees, pine, oak, linden, aspen, spruce, and birch are especially common.  Such mixed forests occupy about 93% of the entire reserve. </p><p>  In more ancient, steppe burs, dye gorse, gray-haired Veronica, broom, sedge, etc. grow. </p><p>  Lime-pine-oak forests have an admixture of maple, as well as undergrowth from birskeleton, hazel, honeysuckle, viburnum, etc. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is famous for the Prioksko Terraced Reserve photo" class="if" height="362" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/599344.jpg" width="528"></div>

    <p>  There are many berry crops that inhabit the Prioksko-Terrasny Nature Reserve.  Plants of this group - blueberry, lingonberry, acidic, as well as cranberries and blueberries are most often found in the northern pine forests of the reserve. </p><h2>  Birds </h2><p>  There are a lot of birds in the reserve.  In mixed forests, they choose the most suitable tiers for themselves, where their chicks are safe, they are protected from enemies and where it is easier to get food.  For example, the nests of large predators are located on the crowns of large trees located in the first tier. </p><p>  Smaller birds that feed on insects settle on the second tier or undergrowth, and the eagle owl arranges nests on the ground.  Here you can find great tits and finches, redstart and forest horse, nuthatch and scallop-rattle, thrush and zoryanka and many others. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="prioksko terraced reserve reviews" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/599345.jpg" width="474"></div>

    <h2>  Secured territory </h2><p>  In order to reduce the impact of active <span>human activity</span> on the natural complex of the reserve, a protected zone was created.  Its territory is quite vast - an area of ‚Äã‚Äã4710 hectares with a width of 2 km.  It includes the Oka floodplain, forest neighborhoods surrounding the territory. </p><p>  In this zone, unlike the reserve, limited economic activity is allowed.  Forestry is permitted, with clear cuts prohibited.  Agricultural work is allowed in the Oka floodplain (plowing new lands is prohibited).  In addition, excavation, mining and development of mineral deposits, the construction of any kind of roads and premises for any purpose are prohibited.  The conditions for fishing and hunting should be additionally agreed with the administration. </p><h2>  Educational activities </h2><p>  The reserve is an excellent scientific base for many universities of the capital, as well as educational institutions of Russia.  Students from various faculties and branches of Moscow State University, Moscow Agricultural Academy named after Timiryazev are trained here.  Here, students of the Faculty of Biology of Moscow State University gain experience.  In addition, specialists from various research institutes work here.  In the reserve there is a lesson for young naturalists - students of lyceums and schools. </p><h2>  Prioksko-Terrasny Reserve: visitor reviews </h2><p>  According to those who have visited this wonderful place, it was created for lovers and connoisseurs of nature.  Everyone admires the amazing and rare opportunity these days to see the pristine beauty of the Moscow region and the unique, sometimes endangered, species of plants and animals. </p><p>  Visitors are pleased that experienced guides accompany them in their walks around the reserve, who, with interest, knowingly talk about animals and plants. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Prioksko Terraced Plant Reserve" class="if" height="260" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/599347.jpg" width="540"></div>
