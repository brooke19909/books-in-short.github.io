In the 3-2 millennium BC, there was a fortified settlement on this territory.  It belonged to the "Land of Cities."  Arkaim on the map of Russia is located eight kilometers north of the village of Amursky (Bredinsky district of the Chelyabinsk region).  It is located on a high cape, which was formed as a result of the confluence of the rivers Utyaganka and Big Karakaganki.  This settlement is a famous historical, archaeological and natural landscape reserve.  Ancient defensive structures and synchronous burial grounds are very well preserved on the territory of the considered monument.  The historical landscape is characterized by maximum integrity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="arch place of power" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/527358.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  How did the discovery of the amazing monument </h2><p>  Ancient Arkaim was randomly discovered in the summer of 1987 by members of the Ural-Kazakhstan archaeological expedition.  The survey of the area began because of the need to build the Bolshe-Karagan reservoir, which would provide for the needs of the region's agricultural enterprises.  At that time, they already adhered to the rules on compulsory archaeological exploration of the territories on which it was supposed to deploy large-scale construction.  At first, experts did not regard the study of this area as promising.  It was believed that it would be necessary to examine the steppe zone, which was not very interesting from the point of view of archaeological discoveries.  However, later findings have amazed many. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Ongoing research </h2><p>  Large-scale excavations have been ongoing since 1991.  They are led by G. B. Zdanovich.  At the same time, natural science methods are actively used, including radiocarbon dating, geological and mineralogical, paleo-soil and geological-morphological studies.  During the excavations, approximately half of the settlement (eight thousand square meters of territory) was discovered.  Thus, it was possible to completely restore the original layout of the monument.  A method of reconstruction, new to Trans-Urals, was also applied here.  L. L. Gurevich painted how the settlement might have looked in ancient times. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="archime coordinates" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/527360.jpg" width="313"></div>

    <p>  What did you manage to find on the territory of an ancient monument called Arkaim?  The place of power revealed some secrets.  The remains of chariots, tools of saddlers and potters, harnesses, arrowheads, and also forms in which metal products were cast were found.  Of particular interest are water supply and sewage systems.  One of the most important finds is the remains of people and animals. </p><h2>  Detailed description of the complex </h2><p>  Arkaim - a place of power, including a fortified city, two necropolises, the remains of pastures and corrals.  The village was built according to the radial scheme.  Its diameter is about one hundred and seventy meters.  There are two walls to which the rooms are attached in the form of a circular sector.  In fact, the city of Arkaim was a fortress, on the territory of which there were two "apartment buildings".  People lived and worked there.  Cattle grazed outside the settlement, including in specially organized pens. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The walls of the dwellings and fortresses were erected from clay-clogged logs and unbaked bricks.  There were premises for both personal and public use, as well as workshops.  Judging by the found artifacts, metallurgical production was organized in some buildings. </p><p>  In the center of Arkaim was a square.  The city had a storm sewage system.  Water was diverted outside the settlement. </p><p>  Residents of the village were representatives of the <span>Caucasian race.</span>  This was established thanks to the skulls found in the burial grounds.  Arkaim (on the map of Russia it can be seen on the territory of Bashkiria) was destroyed by fire.  The cause of the spread of fire was never determined.  There are three versions: the city was set on fire either by enemies, or by local residents themselves, or a fire started by accident. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Arkaim on the map of Russia" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/527362.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The opinion of the mystics </h2><p>  According to the esotericists, Arkaim is a place of power, the cradle of human civilization, the <span>ancestral home of the Slavs</span> and Aryans.  The name of this city is usually associated with the name of Yima.  As a result, the complex under consideration is known as the birthplace of Zarathustra. </p><p>  Arkaim (on the map it can be seen on the territory of the South Ural steppe), as expected, is older than the Egyptian pyramids.  The spiritual power of this place has not completely disappeared.  That is why the ancient settlement attracts many tourists as if with a magnet.  People intuitively strive to touch a special form of subtle energy in order to feel the power of ancient knowledge and the capabilities of our distant ancestors.  If you constantly contact this system, you can learn to attract positive events, change your fate for the better, achieve spiritual balance and improve your health. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The mountains </h2><p>  It is important to note that Arkaim (coordinates - 52Àö38'57 "N, 59Àö34'17" E) includes not only the hillfort itself, but also the low mountains bordering it.  Each of them has a certain meaning.  Based on geological studies, it can be argued that three hundred million years ago the territory of the Southern Urals was a volcanic chain.  The height of the mountains in that period reached one kilometer.  Currently, only one name is left of them. </p><h2>  Shaman (Shaman) </h2><p>  We continue to describe Arkaim.  Mount Shamanka takes the first place.  It has three ledges, pierced by various energy flows.  The ledge of Penance is the largest in area.  This is the initial stage, the starting point for the passage of all the <span>sacred mountains of the</span> complex.  The prevailing streams here are purification.  It is in this place that pilgrims conduct special rites. </p><p>  The second is the ledge of the priestesses.  Its location is the southeast of the central peak of the city of Shamanka.  The energy reigning here allows a person to recall his past incarnations and comprehend the meaning of existence in true reincarnation. </p><p>  Pegasus is the third ledge.  It is located in the southwest of the central peak of the mountain.  Being in this place, pilgrims have the opportunity to restore their own energy structure, to establish a connection between micro- and macrocosmos, as well as get rid of various ailments of the physical body. </p><p>  Many centuries ago, the mountain Shamanka itself played the role of a place where representatives of the ancient Aryans turned to the deity of righteousness.  At its peak is the Spiral of Life.  Travelers visiting Arkaim traditionally undergo a ceremony of repentance in this place. </p><h2>  Anael </h2><p>  Other names for this mountain are Crow, Grachina, Grace.  Our ancestors knew that the very first rays of the sun are filled with pure energy that carries love and joy.  That is why people who in ancient times inhabited Arkaim met dawn in this place.  Mount Anael is located to the left of the upper camp and above the lower.  It is over it that annually on June 21, simultaneously with the rising of the Sun, the <span>star Sirius</span> becomes visible <span>.</span> </p><h2>  Cherkasy hill </h2><p>  Many energetically powerful places are famous for Arkaim.  Mount Reason (another name for the Cherkasy hill) is a unique formation.  On its slopes you can still see images of swastikas laid out by the Arians in ancient times.  In order to get to this mountain, it is required to overcome a sixteen-kilometer path (passes around the border of the conservation zone).  It is noted that it is a source of radiation of powerful energy flows.  Often, tourists in this area feel worse, headaches begin. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="arkaim mountain" class="if" height="364" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/527364.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Scientific direction </h2><p>  Currently, Arkaim is the largest scientific center in the country.  Existing employees and invited experts constantly conduct comprehensive research in the humanitarian and natural sciences.  In the center of the study, of course, are the monuments of Sintashta culture - ‚ÄúCountry of Cities‚Äù.  This is the main secret of Arkaim.  The process is carried out with the involvement of a wide range of different techniques - natural science and archaeological, as well as remote (including decryption of images, geophysics). </p><p>  In 1992, a year after the creation of the reserve, a team of natural scientists and archaeologists developed a program according to which the territory of Arkaim is considered as a testing ground for studying the processes of interaction between nature and man in perspective, retrospective, and also at the present stage.  As part of this program, <span>archaeological monuments</span> were studied not only in the Arkaim valley, but also in its environs, as well as local biological diversity and soil composition.  Of particular interest is information on the geological structure of the underlying rocks and their influence on the nature of farming and the choice of housing for the ancient inhabitants of the settlement in question. </p><p>  Thanks to active museum activities, Arkaim became a platform for organizing a variety of experiments and reconstructions.  Among them are areas such as ancient pottery, weaving and metallurgy, as well as fortification and construction of structures of various kinds. </p><p>  The aim of scientific research conducted in Arkaim is to establish a dialogue of cultures, actualization of antiquity for the present, the formation of an ecological worldview of a new type through studies of cultural and natural spheres in their historical relationship. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="arkaim photo" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/527365.jpg" width="500"></div>

So, it is proposed to visit the rock of Penance, in place of the power of shamans, to touch the stone of Health.

It will cost five hundred rubles per hour. </p><h2>  The healing sounds of Arkaim </h2><p>  As music therapists note, each person is helped by tunes individually selected.  Nevertheless, there are universal sounds that help to cope with negative psychological states.  The most powerful technique gives impressive results.  We list the miraculous sounds of Arkaim that will help get rid of many problems: </p><p>  ‚ÄúThe Ocean of Nothingness‚Äù corrects energy centers. </p><p>  - ‚ÄúThe element of energy‚Äù ‚Äúpatches‚Äù field structures. </p><p>  - ‚ÄúSecrets of the subconscious‚Äù contribute to spiritual enlightenment. </p><p>  - ‚ÄúThoughts of good‚Äù remove negative energy. </p><p>  ‚ÄúThe healing sound‚Äù helps to unleash superpowers. </p><p>  ‚ÄúThe New World can lift the energy blockade of all channels. </p><h2>  Tourists note </h2><p>  Would you like to visit Arkaim?

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p> Arkaim (photos of a unique place presented in the article) became a world-wide sensation of the penultimate decade of the twentieth century.  From the first day of its discovery, it has been the subject of much debate.  Some call it the usual archaeological site of the Indo-European type, others call it the receptacle of the gods, still others call it the outpost of alien creatures on Earth, and others call it the station for receiving Cosmic energy.  In any case, no one denies the fact that Arkaim is a territory that is the ancestral home of peoples who subsequently settled throughout the Eurasian continent. </p>
