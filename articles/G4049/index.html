Preschoolers learn not only to fantasize, but also to work with different materials, use glue, and be able to work with scissors.  Training is carried out on an increasing basis, from mastering easy tasks to the ability to perform complex story applications. </p><p>  The teacher always starts the lesson by explaining the stages of the work and demonstrating the sample made by the teacher.  In addition, the kids are also shown a completely step-by-step instruction.  Children of older preschool age can only be presented with a finished picture and verbally explain the procedure for performing actions. </p><p>  Let us consider how the complication of tasks occurs, by the example of creating the application "Sunflower" in all age groups of the kindergarten, starting from the youngest and ending with the preparatory one. </p><h2>  Kids work </h2><p>  In the younger group, details for the application "Sunflower" are cut by the teacher for each child.  The task of the baby is the correct unfolding of parts and their accurate gluing.  Children first stick the stem and leaves on the same level left and right.  Then the flower itself is pasted over the stalk.  He is big and whole. </p>

    <p>  In the youngest group, it will still be difficult for the child to glue each petal separately for a long time, so the teacher gives a finished gear element that resembles the petals of a sunflower.  It remains only to glue the middle, you can fill it with a black circle, or you can stick the seeds of the plant itself.  Children of the younger group will be able to perform such work only at the end of the year.  You can organize a collective application "Sunflower".  Then the task of each child will be the implementation of some part of the work.  New children can be entrusted with a stalk and leaves, and "experienced" - the flower itself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Application "Sunflower" in the middle group </h2><p>  Children of four years old can already understand the sequence of work from several parts that need to be decomposed correctly.  The teacher prepares the details and puts them on the table in front of each child.  In order for the work to be voluminous, finished parts need to be smeared with glue only in the middle. </p>

    <p>  The only thing that children must strictly observe is that each layer needs to be slightly rotated relative to the center so that the leaves are not located one above the other.  Then the application of the sunflower will be magnificent and voluminous.  Then the middle of the inflorescence is pasted, also in decreasing order of size.  Children take ready-made circles and first choose the largest, then medium-sized ones.  The smallest circle is pasted last.  The work is big and bright.  You can make such flowers as a gift to your mother on March 8. </p><h2>  Complication for older children </h2><p>  Such a bouquet of sunflowers (pictured below) is made from separately prepared strips of paper.  Older children already know how to use scissors, but so far only simple details have been cut out of finished forms.  For example, yellow strips for applying a sunflower from colored paper are cut along the lines drawn by the tutor.  And the black centers are from the squares in which you need to trim only the corners. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  First, blanks for petals are cut.  They are made from strips of paper by gluing them over the edges.  It turns out like a link in the chain.  When there are already many such rings, you can start gluing the parts to get a complete composition.  First, black centers are glued, placing them so that there is sufficient distance for the petals.  Then in turn glued round petals.  When the flowers are ready, glue the stems and leaves.  They are also attached to the base so that they look voluminous. </p><h2>  More complex picture </h2><p>  To do this, you need to prepare many individual elements of a sunflower.  Paper application teaches children not only to place parts and stick, but also to fold paper in different ways. </p><p>  First attach the center and stem.  Then they begin to prepare the petals by folding.  In order for the petals of such a sunflower to look voluminous, the prepared circles must be folded, bending their edges in the middle.  It turns out a cone, which is glued to the central element of the application with the sharp part.  When all the petals and leaf on the stem are glued, proceed to the design of the middle. </p>

    <p>  Sunflower seeds are made from pieces of napkin twisted into balls.  Then they are placed in turn on PVA glue in the central circle.  The work is ready! </p><h2>  Quilling stripes applique </h2><p>  Now many needlewomen are fond of making crafts and applications from colorful quilling stripes.  In the preparatory group of the kindergarten, children already have enough paperwork skills so that you can try to perform application of a sunflower with them in such an interesting way. </p><p>  First, of course, you need to practice twisting simpler details: circles, leaves, squares, ovals.  Only then can you start making plot pictures.  A flower is, in principle, not difficult to do.  You need to have a thick PVA glue and strips of black, yellow and green. </p>

    <p>  Children are also given circle patterns that help them complete the same size parts.  First, the middle is done by simply twisting the black paper into a circle.  The edge of the strip is attached to the last turn with glue. </p><p>  Then you need to twist the same yellow circles according to the template and flatten them along the edges, fixing the end to the glue.  Then the ends of the elements are smeared with glue and glued to the base.  It is better if it is a thick cardboard.  By folding the strips in half to the desired length, the stem and twig of the leaf are made.  It remains to work on the leaf itself.  It can be made simpler, not as complicated as in the photo.  The picture is very effective and bright. </p><h2>  Application of sunflower seeds </h2><p>  Children of any age really like to make crafts from seeds, cereals and other natural material.  So, from sunflower seeds, kids can be invited to make such a hedgehog, as in the photo.  The blank is given by the teacher in the form of a drawn contour of a hedgehog.  Children glue seeds on the plane of the picture smeared with glue. </p>

    <p>  When all the necessary space is filled with seeds, you can plant any of its goodies molded from plasticine on the needles of a hedgehog: pears, apples and mushrooms. </p><p>  Parents, knowing the program requirements and age capabilities of their child, can do such crafts at home.  Develop children from early childhood, then it will be much easier and easier for children to study at school! </p>
