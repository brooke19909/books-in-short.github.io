Photos and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The length of the coastline of Crimea exceeds two and a half thousand kilometers.  On this coastal territory there is a huge number of the most diverse beaches: large and small, wild and well-equipped, pebble and sand, crowded and inaccessible.  This article provides a brief overview of one of the peninsula's most amazingly beautiful and clean beaches.  <span>This is</span> Vasili <span>beach</span> , which is located near Sevastopol in the fabulous Balaklava Bay. </p><h2>  Such a different Crimea </h2><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚ÄãCrimea is relatively small - about thirty thousand square kilometers.  But this small area fits so different in landscape, flora and fauna of the territory that, traveling through them, you can visit different worlds in a short time.  <span>Steppe Crimea is</span> very different from the mountainous regions of the peninsula.  And the southern coast is a separate distinctive and vibrant pearl of the Crimea.  On the peninsula there are a great many amazing corners that resemble fabulous scenery or magical lands.  Such is the small suburb of Sevastopol Balaklava, which has a long history. </p><h2>  The ancient city of Balaclava </h2><p>  The history of the town of Balaclava is rooted in such antiquity that it is hard to believe.  It is believed that precisely this place on the Black Sea coast is described by Homer in his poem Odyssey.  The ruins of the old fortresses are remembered by Tauris, Genoese, Romans, and all later conquerors of Crimea.  At all times, sea travelers hid here from storms and enemies. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In Soviet times, the city of Balaklava was absolutely inaccessible to visit, because there was a military base of submarines.  The town was not even marked on the map.  Currently, a museum has been opened on the site of the former military base inside the cliff. </p><p>  In small Balaklava there are many architectural monuments of antiquity, modern fashionable summer cottages and expensive yachts at the pier.  Here is a beautiful promenade, wonderful small restaurants and picturesque natural views.  In Balaklava, the Zolotaya Balka factory is located, which produces delicious champagne from grapes from the local slopes. </p><p>  The main feature of Balaclava is its location.  The town is located in a deep bay, the entrance to which from the sea is very difficult to find without a guide.  Surrounded by high cliffs, a special world has arisen, where there are no high waves and strong winds, where the sea is always affectionate and welcoming.  Balaclava today is especially popular with tourists, including because of the beaches.  There are several beaches in <span>Balaklava Bay</span> , one of the cleanest and most beautiful is located in Vasilieva Balk and bears the corresponding name - Vasili. </p><h2>  Beach in Vasilievoy beam </h2><p>  Vasili beach in Balaklava is located at some distance from the city (about one and a half kilometers), in a secluded place among high and inaccessible rocks.  The beach area is small: about three hundred meters long and forty meters wide.  The beach is pebble.  The entrance to the water is large-grained and gentle, which is convenient enough for swimming.  The coast is covered with medium and small stones. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  To comfortably lie on the Vasily beach, it is better to use sun loungers and sun loungers.  Vasili is still a sparsely populated beach due to its remoteness.  It takes effort to get here, but it's worth it.  Vasili is one of the cleanest beaches in the vicinity of Sevastopol, since the rocky surface of the coast does not hold up trash, and the wastewater of Balaklava does not fall into the coastal waters of Vasilieva Balka.  Swimming here is a special pleasure. </p><h2>  Pristine beauty </h2><p>  They say that before Vasili beach was surrounded by coniferous forest, but due to the turbulent activity of the Balaklava mine administration, the rocky coast collapsed, covering almost all the vegetation. </p>

    <p>  Today, the beach is surrounded by harsh cliffs.  By the way, local residents and experienced tourists do not recommend putting up tents and settling directly under the rocks, landslides happen quite often.  Several rock fragments are located in the water near the coast and act as natural towers for diving for local daredevils.  This part of the coast is generally very picturesque.  This is another reason for the popularity of the beach.  It offers breathtaking views of the sea and cliffs.  You can appreciate the beauty of Vasili beach in the photo. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  For a long time these places remained wild, underpopulated and untouched by modern service.  On the one hand, this allowed preserving the pristine beauty of the beach, on the other hand, it created problems for a comfortable stay. </p>

    <p>  How to get to Vasili beach in other ways?  You can go by car, use the minibus or take a walk.  It will take 20 minutes to get by transport, you will have to spend at least an hour on foot.  In any case, having reached <span>the recreation center of the</span> Balaklava Mining Administration, you will need to go further on foot.  Another small obstacle awaits the vacationer directly on the beach.  To get to the water, you must overcome a steep, long and seemingly not very reliable metal staircase.  There used to be stone steps, but they were destroyed by another rockfall.  But, having overcome all difficulties, a person finds himself in a charming corner of nature, which has a beneficial effect on both the body and soul.  Healing sea air, clean calm water, picturesque views will improve physical and mental health, and Vasili beach will remain in your memories for a long time. </p>
