From the point of view of palmistry, this is a curved line in the palm of a person.  In geography, the phrase has a different meaning related to the atmosphere.  This is what pink or orange lines are called, which are the transition from the dark sky below to pale blue above.  You can see the spectacle early in the morning or at sunset.  This is a very beautiful natural phenomenon - the belt of Venus. </p>

    <h2>  Ring on hand </h2><p>  Each person has on his palms this element of palmistry.  About him and will be discussed in this article.  The belt of Venus on the arm looks like an unfinished ring.  It starts between the index and middle fingers.  ends in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe little finger and the nameless.  The belt of Venus always runs from the hill of Jupiter to the tubercle of Mercury on their basis. </p><h2>  Venus "Label" </h2><p>  Not every individual has an uncomplicated pattern.  It is difficult to explain with science, but the belt of Venus is more common in people with long and thin arms.  Often the owners of such palms are sensitive and very vulnerable persons.  Their emotional state changes several times a day.  Rarely, but still there is such a line on the palms of full people.  She points to their sexual licentiousness and lust.  On the arm of a man of medium build, this line indicates possible deviations in development. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Belt of Venus: meaning, outline </h2><p>  On heavy and hard hands, a pattern with regular borders never cuts other lines.  Such people have a highly developed mind.  Together with him, they have an understanding of high feelings.  The owners of the above palms - natures are thin, sensitive, sober.  Often, the belt of Venus is found on graceful and small hands.  For girls, this is not a good sign.  Most likely, their feelings and emotions always prevail over the mind.  their character is usually malleable and soft.  Often indecision turns into tantrums. </p><p>  If a person does not see a clear line of the belt of Venus, he should not worry and think that troubles await him in life.  Rather, on the contrary, since the presence of such <span>lines on the hand</span> only indicates that you are too trusting in nature.  Such people are quickly disappointed with others. </p>

    <h2>  Relations </h2><p>  Often a belt can be seen next to <span>the marriage line.</span>  For people who believe in the power of lines in the palm of their hand, this is not a good sign.  First of all, the statement is connected with the fact that the belt of Venus in this case speaks of increased eroticism.  It may indicate the infidelity of one of the spouses.  The double borders of the belt of Venus often indicate a possible marriage breakdown with subsequent voluptuousness. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Palmistry: Belt of Venus </h2><p>  As meteorologists predict weather conditions for every day, so palmists predict the fate of a person.  Do not underestimate the power of palm line predictions.  A palmist always gazes intently at a drawing and compares it with well-known options described by specialists. </p><p>  The crown or ring of Venus is another name for the belt.  Many predictors of the future say that the sign is able to tell a lot about the identity of its owner.  for example, a pronounced line defines a <span>person‚Äôs capabilities.</span>  Such a person is able to realize all kinds of energy: sexuality, self-development, artistic abilities, philosophical perception.  These types of activity originate at a psychological level.  <span>The protective mechanisms of the</span> psyche are revealed precisely by the crown of Venus.  Palmists say that the belt of Venus is responsible for controlling human actions, the will and social expression of instincts. </p>

    <h2>  Owners </h2><p>  The ring of Venus is often marked by artists and musically talented people.  This is explained by the fact that when creating the next masterpiece, they are guided by a sense of love.  Inspiration helps them express an inner special vision.  Not the kind that all people are used to seeing.  The presence of the belt of Venus is able to endow a person with a life-giving way of thought, high sensuality, a desire to go beyond the real. </p><p>  The ring is also common among people who believe in mysticism.  Its harmonious combination with the <span>lines of life,</span> heart, marriage, mind allows a person to understand his spiritual abilities.  This means that a highly spiritual person can inspire others with his energy.  Such vital energy can be expressed with the help of poems, songs, music, paintings.  Palmists give a full interpretation of the Venus belt only after analyzing the combination of the ring with the rest of the lines on the palm. </p>

    <h2>  Heart line </h2><p>  If the heart line is less pronounced than the ring of Venus, then a person is closed in himself.  He lives in his own world of illusions.  Own fantasies and emotions haunt the soul.  It is often difficult for others to understand such an individual.  His strange behavior is not substantiated by anything.  The sharpness of mood swings blocks the ability to be open.  Often such people cannot appreciate all the greatness of feelings of love.  The inability to express tender emotions does not allow a normal existence in society. </p><p>  Widespread can be considered the intersection of the lines of the heart and Venus.  This includes the principle of operation of a nuclear bomb.  All the brightest and most sincere feelings merge together.  Faced with passionate love with inexplicable devotion.  The real perception of the world ends.  Immersion in dreams begins.  This combination of lines is bad in that it often leads to self-destruction.  This is expressed in the form of regret for the deed.  The sense of one's own uselessness corrodes a person.  He complains that he trusted the innermost secrets and dreams of others.  The ideality of the world can be broken about the harsh realities of the world.  This process is difficult to tolerate vulnerable natures. </p><p>  Rough by nature hands speak of impoliteness, uncouthness and cruelty of a person in life.  Such people are only interested in the instinct of procreation.  They can be gentle, but only to get the desired result.  Their main disadvantage is a feeling of gluttony.  The Venus-free, uninterrupted ring is extremely rare.  If it does exist, then such a sign indicates the inherent ability to realize the entire energy potential of one hundred percent.  Such people know how to control themselves and their emotions. </p>
