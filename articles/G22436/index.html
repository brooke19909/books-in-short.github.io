Making them really easy. </p><h2>  A few words about the materials </h2><p>  Before answering the question of how to make a brooch, necklace, bracelet, it is worth considering what they can be made from.  A lot of materials.  But the most popular among them are leather, fabric and beads.  They are the most plastic and give many options for shape and texture. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY jewelry" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/745377.jpg" width="320"></div>

    <p>  The skin is quite strong and at the same time plastic.  It is a lightweight material that holds its shape well.  Its disadvantage is that certain work skills are needed to get more refined forms. </p><p>  Fabric jewelry has become popular in the last few years.  They can be sewn from flaps or remake an old T-shirt, depending on the type of fabric, different techniques for working with it are used. </p><p>  Beads and beads are a classic.  The simplest necklace is low bright beads with a pendant.  But there are many more options that allow you to easily create jewelry with your own hands.  The jewelry is made step by step quite simply.  This process will be discussed a little lower.  We will consider the most interesting and simple workshops. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY jewelry jewelry step by step" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/745376.jpg" width="505"></div>

Making an accessory with your own hands is not difficult at all.  It‚Äôs enough just to show a little imagination, and you will have individual jewelry.  DIY jewelry made of leather or dense fabric is made elementary.  Cut a strip of the desired length and width.  We sew a fastener and several decorative elements to it.  It can be buttons, buttons, beads, sewn rhinestones.  It all depends on the availability of materials and imagination. </p><p>  You can also recall the lessons of labor at school, when the basic units of macram√© were taught.  A twisted double knot is an excellent <span>basis for a bracelet.</span>  It can be left as it is, or additionally beautified by embroidering with beads and colored threads. </p><h2>  Cute brooches </h2><p>  One scarf or blouse and 10 brooches in total give 10 different images.  Making such jewelry is not a problem at all.  Recently, small toy brooches have become fashionable.  They look naive and simple.  At the same time, they really add color to an ordinary look. </p><p>  We offer to make <span>brooches with your own hands.</span>  Let's start the workshop with the choice of fabric.  It should be tight.  <span>Sheet felt is</span> perfect <span>.</span>  We select the form.  For example, it will be a cloud.  Cut 2 identical parts.  On the front part we embroider the eyes and mouth.  Fold the parts and sew together.  Leaving a small hole, we turn out the toy and stuff it with cotton or sintepuh.  Sew. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself brooches" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/745372.jpg" width="525"></div>

    <h2>  Leather jewelry </h2><p>  It is more difficult to make neat leather brooches with your own hands.  A master class on their manufacture is as follows.  We take a piece of the right size and color and cut out the contour of the future decoration from it.  Using glue, we attach a pin, for which we will fasten it to clothes.  On the front side with paints or a wood burner we draw contours that complement the picture.  You can add a little chain or rivets. </p><p>  For an even more complex decoration, cut out several parts and glue them together into a flower.  We mask the places of joints of parts with a chain or metal button. </p><p>  So in a relatively short period of time, we will create jewelry with our own hands.  The jewelry is done step by step very simply, if you think over the necessary algorithm in advance.  Even small flaps of skin can become real masterpieces. </p><h2>  Simple bead necklace </h2><p>  A large number of bead techniques require an unprecedented level of skill.  But not everyone knows that this material can be very simple to use.  Any woman can cope with the production of an unusual bead necklace. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  We begin with a set on a string of all purchased beads.  Its amount should be large enough.  The more threads, the more magnificent beads.  Next, we determine with a minimum length.  The best option is 45 cm. It will be right up to the base of the clavicle.  We fold the bead string several times there and back, each time extending it by 1-1.5 cm. When the whole thread is laid out, we collect its ends and tightly bind the thread.  We put on a trailer-cone on them and attach a fastener.  The necklace can be worn just like that, or curled up with a cord.  The advantage of this method is that the decoration can be made so that it fits perfectly with the new outfit. </p><h2>  Pigtail Necklace </h2><p>  Here is another accessory option if you need truly original jewelry.  Do-it-yourself jewelry from beads follows the same principle as the previous version: we string all the beads onto one thread.  We divide it into 3 parts and begin to weave an ordinary pigtail of three strands.  We close the ends the same way.  At the beginning of weaving, it is worth considering the fact that weaving will steal part of the length.  Therefore, it must be taken with a margin.  This beaded necklace looks best if it is close to the base of the neck. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beads master class" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/745374.jpg" width="527"></div>

    <p>  If you know how to make braids of four or more strands, do not be afraid to experiment.  The more complicated the weaving, the more original the decoration.  You can also play with flowers.  They are either mixed or strands of different shades are made.  It depends on the personal preferences of the craftswoman. </p><h2>  Fabric necklaces </h2><p>  Fabric <span>jewelry</span> also looks beautiful <span>.</span>  Do-it-yourself <span>jewelry</span> from this material will be made by any woman.  Here is an option with minimal effort and tissue. </p><p>  We take any piece of thin knitwear.  An old T-shirt or tunic is well suited for these purposes.  Cut it into thin strips across the weave.  Determining the direction is not so difficult.  Knitwear by sight consists of horizontal wedges.  This is a number of weaving.  It is necessary to cut just parallel to these wedges, cutting off their top. </p><p>  After the strips are ready, take one of them by the ends and stretch.  She curls into a pretty tube.  It is from these tubes that we further form the ornament. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a brooch" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/745373.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Variants of the shape of such a mass.  You can close the ends and sew fasteners on them.  There is a way when such tubes are slightly connected to each other, and their ends are played out as a decorative element.  The tips downward look beautifully, which are caught at a certain height from the neck by a small clamp. </p><h2>  Sheathed beads </h2><p>  Looks interesting and a little different jewelry.  The master class of its creation is understandable to everyone who knows how to sew a little.  First of all, you need to take relatively large beads.  They will become the basis of the decoration.  By their diameter we sew a stocking of fabric of the desired color.  So that later it is easier to turn it on the front side, we sew in a cord of the same length as the future cover.  When it is ready, pull the cord and twist the decorative layer. </p><p>  Next, we insert beads into the resulting product.  And at this moment we begin to create.  The beads themselves can not be separated.  But this option is suitable if the cover sits tightly and clearly distinguishes the relief of each bead.  But it‚Äôs better to separate them.  The easiest option is to tie a knot after each.  You can do this by bandaging the fabric cover with threads a few turns.  Ultimately, the jewelry can be worn in one thread or in several.  A combination with knitted tubes is also possible.  The main thing is not to forget about the tier and contrast of textures and colors. </p><h2>  Leather neck jewelry </h2><p>  With your own hands you can make not only beads.  We will consider a master class on manufacturing leather jewelry below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beaded necklace" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/745375.jpg" width="225"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  We take a skin flap of the desired color and cut out flat geometric blanks from it.  It can be circles, ovals, triangles, squares.  In the upper ends of the product we puncture holes for fastening. </p><p>  We collect all this on a leather cord.  It can be cut from the same flap.  Sometimes it makes sense to dilute the product with <span>metal beads</span> or pendants.  Chains, especially artificially aged, will also look beautiful here. </p><p>  As you can see, making jewelry with your own hands is completely uncomplicated.  You just need to learn how to look in an original way at unnecessary trash and are not afraid to experiment.  So what if you ruin the flaps?  You still thought to throw them away. </p>
