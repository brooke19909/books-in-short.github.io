    <h2>  How to book an apartment </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the Warsaw Hotel is almost always crowded, and therefore the question often arises of how to book a room.  For this purpose, you can contact the special department that deals with the reservation of apartments for guests.  Phone number: 8 (499) 238-19-70.  In addition, the official website, as well as other specialized resources, has the option of ordering apartments online. </p><p>  It is worth noting that a prerequisite for booking is to make an advance payment by credit card or electronic payment system.  Otherwise, after a certain period of time, your reservation will be canceled. <br><br>  Each guest has the right to refuse the reservation with the return of pre-paid funds.  However, if you do this later than one day before your expected arrival, you will be charged a fine of the daily rate in the room. </p>

    <h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  An excellent accommodation option in the capital is the Warsaw Hotel.  Reviews about it are full of positive comments: </p><ul><li>  the hotel is quite well located - in the central part of the city, close to the main attractions; </li><li>  very spacious and bright rooms; </li><li>  incredibly beautiful views from the windows of the rooms; </li><li>  the elevator is very fast; </li><li>  fairly affordable rates for accommodation; </li><li>  good noise isolation between neighboring rooms; </li><li>  Inexpensive all-inclusive dinners  breakfast is included in the price; </li><li>  the bedding is new and smells very nice. </li></ul><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Not all guests are satisfied with the Warsaw Hotel.  This placement option is characterized by the following negative aspects: </p><ul><li>  the air conditioning system in the hotel is turned on only in the summer, and in the spring you have to sleep in stuffy rooms; </li><li>  for a long time there was no major or at least cosmetic repair (carpets and wallpaper are worn and stained); </li><li>  TV shows very poorly; </li><li>  tasteless and very poor breakfasts; </li><li>  the infrastructure around the hotel is rather poor: there are no cafes or grocery stores within walking distance; </li><li>  the room is not cleaned well enough; </li><li>  not enough microwave and electric kettle; </li><li>  since the windows of most rooms face the road, a lot of noise and dust enters the room. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  The general positive impression of the Warsaw Hotel is created due to its good location.  A little stroll will take you to Red Square.  And thanks to the proximity to the metro station, you can quickly get to any part of the city.  Nevertheless, in everything that concerns shops and cafes, you will be disappointed, because there are practically none nearby. </p><p>  As for the living conditions at the hotel, they are quite comfortable.  The rooms are fairly bright and feature a pleasantly bright decor.  Nevertheless, the decoration and equipment of the apartments are a bit outdated and require repair or a complete replacement.  This disadvantage is compensated by the low price of accommodation.  Despite the fact that breakfast is included in the price, you can hardly get enough of it, because the assortment and quality of dishes are not encouraging.  Nevertheless, the hotel is quite suitable for tourists who want to get to know Moscow as close as possible. </p>
