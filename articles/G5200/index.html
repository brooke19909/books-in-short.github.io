    <h2>  Historical essay </h2><p>  The city of Strezhevoy <span>(Tomsk region) was</span> built in the 30s of the last century.  At that time, it was a small village where special settlers settled.  At that time, repressed citizens, mainly the so-called fists, belonged to this category.  Later, in 1966, the village of Strezhevoy was founded near this village.  By 1967, he received the status <span>of an urban-type settlement,</span> and in 1978 - officially the status of a city.  The city of Strezhevoy, Tomsk Oblast, became a city of oil workers who came here on duty to service rigs located within a radius of 400 km. </p><p>  The name of the settlement comes from the Russian word “rod”, which means steep coast, rapid, channel, channel, rapids.  It is worth noting that during the construction of the city it was proposed to name it differently - Neftegrad.  However, the authorities decided that Strezhevoy sounds a lot more interesting, and there are already quite a lot of cities with the prefix "neft", so they settled on this more original and melodic name.  The inhabitants of the town also liked this idea more. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="g rifle attractions" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/524622.jpg" width="600"></div>

But in general, this town can be bypassed in less than one day. </p><h2>  Economic development </h2><p>  Strezhevoy (Tomsk Oblast) is a city where oil workers work for Tomskneft, which is owned on a parity basis by Gazprom Neft and Rosneft.

    <h2>  Education </h2><p>  Strezhevoy <span>(Tomsk Oblast) is</span> traditionally considered the city of oil industry workers, which is why a Training Center has been opened here, where training in oil specialties is conducted.  There are also several children's institutions here: a center for further education, an art school, a ballroom dance club, a folk dance ensemble, and the mystification ensemble.  Every year in March, the Sovremennik Palace hosts a concert entitled “On the Wave of the City”.

In total, there are currently 8 schools, one evening school and 11 kindergartens. </p><h2>  Development prospects </h2><p>  Strezhevoy belongs to single-industry towns, where the main industry is oil refining and oil production.  In the near future it is planned to build a bridge over the Wahu River, this will contribute to the development of this northern town, where there is a huge reserve of gas and oil fields.  The appearance of the bridge will also facilitate Strezhevoy's trade with other regions, and this will give a significant impetus to development.  Strezhevoy, Tomsk Region (photo can be viewed below) is not only a city of oil workers, but a city of great expectations of our huge country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Strezhevoy Tomsk Region photo" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/524633.jpg" width="600"></div>
