During the reign of the Shang Dynasty, the place where the city is today was the capital of the Ba kingdom.  During the Qin era (221 BC), Ba Prefecture was created.  Under the Tang and Sui dynasties (581‚Äì907), it was renamed Yu Province, and the city began to bear the same name. </p><p>  From 960 to 1127, the province was called Gong.  In the period from 1368 to 1911, under the Ming and Qing dynasties, the city became a major transportation hub. </p><h2>  XIX century </h2><p>  Chongqing became an important open port with customs in 1891.  At this time, there was a flourishing in trade, shipping, processing industry of the country.  Gradually, it turned into a nodal point that connected the south-west of the country with the upper Yangtze and neighboring countries. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="History of the city" class="if uuid-2568467" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2568467.jpg"></div><h2>  XX century </h2><p>  The official status of the city of Chongqing received in 1929.  Eight years later (1937), shortly before the Japanese troops occupied the city, Chinese government institutions moved here from Nanjing.  In 1939, Chongqing was directly subordinate to the government of the Republic of China. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  From 1940 to 1946, Chongqing was the "second capital" of the country, the center of its political, cultural, economic and foreign policy life.  After the proclamation of the PRC (1949), Chongqing remained for some time a city of central subordination.  In 1954, after the abolition of the administrative division of the country, Chongqing began to belong to the cities of provincial subordination. </p><h2>  Chongqing Attractions: Jiefangbei Pedestrian Street </h2><p>  As you can see, the city has an interesting and long history.
