  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sociology of Management as a Science</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sociology is a science that considers human society as a single social system.  Its separate branch is the sociology of management.  In general science, sociology studies the foundations of the functioning of society and the laws of its development, its structure, as well as the organization of people in society and their behavior in it.  All this science is based on theory and has its own research methods.  General sociology includes many different sciences, including one as rare as understanding sociology. </p><p>  <span>The object of sociology</span> is society, that is, the people united in it, as well as the diverse processes of interaction, cooperation and rivalry of people united in professional, family and other groups.  In a general sense, the object of study is the processes in society and nature that affect the studied groups of people.  These are the general problems of sociology considered. </p><p>  <span>The object-subject field of</span> any science exists as a unity of interaction between the <span>object of study and the subject,</span> which gives rise to one or another opposition.  And the subject of any science is such a part of the object of study that allows you to determine its features, principal properties, condition and functions.  The sociology of management is exactly the same science. </p><p>  The subject of management sociology is the isolation from various objects of public life of the necessary set of all interactions and social relations of a society (regarded as a polysyllabic and multi-level system) related to personality and management. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The management mechanism exists in all areas of human activity, without exception, it is kind of integrated into them, ensuring the emergence and application of methods, forms and methods to achieve the necessary goals of the society and human activities.  Sociology of management refers to the subject of management impact, which is based on the systematic interaction of two different entities.  <span>This is the subject of</span> management, which includes the management subsystems and the social object, which is a managed subsystem. </p><p>  In science itself, three main levels of government are considered: </p><p>  Level 1 - senior management, which is the institutional level.  Behind this level (director, president) is the task of making decisions; </p><p>  Level 2 - management level or mid-level management, which provides direct <span>management of people</span> ; </p><p>  Level 3 - these are subordinates, which are a technical level. </p><p>  Management tasks are considered by other sciences along with sociology: </p><p>  Economics - considers the implementation of the tasks and provisions of the management mechanism. </p><p>  Informatics - considers informational interactions. </p><p>  Cybernetics - in its sphere is the interaction of various elements of <span>cybernetic systems</span> and subsystems. </p><p>  Psychology - considers decision-making processes. </p><p>  Sociology of management in this series is a medium-level discipline.  It includes certain <span>research methods</span> and various theoretical problems.  It also includes training and various organizational games. </p><p>  The objectives of management sociology are: </p><p>  1. The study of the facts that make up the direct and constantly evolving process of managerial activity.  It is in this process that the interaction of people from various levels of the management pyramid is manifested. </p><p>  2. Identification of important and related facts, detection on this basis, depending on the changing conditions of development trends of management processes. </p><p>  3. The need to explain why various innovations arise in the management system, and what methods of their implementation are possible. </p>
