    <h2>  <span>JBL</span> Charge 2 <span>Wireless Speaker</span> Design </h2><p>  The appearance of Charge 2 is practically no different from the previous model and is focused only on mobile and ubiquitous use.  The original JBL Charge 2 looks like a cylinder, making it easy to attach, for example, to the bike frame using a standard holder. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A large battery negatively affected the mass of the column: it exceeded half a kilogram.  Perhaps this characteristic of JBL Charge 2 is the only one that can cause inconvenience to the user. </p><p>  The case is mostly made of rubberized plastic.  One of the distinguishing features of JBL Charge 2 is the well-thought-out form of the case, in which the speakers are covered with plastic grilles recessed into the main material.  Broadband speakers are located on the side of the manufacturer‚Äôs logo, while the second speaker is only for symmetry in the design. </p><p>  At the top, the grilles are separated by a control panel equipped with backlit keys.  The buttons are not touch-sensitive, as is customary on modern devices, but pushed.  Such a characteristic of JBL Cherge 2, as the absence of protruding parts, is a good advantage, especially if acoustics are used in extreme conditions.  The buttons can be distinguished tactilely, blindly, the volume swing is embossed.  Near the handset is a small hole - a microphone. </p><p>  Passive emitters are placed at the ends of the column.  They are not protected by anything, but at the same time they are deeply recessed into the case, due to which, as users especially note in their reviews of JBL Charge 2, they are not affected.  During operation, the emitters vibrate very noticeably. </p>

    <p>  On the right side of the case are small legs that allow you to set the column in a vertical position.  In acoustics JBL Charge 2, a characteristic that indicates <span>the battery level</span> is a special indicator located under the volume buttons. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Three connectors are hidden under the grill located on the back of the speaker: for charging third-party devices - a high-amp USB input, for connecting sound sources - TRS 3.5 mm and for charging the gadget - microUSB. </p><p>  Due to the elongated base, the column does not have sufficient stability, which is why it is easily tipped over.  Despite this, in the reviews, users note that this does not threaten the acoustics, since after several swings its speakers remain upward. </p><h2>  Column Measurements </h2><p>  Many users in their reviews conducted various tests of JBL Charge 2 characteristics. For this class of acoustics, the frequency response graph is acceptable between 75 Hz and 2 kHz and from 5 kHz to 12 kHz.  It should be noted separately that the schedule reaches an acceptable level quite early. </p><p>  The maximum sound pressure, which is often measured by specialists, is one of the important parameters of acoustic systems.  The check is carried out simply: the column is placed on a table made of chipboard so that the main speakers are directed towards the measuring microphone.  At a distance of a meter from the <span>speaker system, a</span> measuring microphone is mounted at the same height and connected to a spectrum analyzer. </p><p>  <span>The speaker system is</span> synchronized with the smartphone with the maximum volume level.  During the test, the average dBA readings for half a minute of sound are recorded in any player of the so-called pink noise. </p><p>  According to the results of tests, we can say that the portable speakers JBL Charge 2 is practically not inferior to its counterparts in quality and sound volume. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Sound </h2><p>  JBL speakers have excellent sound quality: even for fakes JBL Charge 2, the sound is more open and louder than their original competitors - for example, Sound Blaster Roar.  Lower and upper registers are more detailed, which allows you to convey the nuances of the sound of various musical instruments. </p><p>  The JBL Charge 2 manual notes a feature such as simultaneous synchronization of up to three third-party devices.  The gadget that was connected first remains the priority: the rest do not enter until playback on it is completed.  By pressing the corresponding key, priority is transferred to the device that is currently connected to the column. </p><p>  The disadvantage of the JBL speaker as a wireless headset is the reduced sensitivity of the microphone: in order for the interlocutor to hear at least something, you must move close to the speaker.  Despite the fact that the maximum volume is low, the timbre of the voice is broadcast without any distortion. </p><p>  The maximum volume level is enough to sound a room with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã20 square meters.  The JBL speaker at a volume of 50‚Äì70% copes with any genres and compositions perfectly, delighting the listeners with clear high notes, detailed bass and a good middle.  This gadget is ideal for both background sound and for creating a working atmosphere. </p>

    <p>  JBL Charge 2 is perhaps the first speaker in the acoustics market, capable of playing heavy songs at a fairly high volume level.  In detail and in the depth of low frequencies, losses occur only at maximum volume.  Despite its compact size, the speaker clearly and efficiently reproduces many genres of music.  Controversial compositions are best played out at an average volume level. </p><p>  We should also mention such a feature of Charge 2 as a quick connection via Bluetooth - a pair is created in almost a second, while analogs require five to seven seconds to connect.  The JBL Charge 2 instructions indicate the battery life - 12 hours, during which the music is played seamlessly.  The mentioned time can be reduced several times if portable acoustics will be used as a charger for a tablet or smartphone. </p><p>  Harman‚Äôs acoustics were not just improved by the manufacturer, but completely redone, which made it possible to create one of the best speakers in its class at this price for JBL Charge 2. The gadget has good bass, it plays music at its maximum volume level quite well and comes with capacious battery that allows you to charge third-party devices.  The average price of JBL Charge 2 is 7 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Autonomous work of a column </h2><p>  At an average volume level when connected to the tablet, the JBL speaker is able to work for 18 hours, after which the battery completely discharges.  A large high-power battery allows the JBL Charge 2 to show good battery life in comparison with similar devices of the same price category, slightly inferior in this indicator to some other portable speaker systems. </p>

    <h2>  Connection options </h2><p>  You can synchronize your JBL Charge 2 portable speaker with any device or gadget using a Bluetooth connection or using a 3.5 mm cable.  Unfortunately, this cable is not supplied in the kit - you have to purchase it separately.  A Bluetooth 3.0 profile is used for connection - a high-speed high-quality connection. </p><h2>  Distinctive features of acoustics </h2><p>  As mentioned above, the main feature of JBL Charge 2 is the mentioned Social Mode, that is, the ability to charge third-party gadgets.  Using a standard USB cable, you can connect any device ‚Äî a smartphone, tablet, player ‚Äî to a portable speaker and charge it while listening to music.  This feature is very profitable and useful and will play a good service in situations where it is difficult to access the network to fully charge the gadget. </p>

    <h2>  Review Summary </h2><p>  Portable speakers of the JBL brand throughout all the years of its existence make a good impression on users, striking with their quality and excellent sound.  Together with the original and unique design, the Charge 2 speaker significantly outperforms its main competitors in the same class and price category.  The ability to charge third-party devices can help the user out while traveling or taking long walks, which was repeatedly noted in numerous reviews on JBL Charge 2. The cost of Charge 2 with this set of functions and characteristics does not look so high: the speaker may well compete with expensive products of eminent brands, bypassing many of them. </p>
