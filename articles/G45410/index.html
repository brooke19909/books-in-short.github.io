Of course, it all depends on the needs and ... upbringing of a person: one may be content with a modest life, the other feels the desire to acquire more and more expensive things.  However, one salary is usually not enough.  We have to look for additional earnings.  Of course, the easiest option is to find a job with a higher pay.  But it is not so simple at all. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="additional earnings" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12066/236905.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  <span>Additional earnings</span> - this is income from core activities, and from other activities.  For example, doctors or teachers can provide paid services - private home visits, tutoring.  In addition, representatives of almost any profession can earn extra income by recommending or distributing products of certain manufacturers.  For example, designers, developing a project for changing the interior, can put specific paints, finishing materials, and decorative elements into this very project.  Accordingly, if the client agrees to the implementation, the contractor will receive payment from both him and the supplier. </p><p>  Nowadays, a huge selection of recommendations is worth a lot.  That is why manufacturers are interested in establishing a network of word of mouth or their trusted <span>distribution channels.</span>  Similarly, many doctors recommend certain supplements or "miracle drugs."  Indeed, for them, interest on sales is the same additional earnings ... We will not condemn those who want to improve their financial situation.  We‚Äôll better think about how to use our potential. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="additional earnings in Moscow" class="if" height="294" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12066/236906.jpg" width="584"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, as we have already said, additional income in free time can bring both the main activity and hobbies.  For example, knitting or sewing on order for many needlewomen has long ceased to be just a hobby.  Customers usually do not appear immediately.  First, they are relatives, relatives, friends.  But those customers who were satisfied with the product themselves and recommended the master to acquaintances are the most grateful customers.  Often, a hobby ceases to be just a hobby, and degenerates into its own business.  Today, there are many resources devoted to the "hand-made".  You can order anything your heart desires - from jewelry to furniture, from sweaters to exquisite hats, from soap to stained glass. </p><p>  For many masters, their hobby is the beginning of a serious business, and not just additional income.  In Moscow, there have long been more favorable conditions for improving the material situation.  It is no coincidence that the main money of Russian business is concentrated there.  The level of earnings in the capital is much higher, so residents of provinces and other republics flock to Moscow.  By the way, now you can work in the capital company remotely.  For example, programmers, copywriters, web designers should not live in Moscow at all.  Remote employment allows you to devote more time to the family, it also contributes to the fact that additional earnings appear. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="extra income in your free time" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12066/236907.jpg" width="400"></div>  And if not everyone has the strength and knowledge to open their own online store or real business (and money too), then many Russians are not used to combining several classes.  The psychological component is also very important here.  After all, if a person has, albeit small, but different <span>sources of income,</span> his confidence in the future is much higher than that of someone who hopes for only one salary.  The employing company can suspend its activities, close, go bankrupt, and simply management can change the employment policy.  And if there are several sources of income, you can always switch to another type of occupation.
