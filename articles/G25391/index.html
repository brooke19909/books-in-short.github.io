    <p>  Important!  The hotel does not have rooms, facilities and equipment for people with disabilities. </p><h2>  Reviews on room quality and service level </h2><p>  About accommodation in Central Hotel Prague 3 * reviews for the most part are quite positive.  Guests satisfied with their stay at the hotel are much more than those who left negative reviews.  What positive impressions do the hotel guests share? </p><ul><li>  The rooms are clean.  The rooms are very spacious and well lit. </li><li>  Room equipment corresponds to the three-star status of the hotel.  The rooms are quite decent furniture, although not the most fashionable interior. </li><li>  The bathroom is very large and spacious.  Although sometimes it is not complete without minor flaws.  For example, the absence of a waterproof curtain.  By the way, not a single complaint about the lack of water in the hotel, cold or hot, was found. </li><li>  The room is cleaned daily, hygiene items (gel, soap, toilet paper, etc.) are laid out, bedding is changed. </li><li>  From the windows and balconies of the hotel there is a very beautiful view of the Old Town.  If the windows overlook the Town Hall, a loud, melodic bell ringing of a tower clock is heard every hour. </li><li>  All equipment in the room (hairdryer, refrigerator, TV, kettle) is working properly.  On TV, if you have time to watch TV shows, you can find at least 6 channels in Russian. </li></ul>

    <p>  Tourists also have no problems organizing lunch or breakfast in the city.  Near the hotel, as in any other part of Prague, there are many small and large cafes, restaurants and famous Czech pubs with a good selection of snacks.  In addition, you can purchase food a few meters from the hotel, in the supermarket TC "Kotva". </p><h2>  Staff </h2><p>  A special mention, perhaps, deserves the work of employees of the Central Hotel Prague 3 * (Prague).  Reviews of Russians visiting this Czech hotel range from enthusiastic to sharply negative.  The tourist who left positive feedback about the work of the staff most often tells the following: </p><ul><li>  Many are happy with the lack of a language barrier.  While most of our compatriots in African or Asian hotels have to communicate their requests to staff through Russian-speaking guides and travel agents, then at Central Hotel Prague 3 * you can easily find an employee who speaks Russian - both at the reception and among the maids.  In addition, receptionists speak English. </li><li>  Hotel workers are often described as polite and welcoming people. </li><li>  The overwhelming majority of former guests were satisfied with the level of room service and the diligence of the staff. </li></ul><p>  Nevertheless, negative statements regarding the work of hotel employees are sometimes also found on tourist sites.  What claims are most often expressed by former hotel customers? </p><ul><li>  Most of the complaints relate to the work of the administrator at the reception.  This is primarily due to the daily change of the duty officer and misunderstandings arising from the fact that the employee who replaced the shift is often not sufficiently informed about the hotel‚Äôs work on the previous day.  There may be confusion during the check-in / check-out of guests, periodically the requests or claims voiced by the administrator the day before, and other annoying little things are ‚Äúforgotten‚Äù. </li><li>  Another, especially unpleasant feature that former hotel guests complain about is the outright rudeness that they had to face at the reception.  In fairness, it is worth noting that most of the duty administrators are adequate and polite employees.  But several separate cases have been described when a ‚Äúwoman at the reception‚Äù allows herself to speak sharply, shout and raise her voice at clients, toss a key card and other unacceptable things onto the counter. </li><li>  Claims for room service mainly relate to ‚Äúforgetful‚Äù maids who skip daily cleaning and linen changes.  It is worth emphasizing that such complaints are extremely rare. </li><li>  A remark that some may consider insignificant, but worth mentioning is that people who have not come to the hotel are not allowed to enter the hotel rooms.  Thus, meeting friends and acquaintances in Prague will have to be on neutral territory.  Although the absence of strangers in the hotel is an absolute plus to ensure the safety of guests. </li></ul><h2>  Entertainment and leisure </h2><p>  There are no special entertainments or events at the hotel.  But they are not particularly necessary.  As unanimously the reviews of former guests of Central Hotel Prague 3 * (Czech Republic, Prague), excursions to the famous Karlovy Vary or small nearby towns, day trips to Germany or Austria will completely fill the days of relaxation and make your vacation unforgettable. </p><p>  In addition, many attractions are located near the Central Hotel, right in the Old Town.  For this reason, most tourists prefer instead of organized paid excursions to buy a guide to the Czech capital and travel on their own, by public transport or on foot. </p>
