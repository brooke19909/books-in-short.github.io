In Russia, everyone has heard the Volga Riviera: <span>Saratov, Kazan,</span> Uglich, Astrakhan, etc. In short, this is the Volga region, surrounding one of the largest rivers in the world - the Volga.

    <p>  Another area in which the hotel operates is weddings.  The place is simply ideal for those who want to hold an important celebration away from the city, surrounded by nature, but at the same time with maximum comfort and high service.  The hotel has a unique promotion - ‚ÄúWedding Package‚Äù.  A favorable offer is relevant when ordering in the amount of 100 thousand rubles.  In this case, a superior or deluxe room is provided to the newlyweds free of charge.  The package price includes the rental of a banquet hall (for 50 guests), individual menu preparation, a 10% discount on a cake, a photo shoot in the hotel building and on its territory, accommodation for spouses and their late check-out, breakfast for two persons, a discount on subsequent orders , a compliment from the hotel administration - champagne and fruits. </p><h2>  Volga Riviera (Saratov): reviews </h2><p>  Saratov hotel has a good reputation.  Its rating, in comparison with other accommodation options in this region, is above average and corresponds to an assessment of four points out of five possible. </p><p>  The first thing that tourists who have visited it on vacation is noted is its excellent location.  The city of Saratov is far and at the same time close, 15 km is easily covered by public transport or private car, so after 15-20 minutes you are either in the regional center with attractions and entertainment, or in a secluded corner of nature near the Volga.  The river, according to travelers, is very close, you can walk to the beach in 10-15 minutes.  The shore is well maintained, clean, but the infrastructure is not well developed.  However, in this case, it is difficult to call it a minus, since people come here to rest in the traditional sense of the word. </p>

    <p>  On a solid four guests appreciate the level of service.  The staff is polite, sympathetic to requests and wishes.  Several travelers expressed the opinion that managers do not always have information about booking on third-party resources, and not on the official portal of the complex.  Housekeeping at a decent level, regular. </p><p>  All this allows us to conclude that the hotel is one of the best in its price segment, in it there is a harmonious ratio of cost and quality of service, level of comfort.  An additional bonus is the possibility of celebrations, corporate parties, friendly parties, the organization of trophy fishing and an amazing cedar Russian bath. </p>
