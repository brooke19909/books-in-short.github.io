    <h2></h2><h2>  Minimalism and functionality </h2><p>  The Redmond multicooker-pressure cooker not only amazes with its functionality, it is also unpretentious in operation.  It has very conveniently located control keys.  They are signed, therefore, do not have an ambiguous interpretation.  Another manufacturer has combined programs, such as Frying / Deep Frying, Soup / Cooking and so on.  A smaller number of buttons greatly facilitates the use of the device.  On the other hand, such a laconic control panel may not appeal to fans of clicking on various buttons, adjusting the multicooker control system for themselves.  But you really need a kitchen assistant, so that, without being distracted by the settings, save time as much as possible when cooking. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="slow cooker pressure cooker redmond 4506" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13127/338261.jpg?1392708385328" width="225"></div>

    <h2></h2><h2>  Its pros and cons </h2><p>  So, this super-cooker has only six automatic programs, however, it can really cook everything.  Modes such as Frying / Deep Frying and BAKING / BAKING operate at standard pressure and the remaining at high pressure, so housewives should keep in mind that the valve must be closed.  By the way, all programs, except the function Frying / FRYING, have an adjustment of the cooking speed in increments of one or five minutes.  However, it was this mode that the manufacturer limited to twenty minutes.  Why did this, we do not know.  Indeed, not every dish can be prepared during this time.  Or is it still possible? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  We do not know whether to attribute this to the pros or cons of this household appliance, but you cannot deal with the adjustment of the temperature of cooking products with this appliance.  "Multipovar" is also missing here, since the model belongs to the budget series.  Among other things, the Redmond multicooker-pressure cooker can be used to prepare baby food, and can also be used as a sterilizer for nipples and bottles.  For young mothers, such functions can be very helpful. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="slow cooker pressure cooker redmond" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13127/338262.jpg?1392708408179" width="600"></div>

    <h2></h2><h2>  Simplicity, and only <strong></strong></h2><p>  The most important thing is that you can understand this simple device almost at first glance.  If, to someone, management suddenly seems difficult and raises questions, it will be very, very strange.  Because the main hobby, which the Redmond multicooker-pressure cooker has always been famous for, is simplicity.  If there is a special need, you can activate the delayed start function, which is adjustable in a special range from 30 minutes to 24 hours and has a step of 30 minutes.  As for auto-heating, this mode only works for 8 hours, although maybe this is true - otherwise it will overdry your culinary masterpiece? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2></h2><h2>  What smells? </h2><p>  To say that this household appliance has some obvious flaws, the language does not turn.  However, it seems very strange that most users find it difficult to cook various dishes using the attached recipe book.  There are also complaints about the smell of plastic, which slightly gives the slow cooker.  However, it is not difficult to eliminate.  You just need to boil water with lemon juice.  The slight smell of plastic should not be considered a marriage or a sign of poor-quality equipment.  In fact, absolutely any technique can be affected.  At least remember what a microwave can smell like after you warmed up something fragrant in it? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pressure cooker crock-pot redmond 4504" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13127/338263.jpg?1392708443461" width="600"></div>

    <h2></h2><h2>  More about work </h2><p>  In the kitchen assistant there are six cooking modes that contain specially selected and verified settings for time and temperature for literally any product.  Let's look at them. </p><p>  ‚ÄúFrying / Deep-Frying‚Äù - the mode necessary for cooking meat, poultry, seafood, vegetables with minimal fat or deep-fried (it should be noted that it must be used by removing the lid from the appliance in advance). </p><p>  The ‚ÄúSTEAM / DESSERTS‚Äù function is important for those who are often involved in culinary experiments with steamed products, for example, for the diet and <span>vegetarian menu</span> (the mode should be used only with the steam release valve closed). </p><p>  The ‚ÄúSOUP / COOKING‚Äù mode is simply indispensable for preparing liquid dishes.  The slow cooker will provide you with various broths, soups, compotes, and it will also help to quickly cook sausages, dumplings and other semi-finished products (keep in mind that in this mode the steam valve should be closed). </p><p>  "DAIRY Porridge / Krupy."  As the name implies, the mode is designed specifically for these dishes.  It will significantly reduce your time and give a unique taste (the steam valve should be in the same position as in the previous mode). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="slow cooker pressure cooker redmond 4506" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13127/338258.jpg?1392708499011" width="451"></div>

    <p>  The BAKERY / BAKING program is a real find for sweets and gourmets.  Indeed, in this mode, you can bake muffins, biscuits, pies or cook various types of meat and fish in foil in a short time (it should be noted that the steam valve should be kept open). </p><p>  The ‚ÄúEXTINGUISHING / PILOT‚Äù function is designed to prepare dishes that require prolonged exposure to heat.  It is ideal for stewing fish, meat, fish and various vegetables.  Of course, eastern pilaf is especially amazing (the steam valve must be closed at the same time). </p><h2></h2><h2>  A little bit about protection </h2><p>  Naturally, like all other multicookers, Redmond is equipped with a four-level security system.  If the selected operating mode involves functioning under high pressure, the device will turn on only after the cover is closed.  And immediately after installation, your miracle processor will securely fix it.  The increased pressure that is created in the working chamber is necessarily relieved by an additional spring valve. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Safe and secure </h2><p>  Moreover, if the temperature exceeds the allowable value, the <span>heating element</span> will be stopped.  The device will wait until the pressure reaches the optimum level again.  Also, in the case of already critical situations, this household device activates special mechanisms for the release of excessive pressure in order to avoid overheating and breakdown.  It should be noted that complete with a multicooker there is a bowl with non-stick coating from a Japanese manufacturer.  In it you can cook dishes with a small amount of oil, and this, as you know, is very good for your health. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="slow cooker pressure cooker redmond" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13127/338257.jpg?1392708560658" width="480"></div>

    <h2></h2><h2>  Analogs </h2><p>  The food processor described by us also has its simpler counterparts.  They do not have the same functionality and practicality, but they are also ideal for preparing various dishes and belong to the budget series.  The Redmond 4504 pressure cooker-crock-pot is a wonderful device for your kitchen.  It was developed taking into account all modern technologies for preparing dishes of chicken, fish, meat and vegetables.  The crock-pot carries out its work using two modes.  It can act as a harvester, that is, without pressure, and can be used as a pressure cooker, where it is necessary to process products with high temperature.  The device is simply indispensable if you often cook, cook steamed dishes, stew and fry.  By the way, under high pressure, a special microclimate is created around the products.  Hot steam perfectly heats them, while maintaining the structure and all the beneficial properties.  And most importantly, dishes are cooked several times faster than, for example, with standard heat treatment. </p>
