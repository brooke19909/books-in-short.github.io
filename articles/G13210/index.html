It attracts them not only with the warm sea and clean beaches, but also with the variety of leisure options.  Here you can explore historical and religious sights, try original local dishes, or dance in nightclubs.  At the same time, the cost of rest is not too high.  For example, Patong Pearl Resortel 3 * hotel is suitable for budget accommodation, which we will consider in detail in our article. </p><h2>  Where is the hotel located? </h2><p>  Patong is the most populated resort of Phuket, which is very popular among tourists.  This stretch of coast is a rather noisy place, therefore it is not suitable for lovers of a calm and quiet holiday.  In Patong there are a lot of budget hotels, including Patong Pearl Resortel 3 *.  The resort is suitable for young people who come to the country in search of famous night clubs. </p><p>  The hotel itself has a good location, it is built in the center of the main tourist street.  The city beach is 500 meters from the complex, so you can get to it in five minutes.  There are many restaurants, shops and bars nearby.  The famous Bangla Road, where the biggest parties in Thailand are held, is located half a kilometer from here. </p><p>  The nearest airport is in Phuket, and the distance to it is about 40 km.  For a fee, the hotel can arrange a shuttle service for arrivals upon request.  But, as a rule, many tourists get to the hotel on their own.  The average travel time by car or bus will be a little over 1 hour. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Important Hotel Information </h2><p>  Hotel Patong Pearl Resortel 3 * in Phuket was built recently - in 2009.  It is a six-story building, decorated in a simple style and decorated with neon signs.

    <h2>  What kind of food is provided at the hotel? </h2><p>  Unlike Turkey or Egypt, in Thailand it is quite difficult to find a hotel that offers all-inclusive meals.  Most often, tourists who come here prefer to eat on their own, because local restaurants and cafes offer hearty and original dishes at low prices.  The complex described by us was no exception.  When buying a ticket, you can pay for breakfast or a full full board.  It includes not only a morning meal, but also dinner. </p>

    <h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Since people come to Thailand primarily for a beach holiday, Patong Pearl Resortel 3 * focuses on the category of tourists who prefer a quiet pastime in the complex.  For lovers of water activities, an outdoor pool is equipped here, and next to it is a spacious sun terrace, where there are numerous sun loungers and sun umbrellas.  The pool is open daily, however its schedule should be checked with the administrator. </p>

    <p>  However, the hotel has no private beach area.  The city beach is located half a kilometer from the complex, and tourists get to it, as a rule, on foot.  The road takes only 5-10 minutes, so a transfer to the coast is not provided.  On the beach, tourists can rent sun loungers and umbrellas, as well as buy a ride on a pleasure boat or visit the water entertainment center.  All services here are provided only for a fee. </p><h2>  What entertainment program does the hotel offer? </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews of the Patong Pearl Resortel 3 * hotel, there are not so many entertainment options here.  Coming here, it is worth knowing that there is no animation program here, so most of the tourists independently organize their vacation outside the complex.  However, traditionally, the hotel has a spa that offers a lot of wellness treatments, including the famous Thai massage. </p><h2>  Conditions for staying with small children </h2><p>  The Patong Pearl Resortel 3 * complex is suitable for unpretentious tourists with children, as there are quite few conditions for their relaxation.  All children under the age of 2 years stay free of charge.  Cots in the room can be obtained by leaving a preliminary request when booking a ticket.  At the same time, they may refuse you if they are not available. </p><h2>  Positive feedback about Patong Pearl Resortel 3 * hotel in Thailand </h2><p>  As a rule, tourists who are looking for a budget place to stay understand that for a small amount you can not demand much from the hotel.  Therefore, they remain satisfied with the hotel accommodation, despite the presence of significant shortcomings.  But first, we list the advantages that guests highlight in their reviews: </p><ul><li>  the restaurant serves excellent breakfasts, including desserts (for example, honey cake); </li><li>  Despite the category of the hotel, there is a special children's menu, including cereals, mashed potatoes and soups; </li><li>  the hotel is located in a quiet quarter, far from bars and clubs, but the beach and infrastructure facilities are within walking distance; </li><li>  spacious and deep pool with clean water; </li><li>  good condition of rooms with new furniture; </li><li>  there is a small but well-equipped gym; </li><li>  regular and quality room cleaning. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Negative reviews about Patong Pearl Resortel 3 * </h2><p>  As mentioned above, the hotel has many shortcomings, but all of them are almost completely offset by a favorable location and low cost of living.  Therefore, tourists recommend a hotel for travelers, and if possible they themselves come here again.  However, when buying a ticket should consider the following disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  the air conditioner cools the rooms too much, so tourists are forced to ask the administration for a second blanket; </li><li>  in the rooms on the ground floor, guests met cockroaches and even rats; </li><li>  a second building is under construction under the windows of the hotel, so sometimes it‚Äôs quite noisy here; </li><li>  there are complaints of irresponsible and unfriendly staff; </li><li>  long registration of guests, while tourists are not always lodged in the rooms they booked. </li></ul>
