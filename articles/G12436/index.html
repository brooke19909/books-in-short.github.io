  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Dubna: population, history, science</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The population of Dubna, a city located in the northernmost point of the Moscow Region, is not without reason proud of its unusualness.  Twice born, he has come a long historical way and is considered the oldest and, at the same time, the youngest city in the Moscow region. </p><h2>  The emergence of Dubna </h2><p>  In the place where the two <span>rivers</span> merge <span>, Dubna</span> and Volga, archaeologists launched their exploratory work.  And, based on the results, they argue that it is from here that the history of the city begins. </p><p>  In the XII century in Russia there were fierce internecine wars.  Many specific principalities weakened the country, and Prince Yuri Dolgoruky advocated the unification of Russian lands.  Those who disagree with him began to threaten war.  As a result, Dolgoruky built six fortresses on the borders of his principality to protect the possessions.  One of them on the arrow of Dubna and Volga appeared in 1134. </p><p>  Numerous trade seals and seals with the image of the Rurikovich found during excavations show that there was also a large customs office collecting customs duties from merchant ships and caravans. </p><p>  For almost ninety years, the Principality of Suzdal, guarded by fortresses, existed in a relative world with neighbors.  But the grandchildren Dolgoruky again unleashed hostilities, seeking to increase their possessions.  In the spring of 1216, a fierce battle took place, as a result of which victory was won by the grandson Konstantin and the Prince of Novgorod, <span>Mstislav Udaloy,</span> who entered the union <span>.</span>  Many cities were destroyed and burned.  Dubna fortress ceased to exist. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="56.7320202" data-lng="37.16689740000004" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="11"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/0/6/8/9/10689.png"></div><h2>  Second birth </h2><p>  In subsequent centuries, in these places there were small settlements Ratmino and Gorodishche.  In later times, these lands belonged to the landlords Tatishchev, Professor P. Shubinsky, businessman I.P. Lyubomilov. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By the thirties of the XX century, the population of Moscow had grown so much that there was not enough water.  We returned to the question raised by Peter I on the transfer of Volga water to the city.  The construction of the Moscow-Volga Canal involved prisoners in correctional camps.  In September 1933, the first batch of workers arrived in the village of Ivankovo ‚Äã‚Äãin arresting robes, which they called the Canal Army soldiers.  During the construction of 250 objects on the canal (dams, pumping stations, locks, moorings, etc.) huge areas of land were attached to the construction site, which entailed the relocation of people and the filling of settlements.  The grandiose construction was completed in just four years, in March 1937.  So the city of Dubna reappeared. </p><h2>  Soviet time </h2><p>  At the entrance to the canal two monumental figures of the leaders of the world proletariat ‚Äî Lenin and Stalin ‚Äî were erected. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yandex.ru" data-author=": , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lenin Monument" class="if uuid-2920900" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/2920900.jpg"></div><p>  The population of Dubna until today sees on the banks of the Volga a monument to Vladimir Ilyich looking at the Volga.  The figure of Stalin was dismantled after his death. </p><p>  During the Great Patriotic War, the dam and hydroelectric power station in Dubna became strategic targets.  Indeed, in the event of their destruction, Moscow will be left without water and electricity, the factories and rear plants will stop, settlements and enterprises will flood.  To protect the structures and the city, the gates of the dam were opened, the water level dropped, the ice broke, and the German troops that entered the reservoir went under water.  The offensive of the Nazis failed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Science city </h2><p>  Today, the production facilities operating in Dubna are widely known throughout the world.  There are also strictly classified objects. </p><p>  GosMKB "Rainbow" them.  A. Ya. Bereznyak back in 1955 developed the P-15 Termit anti-ship missile, from which the missile era at sea began. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.writeopinions.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cruise missiles" class="if uuid-2920914" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/2920914.jpg"></div><p>  It was made at the Dubna Machine-Building Plant.  It was these missiles that were to become the basis of Soviet military rocket science for the next half century.  Created by the bureau in 1951. </p><p>  Dubninsky Machine-Building Plant named after  N.P. Fedorova at first had a different specificity.  In the thirties of the XX century, the question arose of creating seaplanes to protect the sea borders of the USSR. </p><div class="photo" data-original="astrochallenge.kpfu.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The building of the nuclear institute" class="if uuid-2920915" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/2920915.jpg"></div><p>  The first production of such aircraft was established here and lasted from 1939 to 1946.  The joint work of the plant with the Rainbow Bureau brought our country to the forefront of developers and manufacturers of winged equipment, having mastered more than 50 types of modern missiles. </p><p>  In 1945, after the explosion of nuclear bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, humanity entered a new nuclear era.  The first <span>proton accelerator</span> was built in Dubna, in 1949 it was launched.  So in the Soviet Union, high energy physics arose.  The Institute for Nuclear Testing, a strictly classified organization, was initially called, for the purpose of conspiracy, the Hydrotechnical Laboratory.  Today, the population of Dubna is proud to live in the city of a peaceful atom, there are no military nuclear developments.  In 1957, a giant synchrophasotron was launched.  It was a victory for Soviet physics.  Scientists from all over the country reached Dubna.  Today, the Institute is in the development of more than fifty applied projects. </p><p>  The NIKA complex is operating in Dubna - a collider, an accelerator of heavy ions.  A little less than Swiss, it allows scientists to conduct serious exploration work. </p><p>  For over a quarter of a century, the Space Communications Center in Dubna has been providing government communications, organizing international radio and television broadcasting channels. </p><div class="photo" data-original="stukalov-sergey.livejournal.com" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Space Communication Center" class="if uuid-2920905" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/2920905.jpg"></div><p>  The scientific and industrial complex "Daedalus" produces the most modern and advanced means of border protection for all military branches.  Their customers also include nuclear power plants, oil and gas facilities.  They were engaged in the technical security of the Olympic complex in Sochi. </p><h2>  Peaceful city </h2><p>  With the advent of the accelerator, in the fifties, the residential part of the city began to actively develop, comfortable houses were built, people got good jobs, decent wages.  Many freedom-loving artists and musicians sought to come here, unusual concerts and performances were held here.  Residents were actively involved in sports.  Both young and well-known world-famous nuclear physicists worked in Dubna. </p><p>  In the eighties, the city was almost divided into two parts along the Volga.  For the left-bank part, a name was already invented - Podberezovsk.  Thanks to the intervention of the deputy of the Supreme Council, N. N. Bogolyubov, the city remains a single organism. </p><p>  Today there are about 700 enterprises in the field of applied science, nuclear energy, communications, where almost half of the population of Dubna works.  Including about three hundred doctors, over 800 candidates of sciences, 10 academicians. </p><p>  The administration of the city of Dubna pays much attention to young residents.  Recently, Dubna University has appeared here, aimed at developing a sustainable development strategy.  He already occupies a worthy place among the best universities in the country. </p>
