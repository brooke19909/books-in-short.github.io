    <p>  The best advertisements for the Yas Island Rotana Abu Dhabi hotel are guest reviews. </p><h2>  What vacationers say </h2><p>  It is best to plan a vacation in Abu Dhabi in mid-March.  Especially if you decide to travel with children.  The weather is warm, but there is no scorching heat. </p><p>  The first thing that gives the impression of high quality service is an individual transfer.  Even if you arrived at the hotel alone, you will still be met by the hotel staff.  The road from <span>Sharjah Airport</span> takes about 2 hours.  Time flies unnoticed, because the windows await you with magnificent landscapes.  The surroundings and the service fully justify the fact that the hotel complex Yas Island Rotana Abu Dhabi is magnificent. </p><h2>  Hotel Description </h2>

    <p>  The first thing that pleases the visitor‚Äôs eye is a luxurious lounge and friendly staff.  Doors open in the blink of an eye by caring porters.  Bags for you are also happy to carry.  At the reception work Russian-speaking administrators.  If the guest arrives too late, the administration will make sure that people get to dinner. </p><p>  Upon check-in, a Wi-Fi password is immediately issued.  Employees configure access themselves.  The Internet works well not only in the room, but also near the pool.  The administration resolves any requests instantly.  The staff is very friendly, always smiling and interested in your affairs and problems.  There is a special care for every guest. </p><p>  The rooms are superbly equipped.  They have everything you need: bathrobes, slippers, tea accessories, soap and other body care cosmetics.  All this is replenished daily. </p><h2>  About location </h2><p>  The island itself, on which the hotel is located, is only a few km away from Abu Dhabi.  15 minutes drive - and you are in the capital.  On the island itself, the infrastructure is not particularly developed.  There are several more hotel complexes, a beach, a water park, a stadium and a Ferrari park.  For entertainment it is worth choosing places more interesting.  All hotels offer excellent facilities.  It is better not to go to the water park and Ferrari park with young children, there simply is nothing to occupy them.  Although in both of these places it is very interesting for adults.  In the store at Ferrari Park you can buy unique souvenir products with logos.  Prices are relatively inexpensive compared to similar products elsewhere. </p><p>  The stadium is intended for concerts and races.  The noise and roar from the fireballs is heard every day, but it does not bother at all.  In the room all this is not heard. </p><p>  The island's infrastructure is improved annually, so after some time there will be a real paradise.  But the prices, of course, will not remain the same. </p><h2>  Sea and beach </h2>

    <p>  The island has one beach, which is used by guests of all hotels.  Customers at Yas Island Rotana Abu Dhabi 4 can visit it for free.  For strangers, the entrance costs about 500 rubles.  You can also relax in cozy tents with awnings, which cost 2500 rubles. </p><p>  Beach towels are available at the entrance.  The coastal zone is equipped with comfortable sun loungers, tables, benches, mattresses, ottomans and umbrellas.  The beach is very clean, lifeguards are on duty, there is a toilet and shower.  There is a playground nearby.  True, there are no entertainments on the beach for children, only sea and sand. </p><p>  The road to the beach takes only 15 minutes.  For those who do not like to walk, buses go.  Schedules are issued at the reception. </p><h2>  About hotel services </h2><p>  For children, the complex has a shallow pool with a canopy.  There is also an aquazone with a jacuzzi for adults.  Towels are provided upon entry.  For children there is a playground.  Sauna and gym are free of charge. </p><p>  Nutrition is full.  Many recommend taking breakfast only, so as not to become attached to time.  Breakfast includes fresh croissants, eggs, stuffed omelettes, gravy pancakes and buns.  A lot of dairy dishes, cheeses, vegetables and fruits. </p><p>  If you wish, you can dine in the hotel restaurant.  Themed dishes are served at dinner.  Drinks are available for a fee.  Everything is very tasty, but for children this menu is completely inappropriate: the dishes are quite spicy.  You can diversify the diet in the nearest restaurants.  Although the hotel has an excellent assortment, especially fruits and desserts. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="centro yas island rotana 3 abu dhabi" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39274/1722204.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Sightseeing tours are offered by the Yas Island Rotana Abu Dhabi hotel itself.  The tours that most agencies offer already include several excursion programs.  But you can independently go on an interesting journey.  For example, many guests recommend a trip to Dubai or to Jumeirah on the coast.  You can also go to the Bourge Khalif or visit the aquarium.  Independent trips are much cheaper than excursion programs.  For young children, admission to almost all establishments is free. </p><p>  A free shuttle bus runs several times a day from the hotel to the main shopping centers in Abu Dhabi, but shopping is best done in Dubai.  There are cheaper and more choices.  You should definitely visit the singing fountains.  This spectacle for a long time leaves in memory indescribable sensations.  In addition, this entertainment is completely free.  Entrance to the aquarium is also free of charge.  The outside is also very interesting and there is something to see. </p><p>  Yas Island Rotana Abu Dhabi is a great place to relax.  Everything here is at the highest level (food, service, accommodation), but with small children it is better not to go here.  However, practically nothing is adapted for children's recreation here.  No children's menu, playrooms, entertainment on the beach. </p>
