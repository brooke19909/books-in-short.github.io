    <h2>  Recreation center "Kirochnoe Compound": visitor reviews </h2><p>  Probably the most interesting thing for those who plan to go here for the first time is to find out how other guests spent time in this complex.  There are those who have already visited the Kirochnaya Compound more than once.  Reviews of such people are very different.  Most were impressed with the place, especially the nature.  There are truly clear lakes and a beautiful forest.  The rooms are also soundproofed.  But from some reviews, it becomes obvious that the administration here is not too friendly.  Also, in certain cottages, the actual conditions do not correspond to the declared ones, so it is important to carefully choose the room.  Before you pay for housing, it is better to ask him to inspect.  And many recommend checking the room for hot water.  But to be objective, it‚Äôs better to see once than read a hundred times. </p>
