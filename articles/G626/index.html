    <h2>  Briefly about the hotel </h2><p>  Achaia <span>Beach Hotel 4 *</span> was built in 1973.  The hotel is not new, however it has modern rooms.  And in general, the complex looks good.  The last renovation was in 2004.  It is interesting that the hotel complex belongs to the Airotel Group chain.  She is widely known.  This is a Greek hotel chain with vast experience in the tourist field. </p><p>  And the complex is located in a city called Patras.  It is located in the northwestern part of the Peloponnese. </p><p>  The main highlight of the hotel is its close proximity to the sea.  The building is located on the first coastline, so you can walk to the beach in just a minute. </p><p>  Araxos Airport is also relatively close.  You can reach it in 10-15 minutes by car.  The city center is also nearby - a 5-minute drive.  And in the immediate vicinity of the hotel there is everything you need - shops, cafes, restaurants and much more.  Most importantly, there is a sea.  For the sake of him, and most tourists come here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Fun and relaxation </h2><p>  While in Achaia Beach Hotel 4 *, you can brighten up your leisure time in different ways.  Take a swim in the outdoor pool, for example, or sunbathe on the terrace.

    <h2>  Accommodation options </h2><p>  And now - in more detail about what rooms this hotel offers.  The Peloponnese Peninsula is a fairly budget resort, so the prices here are reasonable.  Take, for example, a standard 2-seater number.  It has a living area of ‚Äã‚Äã15 square meters.  m. Yes, not very much, but inside there is everything that is needed for a comfortable stay. </p><p>  Two comfortable modern beds are so close to each other that it seems that this is one king-size bed.  The room has access to a private balcony with a view, as well as air conditioning, a plasma TV with satellite channels, a coffee maker and a safe.  In addition, inside there is also a spacious bathroom with toilet and bath.  Minibar, ironing facilities, telephone, hairdryer, alarm clock, radio - all this is in the room.  There is even a trouser press. </p><p>  Still pleased with the style in which the apartments are decorated.  Everything looks very cozy, homely warm and beautiful.  However, looking at the photos provided, you can see this. </p><p>  There are two options - with a view of the mountains and the sea.  The first is cheaper - about 30,000 rubles per week for two people (with breakfast).  Need a sea view apartment?  Then you will need to pay about 35 thousand rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Spacious apartment </h2><p>  Many people travel to the Peloponnese Peninsula, including families with children.  Everyone wants to see the Gulf of Patras and enjoy a beach holiday.  So the hotel has many rooms for families. </p><p>  For example, for 2 adults and 1 child.  The area and amenities are the same as in the aforementioned category of apartments.  Only besides two beds inside there is a folding sofa.  And the view opens onto the bay of Patraikos.  It costs a week to stay in this room a little more than 40 tons.  If you plan the arrival of three adult guests, you will have to pay 45 t. </p><p>  Many decide to go four to the Peloponnese.  Popular hotels (including Achaia Beach) also offer apartments for such travelers.  In this hotel they are called "family".  Their area is not much larger - only 17 square meters.  m. And there are, as a rule, two ordinary beds and one 2-level.  Although instead of the latter they can put a folding sofa.  Maximum occupancy is 2 adults and 2 children (under the age of 2 years).  And the price is about 45 thousand rubles.  during the week. </p><h2>  For independent travelers </h2><p>  In the end, it‚Äôs worth a few words to say about those rooms that are intended for people who independently went to the Peloponnese.  Hotels often provide apartments for single tourists.  And Achaia Beach is no exception. </p><p>  Their area is 13 square meters.  m. Conditions - all the same.  There are any amenities, ranging from a bathroom to a balcony and a coffee maker.  By the way, there are 2 single beds inside (nearby).  The price for a week's stay (with breakfast) is 28 thousand rubles, if you take apartments with sea views.  Although the overpayment, in contrast to the usual, will be only 2-3 thousand rubles.  So it's worth taking it. </p>

    <h2>  Guest Comments </h2><p>  In conclusion, a few words about the comments that people who have already been here about leaving at Achaia Beach Hotel 4 * reviews. </p><p>  They serve the guests well, clean the rooms regularly, change linen every other day, and a towel upon request (just putting the old one on the floor is enough for maids).  Guests assure - this is a great option for people who dream of a quiet and relaxing vacation at sea.  Almost no one goes here with children, since the rooms have a modest (for large families) living area and there is no mini-club.  Because the hotel is very quiet.  And there are no animated shows, so in the evening the music will not interfere with the rest of the guests.  If a person dreams of such a vacation (and even at an affordable price), you should go here. </p>
