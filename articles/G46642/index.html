But it is distinguished from other living beings by the presence of reason, the ability to think and perform <span>logical operations.</span>  How did he gain these abilities?  And how did he use them?  What is the human mind? </p><h2>  How the mind appeared </h2><p>  Man gained his mind through labor, as is customary to say.  Some may argue about how, holding a stick and trying to build something out of it, a person could develop to the current level? </p><p>  Man developed only in one direction - to facilitate survival in terrestrial conditions.  Trying to adapt to earthly life, a man began to turn to his mind.  He managed to use it to achieve success in using the gifts of nature and thereby learned to create goods.  Man has found a way to survive, not through innate reflexes, but by logically carrying out his actions.  Over time, this allowed him to realize that his mind was capable of more.  And so an amazing world appeared on Earth thanks to the human mind. </p>

    <p>  But if a person is a highly developed being, then why can't he overcome his primordial instincts and take over his vices?  Now man does not need to protect his life from predators and the environment.  But now he is looking for a way of salvation from himself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What is the human mind in spiritual terms?  Does this mean that it is developing one-sidedly?  Or are we just not able to part with our instincts and primitive needs, because of which the development of the mind, except for adaptation to the satisfaction of our needs, is impossible? </p><p>  From these thoughts, we can conclude that labor did not create the human mind, but only helped to develop. </p><h2>  Is the brain the source of reason? </h2><p>  This body was created by nature to regulate functions in the body.  It helps to navigate the environment, stores and uses innate instincts, and it is comparable to a library that stores many books with information.  The brain is subordinate to feelings, reflexes, emotions, but it is not a pure mind and does not function as an organ that forms it. </p><p>  But other animals lack the ability to think, because their brain is not sufficiently developed.  Then how to explain it? </p>

Together with all our sensations - instincts, emotions, irritations - it is an integral part of our mind.  And often a person commits actions, guided not by his highly developed intellect, but by feelings and emotions that are individually developed to each person to a greater or lesser extent.

Therefore, many philosophers adhered to religious beliefs.  That is, they did not adhere to them because they became philosophers.  This religion taught them to think.  One question is followed by a number of other considerations.  Some believed that every great thought that came to their mind was revealed by God.  What can be noted in a religion such as Buddhism. </p><p>  What is the human mind?  High development of personality can not reach everyone.  It is closely related to intelligence, but mastering it is not easy.  Personality is the next step after the development of the mind.  It is also a part of consciousness, of the mind. </p><p>  Intelligence is responsible for logical activity, perceives and processes information.  And a personality is a connection of principles, ideas, rules of behavior, ways of perceiving information received, and the ability to compare it. </p><h2>  Religion for our mind </h2><p>  The appearance of religions is one of the manifestations of the development of the human mind.  Atheists consider believers only fanatics and do not take the words of the scriptures seriously.  Indeed, not every person, whether Christian or Muslim, correctly understands and interprets what is prescribed. </p><p>  But if you remove unnecessary sayings, we can say that thousands of years ago, man realized that he was a highly developed being, and began to think about how he appeared, why he perceives the world this way, why the universe itself is so structured?  The amazing world of the human mind does not stop there. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Having invented writing, a man began to utter his thoughts and assumptions about this.  Not having high technology in ancient times and being content with little experience in understanding this world, a man tried to explain to himself questions about the origin of his existence. </p><p>  This indicates that people were also aimed at satisfying spiritual needs (interest in life, the emergence of art, appeal to their inner world), and not only focused on survival.  Religion has led man to this.  The amazing world, which was created thanks to the human mind, would not be so if it did not have a desire for spiritual food. </p>

    <p>  And although many assumptions from ancient times turned out to be wrong, they at least testify to the fact that we were able to think consecutively, create logical chains and seek confirmation for them. </p><p>  This is an amazing world created by the <span>human</span> mind <span>.</span>  <span>People</span> performed ritual ceremonies over the departed, which shows us their attitude to a living being.  Life was valuable to them. </p><h2>  The struggle of nature and mind </h2><p>  The existence of a highly developed science, technology, economy in our life does not mean that we have reached the highest level of reason.  They only explain the world created thanks to the human mind and nature.  Home planet has interested us since ancient times.  And it is precisely this interest and the desire to satisfy it that shows us as creatures with intelligence. </p><p>  The brain is our tool that helps us achieve what we want.  And he is also the link between natural instincts and true intelligence.  He is able to capture the subtlest vibrations of the non-material plane of being, to become an instrument of the spirit, as the <span>philosopher Vladimir Soloviev said.</span> </p>

    <p>  The mind and personality of a person cannot be formed, desiring a specific result.  Everyone meets with different people, hears information from them, and choosing a particle from it, adds up <span>his own opinion,</span> knowledge.  Even other people's actions form a person‚Äôs personality.  This is what distinguishes the external and internal wonderful world, which was created thanks to the human mind. </p><h2>  Life by human hands </h2><p>  Ancient buildings still amaze with their beauty and grandeur.  We are still trying to figure out how people managed to achieve such excellence, what technologies did they use?  Many studies, experiments and studies have not helped to establish this accurately.  Thanks to the human mind, the world has become more favorable for our lives. </p><p>  Having made a tool for the first time, man did not limit himself to it.  He began to create goods that satisfy his other needs, that is, household items. </p><p>  The man did not stop to satisfy his needs.  Gradually, in the man-made life, as the human mind developed, its echoes began to appear.  House and clothes ceased to satisfy people only as a means of protection from the weather, and weapons as a subject of hunting and a means of attack from predators. </p><p>  The amazing world, thanks to the human mind, has changed and improved with each generation, which has changed, leaving behind improved man-made lands.  Buildings became more complex and sophisticated.  The clothes are more elegant and comfortable.  Weapons are more reliable and dangerous. </p><h2>  The grandiose structures of mankind </h2><p>  Until now, people do not stop there.  Each time they surpass the previous generation. </p><p>  Man has always sought to surpass the one who stands above.  An example of this is the myth of the Tower of Babel.  It tells how people sought to reach the level of their creator, God.  They wanted to be on a par with him.  True, this failed.  After all, to be human is not only to have high material development, but also spiritual. </p>
