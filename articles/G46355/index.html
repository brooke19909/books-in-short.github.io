  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Holidays in Rimini</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Most often, tourists who choose Italy for their holidays go to Rimini, a small resort town on the Adriatic Sea.  This choice is explained very simply: a warm sea, mild climate and hot Italian sun complement the beautiful city, saturated with centuries of history.  People who decide to spend their holidays in Rimini should visit its most popular places: Arch of Augustus, Tiberius Bridge, Italy in Miniature Park, Fiabilandia Park. </p><p>  Arch Augustus is a unique architectural monument, preserved from the time of the ancient Romans.  It was built according to the estimates of some scientists in the 27th century BC.  In the Middle Ages, the arch was used as a city gate.  On its facade, facing Rome, the inscription "Golden Gate" has been preserved.  If you are planning a <span>vacation in Rimini</span> with children, then it is worth visiting the Fiabilandia Park.  Here, young guests and their parents will be greeted by cartoon characters.  In the park there is Merlin Castle, a small jungle, Sleepy Lake and many attractions based on your favorite works and cartoons.  For children in the park there is a disco, which adults are not allowed to enter.  For those who want to arrange a romantic getaway in Rimini <strong>,</strong> you should definitely visit the Tiberius Bridge, thrown across the Marecchia River.  It was built in the period from the 14th to the 21st centuries A.D.  and stood for more than 500 years.  In 580, the Goths destroyed the five-arch bridge of Tiberius, which was restored only in 1680.  Today it is one of the most beloved places to visit tourists in the city.  Even if last minute packages to Rimini were purchased, which did not include an excursion to the Italy in Miniature park, you must visit it yourself.  Here are 270 copies of the most famous <span>sights of Italy</span> and the whole world in a scale of 1:50.  A tour of the park can be done on foot, as well as on a monorail train. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Rimini is not a big town where it is best to relax with a family or a group of friends.  On its narrow ancient streets there are a huge number of small restaurants and cafes where you can try dishes of true Italian cuisine.  The traditions of cooking here pass from generation to generation.  Italians prefer home lunches to popular fast foods in America.  They will never exchange a plate of pasta with seafood for a large bun with a patty and soda.  On the shores of the <span>Adriatic Sea,</span> you can spend an excellent holiday in Rimini with its clean beaches.  Here lovers of outdoor activities will also find something to their liking.  They can play <span>beach volleyball,</span> surf, dive, and paraglide. </p><p>  This resort is popular mainly among young people because of their low housing prices.  In Rimini, most of the hotels are 2-3 *, 4 * hotels will be typed no more than 20 pieces, and 5 * only one.  Wealthy people, vacationing here, most often settle in luxury villas.  Many travel agencies offer last-minute tours to Rimini, which allow you to see the city for a very small fee.  For those people who do not come here to sit in the room all day long, this option will be especially interesting.  If the hotel is not as fashionable as its description, the tourist will be able to get more pleasure from walking around memorable places.  Usually, students who do not want to deny themselves the pleasure of discovering new countries and cities do this.  In the morning they have breakfast in an Italian cafe, then go sunbathing on the pure white beaches, which are 15 km long along the coast.  After lunch, they go on all kinds of excursions, and later in the evening - in one of the many night clubs.  Rimini leaves no time for boredom or dissatisfaction with anything.  Here, life is the key, here you are truly relaxing. </p>
