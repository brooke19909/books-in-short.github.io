Why?  There are many prerequisites for such a statement.  First of all, of course, do not forget about the excellent traffic intersection of this place, and Muscovites, as you know, suffer from constant traffic jams.  Well, and secondly, it is here that the capital‚Äôs favorite place for visitors is located - an observation deck from which an amazing <span>panorama of Moscow</span> opens at any time of the year <span>.</span> </p><h2>  Section 1.

According to the initial project, the station was supposed to be built near the Moskva River, but in order to reduce the cost of construction, the project was changed and the metro line was built directly on the Luzhnetsk metro bridge, built, by the way, in 1958.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A station was placed on the lower tier of the metro bridge, and a highway was made on the upper tier.  During the design and construction of the bridge, some technological and structural errors were made.  All the designs of the platform, the lower structure of the track and bridge were one, therefore they experienced enormous dynamic loads due to constant braking and acceleration of trains. </p><p>  To reduce cash costs, reinforced concrete was installed instead of <span>metal supports</span> .  Since construction was carried out in winter, salt was added to concrete to reduce <span>the freezing temperature of water.</span>  This caused intense corrosion of the metal structure.  Due to poor-quality waterproofing, the station was constantly flooded in the spring. </p><p>  After flooding in the summer of 1959, the practically abandoned Vorobevy Gory metro station was in decline for about a year.  In the summer of 1960, the ceiling began to collapse, and duralumin cornices began to fall from a height of four meters.  Subsequently, cracks appeared in the concrete pavements, and as a result, the station was still closed for repairs.  It happened on October 20, 1983. </p><p>  Since 1986, trains have only moved along bypass bridges built on both sides of the main one.  The upper tier has been functioning for quite a long time due to the lack of a bypass line.  The reconstruction of the station, it should be noted, lasted a very long time due to poor financial supply during the restructuring of the late 1980s and 1990s.  According to official figures, the reconstruction of the station lasted a long 19 years, but active construction work was carried out only from 1999 to about 2002. </p><p>  Only on December 14, 2002 the station was reopened.  May 12, 1999 it was renamed in honor of the historical district of the same name, until that time it was called differently: "Lenin Mountains". </p><h2>  Section 3. Metro "Sparrow Hills".
