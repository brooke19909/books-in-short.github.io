    <h2>  Hotel An Vista Hotel 3 *: negative reviews </h2><p>  Sometimes unpleasant little things can seriously spoil the overall impression of relaxation.  That is why travelers should carefully read the comments about the hotel An Vista Hotel 3 * (Vietnam, <span>Nha Trang).</span>  <span>Reviews</span> allow us to talk about the following disadvantages of this hotel: </p><ul><li>  maids do not do wet cleaning (just wipe the dust and take out the garbage);  the rooms are quite cramped; </li><li>  beach towels of an unpleasant gray color, stained (it is better to bring them with you or buy on the spot); </li><li>  to visit the beach you need vouchers, but they do not give them out upon arrival (you need to constantly remind the administration about this); </li><li>  prices for excursions in the hotel bureau are 2 times higher than the cost of similar tours in local agencies; </li><li>  fruit is rarely found at breakfast (and if it is, it is mostly green); </li><li>  bed linen is not changed throughout the rest, if you do not require this from the administration; </li><li>  in the corridors and rooms you can find lizards and insects; </li><li>  for two guests they are given 1 disposable tube with shampoo (but toothbrushes are updated daily); </li><li>  periodically there are problems with the reservation, because of which you run the risk of spending the whole day or night in the lobby or go in search of another hotel; </li><li>  You may be asked to pay for the contents of the minibar, which you did not even touch (therefore, it is recommended that you be in the room during the check by the maids and administrators); </li><li>  near the hotel, an aerodrome is under construction, the building of which will block a beautiful view of the mountains from some of the rooms; </li><li>  the hotel is located on a narrow street that tourist buses cannot call in, so you have to walk some distance with your suitcases; </li><li>  if you do not get an excursion from the hotel Russian-speaking guide, then you can not count on help on any issues; </li><li>  uncomfortable stairs in the hotel (steps are very high and narrow). </li></ul><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  If you do not make excessive requirements for this hotel, then rest will leave you with the most pleasant experience.  It is worth noting that the hotel is new, and therefore you will not have any problems with worn out furniture, rusty plumbing and frayed walls (at least for now).  Claims can only be made to the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe rooms (they are quite close). </p><p>  Food at the hotel for an amateur.  On this issue, tourists have no consensus.  But everyone agrees that the hotel should only order breakfast, and lunch and dinner is better in neighboring establishments.  It is also worth noting that the administrator does not provide guests with comprehensive information.  So, many tourists only in the middle of a vacation find out about the availability of free coupons for visiting the beach. </p><p>  The quality of service in this institution should not be measured by the speed of personnel, cleanliness of cleaning, and other standard parameters.  The value of Vietnamese service lies in the cordial and friendly attitude of the workers towards the guests, as well as in their love for what they do.  What are the touching attempts of reception staff or even maids to learn a few phrases in Russian.  You will certainly be answered with a smile. </p>
