Reviews of tourists about vacation in Phuket in July</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>The largest island of the</span> kingdom of <span>Thailand, Phuket, is</span> fascinating with its beauty.  What are huge coconut palms, white sand on the shores of the gentle sea, mysterious tropical thickets, small hills, huge mountains and stunning beauty of waterfalls.  Plus, a feeling of unity with nature and peace of mind.  Locals are friendly and welcoming.  The tourist infrastructure in Phuket is quite well developed.  An excellent cuisine with an abundance of seafood dishes also attracts tourists.  In general, if you do not want round-the-clock noise, as in Pattaya or Bangkok, and you need silence and comfort, Phuket is what you need.  And do not worry: is it worth going to Phuket in June or even in July.  The island is beautiful at any time of the year.  For example, Cape Brahma, even on rainy days, is the favorite place of lovers of the setting sun. </p><h2>  Mysterious Seasons </h2><p>  The climate of Phuket is a monsoon.  It is these seasonal sustained winds that influence the weather conditions of the island.  And this is either endless rain and low temperature, or dry heat.  And there are two seasons respectively: a dry period and a rainy one.  It rains incessantly from May to October.  The peak occurs at the end of August - September.  At this time, humidity can be above 95%. </p><p>  Most often it rains at night, but it happens that it pours a week without stopping.  Then a flood occurs on the island, but this is a rare case. </p><p>  Sea water has a temperature of 28-30 degrees Celsius, but the rainy season in Phuket is accompanied by strong winds, and the sea is stormy.  Therefore, swimming on almost all beaches is often prohibited.  Therefore, the hotels have swimming pools into which water is pumped from the sea. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What is the weather like in Phuket in July?  Traveler reviews indicate that the vacation is unforgettable in any weather. </p><h2>  July Paradise Island Tours </h2><p>  Most tourists fly to Phuket in July.  You can always find out the features of the weather changes of this month from the agent of the travel agency or on the tourist portal.  In the rainy season on the island, absolutely everything becomes cheaper: rental of various boats, rental of real estate, prices in restaurants, excursion bureaus and even shops. </p><h2>  Vacation Plans </h2><p>  Relaxing on the beach every day does not always work.  Rains begin instantly, however, and end just as abruptly.  Therefore, a vacation in June-July in Phuket is non-standard.  Phuket in July: is it worth it to go?  The reviews that tourists leave at various tourist portals are almost always positive.  There are many entertainments on the island during this wet season: various excursion walks and hikes, lunches and dinners in restaurants and cafes with big discounts, shops with attractive promotions, healing and relaxation treatments, Thai massage sessions and all kinds of SPA, and of course, amazing beauty beaches. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  There are many beaches in Phuket, especially in its southern part.  The most famous is Bang Tao, or, as they call it in Europe, Laguna Beach.  The Laguna Phuket Resort Complex is located here.  Almost all of them are five-star, with impeccable service, cuisine of any country in the world and golf courses. </p>

    <p>  The exact opposite of this fashionable beach is the small, cozy beach of Surin.  It maintains the atmosphere of a quiet village settlement with a slowly flowing life.  From year to year the popularity of this place is growing. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Is beach privacy possible if you arrived in Phuket in July?  Is it worth the ride?  Reviews rested on Kamala Beach are highly recommended!  This is a beach place for those who like a secluded holiday, even though the <span>Phuket FantaSea</span> park complex is located here <span>.</span> </p><p>  Phuket in June: yes or no?  Definitely yes.  Patong's most visited beach is proof of this.  The number of vacationers on it, if it decreases in June-July, is not at all much.  There are guesthouses and hotels, pubs and outdoor cafes, clubs and massage parlors and spas.  You can have fun in Patong around the clock.  It is here that hosts the popular transvestite show - Simon Cabaret. </p><p>  The cleanest beach in Phuket is Karon Beach.  A few years ago, the embankment was reconstructed.  Now <span>cafes, restaurants, a</span> night market, shops and shops are separated from the beach by a road.  Karon Beach is a quiet and comfortable place.  He is very fond of couples with children. </p><p>  Even more comfortable on Nai Harn.  It is located in a small bay.  Only the sea and birds make noise here. </p>

    <p>  Summer monsoons heave large waves off the coast of Phuket in July.  Is it worth the ride?  The reviews that tourists leave recommend at this time a vacation on the beaches of the east coast.  For example, on Chalong beach.  On rainy days, you can visit the famous pilgrimage center - the most beautiful Buddhist temple.  In the main pagoda of this center is a piece of Buddha - a fragment of bone.  The temple can be visited absolutely free. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The second good beach for this time of year is Panwa.  Rest can be diversified by trips to the Aquarium of the Biological Center for the Study of the Seas.  There are many huge fish, including sharks, the feeding of which is very attractive for tourists. </p><p>  And, of course, Rawai beach.  Here, in case of rain, you can study the shells in the museum of the same name.  It presents about two thousand rare, unusual and simply beautiful shells.  The age of some, according to rough estimates of scientists, is 380 million years.  At the exit of the museum there is a small shop selling shell products: pendants, beads, rings and souvenirs.  Resting in these places, you must definitely go to the orchid farm.  Each incoming mistress gives a stunning flower.  On the farm you can buy seedlings and flowering plants (each purchase will be in special packaging designed for the trip). </p><p>  Calm and cozy rest will take place on the banks of Kata Noi.  Waves practically do not reach it because of the small islands with which it is surrounded. </p><h2>  Travel Phi Phi Islands </h2><p>  What to do in Phuket in July?  Be sure to go to the inhabited and <span>uninhabited islands</span> of the Phi Phi archipelago.  From the east coast of Phuket there is a ferry to the islands.  Guests of the islands called this place the "Garden of Eden" for its pristine, virgin beauty.  Today, exciting excursions are organized here.  For example, in Bantosai.  This is a small cozy village.  It has many cafes, shops and bungalows for guests.  The sensations are fabulous.  Diving enthusiasts also love Phi Phi.  Here is clear water with exotic aquatic inhabitants and huge coral colonies! </p>

    <h2>  Water above, water below ... </h2><p>  Reviews about about.  Phuket in July <strong> </strong>  the most diverse.  Some people like the wet season, some do not.  But it is in the rainy season that you need to visit the waterfalls.  Due to prolonged rains, they become powerful, their roar is heard over hundreds of meters.  <span>The highest waterfall on the</span> island is just above the four-story building, however, each of them is striking in its beauty.  You can listen to waterfalls, watch and swim in them! </p>

    <p>  If you have a cold, you must urgently get to the hot springs.  The coldest of them has a temperature of 39 degrees.  And it is better to finish water procedures with exotic foot massage with special fish - Garra rufa. </p><h2>  Hiking in the Old Town </h2><p>  Deciding whether to go to Phuket (Thailand) in July will be much easier if you first get acquainted with video or photo collections of the Old City or Phuket Town on tourist portals.  It is away from most tourist destinations and beaches. </p><p>  The old city is very different from most cities on the island.  There is a special spirit: there is no tourist crowd, but there are many cozy home cafes and elegant taverns in the national style.  Phuket Town is full of contrasts and mysteries.  Talang Street, for example, is proud of the beautiful modern building of the local post office, which is adjacent to the 18th-century mansion.  Now it is open Museum of stamps. </p><p>  Soi Romani Street was entirely from brothels.  Now they have only red paper lanterns left.  At the end of the walk, you should definitely look into the Thai spices shop.  This establishment is more than a hundred years old, and only natural products are traded here. </p>

    <h2>  The holy full moon of the eighth month </h2><p>  On the first full moon in July, Asanha Bucha is celebrated on the island, from which Lent begins.  On this day, beautiful ceremonies are held everywhere, services are held in temples in honor of the holiday, after which the men go to the monastery for three months, renouncing the earthly world. </p><h2>  Delight for the soul </h2><p>  Is it worth going to Phuket in June-July?  Worth it.  Meteorologists say that there are more sunny days in July than cloudy days.  And on occasion, beach pleasure on a rainy day can be replaced by an excursion to the recently opened botanical garden.  Its territory is divided into thematic sites.  There is a European kindergarten and Japanese, a corner of Balinese vegetation and others.  Each of them greets guests with funny figures and sculptures. </p>
