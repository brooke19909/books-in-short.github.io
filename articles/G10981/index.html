Ever since the Middle Ages (XII century), Korea was a single state, and there were no prerequisites for its division. </p><p>  However, the 20th century is a time of confrontation between the two most powerful superpowers: the USA and the USSR.  This confrontation was not expressed in open confrontation, there was a struggle of ideologies.

    <h2>  History of the emergence of a single state </h2><p>  Since the 7th century AD, the Korean people have come a long and <span>thorny path of</span> building their own statehood. </p><p>  His story is conditionally divided into three periods and give the following periodization: </p><ul><li>  the period of the united Silla (VII - X centuries); </li><li>  Koryo period (X - XIV centuries); </li><li>  Joseon era (XIV ‚Äì beginning of XX century). </li></ul><p>  At the beginning of the 19th century, Korea was a monarchical country with a strict isolation policy, but nevertheless was under the control of China. </p><p>  The Korean monarchy was happy with everything: a huge property gap was observed in the country between different sections of the population.  The feudal relations in society hindered the development of capitalism. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Life under the protectorate of Japan </h2><p>  The situation changed after 1895, when China, after the war with Japan, lost its influence on Korea.  On the other hand, the Land of the Rising Sun triumphantly burst into this region and began to impose not only culture, but also control economic life. </p><p>  Korea actually turned into a Japanese colony, and the Koreans were divided into two camps: supporters of national independence and "Minchok Kejoron" (Koreans who approve of the lifestyle imposed by the Japanese).  However, Japan did not stand on ceremony with its colony.  The army and police successfully suppressed any outbursts of discontent. </p><p>  Religion, culture, and language were imposed.  Opposition led by Lee Sungman had to emigrate from the country and, having organized militant groups, fought against the Japanese. </p>

    <h2>  What was Korea in the middle of the 20th century? </h2><p>  On the one hand, there were no prerequisites for the separation of Korea.  Indeed, Koreans are one nation with a common historical and spiritual heritage, close economic ties.  But this is only at first glance. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The history of the separation of North and South Korea originates in the differences in the economic development of different regions of the country.  The north has traditionally been industrial, and the southern part of the country is agricultural. </p><p>  It is necessary to recall one more interesting historical condition.  It's about the political elite.  It was formed mainly from representatives of the capital's elite and immigrants from South Korea.  These differences played a certain negative role in the division of the country.  However, even these factors were not key. </p><p>  The history of the separation of North and South Korea begins after the defeat of Japan and its colonies in World War II. </p>

    <h2>  38 parallel </h2><p>  Soviet and American soldiers on their bayonets brought freedom.  Koreans looked to the future with hope.  However, in practice it turned out: the world's superpowers have their own plans for Korea.  The United States was the first to introduce custody.  It was assumed that this measure would contribute to the optimal development of ways to establish Korea‚Äôs "independence".  The Americans really wanted to get Seoul, so the division of Korea and the delimitation of the zone of responsibility drew 38 parallels. </p><p>  This agreement was reached in August 1945.  In fact, the USSR and the USA at that time were not ready to give independence to the former colony of Japan because of fears of strengthening the position of their political rivals in this region.  Having created areas of responsibility, thus, the victorious countries divided Korea into northern and southern parts.  And now they had to decide what they were going to create in the territories they controlled.  All this happened in an atmosphere of mutual hostility and distrust. </p>

    <h2>  The design of the division of Korea into northern and southern parts </h2><p>  In 1946, the USSR was determined.  It was decided in the north of the country to create a friendly socialist state.  And this was dictated by the historical realities of that time.  Initially, the division of Korea into zones of responsibility was dictated by purely military expediency: it was necessary to quickly and effectively disarm the Japanese army.  But the intensification of nationalists and right-wing radicals in the north of the country very quickly made it clear to the Soviet leadership where the wind was blowing and who was trying to rekindle the fire of war again.  Therefore, the nationalists were mercilessly suppressed. </p><p>  In the south, on the contrary, a reverent attitude towards right-wing radicals was observed.  Those, in turn, gave the necessary guarantees of loyalty to their American masters. </p><p>  The USSR did not allow the UN to hold general elections in the country and did not even let a special commission enter the territory under its control. </p><p>  The 1948 elections and the appearance on the political map of two different states, such as the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, made the division of the people of the once united country a reality. </p>

    <p>  The final division of Korea into northern and southern parts in the hearts of the Koreans themselves became possible thanks to the military adventure of Kim Il Sung.  Due to the actions of this politician, the Soviet Union was involuntarily drawn into this conflict.  His support was the provision of military-technical assistance and the sending of his military specialists as advisers. </p><p>  The Americans were able to protect the south of the country, however, the separation of Korea and the split of one people became a problem that has not been resolved even now. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Recently, the world community has increasingly expressed concern about the actions and general rhetoric of the political leadership of <span>North Korea.</span>  Demonstrative, mostly unsuccessful missile launches, as well as the huge desire of the Democratic People‚Äôs Republic of Korea to further develop its nuclear program do not add optimism.  The division of Korea has given rise to global problems, the solution of which may affect all of human civilization. </p>
