This building is included in the list of attractions of the capital.  It is worth saying that visiting the planetarium on Barrikadnaya is interesting not only for children, but also for adults. </p><h2>  History of creation </h2><p>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbuilding a planetarium in Moscow arose in the first years of Soviet power.  It was then that the Metropolitan Council recognized the need to educate and educate workers.  They planned to make the planetarium on Barrikadnaya a center promoting the science of the Universe. </p>

Its main task was to guide the construction of the planetarium.  In those years, there were already twelve similar structures in the world.  Most of them were in Germany.  The Moscow Planetarium on Barrikadnaya became the thirteenth in a row.

    <h2>  Project development and construction </h2><p>  The government allocated substantial funding for the time for the construction of a planetarium in Moscow.  In addition, a considerable amount of money was needed to purchase a special projection apparatus in Germany.  Equipment was purchased for the observatory, laboratory facilities and for the cinema.  In the planetarium, it was planned to open a library, an astronomical museum and classrooms for circle classes.  Thus, the developers of the project solved the problem of creating a unique public university in this grandiose building. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Young architects M.O. worked on the creation of the planetarium.  Barshch and M.I.  Sinyavsky, who in certain circles already had fame.  The project they created had a constructivist and fashionable style at that time.  The development was approved, after which the construction of the structure began. </p><p>  The facility was commissioned in the fall of 1929. By this time, the construction of the dome-screen was completed and the installation of equipment was completed.  For the general public, the planetarium in Moscow on Barrikadnaya was opened only on November 5. </p><h2>  Beginning of work </h2><p>  In the early years of its existence, the Moscow planetarium on Barrikadnaya did not have extensive programs.  He began his work with short cycles of lectures.  However, the programs were gradually expanded.  Soon, visitors were invited to listen not to three, as before, but forty to those who read qualified lecturers. </p><p>  Gradually, improving the technical equipment of the "people's university" was carried out.  In the first year after the discovery, a special device was created in the planetarium, which was called the Rising Sun.  It worked until 1994. Already by 1934, planetarium equipment made it possible for visitors to show the flight of comets and the <span>northern lights,</span> solar eclipses and August starfalls.  The Tsiolkovsky rocket, escorted by a fiery tail, was also shown here.  Until the fifties of the last century, there were no planetariums around the world that could show similar to their visitors.  This was the merit of K.N.  Shistovsky, who was a talented engineer and the first director of the Moscow Planetarium. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the same 1934, an astronomical circle began to work in the "people's university".  Engineering courses were also held here.  Subsequently, their graduates became the founders of the famous design bureau KB-7, which was engaged in the development of liquid rockets. </p><p>  In addition to scientific activities, the planetarium offered its visitors viewing performances.  Their main theme is the glorification of famous astronomers - Copernicus, Giordano Bruno and Galileo. </p><p>  The planetarium on Barrikadnaya did not stop its work even in the war years.  Not only ordinary lectures were given here.  A whole series of topics was intended to train military pilots and scouts. </p><h2>  Planetarium life after the Great Victory </h2><p>  In the postwar years, the construction of an astronomical site was carried out.  From it one could observe real heavenly bodies. </p><p>  By 1947, the planetarium on Barrikadnaya (see photo below) became a whole complex of buildings, including a star hall and a foyer, an astronomical site and an observatory. </p>

    <p>  For a long time it was the only place where reliable information about space was provided.  In this regard, for many decades, navigators of <span>long-range aviation were</span> trained in the planetarium and studied the location of stars in the sky <span>.</span>  They visited the complex on Barrikadnaya and future astronauts.  Here they studied astronavigation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The era of space exploration </h2><p>  The planetarium reached its peak of popularity in the 60s of the last century.  This was the era of the beginning of space exploration.  Significantly expanded the planetarium on the Barricade program, held for its visitors, after replacing some equipment.  So, the new Planetarium device was installed.  Unlike the old one, it had great capabilities and an automated work system.  However, times of stagnation came that brought oblivion to the planetarium.  In 1994, it was closed for reconstruction. </p><h2>  Updated complex </h2><p>  Repair in the Moscow planetarium lasted seventeen years.  In June 2011, it was finally opened.  Over the years, the complex has been significantly updated.  Its area has increased almost six times.  Currently, the planetarium covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãseventeen thousand square meters and is designed for a thousand spectators.  Tickets cost guests from one hundred and fifty to six hundred rubles.  The complex daily receives up to three thousand people. </p><p>  In the lobby of the planetarium is a scheme of the institution.  On it you can determine your location and navigate how to get into the room of interest.  Volumetric scheme.  When choosing a place, it starts to highlight.  It is very convenient for visitors.  If some difficulties nevertheless have arisen, then you can always contact the workers of the complex who will prompt the necessary direction. </p><p>  To date, an extensive cognitive program boasts a planetarium on Barrikadnaya.  The reviews of numerous visitors indicate that the information received is interesting to people of different levels of knowledge and age. </p><p>  The popularity of the planetarium is again great today.  There is the possibility of free visits to the complex on lecture days.  A convenient location and fascinating excursions conducted in various rooms attract here not only residents, but also guests of the capital. </p><p>  Visitors to the planetarium have the opportunity to refresh their knowledge of astronomy.  This can be done in several rooms that are equipped in the complex.  Each of them differs in subject and cost of visiting. </p><h2>  Museum of Urania </h2><p>  This room is located in the old part of the complex.  Its first level acquaints visitors with the history of the planetarium, as well as with the development of methods of the science of cognition of the Universe. </p><p>  In the museum of Urania, visitors are met by an astronomer-stargazer.  He sits surrounded by old prints and books, as well as special equipment. </p><p>  Then visitors get into the zone, the exhibits of which introduce the history of the planetarium.  A large number of documents and photographs, objects and books have been collected here, allowing you to visually reproduce facts and events that relate to the complex from 1929 to the present time. </p>

    <p>  The most striking exhibits representing the equipment that the complex was equipped with are the Planetarium apparatus (with serial number 313), which worked from 1977 to 1994, as well as the details of the device with the same name, which operated from 1926 to 1976.  (serial number 13).  At one time, with their help, an artificial sky was lit on the dome. </p><p>  The museum has shop windows that display goniometer instruments and telescopes, theodolites and sundials.  This theme is being developed by the Sea Corner.  This exposition resembles a ship's style.  There are sails and a deck, a bargain and a helm.  Star-filled and geographical maps, as well as instruments with which it is possible to navigate the sea, are placed in cylindrical display cases.  This is a barograph and chronometer, a sextant and a boat compass, as well as a spyglass.  Without these tools, it would be impossible to make geographical discoveries. <br>  In the second hall of the Museum of Urania, visitors enter the world of amazing celestial bodies.  Globes of Venus and Mars, the Moon and the Earth are installed here.  These nearest space neighbors are somewhat similar to each other, but at the same time unique in their own way. </p>
