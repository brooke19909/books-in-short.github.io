Description, photo</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The sights of Buryatia are striking in their diversity and grandeur.  Most of them are of natural origin, but there are those that are created by man and preserve the cultural heritage of these places for future generations. </p><h2>  Baikal Reserve </h2><p>  The Baikal Reserve is a state natural biosphere reserve located in the southern part of the Buryat Republic.  Most of it occupies the territory of the Khamar-Daban ridge. </p><p>  The foundation of the <span>Baikal Reserve</span> occurred in 1969. And in 1986, it became one of the biosphere reserves of the World Wide Web.  It is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site ‚ÄúLake Baikal‚Äù (1996). </p><p>  The reserve with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã165,724 hectares consists of several zones: forest-covered (117,214 hectares), reservoirs (1,552 hectares), and zone of treeless highlands. </p><p>  The reserve territory can be divided into two parts: small - southern and large - northern, occupying the strip of the Baikal coast and the northern side of the ridge. </p><p>  The sights of the Republic of Buryatia are for the most part created in order to preserve and explore the unique natural sites of the republic.  So the Baikal Reserve was founded in order to preserve and study the natural conditions and the course of natural processes.  Also an important object of study in this case is the gene pool of animals and plants, unique and typical ecosystems of the central part of Southern Baikal and the Khamar-Daban ridge.  It is precisely in these territories that high-altitude virgin forests are located, which have never undergone logging and fires. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Arshan Buryatia sights" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33887/1126351.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Flora and fauna of the Baikal reserve </h2><p>  Mongolian steppes and East Siberian taiga are the prevailing landscapes of the reserve.  The purest mountain rivers and lakes are located on its territory.  Dark coniferous forests grow on the northern slopes of Khamar-Daban, where cedar and fir prevail.  Partially the forest belt is occupied by ordinary spruce and birch.  The river valleys are occupied by birch-poplar stands. </p><p>  The fauna is quite typical for the highlands of southern Siberia.  The only feature is the presence of <span>bird</span> species <span>, the origin of</span> which belongs to Central Asia.  The territory of the reserve is inhabited by sable, lynx, otter, deer, Manchurian deer, roe deer, elk and bear.  If we talk about ichthyofauna, then it is represented by 18 species of animals, the main of which are taimen, grayling and lenok. </p><h2>  Ivolginsky datsan </h2><p>  One of the most popular tourist destinations in Siberia is Buryatia.  Ivolginsky district, whose sights are of great historical value, is becoming one of the most visited. </p><p>  The Ivolginsky datsan is the most famous datsan in Buryatia, which makes it the most frequent place of pilgrimage for Buddhists not only in Russia but also in the world.  Translated from the Tibetan language in the original sounding like "Khambyn Sume Gandan Dasha Choinhorling", the name means "the monastery Wheel of the Teaching, which brings joy and absolute happiness."  The residence of the head of the Buddhist traditional Sangha of Russia, Lama Pandito Khambo, is the village of Verkhnyaya Ivolga, which is located 30-40 km from Ulan-Ude. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The largest Buddhist monastery complex was erected in 1945. Numerous requests and appeals from local Buddhists gave rise to fundraising for its construction and the acquisition of necessary religious objects.  Soon, the inconspicuous Buryat village expanded.  An unusual wooden structure appeared on its territory, which was given the appearance of a datsan.  And in 1951, the local authorities allocated a plot of land intended for the construction of the monastery complex.  This event is significant for the entire republic of Buryatia, since it was the places of the first structures that became the center of a complex of elegant temples filled with shrines and secrets. </p>

    <h2>  Waterfall Small Zhom-Bolok </h2><p>  The amazing waterfall and basalt canyon of the Oka River (Aha) is a very popular place for visiting tourists who prefer to enjoy natural attractions. </p><p>  The waterfall is located 2 km from the mouth of the Zhom-Bolok River.  Water majestically falls from a height of 22 meters.  A special charm to this place is given by basalt rock and an unusual round dip where powerful streams of water fall.  Spruces grow right in the middle of the gap, and a small lake has formed below, which flows into the Oka River.  In winter, the waterfall completely freezes, taking the form of a giant stalagmite. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Also not far from these places are two more natural monuments: the canyon Maly Saylak and the Okinsky Grotto. </p><h2>  Volcano valley </h2><p>  Sights of Buryatia will interest not only lovers of beautiful natural landscapes, but also those who prefer extreme tourism. </p><p>  The valley of volcanoes with a length of about 20 km attracts more and more lovers of outdoor activities.  This marvelous place is located in the East Sayan Mountains, at the foot of the Greater Sayan Range.  The valley frozen under the lava includes nine extinct volcanoes.  The largest of them are the volcanoes of Peretolchin and Kropotkin.  Lava flows spread down the valleys of Zhom-Bolok and Hi-Gol for more than 70 km.  And the thickness of the layer of solidified lava in some places reaches 155 m. </p><p>  Lava fields look like randomly uplifted, blackened, petrified formations with a porous structure, the height of which sometimes exceeds 2 m. In some places on the vast lava field there are failed depressions and lakes.  The last volcanic eruptions were several millennia ago, and today they are considered "sleeping". </p>
