The history of this country is filled with various ups and downs, which largely determined the characteristics of the nationality.  The history of every nation is closely intertwined with the territory chosen for life - it is here that the people are formed, here they are being improved, and here is where statehood appears.  For modern citizens, it is important not only Tajikistan, which exists on the maps of our world, but also its predecessors.  We turn to the history to find out more. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theatlantic.com" data-author=": Anatoly Sapronenkov, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tajik SSR flag" class="if uuid-2948200" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47518/2948200.jpg"></div><h2>  What is it about? </h2><p>  The Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic formed in the area that was previously part of the great Asian state.  Middle Eastern and Asian lands were formerly ruled by the Samanids - it was about a millennium ago.  Although that political system has fallen, its legacy for many centuries shaped the structure of Tajik society.  Despite Turkization, peoples retained their characteristics.  These lands entered Russia during the period of imperial power - in the nineteenth century.  The revolutionary events of the twentieth century could not but affect the life of Tajiks.  Such was the historical context of the formation of a new country. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The coup that took place in 1917 was an important step in the development of Asian lands.  The backwardness characteristic of the medieval period has finally receded into the past.  A new era has begun.  The Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic is considered in some detail in the Soviet scientific literature, therefore this period of the life of society seems to many to be the most studied, as detailed as possible examined.  At the same time, as historians admit, there are a number of subtle nuances associated with the formation of the country - they are not yet sufficiently disclosed.  Not so long ago, additional research was organized on the formation of Soviet statehood in Asian lands.  Many scholars discuss the topic of the demarcation of Asian lands on a national basis and statehood.  The formation of the republics in the year 24 became the normative base, first for the TSSR, then - an independent power. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": TheSign 1998, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Agro-industry of the Tajik SSR" class="if uuid-2948199" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47518/2948199.jpg"></div><h2>  Theoretical base </h2><p>  What is the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic, how this power was formed, what are the ways and stages of its development can be found not only from Soviet sources, but also from the works of modern authors who have considered this issue.  Well-known foreign scientists involved in the TSSR.  The main task of all these researchers set themselves the definition of historically important points that changed the course of history for an entire nation.  It is noted that the Soviet ideology mainly reflects the general ideology of the formation of the USSR, while the TSSR, as one can conclude from official publications, practically did not differ from other parts of the allied power.  Of course, from 1924 to 1991, quite a lot of works were published on the Tajiks and their statehood, but the political realities of this time period showed a significant adjustment.  The authors avoided an objective examination of the problems associated with Soviet history.  According to many, the most valuable can be called the works written shortly after the 20s of the last century by the direct participants in the event - Khojibaev, Makhsuma, Shotemura. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The autonomous Tajik Socialist Soviet Republic, as can be seen from the works of a later time (about the middle of the last century), already seemed to some extent idealized country.  Scientists could not afford to criticize the actions of the ruling structures, to point out the mistakes made by the managers who were previously responsible for delimiting the Asian lands.  The realities of the development of statehood, as well as the features of public education, have not been practically considered.  Over the years, the number of scientific papers on this topic has increased significantly, while the quality continues to be insufficient.  Of particular interest is the monograph published by Radjabov. </p><h2>  Comprehensive review </h2><p>  The Tajik Republic of the USSR was an object of interest not only for Soviet scientists, but also for a number of foreign scientists.  The first such works were presented to the public in the 20-30 years of the last century.  Foreign researchers used different approaches to assess what is happening in the Asian region.  From the point of view of the USSR, all authors were divided into reactionary and progressive, and only those whose positions coincided with the ideology of an allied power belonged to the second category.  The authors, from the point of view of the Soviet authorities, belonging to the reactionaries, as the ideologists of the union country assured, falsified what was happening.  Their works were anti-Soviet and, according to some modern scholars, are far from always objective.  On the other hand, criticism of the power system and regime was justified. </p><p>  Quite curious are the works of Zhekhak devoted to the Tajik USSR.  He created a unique scientific work devoted to the Tajik language, and described in it especially difficult periods for the local population.  The author‚Äôs attention was drawn to the period of the ban on the Tajik language, which operated for some time in Bukhara. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": Transoxsiana, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lenin district of the Tajik SSR" class="if uuid-2948198" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47518/2948198.jpg"></div><h2>  Historical context </h2><p>  Formed around the capital (Dushanbe), the Tajik SSR appeared on the territory of the Central Asian lands.  Before the modern demarcation, what is today Tajikistan belonged to the Bukhara and Turkestan republics.  Turkestan included north and east, the remaining parts were the eastern region of Bukhara.  In the spring of the 18th, the fifth Soviet congress was organized in Tashkent, during which they announced the existence of the TASSR, at the same time approving the provision on the features of this republic. </p><p>  To deal with the problem of national minorities, they organized the People‚Äôs Commissariat, whose normative documentation read: "All nations are given the right to send representatives to the committee."  At that moment, there was no mention of Tajiks, although this nationality was indigenous to the region, and the number of people was quite impressive.  The Constitution of the new republic, which entered into force in the autumn of 1920, also did not have Tajiks.  As indigenous peoples, only Kyrgyz, Uzbeks, and Turkmens were considered. </p><p>  The Bukhara emirate is one of the predecessors of the Tajik SSR (Dushanbe was chosen as the capital), distinguished by the peculiarity of national dialects.  Here, it was possible to preserve the Persian language as the state language - but this was only the first time.  The emir‚Äôs regime was eliminated as part of the Frunze‚Äôs campaign, at the same time they proclaimed the Bukhara Republic.  The local population, however, opposed the innovations - it was called the "Basmach movement."  The fight with him lasted several years.  Tajik rights were also violated here, although it was this nationality that was one of the main ones.  The Tajik language was persecuted, and Uzbek was declared the main language.  Then they introduced fines for using the Tajik dialect.  As can be seen from the documents that have been preserved to this day, there were not a single Tajik in the Communist Party. </p><h2>  Borders and unity </h2><p>  According to the photo, the Tajik SSR may seem like a fairly calm place where people lived peacefully and without serious upheavals.  In reality, the situation was more unpleasant.  After the formation of the Bukhara Republic, numerous politicians from the TASSR were sent here, including many Pan-Turkists.  So the opinion began to spread that the Central Asian territories were Turkestan, a Turkic country in which there were no Tajiks at all.  The goal pursued by the government was as follows: to form the Great Turan, that is, to form as a single whole of all the T√ºrks.  Such a state should have focused more on Turkey than on Russia.  Such a development of affairs caused unrest in the central apparatus of administration of the allied power.  It was decided to delimit Asian areas in order to exclude the formation of a new state. </p><p>  National and territorial delimitation occurred in 1924.  From that moment, there is the Tajik SSR;  the city of Dushanbe was chosen as the capital.  Some foreign historians believe that such a demarcation was nothing more than an experiment based on the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa separation of powers.  During this period, managers remembered the Tajiks as a nationality, they were assigned the status of small natives who retained their unique native language.  In reality, the Tajik population had several dialects.  At the same time, the lifestyle and cultural heritage for all representatives of the Tajik people was quite similar.  Many simultaneously spoke Persian, Turkic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rbth.com" data-author=": Mahmud Babadzhanov, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tajik SSR areas" class="if uuid-2948197" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47518/2948197.jpg"></div><h2>  Situation development </h2><p>  At first, the districts of the Tajik SSR were only on paper ‚Äî the local government practically did not work, and much remained to be done so that it could function.  They began to form party organs on the ground.  Tajikistan was autonomy in the Ukrainian SSR, so it was not possible to form its own Communist Party.  In May the 24th, the governors of the Bukhara SSR dissolved the ChDK by organizing the Military Revolutionary Council, and in November of that year they formed a revolutionary committee that was preparing the congresses.  The main goal of the work was to get rid of Basmachi and guarantee the local population peaceful conditions for life.  Already in those days, the authorities understood that it was necessary to begin work on educating the people, and also to restore the national economy. </p><p>  Until the end of 1926, the Revolutionary Committee was the main governing body of the TSSR.  Then the authority of the structure was transferred to the Central Executive Committee.  Responsibility for his election was entrusted to participants in the congress organized in the city of Dushanbe of the Tajik SSR.  From this moment, the republic has a presidium and its chairmen, and the people's commissars have been dismissed - new appointments have been made.  Then they adopted a number of important regulatory acts on nationalization, education, and women's emancipation.  At the same time, the military and political situation remained practically unchanged even after the demarcation: there were adherents of the old and new regimes.  It was the followers of the power of the emir that were seen as the main problem of the Central Asian lands - this can be seen from extant Soviet sources.  Two military campaigns were organized.  The first caused serious damage to Basmachi, and by the 31st year it was possible to completely end this movement.  From that moment on, normal peaceful construction and management in the republic became possible. </p><h2>  Economics and culture </h2><p>  And in the capital of the Tajik SSR, and in other settlements, at first people lived very hard.  According to experts, the entire period of autonomous existence of the Tajiks were forced to deal with great economic difficulties.  It is known that managers regularly wrote petitions to financial institutions and a specialized bureau in the central government, urging them to pay special attention to local difficulties.  The center, however, did not officially have the money, and the bureau allowed to increase funding for the region by only 5%.  It was assumed that the inflow of funds could become more substantial if the provision of other republics was reduced, but such a measure was not enough.  The budget of the republic was formed by the managers of the allied power and was tied to the Ukrainian SSR.  In practice, the government of the TSSR did not receive money at all, or they were transferred with significant delays.  According to modern researchers, often the managers of the Ukrainian SSR simply robbed the TSSR, which further worsened the situation of the region. </p><p>  The cities of the Tajik SSR were, to some extent, the stronghold of culture, the development of which was regulated by Leninist and Stalinist instructions.  The proletariat of a developed power, as Lenin wrote in his writings, helps other countries move to a more progressive system, having gone through important periods of development without capitalism.  It was immediately recognized that it does not seem realistic in advance to indicate what is needed for the development of the country.  According to foreign researchers, virtually all of the cultural construction of that era was the Russification of Asian peoples.  Alphabets, grammar systems and morphological norms were created, which, according to a number of scientists, were only supposed to break the community of the population and prevent communication of nationalities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kisspng.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic" class="if uuid-2948201" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47518/2948201.jpg"></div><h2>  Education and Progress </h2><p>  The period of Soviet power was not only the time of the appearance of new names (for example, Leninabad).  The Tajik SSR received the opportunity to organize the educational process in accordance with the standards of the allied power.  As soon as the TSSR was formed, they began to create model Soviet educational institutions.  At first, the training was conducted in Uzbek.  This seemed especially surprising to those who remembered the statement of the Revolutionary Committee, which designated one of their most important tasks to develop Soviet schools where children could study in their native dialect. </p><p>  Not only language, but also art, literature changed greatly during the Soviet period.  A decree was adopted on hudlite.  In fact, it was thanks to him that the direction of art became a method of propaganda and agitation.  In the 20s, local literary criticism was formed, new directions appeared.  Then the founders of Tajik literature acted.  The genre of songs was actively developing.  Particular love was devoted to the elimination of Basmachism, the prosperity of the Komsomol, and revolutionary leaders.  Then they began to sing about the emancipation of women, the participation of the female half of humanity in the development of the agricultural industry of the Tajik SSR.  One of the most typical creations of that time was considered the song ‚ÄúGirl from the Combine‚Äù. </p><h2>  Coat of arms and flag </h2><p>  Symbols of a country, nation, people - all these signs and characteristic images, musical works have always been important for a person.  Along with the formation of the new republic, provisions governing the basic symbolism were adopted.  This made it possible to increase the self-identification of the local population.  The rules and features of the use of images, as well as the nuances of these works themselves, were fixed in the local constitution.  As you can learn from this document, the emblem of the Tajik SSR is a star with five endings, decorated with a crown.  From the first half, it is formed by wheat ears, and in the left you can see cotton branches, at the ends of which boxes are opened.  On top of the emblem are a sickle, a hammer, golden in the sunlight.  The crown is decorated with a twisted ribbon on which the slogan of the allied power is written: "Workers of all countries, unite!"  The inscription is made in two languages: Tajik and Russian common to all republics.  Below you can see the tape on which the name of the republic is written in the same two dialects. </p><p>  The Tajik SSR flag is a rectangle-shaped canvas painted in four colors.  The bands are sequential and horizontal.  The upper part is painted red, it dominates and occupies half the panel.  Next, a white block goes one fifth of the width, then half as much green, and red equal to the width of white.  Above, near the flagpole, golden paint depicts a sickle and a hammer.  Above these images on the flag of the Tajik SSR there is an asterisk - a classic Soviet with five extremities.  The star is decorated with a gold border.  The ratio of width and length is one to two. </p><div class="photo" data-original="news.tj" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mr.  Dushanbe Tajik SSR" class="if uuid-2948196" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47518/2948196.jpg"></div><h2>  About the Constitution </h2><p>  Stalinabad, Leninabad, the Leninsky district of the Tajik SSR, and other new names appeared on the territory of the country, since the Soviet government was able to win in the course of the 1917 revolutionary conflicts.  It was thanks to the courage and courage of the soldiers of that time that Soviet power was established, the Communist Party took over the government, on whose initiative there were numerous transformations in the economy and society.  The Constitution of the TSSR states: "It was due to this that we managed to defend what was created and develop it into a full-fledged socialist society in which every person is free, has excellent opportunities and welfare."  The constitution reads: "A power has impressive productive forces, the culture of its people is constantly growing, and the working class is in a strong alliance with intellectuals and peasants." </p><p>  From the Constitution you can learn about the equal rights of the TSSR and other republics as part of a single union state.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The TSSR is one of the aspects of state unity, and the Soviet Union as a whole is called upon to unite different peoples so that people can jointly develop the ideas of communism. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The highest ideals, documented by the Constitution, consolidated the system and political realities of the country, as well as the obligations of all citizens and the goals of the state.</font></font></p><h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Curious to know </font></font></h2><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The total territory of the TSSR totaled 143.1 km2. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The population was estimated at 4,807,000 people. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The republic was formed in 1924, entered the USSR at the end of the 29th. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">TSSR was established in Southeast Asian lands. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Indian borders are only 15 kilometers from here. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">TSSR bordered on western Chinese territories and Afghanistan.</font></font></p><p> A distinctive feature of this area is a complex and diverse climate, relief.  The plains have a dry subtropical climate, and in the highest zones of the Pamirs - polar.  The north of the country covered the Ferghana Valley.  The highest population density in TASS was recorded in the western and northern regions, where valley arid areas have an irrigation system of canals.  Numerous oases were decorated with beautiful flowerbeds, cotton was green in the fields, and rice was grown.  The mountain slopes in the TSSR were partially bare and completely unsuitable for management, but some were overgrown with pistachio and juniper forests - this is characteristic of a temperate climatic zone.  In such an area, bread grows that does not need to be watered, and you can also engage in animal husbandry.  In the TSSR, the most popular direction was the breeding of Hissar sheep. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikiwand.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dushanbe city of Tajik SSR" class="if uuid-2948195" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47518/2948195.jpg"></div><p>  The Pamir highlands are covered with eternal snow.  Large glaciers are formed here, from which pure turbulent mountain rivers flow.  The highest peaks of the TSSR were named after the Soviet leaders - Stalin and Lenin.  The valley areas of the country are sunny, and the mountains close these edges from a strong cold wind.  It‚Äôs rather hot in the warm season, and warm in the winter.  For centuries, the population built canals in order to provide moisture to the land, and during the Soviet period, Tajiks received rich crops of fruit, rice and cotton.  For a long time, Tajikistan was a rather poor country due to the oppression of the ruling class - and it was precisely the efforts of the soviets that were directed to combat it. </p>
