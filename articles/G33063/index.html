After landing in the air harbor, the path to the hotel will take you a little more than an hour.  A very important factor when choosing a place of residence in Turkey is the proximity of the sea.

    <h2>  Posting Rules </h2><p>  As in most other hotel complexes around the world, the Palmie Garden has a set time for check-in and check-out.  So, settling of the staying tourists here is carried out starting from two in the afternoon, and to leave the room on the day of departure should be before noon.  However, if you arrived at the hotel much earlier, the administration will do everything possible to make you check in as quickly as possible.  But during the "high season" sometimes situations arise when previous guests have not yet had time to vacate the room, and accordingly, the maids could not prepare it properly for arrival.  In this case, you will be offered to leave bulky things for storage in the luggage room and stroll around the Palmiye Garden Hotel, take a refreshing dip in the pool, have a bite to eat in the restaurant, or go straight to the nearest beach. </p><div id="sjcont"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On the day of departure, upon delivery of the keys to the reception you will also need to pay for the stay.  If you booked a tour through a travel agency and already paid the full cost of the accommodation, then in the hotel you only have to pay for the additional services provided, if you used them.  As for accommodation with children, the hotel only welcomes guests with children of different ages.  If you are used to going on a trip in the company of a four-legged friend, then you should contact the administration in advance about the possibility of placing it in the hotel. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews of tourists about the hotel "Palmie Garden" </h2><p>  Since the vast majority of travelers choose a hotel for rest, based not only on its description, but also on the comments of people who have already visited it, we have summarized the reviews of our compatriots staying this summer at Palmiye Garden Hotel 3 * (Side).  In general, we can say that most tourists liked the hotel.  In their opinion, it is consistent with both its stated description and cost.  Now we offer to understand the details in more detail. </p><p>  As for the rooms, most travelers did not show any dissatisfaction with the accommodation.  However, some tourists were unhappy with the poor quality of cleaning the bathroom, poor lighting, and noise.  The hotel area seemed to tourists a bit small.  However, those who came to rest with the children did not complain, since their babies were always in sight. </p><p>  Now let's focus on the issue of nutrition.  In general, most tourists had no complaints about the quality of the food.  Of course, the assortment of dishes was not very diverse, but this situation is quite normal for a three-star hotel.  The main thing is that everything here was quite tasty and edible, so that no one was left hungry.  The only thing that confused some of our compatriots a bit was that the dishes in the restaurant were not always clean.  However, guests could always replace plates or glasses with clean ones.  Another drawback on which some vacationers drew attention in their comments was the very meager lunch boxes that could be taken at the hotel if you went on an excursion early in the morning.  So, according to travelers, it is simply impossible for an adult to eat such a breakfast. </p><p>  As for the beach, then, as stated in the description, it is several hundred meters distant from Palmiye Garden Hotel 3 * (Turkey).  At the same time, it is necessary to cross a rather busy roadway along the way.  In general, the road to the beach will take you no more than a quarter of an hour.  But here you will have to go back longer, as you will need to climb a rather steep hill, which may not always be pleasant and comfortable after a day on the beach.  The beach itself is quite clean and well equipped. </p><p>  Some vacationers were a little disappointed with the entertainment offered.  So, some of them complained about the lack of animation and discos.  As for the animation for children, every night there was a mini-disco, which both the young guests of the hotel and their parents were quite satisfied with. </p><p>  The rather contradictory comments of our compatriots concern the administrators of the Palmie Garden Hotel (Side, Turkey).  So, some travelers note a respectful and attentive attitude on their part, while some tourists claim that the workers allowed themselves an unacceptable and even boorish treatment towards them.  In particular, such incidents were related to complaints about noise in the room and requests to relocate guests to a quieter room. </p><p>  To summarize, it can be noted that many tourists were pleased with their choice of hotel.  So, in their opinion, the three-star hotel complex ‚ÄúPalmie Garden‚Äù in Side (Turkey) has the best combination of price and quality.  Our compatriots do not exclude their return to this hotel and are ready to recommend it to their friends and relatives as a good option for a budget holiday on the coast of the Republic of Turkey. </p>
