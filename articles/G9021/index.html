    <h2>  A bit of geography </h2><p>  Maldives is a tiny state located on an archipelago in the middle of the Indian Ocean.

The islands are surrounded by coral reefs, densely populated by marine inhabitants, and beautiful lagoons.  No wonder divers come here from all over the world. </p><p>  The population is about 400 thousand people, lives on 200 islands.  Another 44 are equipped to accommodate tourists.  The rest are uninhabited and await their Robinson Crusoe.  The capital became the island of Male, whose area is only 5.8 square meters.  km  Nevertheless, more than 55 thousand people live here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Weather in the Maldives in October </h2><p>  According to the popular calendar, October is divided into three periods.

    <p>  Tourists, however, are not deterred by the weather in the Maldives in October.  Reviews indicate that one way or another everything fell under the rains.  Most often they go at night, but also happen during the day.  Strong short showers predominate.  In an hour you can swim.  Only the most unlucky ones managed to observe the prolonged drizzling rain, which lasted for a day. </p><p>  The water temperature is comfortable.  In the afternoon there is a heat in the region of 28-30 degrees.  A refreshing breeze from the sea comes in handy.  After rains, when the air is saturated with moisture, it becomes stuffy.  At night, the temperature drops to 24-25 degrees. </p><h2>  Tours to the Maldives in October </h2><p>  The main advantage of traveling to these <span>paradise islands</span> in the fall is the price, reduced by 1.5 times.  Moreover, there is no such influx of people as from December to March.  Tourists are happy with their vacation in the Maldives in October.  Reviews prove that this time is great for sunbathing, swimming, surfing, fishing and excursions to the islands of paradise. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The only thing that can stop you is high humidity.  It is contraindicated in people with diseases of the heart, lungs, bronchi.  Rain can be stuffy.  This may not be suitable for older people.  The rest will easily suffer rapid rains, after which the beach dries out in a few minutes.  In addition, at this time, the Maldives will delight you with exuberant flowering and affordable housing prices, wellness programs, excursions. </p><h2>  The most economical tips </h2><p>  Maldives is an expensive destination.  Luxury bungalows on the beach, not everyone can afford.  The budget option is the island of Maafushi, where you can stay in a cheap hotel.  It is located near Male, so you can save more on transfer.  The main disadvantage of the island is the small beach.  Some tourists are also alarmed by the proximity to the prison located on the island, although this does not affect the quality of the rest. </p><p>  The second available option is a guest house on the island of Todd.  Here you will have at your disposal a large beach with beautiful landscapes.  Maldives in October will please you with good fishing, exotic plants and animals.  Toddu beaches have gently sloping water entrances.  Tourists, however, note the inconvenient location of the island.  It will take a long time to get from it to Male, and this can fly into a pretty penny. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The cheapest option is an independent trip.  Some tourists, without the help of agencies, book tickets for shares, rent a room with local residents, eat in shops or local cafes.  Such a vacation "savage" sometimes comes out much more interesting and varied than lazy sunbathing on a fashionable beach.  But first-class service, of course, you will not have to wait. </p>

    <h2>  Beach holiday </h2><p>  The Maldives in October is quite suitable for swimming.  Water warms up to 29 degrees and resembles fresh milk.  The tan goes perfectly, just do not forget to use sunscreen.  For a change, you can play tennis or volleyball, ride a catamaran. </p><p>  Experienced tourists are advised to take an umbrella to the beach.  Rains in October still happen and start completely unexpectedly.  Suddenly a cloud rushes, streams of warm water spill from the sky, and after a short time the sun shines brightly again and the sea rustles.  Sand dries quickly, but only on top.  Therefore, after rain it is better to sit on a deck chair. </p><h2>  Leisure </h2><p>  For those who can not lie for a long time under the bright sun, the locals will offer a lot of entertainment.  A popular activity here is parasailing or parachuting above the water surface.  Exciting experiences can be enjoyed after water skiing and kayaking. </p>

    <p>  Surfers love this time.  Holidays in the Maldives in October - the last opportunity to ride a high wave (up to 6 pounds).  At this time, the winds still blow, but literally in a month they will die down.  Travelers will also be able to test their strengths in windsurfing. </p><p>  But for diving and snorkeling, this is not the best time.  There is too much plankton in the ocean, which makes the water cloudy and visibility is much worse.  True, some tourists say that plankton attracts large inhabitants.  In October, you can shoot a whale shark or stingray, which rarely happens in other seasons.  However, most divers come here from January to April, when the sea is calm and well visible. </p><h2>  Excursions and Cruises </h2><p>  Coral reefs, pristine lagoons, a riot of colors and greenery await you in the Maldives in October.  Reviews of tourists say that the most popular excursions are trips to uninhabited islands.  They are generously scattered across the territory of the state and attract to themselves, promising privacy and romance in the midst of magnificent nature. </p>

    <p>  Fishermen, of course, will prefer hunting for trophy specimens from the yacht.  The catch will be prepared right here or in the restaurant upon returning to land.  Larger fish await lovers of larger sensations, namely sharks and stingrays.  They are accustomed to sail at a specific time for feeding.  Tourists throw sharks pieces of fish.  Stingrays swim to the shore, you can enter the water into them, put food directly in your mouth, stroke. </p><p>  Unforgettable impressions remain with tourists from flying on a seaplane.  It is expensive, but worth it.  There are several options to choose from.  You can just take a bird's eye view of your island.  A more interesting offer is flights over distant atolls with stops in interesting places.  Typically, the program includes a visit to a fishing village, lunch on a desert island, scuba diving. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  There are not many of them in the Maldives.  The main ones are located in the capital Male.  Many tourists are surprised by this city, which has more bicycles than cars.  You can get around it in an hour.  Be sure to look at the mosque with a golden dome, located in the Islamic center.  Also of interest are the Sultan Park, in which the National Museum, the Friday Mosque is located, near it are the burial places of members of the royal family and national heroes. </p>

    <p>  But the most attractive in the capital is the most beautiful landscapes that open from the embankments.  You can feel the <span>local flavor</span> in the markets: fish, fruit, and vegetable.  There are special gastronomic excursions when, together with a guide, you choose the best products.  Then you are invited to a hospitable house of local residents, where a traditional dinner is prepared together from the purchased ingredients.  Usually these are snacks, as well as fish and rice. </p><p>  In October, the Maldives attract tourists with reduced prices, high waves, the hot sun and beautiful views.
