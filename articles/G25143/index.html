The one that the classics wrote about?  A cozy living room where guests can sit and leaf through newspapers and where tea is served at exactly five in the afternoon ... Guest rooms with all the comforts ... A homely atmosphere where the hostess in the morning wonders how you slept and can advise where to go on an excursion ... I would like so that such a guesthouse is not located on a noisy avenue, but on a quiet street like Baker Street.  All or almost all of our dreams of a European guesthouse can be found in the Europa Pension 3 * hotel <span>(Czech Republic, Prague).</span>  We will tell you about this small hotel with the heart of a birthplace in this article.  Earlier, four years ago, only two stars adorned its facade.  But now there was a repair, the rooms were enriched with new stylish furniture and sanitary ware.  But this absolutely did not take anything from the atmosphere of an old mansion.  Hotel rating was previously 4.2, and now - 4.4 (out of five possible), which indicates an improvement in hotel service. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pension Europa 3 (Prague)" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2098857.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Where is the guesthouse located </h2><p>  When booking tours to Prague from Moscow, pay attention to Pension Europa 3 *.  Don‚Äôt be afraid that the hotel looks like a rural hotel on the back of the map of the city.  After all, the Czech capital has one feature: wealthy people prefer the areas of rich villas, which have a large area and a beautiful garden or a spacious green lawn.  Have you dreamed about a neighborhood like Baker Street?  Prague-8 differs from its London counterpart except in a more pleasant southern climate, without fogs and English spleen.  And far from the center, it looks only on the map, or if you intend to walk everywhere. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>Public transport in Prague</span> runs like clockwork.  A bus stop is a five-minute walk away.  Three routes follow to the metro station - Nos. 145, 152 and 183. The third is preferable, it goes straight.  Having descended underground at the Kobylisy metro station, get into the car on branch C (marked in red in the diagram).  Ten minutes later you will be in the center.  You need to leave at the metro station "Museum".  According to reviews, the entire journey from the hotel to the center will take a maximum of twenty minutes.  The Prague 8 area is not at all a backyard or a sleeping area.  Within walking distance you will find a supermarket, pharmacy, post office and an extensive sports center.  Bus number 152 takes you to the water park with slides, swimming pools and saunas in five minutes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Europa Pension 3 czech republic prague" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2098829.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  How to get to the hotel </h2><p>  For package travelers who booked tours to Prague from Moscow, the transfer is included in the price of the ticket.  Airport them.  Vaclav Havel is twenty kilometers away.  If you have to get to the hotel on your own, you need to take bus number 119 and get there to the nearest metro station.  This is N√°dra≈æ√≠ Veleslav√≠n (green line A).  At the Museum you should transfer to the red branch C and go on it to Kobylisy.  Having reached the surface of the earth, you need to take one of the three bus routes that we mentioned above and get off at the S√≠dli≈°tƒõ ƒåimice stop.  Now it's up to the small: find K vƒõtrolamu street and house number 22 on it.  It is much easier to get to the hotel from the train and bus stations.  They are connected to the center by the red subway line, so you just need to make a transfer at the Museum Museum.  For those who come to Prague by car, let's say that the journey from the hotel to the center will take (excluding traffic jams) about fifteen minutes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pension Europe" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2098828.jpg"></div>

The name of the hotel can be seen on the wall of a three-story building, and on a sign glowing in the evening at the gate.  After passing it, you find yourself in a small courtyard, rather, a front garden with evergreen shrubs and a green lawn.  Everywhere there are many flowers: both planted in the flowerbed, and in pots on the windows.  Over the entrance to the house flutter the flags of those powers whose subjects are currently visiting the guesthouse.  You will not find any reception (on Baker Street it was not there either).  You will be greeted by a welcoming hostess and escorted to your room.  On the ground floor there is a living room, which in the morning turns into a breakfast room.  If you are in a car, the hostess will unlock the gate, and you can park your iron horse in a guarded parking lot.  Guest rooms are located on the upper two floors of the building. </p><h2>  Pension Europa 3 *: room description </h2><p>  This hotel is family run.  It is controlled by a mistress from Russia.  Therefore, guests from the Russian Federation will not feel any discrimination here compared to other guests.  There are only twenty one rooms.  This allows all the attendants to know you by sight and name on the second day, and on the third - to be well-versed in your life interests and food preferences.  There is no classification in the available rooms.  They differ among themselves only in area and, accordingly, in capacity.  There are rooms designed for one guest, two and three.  All rooms are equipped with brand new furniture.  The bedrooms have a safe, fridge and TV.  Throughout the hotel Pension Europa 3 * (Prague) operates free and fast Wi-Fi.  Each room has its own bathroom.  It has a shower cabin.  A hairdryer, as well as an iron with an ironing board, and utensils are available for use upon request.  All guest rooms are individually decorated and very stylish.  The atmosphere of home comfort and silence reign in them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pension Europa 3 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2098825.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Pension Europa 3 *: service </h2><p>  They clean the rooms every day.  According to reviews, the rooms are very clean and tidy.  Sheets are changed once a week.  The hotel staff speaks Russian and can explain to you all the subtleties of life in Prague.  For example, which public transport ticket to buy, which restaurants or cafes to go to, which museums or interesting places to visit.  By the way, excursions can be ordered directly from the hostess herself.  Laundry facilities are also available.  There is a hotel Pension Europa 3 * (Prague) and office equipment with which you can send a fax, print, scan or print documents.  If for some reason you do not want to go into the common breakfast room, a tray of food will be delivered to your room upon your request.  And if you are leaving early on an excursion, you will be given a packed lunch with you in the evening.  Fast wireless internet is available throughout the guesthouse. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pension Europa 3 service" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2098822.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Breakfast </h2><p>  The room rate at the Pension Europa 3 * hotel (Prague) includes a morning meal.  The property itself characterizes it as an extended continental breakfast.  What does this mean in practice, pass reviews.  Guests of the guest house go down to the first floor, where in the corner of the living room on a separate table they will be treated to refreshments.  <span>Continental breakfast</span> at other hotels includes tea, coffee, a croissant, bread and a slice of butter.  In this case, we have an extended version of the meal.  Sliced ‚Äã‚Äãsausages, cheese, seasonal fresh vegetables, as well as boiled eggs, pastes, cookies and cereals or cereal with milk are added to these products.  All this is exhibited in sufficient quantity - boarders can take their own products as much as they like.  Reviews say that no one has gone hungry since breakfast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Prague 8" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2098835.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  The hostess of the Europa Pension 3 * hotel (Prague) is directly connected with travel agencies.  Therefore, with questions about what to see in the Czech capital and the surrounding area, it is better to contact her.  She will be able to organize exciting city tours for you.  Reviews praise the Mystical Prague tour, a visit to Vysehrad and the Jewish quarter, a boat trip on the Vltava River.  The hostess can also arrange bus tours of the <span>Czech castles.</span>  These are fascinating and informative trips to Konopiste, Karlstein, Orlik, Sykhrov, <span>Kutnu Gora,</span> Sternberk, Kostnitsa and other interesting places.  But that is not all.  Prague is located not so far from the German federal state of Bavaria.  Therefore, such beautiful castles as Hohenschwangau and Neuschwanstein are available to you.  There are many nature reserves in the Czech Republic, and you can visit them with the help of the tour desk located in the Europa Guesthouse. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tours to Prague from Moscow" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2098850.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Prices </h2><p>  All reviews about Pension Europa <span>3 * (Czech Republic, Prague)</span> claim that this is the best value for money among all hotels in the capital.  Low prices and high quality services attract tourists here, so often all rooms are full.  Prices depend not only on the room (and, as we recall, they are single, double and triple), but also on the season.  The low period is the time from January 4 to April 1 and from November 1 to December 24.  This season, room rates are CZK 600, 900 and 1100 (1580, 2350 and 2900 rubles, respectively).  In the middle period, they increase slightly.  So, a single room costs 750 crowns (1980 rubles) per night, and rooms of larger capacity - 1100 (2900 rubles) and 1350 (3570 rubles).  The average season is the longest.  It includes the period from April 2 to October 31, excluding the May holidays.  They belong to the high season, as well as the period of Christmas and New Year (from December 24 to January 3).  Then the prices in the hotel (and in most hotels in Prague) soar.  A single room costs 950 (2500 rubles), a double room costs 1500 (3950 rubles), and a room for three guests costs 1800 Czech crowns (or 4750 rubles). </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  All tourists note the warm home atmosphere that prevails in Pension Europa 3 *.  Reviews mention that guests are given two keys: one from the room, and the second from the house.  You can leave and come when you like.  Many tourists claim that they have revised their views on what a sleeping area of ‚Äã‚ÄãPrague is far from the center.  It turns out that you can live in a quiet street, consisting of rich villas, and in 15-20 minutes find yourself in the very center of the Czech capital, while using the services of not regular taxis, but regular public transport.  Near the hotel there is a supermarket and several cafes, so you can have dinner nearby.  Many tourists claim that they would happily stay here again. </p>
