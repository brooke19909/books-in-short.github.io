Colorful and colorful, it captivates with a magical atmosphere and gives an unforgettable experience.  Each of its resorts is unique, because here all the time something interesting happens.  One thing remains unchanged - amazing landscapes and unique architecture.  It seems like a country filled with bright colors is specially created for tourism. </p><h2>  Fashionable resort with well-kept beaches </h2><p>  A small resort founded by the Phoenicians, is located in the province of Malaga, in the Costa del Sol region, Spain.  Fuengirola is a typical Andalusian town, which differs from the rest by a wide strip of sandy beaches, awarded with a prestigious international award. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="36.544148" data-lng="-4.624943900000062" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/0/3/2/9/10329.png"></div><p>  The former fishing village of Fuengirola, which has turned into a prestigious holiday destination, has a unique charm.  One of the most visited corners of the south of Spain is perfect for families, and it is no coincidence that tourists traveling with small children are regular guests of the resort. </p><h2>  Colorful city </h2><p>  The original Fuengirola in Spain is a small town that can be reached on foot in just a few hours.  Here lived the Carthaginians, Byzantines, Arabs, and only in the middle of the XV century the settlement was annexed to the Castilian crown. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.trover.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Fuengirola, Spain" class="if uuid-2907021" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2907021.jpg"></div><p>  The most interesting place of the city is its historical center, where you can instantly get into past eras.  This part of the popular resort has retained its authenticity, and tourists love to stroll through the narrow streets with small, pretty houses. </p><h2>  The lively promenade and its highlights </h2><p>  Along the coast runs the busiest place in a calm town - Paseo Maritimo promenade, completely given to tourists.  There are many restaurants, small fashion shops, modern shopping centers, souvenir shops, night discos and bars. </p><p>  On the seafront of Fuengirola in Spain, there is a monument to the patroness of sailors - Virgen del Carmen.  In addition, tourists are attracted by another art object - a sculpture of a huge bull, which is best viewed from the water.  The unique steel plate construction reminds us that bullfighting is a symbol of the country.  The work of unknown authors, according to holidaymakers, doesn‚Äôt look as presentable near as it does from afar.  Most often, they come to a rusted structure with many mounts in the evening, when all the flaws are erased and spectacular pictures are obtained. </p><p>  There is also a monument to a small monetary unit, which is withdrawn from circulation - peseta.  Near an unusual composition, tourists take pictures for memory. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="pxhere.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to Coin Peseta" class="if uuid-2907018" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2907018.jpg"></div><p>  And in the middle of the promenade, which stretches for 4 kilometers, is a picturesque port, where travelers are sure to drop by.  This is a modern transport hub, which managed to preserve its historical features. </p><h2>  Castle </h2><p>  The main attraction of the resort is the ancient Castillo Sohail castle, made in the Moorish style.  Appearing during the reign of the Arabs, he survived many enemy attacks.  The fortress, located in an important strategic place, was repeatedly rebuilt.  Now Soail Castle, more reminiscent of a powerful citadel, is a hallmark of Fuengirola, Spain. </p><div class="photo" data-original="clraven.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Old castle" class="if uuid-2906863" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2906863.jpg"></div><p>  The symbol of the city, bought by the city authorities, is located at an altitude of 125 meters above sea level.  It has become a viewing platform from where you can admire the enchanting views of the mountain range.  In the renovated castle, open-air celebrations and festivals take place annually. </p><h2>  Local zoo </h2><p>  At the exit of Fuengirola, the sights of which will not let anyone get bored, there is a curious biopark decorated in the style of a virgin jungle.  It raises rare animals and studies the ecosystem of the rainforest. </p><p>  The local zoo, built 8 years ago, will surprise both children and adults.  All its inhabitants live in the wild. </p><h2>  Beach holidays in Spain in October </h2><p>  It is not surprising that the Russians, whose vacation falls on wet and cold October, tend to spend it where it is warm and you can sunbathe.  Often, our compatriots choose a vacation on the Mediterranean Sea, because in some Spanish provinces the fertile season begins - the velvet season. </p><p>  On the beaches of many resorts, swimming in October will not bring any pleasure.  But in the south of the country, on the Costa del Sol, whose name is no coincidence translated as "sunny beach", you can turn back the clock.  Daytime air temperature is 25 <sup>o</sup> C, and the sea - 21 <sup>o</sup> C. </p><p>  Autumn is the perfect time to relax.  The beach season is still open, and along with the heat, the flow of tourists also subsides, which allows you to leisurely get acquainted with local attractions, and not just take sun baths. </p><h2>  The best beaches in the country </h2><p>  Hospitable Fuengirola (Spain) attracts tourists with a favorable beach holiday climate.  The majestic Sierra de Mijas mountains protect the paradise from the cool winds, so you can swim in the waters of the Mediterranean Sea even in autumn.  The coast stretches along the resort for 8 kilometers, and the width of the seven beaches recognized as the best in the country is 50 meters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="losbakerstreet.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The best beaches in Spain" class="if uuid-2906851" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2906851.jpg"></div><p>  The coastline is divided into two parts by the city port.  All beaches, which are equipped with sun loungers and umbrellas, have a gentle entrance to the sea, a sandy bottom and the absence of rocky areas.  And each of them boasts well-groomed and clean. </p>
