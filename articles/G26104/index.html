    <p>  But, despite the fact that this country is one of the most popular for travel, Sarygerme is still little known to domestic tourists.  And completely in vain.  This is a tiny settlement in which the one and only central street turns into a place where many tourists gather in the evenings.  Despite its modest size, this former fishing village attracts tourists with souvenir stalls and shops, traditional cafes and restaurants. </p><p>  And although inveterate party-goers, judging by the reviews, it can be boring, for those who crave peace, silence and enjoy the unspoiled beauty of the local nature, there will be a real paradise, since they cannot find a better place to relax in body and soul. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The One Club Hotel 4 reviews" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/584152.jpg" width="600"></div>
