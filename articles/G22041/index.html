    <p>  Speaking of the Soviet Union, it must be pointed out that this was a rather difficult period in the history of the state.  That is why the reasons for its split are so diverse. </p><p>  But still, why did the <span>collapse of the USSR</span> and the formation of the CIS take place?  This was facilitated by many of the following events: </p><p>  1. The social and economic crisis, as a result of which there was a gap in economic ties between the republics, national conflicts arose, which contributed to the destruction of the Soviet system. </p><p>  So, in 1988, the Baltic States, Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia are heading for the exit from the Soviet Union.  In the same year, the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict begins.  And in 1990, all republics declared sovereignty. </p><p>  2. The collapse of the CPSU, which served as the reason for the creation of a multi-party system in 90-91, in turn, the current parties proposed the dissolution of the Union. </p><p>  The collapse of the USSR and the formation of the CIS also occurred due to the fact that the union center, not having the strength to hold power in a democratic way, uses military force (in Tbilisi, Baku, Riga, Vilnius and Moscow, as well as in Dushanbe, Fergana, etc.).  All these events also contributed to the threat of creating another Union Treaty, the development of which took place in Novo-Ogaryovo by representatives of the republics. </p><p>  The discussion of the agreement ended with a vote, as a result of which the majority of those present supported the preservation of the Soviet Union.  The new project foresaw the collapse of the <span>Soviet Union</span> and the creation of the GCC, that is, equal sovereign republics.  The signing of the treaty was scheduled for August 20, 1991, but many republics refused to do this and reported the creation of independent states. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A lot of people who at that time held high official positions in the Soviet Union advised L. Gorbachev to establish a <span>state of emergency</span> in the country, but he refused.  Most of the government leadership made an attempt to seize power, it did not allow the collapse of the USSR and the formation of the CIS.  However, the coup attempt failed because the masses defended their political freedoms. </p><p>  This fact contributed to accelerating the split of the Union, Gorbachev lost credibility, and Yeltsin gained popularity.  Soon, eight republics declared their independence. </p><p>  Already on December 8, the Union Treaty ceased to exist, while Ukraine, Belarus and Russia in the course of negotiations agreed on the creation of the CIS, and subsequently they invited other states to join the Commonwealth. </p><p>  The collapse of the USSR and the formation of the CIS opened up new opportunities for the former republics.  Many agreements were signed between <span>independent states</span> (on collective security, on regulating integration in various fields, on cooperation and partnership, on creating a single financial space).  Thus, over the entire period of the existence of the CIS, more than nine hundred <span>normative legal acts</span> have been signed with regard to defense, security, open borders and more. </p><p>  If we consider the consequences of the collapse of the USSR, the following should be noted: </p><p>  1. The world has become one economic, political and information system. </p><p>  2. A large number of new states appeared, as well as republics that had fought fierce wars among themselves earlier. </p><p>  3. The USA and <span>NATO countries</span> begin cooperation with the former republics. </p><p>  Thus, the fall of the Soviet Union had a number of reasons, it was inevitable.  Subsequently, instead of republics, independent states appeared with their own economy, politics, culture and living standards.  Although there are negative consequences of the formation of the <span>Commonwealth of Independent States,</span> in general, the expression of the will of the masses has been heard and achieved. </p>
