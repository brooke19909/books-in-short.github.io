It is them we call for help when our lives are in danger.  The salary of police officers in Russia depends on many factors that take into account the specifics of the job, the rank of the employee and his professional achievements.  Consider what kind of monetary reward Russian police receive for their hard work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.odt.co.nz" data-author=": Reuters, "><img itemprop="image" alt="policeman salary in moscow 2018" class="if uuid-2932083" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18963/2932083.jpg"></div><h2>  Law Enforcement Advocates </h2><p>  The police are part of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs system.  In the country, it acts to ensure public order.  The Russian police protect citizens from offenders of the law, ensuring their safe stay in the state.  She also fights crime and prevents crime. </p><p>  The police is a body of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, managed by the president of the country.  The structure of the <span>Ministry of the Interior</span> provides for the position of Minister, who runs the entire service. </p><p>  Police officer - an employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, carrying out his activities on the basis of an employment contract or contract.  Police salaries in Moscow are considered the highest.  In fact, its size may vary significantly among employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.  Monthly monetary compensation depends on the functions performed, work experience and position held. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Before answering the question: ‚ÄúWhat is the average salary of a policeman in Moscow?‚Äù, We briefly define the main functions of the police. </p><ol><li>  Acceptance of applications (statements) of citizens about offenses and crimes. </li><li>  Consideration of citizens' appeals. </li><li>  The adoption of measures taken from the public appeals, statements and notifications. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.rferl.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="salary of a policeman in Moscow in 2018" class="if uuid-2932085" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18963/2932085.jpg"></div><h2>  How to become a policeman? </h2><p>  Citizens of the Russian Federation (boys and girls) aged 18 to 35 years can apply for this position.  They should not have health problems.  With regard to qualification requirements, for some posts it is sufficient to have a full secondary education.  But in order to become part of the senior or senior management team, you must have a diploma of higher profile education. </p><p>  Many try to get into service in the Russian capital.  And this is understandable, because the salary of police officers in Moscow is the highest in comparison with other regions of the country.  But it will not be able to earn candidates who have convicted relatives in the family, or have recorded a personal criminal record in the past or repeatedly brought to administrative responsibility.  Such people simply will not be hired by the Ministry of Internal Affairs.  A person who has his own business and who is not ready to keep state secrets will not be able to serve in the police. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Future law enforcement advocates are testing.  Check not only their physical fitness, but also emotional stability.  Upon successful completion of all stages of testing, the candidate for the police is accepted for an internship that lasts from three to six months.  And only after this the employee is certified and enlisted in the staff of the Ministry of Internal Affairs with the assignment of a certain rank. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rbth.com" data-author=": Eugene Odinokov/RIA Novosti, "><img itemprop="image" alt="average salary of a policeman in Moscow" class="if uuid-2932087" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18963/2932087.jpg"></div><h2>  What does the salary depend on? </h2><p>  The salary of a policeman has several components.  Total monthly income includes: </p><ol><li>  Tariff salary. </li><li>  A bonus for an existing title. </li><li>  Extra charge for length of service. </li><li>  A coefficient that depends on the region of service. </li><li>  A bonus for complexity, work stress. </li><li>  Surcharge for irregular schedule. </li></ol><p>  The salary of a policeman in Moscow is formed in the same way as that of a military man.  But the latter - the monthly income is often higher than that of an employee of law enforcement agencies. </p><h2>  How much do employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Moscow receive? </h2><p>  Statistical data for 2016‚Äì2017  <span>salaries</span> did not add prestige to this profession.  This year the situation has become better.  The average police salary in Russia in 2018 increased to 40,000 rubles.  In previous years, this figure was at the level of 25,000‚Äì35,000 rubles per month. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The highest income remains with the capital's employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.  The salary of a policeman in Moscow (2018) varies from 45,000 to 50,000 rubles.  This is taking into account the increasing coefficient - 35%.  And even this amount does not add the prestige of the profession of a policeman.  If we compare the average Russian salary (32,000 rubles) with the monthly income of a law enforcement defender, the latter can hardly be called worthy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dailydot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="police salary in Russia" class="if uuid-2932113" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18963/2932113.jpg"></div><h2>  Remuneration by region of Russia </h2><p>  Work in the Ministry of Internal Affairs is complicated.  It seems to many that the police are not performing their duties properly, and therefore their income cannot be high.  In fact, the policeman‚Äôs work has many difficult aspects: from night shifts to the risk of spoiled health or death. </p><p>  The salary of police officers in Russia by region differs from the same indicator in Moscow: </p><ol><li>  In Vladivostok, law enforcement officers receive about 40,000 rubles every month. </li><li>  In Smolensk, police are paid about 27,000 rubles. </li><li>  In Krasnodar, you can earn 22,000 rubles. </li><li>  The authorities of Kuznetsk are ready to pay law enforcement defenders 19,000 rubles a month. </li><li>  In Ufa, the salary ratio is 18,000 rubles. </li><li>  In Khabarovsk, a policeman receives a monthly salary of 10,000 rubles. </li></ol><p>  But this does not mean that having started work, the policeman will immediately begin to receive the indicated monetary reward.  A decent salary will be established by a candidate for the staff of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, if he has the appropriate education, good physical data and titles remaining from his previous job. </p><h2>  Salary by rank </h2><p>  One of the honorable professions is the work of an investigator of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.  In the Russian capital, a person employed in this position can earn up to 75,000 rubles a month.  If the investigator of the Ministry of Internal Affairs is listed in the state structure, then his income increases by approximately 20% every 5 years (depending on the level of inflation). </p><p>  On average, a national MVD investigator with 10 years of experience earns 47,000 rubles a month.  The largest level of income remains with staff involved in the fight against drugs. </p><p>  Consider how many bonuses earn the police depending on the rank: </p><ol><li>  The police general has an average monthly income of about 23,500 rubles. </li><li>  Major and captain receive from 12,000 to 13,000 rubles. </li><li>  The lieutenant‚Äôs earnings are 10,700 rubles per month (the oldest - 11,600 rubles, the youngest - 10,000 rubles). </li><li>  Warrant officers earn an average of 9,000 to 9,500 rubles (depending on rank). </li><li>  Senior sergeant can receive monthly income in the amount of 10,000 rubles;  sergeant - 7 500 rubles.  The salary of a police officer ‚Äúml sergeant‚Äù in Rosguard Moscow is 7,000 rubles per month. </li><li>  Ordinary employees receive an average of 5,500 rubles each month. </li></ol><p>  Colonels in different parts are rewarded with cash in the amount of 14,500 rubles per month. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.insidethegames.biz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="police salary in 2018 in russia latest news" class="if uuid-2932124" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18963/2932124.jpg"></div><h2>  Prospects </h2><p>  In the previous year, the Russian president spoke about the possibility of increasing the salary of police officers by 150% compared to the same period in 2012.  Such a perspective was foreseen for 2018.  Experts unanimously argued that increasing the income of employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs is possible if their composition is optimized (reducing the number of employees).  To check whether the order comes into force, having drawn the appropriate conclusions, you need to wait until the end of 2018.  Many analysts believe that the prospect of an increase in the salary for employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs will smoothly switch to 2019.  If the forecast comes true, then the salary of police officers in Moscow will increase significantly and become worthy. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the reform in the field of the Ministry of Internal Affairs has already begun.  At the beginning of the year, a number of benefits were introduced for police officers. </p><ul><li>  A queue has been allocated for free housing. </li><li>  Given the opportunity to receive expensive medical care free of charge. </li><li>  Additional vacation days are set (10). </li><li>  The opportunity to get permits in the sanatorium is provided for both police officers and their family members. </li></ul><h2>  Indexing </h2><p>  Police salaries continue to increase due to the existing indexing system.  These figures are necessarily agreed upon, and then approved by the Russian State Duma by vote.  As a rule, salaries are indexed, taking into account the rate of inflation.  According to statistics, in 2017, the indexation of salaries of employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs was carried out. </p><p>  So far, the salary of police officers in 2018 in Russia remains at the same level.  The latest news does not tell about the long-awaited increase in the income of employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.  But still ahead, because the program to increase the remuneration of police officers is still incomplete.  In any case, their salary will increase due to the annual increase in prices in the country. </p><p>  The government promised by the beginning of 2020 to index workers by at least 5%.  First of all, those who have decent work experience and special merits will be encouraged.  The indicator will also depend on the level of inflation.  With a good forecast, the indexation index can reach 8% in 2020. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.reddit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="police salary in Russia in 2018" class="if uuid-2932110" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18963/2932110.jpg"></div><h2>  How much do trainees get? </h2><p>  Police officers who have graduated from college and have just started work are considered interns.  In the first years of work, they undergo training because they do not have the proper experience.  Therefore, their income will be less than that of colleagues who have worked in the police for several years.  The average salary of an intern is 20,000‚Äì25,000 rubles per month. </p><p>  To become a senior assistant or an ordinary, you need to serve in the police a certain time.  Decent salary comes with work experience.  To get a title and a prestigious position, you need to make a lot of effort. </p><h2>  Police Pension </h2><p>  The salary of police officers in Moscow directly affects their future retirement.  And its size, in turn, depends on the following factors: </p><ol><li>  The salary established according to a post. </li><li>  Salary for special ranks. </li><li>  Work experience allowances. </li></ol><p>  The pension is calculated for the police on the basis of the actual salary, which was valid at the time of dismissal, taking into account the decreasing coefficient.  Since 2017 (October month) it is 66.78%. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dw.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="police salary in Russia by region" class="if uuid-2933797" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37876/2933797.jpg"></div><h2>  Foreign colleagues </h2><p>  The salary of a policeman in Moscow in 2018 is discussed above.  Find out how it differs from the salary of foreign colleagues.  American law enforcement officers boast the highest salaries, the level of which, unlike Russia, does not depend on experience and merit to the country.  The average salary of a policeman in the United States is 210,000-380,000 rubles per month (translated from the dollar equivalent).  US law enforcement officers have about $ 60,000 a year.  This figure may increase by the amount of bonuses and various allowances. </p><p>  In Germany, police also have a rather big income.  When transferred to Russian rubles, their average monthly salary is about 170,000. As you can see, the income of a Russian policeman is several times less than that of foreign colleagues.  And these statistics upset domestic law enforcement.  But if we compare their income with the average salary of working citizens of the Russian Federation, then we can say that they live well. </p>
