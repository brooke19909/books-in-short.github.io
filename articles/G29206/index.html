People are researchers by nature, and curiosity is the progress of civilization both in the technical concept and in the expansion of self-awareness.  The first man‚Äôs landing on the moon strengthened the belief that we are capable of interplanetary flights. </p><h2>  Earth satellite </h2><p>  The Russian name of the cosmic body "Moon" in translation from Proto-Slavic means "bright."  She is a natural satellite of our planet and its nearest celestial body.  The ability to reflect sunlight on the earth's surface makes the moon the second brightest object in the sky.  On the origin of the <span>cosmic body,</span> there are two opinions: the first says about the simultaneous occurrence with the Earth, the second says that the satellite formed in another place, but was subsequently captured by gravity. </p>

    <p>  The existence of a satellite provokes the appearance of special effects on our planet.  For example, by the force of its attraction, the Moon can control the water spaces <span>(ebbs and flows).</span>  Due to its size, it takes on part of meteor attacks, which to some extent protects the Earth. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Initial research </h2><p>  The first man‚Äôs landing on the moon is the result of American curiosity and the country's intention to overtake the USSR on the urgent issue of space exploration.  For many millennia, humanity has watched this celestial body.  The invention of the telescope by Galileo in 1609 made the visual method of studying the satellite more progressive and accurate.  More than one hundred years have passed since then, when people decided to send the first unmanned vehicle to the cosmic body.  And Russia was one of the first here.  On September 13, 1959, a robotic spacecraft landed in honor of the satellite landed on the surface of the moon. </p><p>  The year of the first man‚Äôs landing on the moon was 1969. Exactly 10 years later, American astronauts opened new horizons for the development of civilization.  Thanks to more detailed studies, interesting facts of the birth and structure of the satellite were discovered.  This, in turn, made it possible to change the hypothesis of the emergence of the Earth itself. </p><h2>  American expedition </h2><p>  The Apollo 11 spacecraft began its flight on July 16.  The crew consisted of three astronauts.  The purpose of the expedition was the first man to land on the moon.  The ship flew to the satellite for four days.  And already on July 20, the module sat on the territory of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãTranquility.  In the southwestern part of the region, the group stayed for a certain period of time: more than 20 hours.  The very presence of people on the surface lasted 2 hours 31 minutes.  On July 24, the crew returned to Earth, where they held it in quarantine for several days: astronauts never found lunar microorganisms. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The first to set foot on <span>lunar soil was</span> Neil Armstrong (commander of the ship), and Edwin Aldrin (pilot) came out a few minutes later.  Michael Collins (another pilot) was waiting for his colleagues in orbit.  The astronauts set the <span>American flag</span> and scientific equipment.  So, fixing every second, the first landing of people on the moon was made.  The release date is officially entered in the logbook and in historical chronicles of the whole world: this is known to everyone on June 21, 1969. </p><h2>  Neil Armstrong </h2><p>  In order for the story of the conquest of the moon to be complete, you need to familiarize yourself with brief biographies of its first researchers.  Let's start with the main character of this story - Neil Armstrong.  He had a great family: loving parents, younger sister and brother.  My father worked as an auditor: all members of the household traveled with him through the cities of the state.  Only in Wapakonete (Ohio) did they settle for a long time.  The boy studied well, was a top-ranking boy scout. </p>

    <p>  Armstrong's first profession is an Air Force test pilot, he participated in the war with Korea.  In 1958 he was enrolled in a group of space pilots.  As a commander, made his first flight on the ship "Gemini-8" in 1966.  Exits in outer space, except landing on the moon, did not have.  In 1970, he visited Russia as part of a NASA delegation.  From 1971 to 1979 he worked as a teacher.  He died after an unsuccessful bypass surgery in 2012. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Edwin Aldrin </h2><p>  It has a Scottish origin.  His father served in the US Army with the rank of officer.  The son followed in his footsteps and, abandoning higher education, entered the Military Academy.  The younger sister awarded Edwin the nickname Buzz, as she did not fully pronounce the word "brother." </p><p>  Aldrin graduated with the rank of lieutenant and was sent to the Korean War.  Then he flew a combat aircraft.  Upon returning from the front, he worked as an assistant to the dean of the Air Force Academy, then transferred to serve in the Space Flight Center. </p>

    <p>  In 1988 (as a pilot) he was sent on a near-orbit flight on the Jenimi-12.  On this expedition, Aldrin made his first spacewalk.  As part of the Apollo 11 team, he flew with the so-called moon mission.  It steps to the satellite‚Äôs surface 20 minutes after the commander and conducts historical surveys.  In 1971, his career at NASA ended. </p><p>  "The astronaut retired" ... This was a major shock to Edwin.  Some unofficial sources claim that Aldrin was promised a second visit to the satellite.  But he remained the "second" man on the moon.  This circumstance negatively affected the psyche of the former astronaut, as a result of which he began to drink and fell into depression.  Since 1970, he began to try himself as a writer.  He is the author of several books on <span>space exploration</span> and the conquest of the moon. </p><h2>  Michael Collins </h2><p>  Another important character of the "lunar" story.  The first flight with spacewalk was made by Michael in 1966 on the ship Dremini-10.  During the second expedition, it was he who was waiting for the astronauts on the command module.  The astronaut had an order: in case of failure, go down to the surface and record the event. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="first moon landing year" class="if" height="471" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38939/1129285.jpg" width="600"></div>  In addition, he was obliged to help the crew if they find themselves in a difficult situation.  But his main task was as follows: despite the circumstances, return the ship to Earth.  The name Crater of the Moon from the bright side is named after Michael Collins.

    <h2>  Termination of research </h2><p>  It is believed that flights to the satellite and its active study are now stopped, but this is not so.  After Armstrong‚Äôs landmark historic move, other Apollo descended to the moon.  Not all expeditions were successful, but fruitful enough for science and technology.  It is rumored that aliens are "bossing" on the moon now.  Back in 1972, in America, at a Senate meeting, there was even a report on interference in the space programs of extraterrestrial intelligent forces.  Until today, photographic materials have periodically leaked to the press, where strange lights are recorded on the dark side of the moon. </p><p>  But not aliens prevent people from exploring the cosmic body.  The most plausible version of the cessation of flights to the moon is the lack of funding.  The breakthrough of astronautics in the 70s of the last century occurred due to the race with the USSR.  After a certain victory on the American side, financial investments in the development of flights fell sharply.  The first man‚Äôs landing on the moon, the date of which was to be the beginning of a new ‚Äúcosmic‚Äù era, was its end: in fact, people lost their desire to conquer this celestial body.  An intrusive rumor that Armstrong and his team had never been on the moon and that this whole epic was just played skillfully played a role in the cessation of flights. </p><h2>  Lunar conspiracy </h2><p>  There is a theory that during the "race" with the USSR, all documentation about the landing was forged by the US government.  The beginning of the scandal is the book of American B. Keysing, which describes this possibility.  Although after the trial it turned out that the work was a natural response to the hype of rumors in the country. </p>

    <p>  There is some evidence to support the theory that the first man to land on the moon is <span>falsification</span> : </p><ul><li>  A survey conducted in 1976 by statistical residents of America. </li><li>  A video of the training actions of astronauts at the Earth base, which has a fantastic similarity to the video shot on the satellite. </li><li>  Modern image analysis using a photo editor, which revealed inaccurate shadow episodes. </li><li>  The <span>USA flag</span> itself <span>.</span>  Some scientists first expressed the idea that tissue cannot develop under conditions of lunar gravity due to the lack of wind. </li><li>  There are no stars in the photographs ‚Äúfrom the moon‚Äù. </li><li>  Edwin Aldrin refused to swear on the Bible that he went to the surface of a celestial body. </li></ul><p>  Landing supporters found natural explanations for all the charges.  For example, that retouching was used in photographs to improve the quality for publication, and the ripples on the flag were not from the wind, but from the actions of the astronaut <span>(damped oscillation),</span> which sets the flag.  The original record has not been preserved, which means that the fact of the first step on the Earth‚Äôs satellite will remain a controversial moment. </p><p>  In Russia there was an unpleasant incident in the year of the first people landing on the moon.  The government of the USSR did not consider it necessary to inform the inhabitants of the country about the American event.  Although the Russian ambassador was invited, he did not appear to launch Apollo 11.  The reason he called his business trip on important government matters. </p>
