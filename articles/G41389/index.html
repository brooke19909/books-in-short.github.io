    <h2>  The specifics of this Cuban hotel </h2><p>  When you do not have your own children, the presence of strangers is all the more undesirable.  Especially if you are in love or have recently married.  And you want to devote yourself entirely to your soul mate.  The hotel described by us is just designed for such vacationers.  In tourist avenues, he is listed as Melia Las Antillas Adults Only 16+ 4 *.  This means that only people over the age of sixteen are accepted into the hotel.  There are no children snooping around, especially their mothers, who scream that your kisses will shock her chaste child.  You can indulge in bliss in the pool, and the screaming gang of kids will not splatter nearby.  For newlyweds, the hotel provided compliments and various bonuses.  You can even have a wedding here!  Hammocks in the shade of palm trees, <span>panoramic elevators</span> and room service - how can a honeymoon be sweeter? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Melia Las Antillas 4 Varadero" class="if" height="285" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1459148.jpg" width="600"></div>

The territory of the hotel is compact, but very green.  Gardeners are trying their best, and wherever you look, you can see flower beds, flowering shrubs and palm trees.  The hotel was built in 1999. </p><p>  The hotel complex consists of one main five-story building and several villas.  Reviews of tourists were divided on where to live better.  Some newlyweds were offered rooms on the top floor of the building.  They liked the ocean views and the service with a romantic atmosphere.  Other newlyweds had a chance to live in a bungalow.  Also laudatory reviews: quiet, cozy, romantic.  Between the buildings there is a swimming pool with ponds and bridges.  And this quiet corner of paradise is located just nine kilometers from the center of Varadero and thirty-five from the international airport. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Melia Las Antillas 4 reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1459145.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Meals at Melia Las Antillas 4 * </h2><p>  This hotel is all inclusive.  And this is not easy in the communist "paradise", which is Cuba.  But tourists appreciated the skill of cooks who were able to create real masterpieces of culinary art from local and seasonal products.  Of course, exotic fruits grow in abundance in the tropical climate, and the local waters give wonderful fish and seafood.  But reviews speak of a variety of meat dishes.  At breakfast alone, there are at least twelve types of pastries!  So not only children should not go to this hotel.  It is dangerous to visit and dieters - the temptation to try everything is too great.  Breakfast, lunch and dinner are served at the Los Tainos main restaurant.  All meals in it are held in buffet style.  About food tourists leave only positive reviews.  You can always choose dishes to your liking.  The restaurant is kept clean, dishes are replenished quickly, and no queues arise (except for breakfast at pancakes). </p><h2>  Other restaurants and bars </h2><p>  Los Tainos is not the only catering establishment in the Melia Las Antillas 4 * hotel complex.  It has six bars and five restaurants.  The latter, unlike Los Tainos, operate in a <span>la carte</span> mode <span>,</span> with menu service.  These restaurants have their own specifics.  For example, Don Peperone offers visitors dishes of Italian cuisine, El Conuco - Caribbean, El Romantico - French.  Reviews highly recommend visiting a fish and seafood restaurant.  Between meals, you can treat yourself to light snacks, refreshing or, conversely, warming drinks.  From ten in the morning until five in the afternoon, the Dune and La Tortola bars operate on the beach and by the pool.  But with the onset of darkness, the fun does not end.  24 hours a day there are Las Casop bars with live music, El Mirador in the lobby, Ranshon, Fan Pub with karaoke.  Reviews say that in addition to the wonderful Cuban rum, you can also taste imported drinks, as well as good alcoholic cocktails. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cuba Hotel Melia Las Antillas 4" class="if" height="285" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1459151.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach and Pool </h2><p>  Melia Las Antillas 4 * (Varadero) is a first-line hotel.  So he has his own piece of the coast.  Reviews say that the sandy beach of the hotel is carefully guarded and cleaned.  The entrance to the sea is gentle, ideal for those who are poorly kept on the water.  Reviews say that during the season there are no waves and dangerous currents.  There are no jellyfish and burning plankton either.  Naturally, sun loungers, deck chairs, hammocks, umbrellas and sunshades are free for guests.  Tourists can not find agreement on the question of how many pools in the hotel.  Some reviews speak of two, others speak of one.  In fact, this is a huge curved swimming pool, consisting of two compartments.  It is filled with crystal clear fresh water that has passed the latest purification system.  There is also a jacuzzi in the hotel.  The use of the hot tub is also free.  Many reviews focus on beach activities.  All kinds of non-motorized sports (kayaking, windsurfing, pedal boats) are free.  You can even freely and without money take an introductory diving course. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  This hotel provides its guests with all the services that socialist Cuba can pamper with foreign tourists.  Hotel Melia Las Antillas 4 * fully meets the stated four stars.  And even more.  The hotel has not only daytime and evening animation (according to reviews, not bad), but also a small spa.  It features a sauna, hammam and massage treatments.  The hotel has free bike rental, two tennis courts, basketball courts, boccia, darts and a pool table.

    <h2>  Melia Las Antillas 4 *: reviews </h2><p>  This hotel is designed for honeymooners traveling to Cuba to spend their honeymoon (or at least ten days).  For such couples, the hotel provided all kinds of bonuses in the form of a superior room, a meeting with a bottle of champagne, etc. But there were tourists who celebrated the wedding anniversary at the hotel, as well as lovers who were just thinking about marriage.  They celebrate the romantic atmosphere in the hotel and its rooms, in the decoration of a la carte restaurants.  The hotel is visited by few Russian tourists, so knowledge of English or Spanish is necessary. </p>
