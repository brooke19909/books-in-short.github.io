    <h2>  Modern Internet Connection Approaches </h2><p>  The capabilities of the latest generation networks are quite large, and the service provider can offer the consumer a speed of up to 100 Mbps, but there are many conditions that do not allow you to achieve the desired speed.  One of the restrictions is the tariff plan set by your provider and chosen by you; it will not work to exceed its performance.  If you want to change it, you need to find out the possibility of supporting high-speed connections, both by your operator and the equipment that is used.  Currently, there are three main technologies for accessing the worldwide network.  The first is called dial up connection, it is the most outdated and is used less and less.  With such a connection, a dial-up approach to obtaining information is used, a telephone line and a modem are operated, while simultaneously performing two operations, i.e.  talking on the phone and using the internet is impossible.  <span>The maximum speed is</span> not more than 50 Kbps, it is impossible to get an <span>accelerated Internet connection</span> with this method. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Broadband access </h2><p>  The second method is most widely used and is called DSL, in other words, a telephone line is also used here.  However, the possibility of transmitting information is significantly increasing, since it uses broadband access, which significantly exceeds the capabilities of the dial-up approach.  DSL modems provide a completely digital exchange of content, while there is no need to convert analog-to-digital information, which improves the quality of communication.  With this type of connection, the dependence of the network on telephone calls disappears: the Internet and telephone communications exist independently of each other, which further enhances the convenience of this type of connection with the network. </p>

The most popular among users is a variation of this ADSL communication method.  At the same time, the speed of incoming traffic is higher than outgoing, which creates additional convenience for the user, the maximum speed of this connection is about 20 Mbit / s.

    <h2>  Optical fiber and its capabilities </h2><p>  The third way to gain access to the global network has appeared recently, but is already gaining more and more fans.  This technology is known by the English abbreviation ETTH.  This method uses optical fiber, its advantages in comparison with the usual telephone line are undeniable.  So, with this approach, any restrictions on the speed of information transfer practically disappear.  Communication is carried out in a relatively inexpensive and simple Ethernet system, the optical fiber transmits arrays of content over long distances without sacrificing speed.  This is a real opportunity to increase Rostelecom‚Äôs Internet speed by simply changing the technology <span>for connecting</span> to a network.  The average data transfer rate according to this scheme is about 1 Gbit / s with the possibility of either increasing or decreasing.  However, while this method is not ubiquitous, and the possibility of connecting it can be obtained from the provider that provides Internet access. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  For advanced users </h2><p>  You can increase the speed of the Internet by using other programs, but for this you need a fairly high level of computer skills.  These utilities have advanced settings that allow you to manually select the necessary parameters, in addition, they have many hidden systems, using which in some cases you can significantly improve the performance of your Internet connection.  However, ignorance of the process algorithms when using these programs can even harm and make your <span>communication channel</span> even slower than before.  One of the most famous programs in this segment is considered DSL Speed, there are various editions of this utility, but the principle of operation is similar in all its types.  It is valid for all types of DSL connections.  With it, you can adjust and correct DNS errors.  Also, the program allows you to change the internal settings of the PC to your Internet speed and thus adapt it for full work on the network.  An undoubted advantage is that the utility can be downloaded online absolutely free. </p>

    <h2>  Operational Connection Optimization Approaches </h2><p>  An important condition for how to increase the Internet speed of Rostelecom is also the presence of a modern anti-virus complex on your computer.  Today, you can download many anti-virus programs on the network, they are free, but their functionality is limited by the minimum required indicators.  These antiviruses will not protect your PC from threats from the Internet, and you may not even notice them visually, however, the operation of your device will be extremely slow, and even with a high initial speed of connecting to the network, they can significantly slow it down.  Therefore, the best way to protect yourself from cyber dangers is a commercial version of the antivirus program.  To increase the performance of your computer and, as a result, increase the speed of the Internet, Rostelecom will help your OS settings.  Any version of Windows provides this feature.  In this case, you need to disable all unnecessary or unnecessary options using the BIOS settings, however, it is better to do this only for advanced users in order to avoid further problems. </p><h2>  Hardware needs </h2><p>  Another factor to speed up your Internet connection is the hardware of your connection.  If the speed drops, you need to make sure that all your physical contacts on the line are operating at full power.  The slightest malfunction in the wiring system can lead to significant network access problems.  You need to use only modern and compatible equipment, only in this case you can achieve high-speed connection.  If someone joins your line, this will directly affect your Internet, so regular checking of the entire line is an indispensable condition for high-quality communication. </p>
