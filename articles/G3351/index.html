This climatic device can also be called a monoblock.  It serves to heat the air and supply it to the room.  All components are located in the housing, so the outdoor unit does not exist.  In order to conveniently move the device around the room, wheels were fixed on its body.  That is why most users choose it. </p><p>  The mobile air conditioner, which is installed indoors, has a compressor.  It is not taken out into the street, as with ordinary analogues, but remains in the room.  This design has positive reviews. </p><p>  A standard mobile air conditioner performs the following functions: </p><ul><li>  heating or <span>cooling air</span> to a certain temperature; </li><li>  drying it; </li><li>  space heating; </li><li>  ventilation. </li></ul><h2>  Principle of operation </h2><p>  During engine operation, excess heat is generated that must be removed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="installation of a mobile air conditioner" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1167413.jpg" width="400"></div>  For this, a standard mobile air conditioner is equipped with a corrugated pipe.  It is displayed through a window or door to the street.  This process, namely the removal of warm air, must be carefully thought out.  If this is not done, then the efficiency will be low for a device such as a mobile air conditioner.  This type of installation has a drainage system.  It is necessary to collect the condensate produced.  The process is carried out in two ways:

But there are significant differences, which will be discussed below. </p><h2>  DIY mobile air conditioner installation </h2><p>  Most people find this equipment easy to install.  Of course, the installation of a mobile air conditioner in an apartment differs from the work that is carried out for standard split-system air conditioners.  But for these purposes, certain skills and knowledge are still needed. </p><p>  The main feature of the monoblock is that when you purchase the device, certain services of installation specialists are offered.  First of all, it is necessary to bring the warm air produced by the compressor to the street.  Therefore, a special window insert is made. </p><p>  To install a monoblock in the room, you should purchase some materials and equipment: </p><ul><li>  A sheet of dense plastic having a thickness of more than 9 mm.  This material is used to isolate cold air from warm, which is indoors. </li><li>  A device for sawing solid material, namely a sheet of plastic. </li><li>  Adhesive tape or masking tape that can withstand a piece of plastic on a window. </li><li>  <span>Foam</span> that provides protection against water and air. </li></ul><h2>  How to get started? </h2><p>  Before starting <span>installation work, you</span> should consider a clear plan of action. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="installation of a mobile air conditioner in the window" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1167414.jpg" width="300"></div>  If you have special skills, you can draw a mini-project.  As a rule, the installation of a mobile air conditioner is carried out next to the window.  In this case, air resistance decreases several times.  It is also necessary to monitor the hose.  It should not have fractures or other mechanical damage.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Making a window insert </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, the installation of a mobile air conditioner in the window is carried out using a plastic insert.  So, the process begins with measuring the dimensions of the window.  Next, find out the diameter of the duct.  Using a pre-prepared tool (saw or scissors), a window insert is cut out in accordance with certain dimensions.  The result should be a rectangle of plastic.  A hole is cut in the center that corresponds to the diameter of the corrugated pipe.  The duct must fit snugly against the walls of the opening. </p><p>  Ensuring tightness is an extremely important process.  Installation of a mobile air conditioner begins with a window insert.  It is the only obstacle to cold air and moisture coming from the street.  To ensure reliable sealing, use silicone sealant or polyurethane foam.  Any of them can be purchased at a hardware store. </p><h2>  Installing a mobile air conditioner in a plastic window </h2><p>  The installation of the plastic insert is carried out in the following order: </p><ul><li>  open the window and lock it in this position; </li><li>  apply a self-adhesive tape or sealant to the plastic insert; </li><li>  attach the insert in the window frame. </li></ul><p>  A mobile air conditioner, the installation (a photo of such devices can be seen below) which is described in the article, can be mounted by almost every home master. </p><p>  How to do it yourself?  Installation methods for mobile air conditioners are very simple. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="installation of a mobile air conditioner in a plastic window" class="if" height="341" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1167415.jpg" width="600"></div>  After completion of the preparatory work, installation of the apparatus is started.  First you need to choose a future installation location.  After this, one end of the duct is inserted into the plastic window insert, and the other to the exhaust outlet of the equipment.  A mobile air conditioner, the photo of which can be viewed in this article, must be turned on after the device has been idle for more than 3 hours in an upright position.  This ends the process.  As you can see, there is nothing complicated in it.  If you have certain skills and a simple bench tool, the procedure can be completed in a short time.

    <h2>  Installation Rules </h2><p>  Installing a mobile air conditioner is a relatively easy process, but there are actions that cannot be performed: </p><ul><li>  turn on the system through a do-it-yourself extension cord; </li><li>  arrange grounding to the gas pipe; </li><li>  mount the air conditioner in the bathroom; </li><li>  block the space near the device; </li><li>  connect to a grounded outlet; </li><li>  give direct access to the mains. </li></ul><p>  If there is no time and desire to install the air conditioner with your own hands, you can call specialists.  However, you will have to spend money on paying for the work. </p><p>  Any equipment has advantages and disadvantages.  Mobile air conditioning was no exception.  Despite the fact that there are more positive sides, we will consider each view in more detail. </p><h2>  Advantages of the mobile candy bar </h2><p>  Among the positive qualities of the device are the following: </p><ol><li>  Mobility.  Such devices have small overall dimensions and weight, which allows them to be transferred and installed in other rooms.  In the winter season, the air conditioner can be assembled and delivered before the onset of hotter weather. </li><li>  Easy installation.  Installing a candy bar does not take much time and effort.  All you need is tools and basic skills.  The installation process is described in the article. </li><li>  Saving.  How can I save?  First of all, at the installation.  It can be done independently.  When installing a split system, a lot of dust and noise is generated, and all this costs a certain amount of money.  This will not happen here.  In addition, the device itself is much cheaper.  Its price ranges from 10,000 to 50,000 rubles. </li></ol><h2>  Disadvantages of air conditioners </h2><p>  Monoblock must be constantly monitored.  As mentioned earlier, when the compressor is running, condensate is produced, which is collected in a special container.  Therefore, it should be emptied periodically.  If the container with the capacitor is full, the device will cease to function. </p><p>  The next drawback is the noise generated. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY mobile air conditioner installation" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1167416.jpg" width="568"></div>  It is much higher than that of an air conditioner split system.  This is due to the fact that the compressor is not in the street, but in the room.  In terms of noise characteristics, they are similar to kitchen hoods.  Therefore, you should endure it to maintain a comfortable environment.

    <p>  During the operation of the monoblock, a lot of warm air is released, so it needs to be vented to the street.  This is done using a <span>corrugated pipe</span> that is led out through a window or door.  As a rule, it is included.  Its length is too small, and an increase threatens with a loss of productivity. </p><p>  Despite the negative aspects, many users are satisfied with its work.  Its main advantages are ease of installation, mobility, cost, as well as high rates of creating optimal climatic conditions.  Various models are widely represented in the domestic market. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Many users of mobile air conditioners note their high performance as well as ease of installation.  For installation you will need basic skills.  To ensure comfortable climatic conditions in another room, you just need to move the device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="instructions for installing a mobile air conditioner" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1167417.jpg" width="600"></div>  Among the positive qualities, low cost is distinguished in comparison with split-system air conditioners.  Its cost is in the range of up to 50,000 rubles.  It depends on performance and other specifications.

    <p>  The biggest drawback is the noise generated.  This is due to the fact that the compressor is not located on the street, but indoors.  However, to ensure comfortable climatic conditions will have to be patient. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Mobile air conditioning is a great device for ventilating a living area. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="installation of a mobile air conditioner in an apartment" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1167418.jpg" width="569"></div>  Despite the negative aspects of the device, it is still popular among many users.  You can save on its installation.  To do this, you need to have simple tools and basic skills.  The low cost hides a high-quality device that will create comfortable conditions in any room.
