    <h2>  Comments of tourists </h2><p>  Since the choice of a hotel greatly affects the quality of leisure, especially when it comes to the all-inclusive concept, it is very important not to make a mistake.  Therefore, experienced travelers are advised to get acquainted with as many reviews of people who have already visited the hotel you are interested in.  Today we offer to find out what impressions our compatriots had on their vacation at Magnolia Hotel.  To begin with, it is worth noting that tourists from the Russian Federation and neighboring countries, judging by the comments they left, the hotels were quite satisfied with their choice.  According to them, it offers an excellent combination of affordable price and quality of accommodation. </p><p>  Confirmation of this can serve as the rating of the hotel.  It is compiled based on all the ratings of travelers who have been here.  So, this indicator for Magnolia Hotel is above average.  The rating of this hotel is four and a half points out of a maximum of five.  I must say that this indicator has significantly increased this year compared to the previous one.  So, in 2015, the hotel was rated only 3.8 points.  This suggests that the administration made the appropriate conclusions and made sure that the guests liked the Magnolia as much as possible. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To date, the highest ratings have received the quality of accommodation, level of service and catering.  Some tourists complain about the infrastructure (guests do not really like the fact that you have to pay for using the Internet) and entertainment (some travelers would like to be able to spend more leisure time on the hotel).  However, in general, the rating of Magnolia Hotel can be called very worthy and worthy of attention. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="magnolia hotel 4 turkler" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1389122.jpg" width="376"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel itself </h2><p>  In general, Magnolia <span>Hotel 4 * (Turkey,</span> Alanya) left a positive impression on our compatriots.  So, according to them, this hotel will appeal to those who are tired of roomy hotels with a large number of guests.  ‚ÄúMagnolia‚Äù has not so many numbers.  Accordingly, there are not so many tourists here.  Therefore, you can relax in a more relaxed atmosphere.  As for its own territory, the hotel has a small one.  However, in addition to the residential building, there are several swimming pools (for toddlers, older children and adults), there are water slides, a restaurant, a bar, a sun terrace with sun loungers, parking, a conference room, table tennis tables and much more. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Guests were generally satisfied with the location of the Magnolia Hotel 4 *.  Reviews of tourists indicate that there are several shops, supermarkets, pharmacies, cafes, bars, tour agencies, etc. near the hotel. Also nearby is a park where you can go on a picnic.  A fifteen minute walk is the market.  However, according to our compatriots, the prices and quality of products here are practically no different from what can be found in supermarkets next to the hotel. </p><p>  The only inconvenience may be the way from the airport to the hotel.  So, it takes about two hours.  However, as a rule, tourists overcome it on comfortable buses equipped with air conditioning.  Also on the way, you can listen to the stories of the guide and find out from him the answers to your questions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="magnolia hotel alanya 4 reviews" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1389121.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Housing stock </h2><p>  As for the apartments, in general, the guests were satisfied with their design and equipment.  So, according to travelers, they do not differ in modern design.  However, it is noticeable that they have a fresh repair.  The rooms are decorated in soft soft colors.  The apartments cannot boast of a large area, but there is enough space for everyone.  Furniture and appliances are not new.  But everything is of high quality and is in good condition.  So, for example, some guests mention large and comfortable beds with clean and high-quality linens in their comments. </p><p>  Some guests were a little surprised that in the two-room apartments there is air conditioning only in the bedroom.  Therefore, to cool the entire room, they had to constantly keep the doors open.  Also, some complaints about the quality of hair dryers.  So, the guests say that it will be quite difficult for the fair sex with long hair to dry her hair.  The fact is that after 20-30 seconds of operation, the hair dryer is so heated that it becomes impossible to hold.  Therefore, tourists are advised, if necessary, to capture this item from home.  As for the safes in the Magnolia Hotel rooms, they can be used at an additional cost.  However, not all guests did this.  So, guests preferred to store valuables in suitcases and travel bags that were locked on a padlock or combination lock.  According to them, nothing was lost. </p><p>  Many travelers are also concerned about the issue of any interruptions in water.  As for the Magnolia Hotel 4 * <span>(Turkey) we are considering, the reviews of</span> former guests indicate the fact that, in general, no problems were noted in this regard.  The only thing, according to some tourists, a slight weakening of the water pressure was noted in the evening, when most vacationers returned from the beach to their rooms and took a shower.  However, this did not cause any difficulties to anyone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="magnolia hotel alanya 4 turkey alanya" class="if" height="378" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1389120.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  the Internet </h2><p>  Since in this age of high technology it is important for everyone to constantly be able to stay in touch with friends, family, colleagues and business partners, the vast majority of tourists are concerned about the availability of Wi-Fi at the hotel.  So, as far as Magnolia is concerned, wireless internet is available here.  Moreover, you can use it both in public areas and in rooms.  However, this service is provided for a fee, which slightly disappointed some guests.  According to our compatriots, 5 days of using Wi-Fi will cost you about 15 euros.  In general, some tourists say that they were even satisfied that the Internet in the hotel is paid.  According to them, they even enjoyed the fact that they simply enjoyed nature, the sea, the beach and new experiences, without wasting time reading the news feed on social networks, etc. </p><h2>  Staff </h2><p>  As for the service at the Magnolia Hotel 4 * (Turkler), according to some tourists, it is not much inferior to five-star hotels.  The staff here are very attentive, helpful, friendly and coping with their duties perfectly.  For example, by contacting the administrator at the reception at any time of the day or night with a question or request, you can be sure that you will receive a full consultation or the necessary help.  Former hotel guests pay attention to the fact that not all hotel employees speak Russian.  The easiest way for you here is to communicate in English or German.  As a rule, even basic knowledge of the school curriculum in these languages ‚Äã‚Äãis enough for you to communicate with the staff. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="magnolia hotel 4 turkey alanya" class="if" height="346" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1389119.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Cleaning </h2><p>  As for the work of the maids, in this regard, the guests generally do not have any complaints, which is not so common even for higher-class hotels.  So, cleaning in all rooms is very high quality.  Every day, maids not only throw out garbage, renew towels and personal hygiene products, but also do wet cleaning - they wash the floor and wipe the dust.  Therefore, you can be sure that your apartments in Magnolia will always be clean and comfortable.  As for the change of bed linen, judging by the comments of our compatriots, it is carried out every three days. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Since Magnolia Hotel 4 * (Turkey, Turkler) operates on an all inclusive system, guests can eat or enjoy a drink at almost any time of the day.  So, meals are held three times a day in the main restaurant of the hotel.  According to our compatriots, of course, you should not expect that the tables here will be full of delicacies and expensive dishes.  However, there were no complaints about the quality of food.  Travelers say that they always had the opportunity to taste delicious and well-prepared first and second courses of meat, poultry and fish, various snacks, side dishes, salads, pastries, fruits and vegetables, sweets. </p><p>  In addition, in the intervals between the main meals you can always have a snack fast food in the snack bar.  Here you will be offered pizza, french fries, a hamburger, etc. Also, all day, both at the pool and on the beach, there are bars offering alcoholic and refreshing drinks.  True, according to our compatriots, only beer deserves attention.  Many tourists were not thrilled with the quality of wine and other alcoholic drinks.  However, many solved this issue by visiting one of the neighboring stores or making a purchase in duty free. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="magnolia hotel 4 turkey reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1389117.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Since 99% of tourists staying in Alanya in summer expect to have a good rest at the sea, this point is very important when choosing a hotel to stay.  As for the hotel we are considering, in this regard, according to our compatriots, it will not disappoint you!  So, Magnolia <span>Hotel Alanya 4 *</span> (Turkey, Alanya) has its own sandy beach.  It is not very large, but everyone can comfortably accommodate here.  The beach can be reached in 7-8 minutes in measured steps.  Along the way, you will have to go around the neighboring hotel without having to cross the roadway. </p><p>  The beach is equipped with comfortable sunbeds with mattresses under a canopy.  This is very convenient, since there is no need for vacationers to constantly turn either deck chairs or umbrellas as the sun moves.  As for entering the water, it is quite gentle.  Near the shore, the bottom is sandy.  However, closer to the depth, you can stumble upon large stones, so caution is advisable. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  According to our compatriots, Magnolia 4 * (Turkey, Alanya) cannot brag of special animation.  So, only children are specially entertained here.  This is not about a mini-club, where young guests can spend several hours, but about a disco in the evening.  On this occasion, the opinions of tourists were divided.  After all, someone loves noisy entertainment, games, etc., and someone prefers to relax in a more relaxed atmosphere.  As already mentioned, the hotel has several swimming pools designed for both children and adults.  Also, vacationers can play table tennis, billiards, ride a water slide, as well as enjoy water sports on the beach (for an additional fee). </p>
