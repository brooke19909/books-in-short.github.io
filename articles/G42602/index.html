For one trip to Rimini, you can take a rich excursion program to historical and cultural attractions, purchase a beautiful bronze tan, swim in the warm sea, enjoy the delicious delights of local cuisine and return home with a full suitcase of branded items.  But where to stay on the Adriatic Riviera?  In this article, the Hotel Donau 3 * is presented to your attention.  Rimini is a very ancient city.  It was founded in the third century BC.  The modern city has overgrown with resort beach areas, stretching for fifteen kilometers along the sea.  And one of them is Marina Centro.  The first word in the name indicates that this area is seaside.  And the second is that it is the modern center of the city of Rimini.  Historic sites are located inland.  And Marina Centro is the center of modern Rimini, with its shops, restaurants, beautiful promenades and rampant Italian fun. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Donau 3.

She has no territory as such.  The hotel occupies a four-story building with an elevator.  Most recently, major repairs were made.  The building pleases the eye with a fresh finish.  Almost all rooms, except three or four, have small balconies.  A characteristic feature of this hotel is that a flag of the country from which the tourist occupying the room came from is hung over each balcony.  By this sign - flying colorful banners - the hotel can be easily recognized.  Moreover, the sign at the hotel itself is small, inconspicuous.  The entire ground floor is occupied by a reception and a restaurant with lounge.  At the entrance there is a terrace with tables.  This hotel is loved by Russian tourists who come to Emilia-Romagna for shopping. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  Hotel Donau 3 * in Marina Centro is very small.  It has only twenty one numbers.  So the atmosphere in the hotel reigns just family.  The hostess speaks Russian, one of the girls at the reception too.  The tourists described the rooms as small but comfortable.  There is only one category of guest rooms at the Donau Marina Centro 3 * hotel - Standard.  Rimini is often visited by two.  After all, this is a city glorified by Dante, who told the descendants the story of the tragic love of Paolo and Francesca.  Most of the hotel rooms are designed for two guests, and they have one wide bed.  But there are rooms for three people and even four.  But due to the small area, children are accommodated in bunk beds in these rooms.  What else is in the bedrooms?  Tourists report on a TV with satellite channels (one of them is Russian), on air conditioning, heating in the winter, a telephone and a safe.  Bathrooms feature showers and bidets.  They cleaned the rooms every day, towels are changed every other day, bed linen - once a week.  The rooms can connect to wireless Internet for an additional fee. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Donau Marina Centro 3 (Rimini)" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1550902.jpg" width="550"></div>

Breakfast is included in the price.  They are served in buffet mode.  Breakfast runs from eight to ten in the morning.  Guests are offered hot drinks from a coffee machine, croissants, sausage and cheese slices, milk, granola, pastries.  But there are other nutrition options: HB Plus and FB +.  This is an improved half and full board.  At these two meals, vegetables and snacks are displayed on a common table (buffet format), and waiters bring other dishes on a fixed menu.  The chefs at this hotel specialize in Italian delights.  The hotel also has a bar with a small outdoor terrace.  Budget tourists were content only with breakfast at the hotel.  There are a lot of opportunities to have lunch and dinner at Marina Centro.  Tourists recommend cafe "Amerigo".  Conad Supermarket, two blocks from the hotel, offers ready-made meals and snacks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Donau 3.

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Just seventy meters from the Hotel Donau 3 * (Rimini) the warm <span>Adriatic Sea</span> splashes <span>.</span>  The entire coastline is shared between private beach owners.  Such is the stern Italian capitalism.  But then, having paid for the entrance, you can enjoy the entire beach infrastructure.  And not only the provided sunbeds and umbrellas, but also the animation.  Here you can play beach volleyball, use water sports.  Rimini's “marina” stretches for fifteen kilometers, and encompasses former fishing villages.  Among this long strip of sand you can find free sites, but there are very few.  Reviews recommend visiting Beach No. 52 directly at the hotel, as guests have a small discount there.  Sunset in the sea on this stretch of coast is very convenient, the sand is clean, there are no big waves (if this is not a storm). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Hotel Infrastructure </h2><p>  In the lobby of the Donau 3 * hotel (Rimini) there is a cozy common living room with a large TV and library.  The building has four floors with an elevator.  It is also noteworthy that the staff at the reception and the waiters in the restaurant speak Russian.  This is a big plus for those tourists who do not speak English and Italian.  At the hotel at the early check-in or late check-out you can leave your luggage under the supervision of the reception staff.  The hotel also has a currency exchange service.  There is also a laundry room.  For an additional fee, you will be happy to wash your clothes and iron them.  In public areas (actually on the ground floor) there is fast Wi-Fi, access to which is absolutely free for guests.  But if you want to hang out on the World Wide Web, lying on the bed in your room, you have to pay five euros.  The hotel accepts pets by prior arrangement. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Donau 3.

    <h2>  Conditions for children </h2><p>  The Adriatic Riviera, due to its sandy beach and shallow entry into the sea, is a great place for families.  And in order to attract tourists with children, the Donau 3 * hotel (Rimini) offers a lot of services for its young guests.  Firstly, it is a favorable pricing policy.  Children under six years are free of charge in any case.  For absolutely babies, a cradle can be placed in your room upon request.  If the child is already six, but has not yet “hit” nine, he can also live in a hotel for free, but on the condition that he will occupy the existing beds.  Since the hotel has no territory to equip a playground for there, for small guests there is a room full of toys. </p><h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  Many tourists do not go beyond the beach and sea to Hotel Donau 3 *.  Rimini is a paradise for shopaholics.  To come to the Adriatic Riviera and not to visit at least one outlet is a bad manners.  The most popular among Russian-speaking buyers in a row is Gross Remini.  In this huge shopping center under one roof, more than one hundred and sixty shops and boutiques fit.  Very profitable purchases can be made at the Queen Outlet.  Rimini differs from Milan in that sua bring wonderful things of the past season, which is why the price is simply fantastic.  Tourists travel to this resort with half-empty suitcases, and on the way back they pay at the airport for overloading luggage.  By the way, cheap prices also explain the fact that in the streets of Rimini you can hear light brown speech more often than Italian.  It is simply unthinkable to return from leisure only with a bronze tan without adding a couple of three new things from the wardrobe to it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Donau 3.

    <h2>  What to try in Rimini </h2><p>  We have already said about the "masthead".  Now a few words about the “mast tray”.  The Emilia-Romagna region, where the <span>Donau Marina Centro 3 *</span> hotel (Rimini) described here is known, is known as the gastronomic center of Italy.  It was in this province that Parma ham, Parmesan cheese, mortadella sausage, balsamic vinegar were born.  Durum wheat is grown in the fields of Emilia Romagna, from which the famous Italian pasta is made.  All these delights can and should be tasted in restaurants, which are at least a dime a dozen in Rimini.  The best are considered “Lo Skiero”, “Il Lurido”, “Da Guido”, “Marinelli”.  By the meal, you will certainly be served piadin cakes, not included in the bill.  The wines of the region are a separate topic of conversation.  You can taste the best samples in the Tenuta del Monsignore winery.  The average bill at Marina Centro restaurants is twenty euros.  Some well-respected establishments offer set meals for eighteen.  Rimini has many restaurants not only of local cuisine, but also of Thai, Japanese, Chinese, Arabic and Russian. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Donau 3.

    <h2>  What to see in Rimini </h2><p>  To the old town to go leisurely step only half an hour from the hotel Donau 3 *.  <span>Rimini reviews</span> are advised to inspect, starting with the Arc de Triomphe of Augustus.  From it is close to other attractions inherited by the city from the ancient era.  This is the Tiberius Bridge, which was built in 21 AD and which still regularly performs its function (and not only for pedestrians, but also for cars), the Roman amphitheater and the "House of the Surgeon".  The latter attraction is interesting in the collection of all kinds of tools used by the Aesculapius of ancient times.  From the era of Ancient Rome, you can smoothly go to the Middle Ages.  This period gave Rimini the castle of Sismondo, the Town Hall and the palace of the mayor.  The Renaissance is represented by the temple of Malatesta.  In the eighteenth century, the Fish Market was built in the city, which must also be visited.  And do not forget that Fellini lived in Rimini for a long time.  A special tourist route is dedicated to him.  You can drink espresso in a cafe where the famous director had breakfast and even sit on the “same bench” where the honorary citizen of the city sat. </p><h2>  Hotel Donau 3 * (Rimini): reviews </h2><p>  Tourists liked the location of the hotel.  Close to both the sea and the Old Town.  The entire infrastructure of the resort is within walking distance, but the hotel is located on a quiet street.  The rooms in the hotel are quite small, but very comfortable.  Tourists appreciated the family atmosphere prevailing in the hotel.  The staff and hosts are very welcoming.  There is no language barrier - and these reviews were considered a big plus.  Many tourists described breakfasts.  They characterized them as quite satisfying and tasty. </p>
