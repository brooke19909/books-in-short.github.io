They help to monitor the state of their health not only to those who regularly devote time to training in gyms, but also to ordinary people.  Functionality develops with each subsequent generation.  If before they were only hours with several additional features, now it is already a powerful harvester with good autonomy and capable of replacing several individual gadgets.  Today‚Äôs review is dedicated to the new Honor Band 3. We‚Äôll analyze the reviews at the end of the article, and now consider the main advantages announced by the manufacturer. </p><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  A device is sold with everything necessary for its comfortable operation.  The packaging is transparent and made of plastic, which allows you to immediately evaluate the gadget in reality, and not by the images shown, which may differ from reality.  Inside it, according to reviews on the Huawei Honor Band 3, the capsule of the fitness bracelet itself is located, a convenient <span>silicone strap</span> that can be adjusted to fit any wrist, a transitional charger and a USB cable that can be connected to a laptop or computer, or to a block from any other gadget.  The manufacturer did not forget about the simple instructions that allow you to get acquainted with the basic functions and make the initial setup of the wearable device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="swiftinformer.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Colors of Huawei Honor Band 3" class="if uuid-2251469" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/2251469.jpg"></div><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The bracelet turned out to be quite original and clearly differs from its competitors.  So, the strap is made non-removable, and, as the Huawei Honor Band 3 Nyx B10 reviews say, to replace it, you need to unscrew a couple of screws.  The charger connector is located on the bottom of the capsule, deployed to the arm, and does not cause discomfort.  This method of attachment allows you to protect the capsule from accidental loss, as is possible in the case of the famous <span>Xiaomi Mi</span> Band 2, in which it can simply fall out of the stretched strap, and the user will not even notice it.  Three colors of the bracelet are initially available for the buyer to choose from - orange, black and blue.  In reviews of the fitness tracker of Huawei Honor Band 3, there is often information that in Chinese stores you can already find enough other options designed specifically for this model. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  All text and graphic information is displayed on the front panel display manufactured using PMOLED technology and having a diagonal of 0.91 inches.  This is enough to display time, date, information about the charge level and the status of the connection with the smartphone in non-stop mode.  The reverse side of the capsule is a heart rate sensor with green LEDs already familiar to us from previous revisions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.apktechnical.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Features of Huawei Honor Band 3" class="if uuid-2251464" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/2251464.jpg"></div><h2>  Suitable smartphones </h2><p>  In order to fully use the capabilities of the bracelet, you need to connect it to a compatible smartphone on which the Huawei Wear application developed by the manufacturer will be installed.  As noted in the requirements, the smartphone must have Android or iOS as the operating system.  Unfortunately, owners of Windows-based smartphones will not be able to use it fully, even if they synchronize two gadgets with each other, due to the lack of official software.  This fact is confirmed by reviews of Huawei Honor Band 3 Carbon left by users of Win-backgrounds. </p><p>  A tracker connected to the phone helps keep you connected.  It notifies the owner of calls, messages and notifications from instant messengers in real time.  Thanks to the vibration function, according to reviews on the Honor Band 3, missing an important call becomes much more difficult. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Built-in pedometer </h2><p>  One of the main features of any fitness bracelet is the ability to count the number of steps taken by its owner.  This function encourages you not to sit still and to devote time to physical activity every day.  The accelerometer installed in this model, as users note in the reviews about the Huawei Honor Band 3 bracelet, quite accurately captures the vibration created during walking, while ignoring extraneous distortions and not ‚Äújudging‚Äù the extra number of steps.  And the graphs created by the application based on your activity will allow you to make physical activity more uniform. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.igeekphone.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Functionality Huawei Honor Band 3" class="if uuid-2251470" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/2251470.jpg"></div><h2>  Activity Modes </h2><p>  The bracelet can work with special modes designed for focused training.  There are only two of them, but they allow you to track most of the indicators for their subsequent analysis.  The first is Run.  In this mode, the bracelet considers such indicators as the frequency of the heartbeat, the distance traveled, the number of steps, the approximate calorie consumption.  All data is synchronized with the cloud storage and subsequently allow you to both display statistics for each individual workout and compare several consecutive exercises.  If necessary, you can even use the services of a virtual trainer from Huawei Honor Band 3. Reviews say that based on statistical data, the application can develop an individual recommended training program that will be balanced and will not create physical overload. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The second mode, which is absent in many offers of competitors, is ‚ÄúSwimming‚Äù.  Perhaps he is the highlight of this model.  In this mode, the bracelet counts the number of strokes, determines the approximate distance, and also writes all this data to the cloud storage.  You can control the indicators in the process, because the display shows information on the number of calories burned, the total training time and the approximate distance traveled.  The only negative, according to reviews on the Huawei Honor Band 3 fitness bracelet, is the relatively small screen on which it is difficult to view information when swimming. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.igeekphone.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Huawei Honor Band 3 Modes" class="if uuid-2251466" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/2251466.jpg"></div><h2>  Sleep and alarm </h2><p>  Thanks to the constant measurement of the pulse, the bracelet is able to control the state of its owner, therefore it switches to sleep mode automatically.  If you wish, you can translate it in manual mode.  Data is collected on the duration and depth of sleep, based on which recommendations are made.  For example, there may be advice on a schedule when you should go to bed a little earlier, or on the duration of sleep. </p><p>  <span>A smart alarm clock,</span> which is an integral part of the "Sleep" mode, allows you to make awakening truly enjoyable.  The bracelet analyzes activity and tries to wake it up exactly at the time when the REM sleep phase occurs.  As a result, as satisfied customers say in reviews of the Honor Band 3 Nyx B10, waking up is much easier than with a normal alarm clock, and vigor comes in itself in this case during a morning warm-up. </p><h2>  Heart rate monitor </h2><p>  Another key feature of the bracelet is the ability to measure the pulse constantly, and not just at some interval or on request.  This can be useful for those who have certain problems with the cardiovascular system. </p><p>  So, with some diagnoses, it is undesirable if the heart rate exceeds a certain indicator.  However, during hard physical work or training, you can forget about it, and constantly distracted by manual heart rate measurement is unlikely to be convenient.  It is here, as noted by the reviews on the Huawei Honor Band 3 bracelet, a constantly working heart rate monitor comes to the rescue, which monitors the status and notifies the user of the excess of the critical mark with the help of vibration.  Thus, you can protect yourself from many problems, including a heart attack and heart attack.  And the collected statistics will help determine exactly which loads should be avoided, or distribute them more evenly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.igeekphone.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fitness Bracelet Huawei Honor Band 3" class="if uuid-2251467" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/2251467.jpg"></div><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  Another important indicator for the bracelet is the ability to work for a long time without recharging.  After all, if you use the function of a smart alarm clock daily and constantly monitor the state of the pulse, taking it for a long time would be extremely undesirable.  The manufacturer of the gadget claims that there is no reason for concern.  With a constant measurement of heart rate, the bracelet is able to work for about 10 days, taking into account synchronization with a smartphone.  If you turn off the heart rate monitor and start it only when necessary, the operating time increases to a record 30 days.  At the same time, it takes only an hour and a half to charge the gadget from zero to 100 percent.  These indicators can be considered more than worthy, since they probably will not cause you any discomfort when using the Honor Band 3 fitness bracelet. Reviews say that there is no need to fully charge it.  You can recharge it sometimes for 10-15 minutes, for example, while taking a shower. </p><h2>  Key Specifications </h2><p>  Most of the key parameters have already been listed in the article.  However, for those interested in the facts, it may be interesting to read the exact data.  So, the bracelet received a battery with a capacity of 100 mAh, as well as a smooth charging controller, which extends the battery life and does not allow it to quickly fail.  To synchronize data between a smartphone or tablet and a wearable gadget, Bluetooth wireless technology version 4.2 is used, implying the ability to connect multiple devices at the same time.  Therefore, you can not worry about data synchronization, if there is a need to use a bracelet and, for example, a wireless headset. </p><p>  The weight of the device with the bracelet is only 18 grams, so there should not be any discomfort from its use.  However, in order for the heart rate monitor to work as accurately as possible, reviews of the Honor Band 3 fitness tracker recommend fastening the strap as tight as possible, but without squeezing the hand. </p><div class="photo" data-original="indianexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fitness Tracker Huawei Honor Band 3" class="if uuid-2251465" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/2251465.jpg"></div><p>  The resolution of the built-in display is 128x32 pixels, which is enough to display basic information.  On the Web, alternative firmware already exists that allows you to expand the capabilities of the built-in display, displaying more data on it, up to the text of SMS messages received on the smartphone.  If you wish, you can experiment, however, all responsibility for the operation of the gadget in this case lies with you, and the warranty is voided. </p><h2>  Positive bracelet reviews </h2><p>  It's time to analyze the reviews on the Honor Band 3 from users who already had the opportunity to test this gadget in everyday use.  To begin with, let's pay attention to its strengths, most often noticed in reviews. </p><ul><li>  <em>Good autonomy.</em>  As indicated in the technical documentation, the bracelet is able to work in a minimum mode of up to one month.  If you have it connected to your smartphone constantly and you use the heart rate monitor mode and notifications, then expect a full discharge in 7-10 days. </li><li>  <em>A large number of modes.</em>  Users note that the bracelet has all the necessary functions that can be useful both in everyday life and in training. </li><li>  <em>Regular updates.</em>  Despite some shortcomings in the software, the manufacturer constantly releases patches and modified versions of both applications and firmware for the device.  As a result, there is a positive tendency to eliminate minor flaws and increase the stability of the bracelet. </li><li>  <em>The ability to put the phone into silent mode.</em>  Since all notifications are received on the bracelet, the sound in the smartphone can be turned off due to its uselessness. </li><li>  <em>Smart alarm clock.</em>  Thanks to this feature, many wake up in much better condition than before. </li><li>  <em>Powerful vibration.</em>  The vibration motor installed in the bracelet is powerful enough so that the user does not miss one of the important notifications received on the phone.  He also acts as an alarm clock in the morning. </li><li>  <em>Water resistant.</em>  As shown by numerous reviews in which users tested this feature, the bracelet is really able to survive a long time under water without consequences. </li><li>  <em>Accuracy in the calculations.</em>  Although some of the calculations are based on statistical data, their accuracy is kept at a height.  Sensors work out correctly and allow you to monitor your activity. </li><li>  <em>Continuous heart rate measurement.</em>  For those who want to control the loads in non-stop mode, this feature has proven to be indispensable.  The manufacturer optimized its work well, since the use of a heart rate monitor previously led to a too rapid discharge of the battery. </li></ul><p>  These are the main positive aspects of this bracelet.  However, it has a number of disadvantages that should be considered before buying. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.igeekphone.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Using Huawei Honor Band 3" class="if uuid-2251468" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/2251468.jpg"></div><h2>  Negative points based on reviews </h2><p>  Among the minuses, first of all, users in reviews of Honor Band 3 noted the inability to completely turn off the device.  So, if you remove the bracelet and leave it on the table, it will still try to continue measuring until it is completely discharged.  This is inconvenient if you want to leave it for several days, since upon returning it will be necessary to charge it before further use. </p><p>  The second negative aspect was the silicone strap that stretched over time.  Therefore, if you plan to purchase this bracelet, it is recommended to immediately pick up and order a pair of interchangeable straps.  They will not only help change the image, but also come in handy if the native strap is simply torn. </p><p>  Users note and not completely balanced and modified software.  However, given the continuous improvement and release of updates, this problem should completely disappear with time. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  This bracelet is suitable for absolutely everyone, and not just lovers of an active life.  Its functionality allows you to configure everything exactly as a specific user needs.  Someone will use it for training, while others need it as an indicator of notifications.  In any case, it can become an indispensable companion.  The review and reviews of the Honor Band 3 show that there are also disadvantages, and they need to be considered before the acquisition, so that later there will be disappointment.  However, in general, the device is fully consistent with its tasks and performs them fully. </p>
