He gained his popularity among historians for the most part thanks to his friendship with the great Russian poet Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin.  However, even without it, the biography of Mikhail Yakovlev contains rather interesting facts. </p>

    <h2>  Childhood and adolescence </h2><p>  Mikhail Yakovlev was born on September 19, 1798 in the family of a state councilor in the capital.  He spent most of his childhood in a Moscow noble university hostel.  Here he learned not only good manners and etiquette, but also cultivated a strong character and independence. </p><p>  In 1811, Mikhail Yakovlev entered the Tsar's Lyceum.  Here he quickly earned the respect of fellow students and teachers.  In his memoirs, the director of the lyceum Vasily Malinovsky will write the following lines: ‚ÄúYakovlev is a student of 14 years.  He has very enviable talents, studies diligently, good-natured, submissive and quick.  Despite the fact that poor education is sometimes seen in him, he more than compensates for this shortcoming with his kindness and caution.  Moreover, the guy has a penchant for music. ‚Äù </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Friendship with the great poet </h2><p>  While at the Moscow Lyceum, Mikhail Yakovlev became addicted to literature.  In order to satisfy his thirst for beauty, he enrolled in a local literary circle.  It was here that the future civil servant met Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin. </p><p>  Naturally, for Mikhail Lukyanov, such a meeting could not pass without a trace.  After all, everyone who was lucky to talk with the great poet, had an irresistible urge to create.  The joy of Yakovlev then became music.  He was a good composer and quite often composed new romances, which he then sang with pleasure in front of his friends. </p><p>  Due to his warm nature, he quickly attracted not only Pushkin, but his whole environment.  Subsequently, many literary evenings began to take place at his house, and Mikhail Yakovlev himself received the nickname "Lyceum Warden". </p>

    <h2>  Career and Achievements </h2><p>  After graduation, in 1817 <strong> </strong>  Lukyanov received the position of petty official in the Sixth Department of the Government Senate.  Here he was supervised by the great senator of the Russian Empire - Dmitry Borisovich Mertvago.  Under his leadership, he proved himself to be a rather responsible employee, thanks to which in 1820 he received the post of head of the department of taxes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the winter of 1827, Mikhail Lukyanov was sent to St. Petersburg.  Here he had a special task - to help <span>M. M. Speransky to</span> draw up a new code of laws.  It was necessary to work in the imperial office, which became a good ‚Äúbonus‚Äù in his biography.  In particular, this allowed him to become the director of the second branch of the imperial printing house in 1832.  Using his power, Mikhail Yakovlev was able to print here the first edition of Pushkin's ‚ÄúHistory of the Pugachevsky Revolt‚Äù. </p><p>  In 1843 he received the Order of Stanislav I degree.  It should be noted that few statesmen of Russia in those years were awarded such a prestigious award.  As for Yakovlev, he earned it thanks to his contribution to the publication of a new code of laws in late 1942.  After receiving the order, the official was promoted to a member of the council of the Ministry of the Interior.  Here he worked until 1848, after which he left this post at his own request. </p>

    <h2>  last years of life </h2><p>  The reputation of Mikhail Yakovlev was impeccable.  Therefore, it is not surprising that he was offered many times to return to public service.  However, keen on his hobbies, he refused for a long time.  And only in 1862, Yakovlev decided to return to work - this time as a consultant to the Ministry of Justice. </p><p>  With this position, the duties of the Senate who checked the work fell on him.  He coped with his task quite skillfully, and therefore in 1963, by special decree of the emperor, Mikhail Yakovlev was appointed to the post of privy councilor.  In this post, he held out until his death, which occurred on January 4, 1968. </p><h2>  Contribution to Russian Culture </h2><p>  During training at the Lyceum, as well as some time after its completion, Mikhail Yakovlev was actively engaged in composer activity.  Very valuable for Russian culture were his romances and stylization.  His romance ‚ÄúWinter Evening‚Äù is considered to be the most popular today, the basis for which was the poem by A. S. Pushkin ‚ÄúThe storm is covering the sky with darkness ...‚Äù. </p>
