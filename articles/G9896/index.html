What to see in Moldova</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Moldova is an independent republic located in the south of Europe.  On the one hand, it borders with Romania, and on the other, with Ukraine.  The population of the country is around 3 million people.  According to this indicator, Moldova ranks 118th in the world. </p><h2>  Subtleties of the region </h2><p>  Description of Moldova is best to start with its capital.  It is the city of Chisinau in any sense that is the heart of this sunny country.  Moldavian is considered the official language, however, Romanian is constitutionally acting on the territory of the republic. <br><br>  The main authorities are the President and Parliament.  The territorial unitary state is conditionally divided into 32 districts, 5 municipalities and 2 autonomous entities.  The largest cities of Moldova, in addition to the capital: Balti, Magpies, Tiraspol, Orhei and Bender.  Most of the population professes Orthodoxy. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moldova on the map" class="if" height="460" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/844852.jpg" width="325"></div>  Moldova is not a very rich country.  Its annual GDP is just over $ 7.5 billion.  On the territory of the republic, the main monetary currency is Moldovan Leu. <br><br>  It is interesting that the country became independent on political grounds only in August 1991, after the collapse of the USSR.

    <h2>  Geographic Benefits </h2><p>  Moldova on the map is located just west of the Black Sea.  It does not have a common border with the water area.  The territory has a second time zone.  The largest and most famous rivers are the Dniester and the Prut.  It is worth noting that Moldova has an extended exit to the Danube. <br><br>  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe republic is about 33.7 thousand square meters.  km  Extreme geographical points are considered such villages as Naslavcha, Giurgiulesti, Palanca and Kriva.  There are practically no highlands in the region, with the exception of insignificant massifs and ridges.  But in the ground there are many <span>minerals: clay,</span> sand, limestone, gravel, gypsum. <br><br>  The climate here is continental, temperate.  In winter, the average temperature is -10 degrees, in the summer - from +22 to +25.  Precipitation is rare, so their annual level varies in the range from 380 to 500 mm. <br><br>  Most of the territory is occupied by villages, villages, plowed fields and forests.  The cities of Moldova are evenly dispersed throughout the region. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Historical heritage </h2><p>  Until the 14th century, tribes such as the Goths, Dacians, and Antes lived on the territory of modern Moldova.  Then state entities began to appear, for example, the Galician and Old Russian principalities, the Golden Horde.  From the end of the 16th century, the Ottoman Empire took control of the region. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moldavian cities" class="if" height="410" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/844853.jpg" width="600"></div>  In 1711, the great ruler of Moldova, <span>Dmitry Kantemir,</span> swore allegiance to the Russian throne.  Soon, he became close to Peter I. At that time, Moldova on the map of the Russian Empire only covered a small fraction, but it was extremely important from the point of view of military strategy.  That is why the Turkish khans repeatedly captured her.  Nevertheless, the Russian army was able to conquer the area back after each enemy attack. <br><br>  The republic entered the Soviet Union as an autonomous MSSR.

    <h2>  Travel destinations </h2><p>  Oddly enough, but all the attractions of Moldova come down to historical heritage and winemaking.  The tourism industry in the country is practically undeveloped.  However, anyone who wishes to come to Moldova can check into a hotel without any problems for a little money and book any kind of excursion for himself.  On the other hand, you can go around the whole region by your own transport in a couple of days by visiting all the most interesting places and places. <br><br>  Of course, the main asset of the republic, which glorifies it throughout Europe, is winemaking.  Even the most sophisticated taster must at least once in his life visit the famous cellars in Small Milesti and Cricova. <br><br>  However, the sights of Moldova do not end with wines.  In the country there are a huge number of large and significant monuments and memorials.  Each city and village has its own historical monuments.  The most notable are the monuments to Stefan cel Mare, victims of repression, Lenin, Kalinin, Kotovsky, Karl Marx, Pushkin, Komsomol heroes, Dzerzhinsky, etc.  It will not be superfluous to visit the <span>memorial complex</span> called Eternitate.  The monument of <span>Nizami Ganjavi</span> is also popular with tourists <span>.</span>  This monument was erected by the Azerbaijani sculptor A. Askerov in honor of the cult Persian classic. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The main wineries of the country </h2><p>  In Moldova there are several factories and cellars where the sparkling drink of the gods is produced in compliance with all norms and old traditions.  However, the main winery of the country is considered to be the city of Cricova.  It is located near Chisinau and is part of the municipality of Riscani. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moldavian wines" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/844854.jpg" width="600"></div>  Here, Moldavian brand wines began to be produced since the end of the 16th century.  The legendary Cricova cellars are located under the city.  They stretch for many kilometers, keeping hundreds of collections of wines in their walls.  Such drinks cannot be tasted anywhere else in the world.  All wines are squeezed only from berries growing in the country.  Combine "Cricova" also produces vintage champagne drinks. <br><br>  The cellars of the city keep the optimum temperature for <span>collection wines</span> +12 degrees with a humidity of 97%.  The total length of the complex is about 120 km.

    <h2>  History of the fortress </h2><p>  This building represents the unique historical heritage of Moldova.  Soroca fortress was built in the 14th century.  Her task was to establish control over the Dniester River and the surrounding territory.  Based in the city of Soroca, which is a two-hour drive from Chisinau. <br><br>  The fortress is made in a typical medieval style of defense architecture.  In 1543, thanks to the nobles of Transylvania, work was carried out to strengthen the main walls of the complex.  Until that moment, the Soroka fortress consisted of several towers and wooden fences.  On the territory of the historical monument, artifacts of the ancient colony of Olkhoniy and Tripoli culture were repeatedly found. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fortress fortress" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/844855.jpg" width="600"></div>  The complex has an oval shape.  It consists of 5 towers, one of which is a panoramic over the main entrance.  The walls rise 21 meters.  Their thickness varies within 3 m. It is worth noting that the foundation of the fortress is 7 m in depth.  The complex itself is small - 30.5 meters in diameter, but it does not cease to amaze with its majesty and massiveness.

The most significant and final victory was marked in 1789.  Then, under the leadership of A. Suvorov, the Russian army dealt a crushing blow to the Turks on the Dniester. <br><br>  Currently, the complex is the military unit and the Orthodox Church of Alexander Nevsky.
