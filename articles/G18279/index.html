  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The structure of the brain of a mammal - the victory of evolution!</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>The structure of the</span> animal‚Äôs <span>brain</span> is significantly different from the characteristics of the <span>human brain</span> and other living creatures, therefore it is customary to distinguish it into a separate type. </p><p>  <span>The</span> mammalian <span>brain</span> is quite large, according to the study, the largest area is occupied by the so-called <span>forebrain,</span> located above the middle and intermediate.  The general structure of the mammalian brain was formed as a result of the evolution of ancient animals, and it is based on the power of smell.  None of the other vertebrates is so sensitive to odors. </p><p>  The common name for an animal‚Äôs brain is the secondary vault.  The coordinating center for the work of all parts of the brain is considered to be the cerebral cortex.  The front brain, or frontal lobes, is responsible for the communication of the mammal with the outside world. </p><p>  The structure of the brain of a mammal is formed in such a way that its front part has maximum dimensions, just like the cerebellum, the intermediate part of the brain is slightly smaller, and the middle part has the smallest size. </p><p>  The nerve endings associated with the spinal cord and transmitting signals to various organs of the animal are located in the <span>medulla oblongata.</span> </p><p>  Various <span>parts of the brain of</span> mammals are responsible for certain processes of the body.  So, it is in the intermediate section of the brain that the visual information received by the individual is processed.  In addition, the process of thermoregulation occurs precisely due to control by this body. </p><p>  The smooth operation of the endocrine system is controlled by the pituitary gland, and all the information received is analyzed in the middle part of the brain. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In order to maintain the equilibrium of the mammal, as well as the balance of the motor system in general, the work of the cerebellum is necessary.  And the basic systems of life have their control centers located in the medulla oblongata. </p><p>  The body of the animal is quite complex, and it is believed that its intelligence takes second place after the human.  This is evidenced not only by the structure of the brain of a mammal, but also by mass in relation to the mass of the spinal cord.  For example, in reptiles, the spinal cord and brain weigh approximately the same, while in an animal, the brain mass exceeds the spinal cord by three, or even fifteen times, depending on the species. </p><p>  Certain areas of the brain in one species develop more strongly, in the other weaker, depending on the habitat of the animal.  For example, if the main time of day of a mammal‚Äôs life is night, then such an animal has the most developed vision.  If we are talking about the inhabitant of a reservoir or swamp, it is noted that such a mammal will have a strong development of hearing and smell.  An exception is a whale, in which the smell system is rather weak. </p><p>  In the brain of the animal, 12 pairs of cranial nerves are located.  The mammalian head nerves are responsible not only for hearing, sight and smell, they also take a direct part in the formation of the autonomic system. </p><p>  Scientists have proven that the structure of the brain of a mammal has formed millions of years.  And the ancestors of modern animals were animals that had a hunting instinct, who got their food at night with the help of a well-developed scent and vision.  When compared with the modern animal kingdom, their development was approximately in the middle between modern mammals and reptiles.  How the formation of the brain took place, researchers are still not completely aware.  But precisely because of this degree of development, the ancient animals managed to significantly survive to survive to modern times, and some became indispensable human helpers. </p>
