    <h2>  Requirements </h2><p>  Russian banks offer business representatives opening deposits, as they are profitable depositors.  For them, there are no strict requirements, especially if before that they were regular customers.  In this situation, a minimum of documents must be presented.  At the same time, virtually every bank offers favorable conditions. </p><h2>  Documents </h2><p>  Deposits for legal entities in banks are made out only with the provision of documents.  If the contributor is new, then you will need: </p><ol><li>  Statutory documentation (certified copies). </li><li>  Registration papers (certified copies). </li><li>  Registration documents (copies and originals). </li><li>  Letter from the State Statistics Committee. </li><li>  IP documents. </li><li>  Power of attorney. </li><li>  Cards certifying the signatures of persons having access to the deposit. </li></ol><h2>  Early withdrawal </h2><p>  Today, Russian banks offer depositors to withdraw funds ahead of schedule.  Just keep in mind that a lot of passive income will be lost.  The reason for this is that the financial institution calculates interest on the stay of funds on deposit.  Whatever <span>deposit rates</span> for legal entities may be, profit is lost with early withdrawal. </p>

    <h2>  Deposit closing </h2><p>  To close the deposit, you must contact the bank in which the contract was signed.  You need to take your passport and deposit documentation with you.  If a plastic card was provided with the execution of the contract, then it should be returned. </p><p>  The manager of the financial institution checks the documentation.  The client needs to fill out an application.  Based on this document, the deposit is closed and services are disabled.  Money is returned to the depositor. </p><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2>

    <p>  Deposit programs that are created for the business have many advantages.  In addition to obtaining passive income, customers are provided with the following advantages: </p><ol><li>  Deposits open for short and long periods, but there are unlimited programs. </li><li>  If the deposit is provided at a bank that provides services to a legal entity, the documentation package is reduced several times. </li><li>  For fixed deposits high rates apply. </li><li>  Individual entrepreneurs and commercial firms are entitled to early termination of the agreement. </li><li>  Clients do not have to take out insurance. </li><li>  If legal entities and individual entrepreneurs provide a certificate of deposit with a financial institution, they do not need to notify supervisory authorities of the opening of a deposit. </li></ol><h2>  Available Operations </h2><p>  With a deposit account, you cannot transfer funds to other persons.  It can be used as an additional settlement.  Funds will be held for future transactions.  The bank does not prevent the flow of money if it does not violate the terms of the agreement. </p><p>  A deposit must be opened using funds that are not in circulation.  To make a deposit, a company must have statutory and other documents confirming the work of a legal entity.  After presenting the documents, you must sign an agreement and open a deposit.  If the customer is regular at the bank, then a new, separate account will be issued anyway. </p><p>  There may be several deposit accounts, which is very convenient.  If you need funds, some part can be removed.  Then the interest is not completely lost, but only partially. </p><h2>  Probable difficulties </h2><p>  The following violations may occur during <span>deposit operations</span> : </p><ol><li>  Lack of internal documentation that establishes the rules for conducting operations. </li><li>  The deposit agreement does not contain information on the amount entered, the rate, the term or there are conditions that contradict the law. </li><li>  Money for deposits is attracted even with the restriction or prohibition of operations. </li><li>  The terms of accounting do not correspond to the terms indicated in the contract. </li><li>  After the expiration of the contract, the balance is not transferred to the account on demand. </li><li>  There is no deposit agreement with a personal account. </li><li>  Interest is calculated incorrectly or late. </li><li>  Funds are deposited or withdrawn in cash. </li></ol>
