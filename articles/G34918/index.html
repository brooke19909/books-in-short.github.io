One of them was more fortunate - museums were opened on their territory, only the facades were preserved from the others, and the interior was long ago transferred to some public institutions, and the third remained only in the form of ruins.  The last category includes the Grebnevo complex - a manor and a park located in an incredibly picturesque place. </p>

    <h2>  History of creation </h2><p>  The manor complex was designed and built under the direction of architect I. Vetrov.  The customer and the first owner of the estate was Boyar B. Ya. Belsky.  The complex begins its history in the 16th century.  Later, at different periods, the estate was owned by: General G.I. Bibikov, the wife of Golitsyna, the merchant Panteleev.  Each of the owners complemented the architectural ensemble, trying to improve and redo something.  In 1845, the merchant Panteleev converted the main palace for distillery and vitriol production, as a result of which irreparable damage was caused to the original interior decoration.  But, despite all these alterations in Grebnevo, the estate has preserved its facade to the present day, albeit in a very neglected form. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Manor complex in the XX century </h2><p>  In 1913, the main buildings were repaired, and a private sanatorium was opened in Grebnevo.  This institution was led by Dr. F. A. Grinevsky.  It is worth noting that the manor complex is located on a fairly large territory.  It consisted of the main palace, two outbuildings, two churches, magnificent front gates, outbuildings and decorative elements.  In addition, around the central house was laid out a well-maintained park, turning into apple orchards.  The windows of the palace and the front yard overlooked a picturesque pond. </p><p>  In the days of the USSR, the estate housed the sanatorium named after N. A. Semashko, then the bone-tuberculosis sanatorium, and then the Schelkovo College and House of Culture.  In the 1980s, the value of the Grebnevo complex was recognized, the estate turned into an open cultural center.  The reserve existed until 1991.  The cause of his death and emergency closure was a fire, which seriously damaged the main palace. </p><h2>  Manor Grebnevo: the history of decline today </h2><p>  Today, the object belongs to the Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation, but is not actually protected and can be identified as ownerless.  Because of this, the estate is very popular among fans of extreme tourism.  The problem lies in the fact that not all visitors are careful about the monument of history and architecture.  Year after year, the condition of the remaining buildings deteriorates - the stone walls crumble, the survivors are covered with graffiti and less artful designs.  On the shore of a reservoir in the shadow of an ancient apple orchard, tourists fry kebabs in warm weather, sometimes leaving trash after themselves. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The vast parkland today is partially given over for private development.  If the owner‚Äôs attitude to this object does not change, the forecast for the estate is the most deplorable.  And yet, even today, there is still something to fight for.  Let the floors fail long ago, in some places interesting fragments of the interior decoration remained.  Until 2007, the central <span>marble staircase</span> to the second floor and two-color hall were intact.  Today, inside the main house, you can admire the remains of stucco molding and appreciate the incredibly beautiful view of the lake from the windows. </p>

    <h2>  The former greatness of the complex </h2><p>  During the heyday of Grebnevo (the estate) looked majestic and pompous.  At the entrance there were large gates in the form of a <span>triumphal arch,</span> they were decorated with <span>sculptures of lions</span> and sphinxes.  The large pond had as many as eight islets, and the park surrounding the complex was decorated in a classic French style.  The main courtyard impressed the imagination with its size and clear geometric shape.  In combination with large-scale architectural buildings, the ennobled territory gave the impression of a real palace park. </p><p>  On the sides of the main building there are wings, one of which had a balcony overlooking the main courtyard.  Two pavilions with domes adjoin the main palace on the sides; in one of them, the first owner had his own theater.  The main house has a protruding central entrance, decorated with a six-columned portico and pediment. </p>

Short-distance passenger electric trains run from the <span>Yaroslavl station (</span> Komsomolskaya <span>metro station</span> ).

    <h2>  Memo to tourists </h2><p>  If you are interested in the abandoned manor Grebnevo, and you want to visit it, you should prepare for the trip in advance.  Choose the most comfortable clothes, prepare a navigator (the terrain orientation program can be downloaded to a modern phone), stock up on drink and take food for a snack.  Make a route in advance and study it on the map, taking into account the chosen <span>mode of transport.</span>  The territory of the estate complex is not protected today, and everyone can get here without hindrance. </p><p>  Be careful: stray dogs live near historical ruins, for the most part they are peaceful and accustomed to the community of tourists.  Do not forget that the estate Grebnevo (Shchelkovo district) today is in poor condition.  If you decide to inspect the buildings inside, look under your feet and up - the remains of buildings scatter almost before our eyes.  Do not forget to bring a camera with you.  Let only miserable echoes remain from the original splendor in Grebnevo, the pictures against their background are incredibly beautiful. </p>
