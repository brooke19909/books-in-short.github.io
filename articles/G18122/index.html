This complex easily accommodates representatives of youth, couples, and senior citizens.  The location on the Indian Ocean coast allows you to fully enjoy a comfortable beach holiday.

Nightclubs offer live music and unbridled fun. </p><p>  Such versatile services are offered to guests of the Fujairah resort by Indian Ocean hotels. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The Emirate has its own airport, so the fastest way to reach it is by plane.  The airport is located almost in the center of Fujairah.  As a rule, all tour operators include the cost of transfer from the airport to the hotel.  But there are no flights from the CIS countries directly to Fujairah.  You have to fly through Dubai or Sharjah.  You can also get here by car through the desert, renting a jeep with a driver.  Buses run from Dubai and Sharjah to Fujairah. </p>
