This question does not arise too often, but everyone still needs to know the answer.  Especially, of course, for real Beeline customers.  SIM cards can be damaged, lost, stolen, and also simply not suitable for a particular smartphone in size.  It is in these cases that it is advisable to talk about SIM recovery.  How successful is this?  What would she need?  And what difficulties do people most often face in the process of achieving their desired goal?  The answers to all these questions and not only look further. </p><div class="photo" data-original="beeline365.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Restore Simka Beeline" class="if uuid-3162521" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3162521.jpg"></div><h2>  Fairy tale or reality </h2><p>  Is it possible to restore the Beeline SIM card?  This is the first question to be answered. </p><p>  Today, customers have the right to restore SIM cards.  They can cope with this task in different ways.  The main thing is to know how to act under certain circumstances. </p><p>  Accordingly, the idea itself is quite real and realizable.  Only in practice to achieve the desired result is not always possible. </p><h2>  Ways to solve the problem </h2><p>  How to restore a Beeline SIM card?  It‚Äôs impossible to answer unequivocally.  This is due to the fact that the clients of this mobile operator can achieve the desired result in various ways.  But which ones? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For example, you can: </p><ul><li>  contact the company‚Äôs mobile phone salon; </li><li>  Call customer support </li><li>  order a SIM card on the site; </li><li>  submit a request via email. </li></ul><p>  Of course, everyone decides how to use it.  But, as practice shows, the best technique is a personal visit for Simka. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yamobi.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beeline - all about SIM recovery" class="if uuid-3162525" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3162525.jpg"></div><h2>  What is useful </h2><p>  How to restore the Beeline SIM card number?  To begin with, it is recommended to prepare for this operation.  In fact, everything is not as difficult as it seems initially. </p><p>  To restore the SIM card, you must necessarily prepare a passport.  Without an identity card, achieving the desired goal will not work. </p><p>  In some cases, a mobile phone or email may come in handy.  A "personal account" on the website of the mentioned mobile operator will also not be superfluous. </p><p>  Perhaps this is all.  How to restore a Beeline SIM card?  We will talk about this below.  And what difficulties can people face in the process of moving towards a goal, too. </p><h2>  The main problems in the process </h2><p>  Recovering a lost Beeline SIM is actually not so difficult.  True, as has already been said, it is not always possible to cope with this task. </p><p>  The only real problem that Beeline customers may encounter is the inability to restore the SIM card.  This happens due to the fact that Simka is framed by another person. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Accordingly, the restoration of the SIM should be handled by the one who originally issued the phone number.  Otherwise, the service will simply be denied.  And this is normal. </p><h2>  Personal visit </h2><p>  Where to restore the Beeline SIM card?  You can seek help from any mobile phone operator of this operator.  There are a lot of them all over the country.  Therefore, everyone can choose a place where he is most convenient to contact. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cnews.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Instructions for recovering Simon Beeline" class="if uuid-3162522" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3162522.jpg"></div><p>  Instructions for recovering a SIM card will look something like this: </p><ol><li>  Prepare a passport or other personal identifier. </li><li>  Contact the nearest Beeline operator. </li><li>  Write a request to restore your SIM card. </li><li>  Wait a while. </li></ol><p>  After the actions taken, the SIM card will be restored.  In some cases, it is issued immediately, and sometime it is necessary to wait a few days. </p><h2>  By mail </h2><p>  You can recover a lost Beeline SIM by email.  Such a decision is time consuming.  This is due to the fact that the finished SIM card is delivered by courier.  And this takes some time.  It is often faster and easier to personally contact the operator‚Äôs salon. </p><p>  Nevertheless, e-mail addressing still takes place in practice.  In order to use it, a citizen needs: </p><ol><li>  Write a letter requesting restoration of the card. </li><li>  Attach scans of photographs and other documents to your email that can help you identify yourself. </li><li>  Send a request to services@beeline.ru. </li><li>  Wait for an answer. </li></ol><p>  It is recommended that you initially indicate the SIM delivery address in the application.  It is possible that Beeline technical support will enter into a dialogue with you.  It will help to identify the identity of the customer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="newsgsm.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to recover SIM through the site" class="if uuid-3162523" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3162523.jpg"></div><h2>  Website and personal account </h2><p>  I wonder how to restore a Beeline SIM card?  Another solution is to contact technical support via the feedback form.  It is located on the company's website and works great with the help of the "Personal Account" of the user. </p><p>  This solution is almost never found in practice.  This is due to the fact that the online application through the feedback form is processed for a very long time.  Moreover, usually after sending it you still have to conduct a dialogue with Beeline employees via e-mail. </p><p>  In general, instructions for implementing the task will look like this: </p><ol><li>  Go to the Beeline website and log in using your name. </li><li>  Find a feedback form. </li><li>  Write a message asking for the restoration of the SIM card.  It is recommended to indicate as much data as possible about the owner of the number, as well as describe the whole situation. </li><li>  Send the generated request for processing. </li></ol><p>  Now it remains to wait.  If everything is done correctly, Beeline technical support will respond to the message and contact the customer.  After that, it remains to identify the person and wait for the courier with a SIM card. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.iguides.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to restore a Beeline SIM card" class="if uuid-3162524" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3162524.jpg"></div><h2>  By phone </h2><p>  How to restore a Beeline SIM card?  The last scenario is a call to the company's call-center.  Such a solution is in demand, especially if you need to urgently order a SIM, but there aren‚Äôt a single mobile phone branch nearby. </p><p>  A guide to using this method looks like this: </p><ol><li>  Call the Beeline tech support.  The number can be found on the same operator‚Äôs website. </li><li>  Wait for an answer. </li><li>  Report your concerns.  It‚Äôs best to first explain why you need to get such a service. </li><li>  Name the delivery address of the SIM.  You can order it in the operator‚Äôs cabin or directly home / to work. </li></ol><p>  Provide information that the call center employee will ask for identification.  As a rule, this is passport information, as well as the surname, name and patronymic of the owner of the number. </p><p>  After the approval of the application, you will only have to wait a bit.  The call center employee will process the request, after which the SIM will be restored and delivered to the customer. </p><p>  Important: do not forget to show your passport upon receipt.  A sim will not be given to an outsider. </p><h2>  How much is </h2><p>  Where can I restore the Beeline SIM?  As already mentioned, in any office of this company.  You can see their location in your area on the Beeline official page. </p><p>  How much will the service under study cost?  Recovery of SIM cards for Beeline customers is free.  With all this, the balance from the last "number" will be maintained on the new SIM card.  Very comfortably! </p><div class="photo" data-original="telecomspec.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it possible to restore a Beeline SIM card in Russia" class="if uuid-3162526" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3162526.jpg"></div><h2>  About unlocking your phone </h2><p>  How to restore the Beeline SIM number?  The answer to this question will no longer put a person in an awkward position.  True, sometimes recovery is understood as SIM unlocking. </p><p>  This operation is carried out depending on the reason for blocking the number.  If a person himself ordered a similar service or the operator activated it, it is better to personally contact the Beeline salon and write an application for unlocking. </p><p>  If the number is blocked due to a large debt on the account, you will have to replenish it to a positive balance.  Then the unlock will take place automatically. </p><p>  Important: through the official website, you can also restore a blocked number.  To do this, use the appropriate function or feedback form. </p>
