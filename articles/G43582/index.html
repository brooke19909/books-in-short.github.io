    <h2>  Tacho repair </h2><p>  If a washing machine manufactured by Ariston breaks, you need to study the error codes to understand what exactly is out of order.  The tachometer, for example, can be removed independently.  To do this, it is important to twist the cover, to examine first of all the model module.  Also, experts recommend checking the board completely.  In order to make a full check, you will need a tester.  It is important to check the resistance at all nodes of the module. </p><p>  Tacho sensors in the devices are located near the drum.  To remove them, use a conventional screwdriver.  The next step examines the base of the tachometer.  If the contact burns out, the circuit closes.  If the device is working properly, the tester will show a resistance of 40 ohms.  If everything is OK with the contacts, then you should check the control module.  With a software error, the board is completely replaced. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Temperature Sensor Errors </h2><p>  Sensors very often break down with inexpensive washing machines.  The reason for this is the overload of the central module.  If the voltage rises sharply in the network, then the capacitor may not withstand.  The main problem is that sensors are expensive. </p><h2>  Repair of temperature sensors </h2><p>  When a washing machine breaks down at Ariston, error codes can tell a lot.  You can try to inspect it yourself, find out the cause of the breakdown.  If the temperature sensor is defective (code F03), it is recommended to remove the panel and check the module first.  In this case, the part is also worth testing.  For this purpose, you need a high-quality tester to measure the resistance level.  Many models have a temperature sensor near the rotor.  It is connected through a small contact. </p><p>  To remove it, you have to use the key.  Many modifications have a protective plate.  It is attached to the body, it can be easily twisted.  After disconnecting the sensor, the element is checked by the tester.  In this case, the resistance should not exceed 30 ohms.  If the device shows a zero value, then the element will have to be completely replaced.  Sometimes, together with the sensor, you have to completely change the control module, but this rarely happens. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Causes of damage to the level sensor </h2><p>  Code F04 <strong> </strong>  indicates that the model has a faulty level sensor.  Thus, the machine leaks, or water does not collect.  Level sensors most often fail due to a wiring failure.  In this case, the contacts may oxidize.  When you see code F04, you need to check the level sensor and clean it. </p><h2>  Level Sensor Repair </h2><p>  To remove the level sensor, twist the lid and detach the protective plate.  The above item is always near the drum.  It is mounted on screws or clamps.  Many models have a small shelf for an element.  After detaching the part, the protective cap will be checked.  Contacts must be clean and free from defects. </p><p>  If the user sees dark spots - the level sensor needs to be cleaned with a cloth.  The cap must be twisted counterclockwise.  Everything inside the sensor should be clean.  If any objects are found, they are removed.  At the end of the work, the element is installed in its original place and checked.  If there is a problem with the intake of water in the tank, the part must be replaced. </p><h2>  Drain pump errors </h2><p>  A washing machine pump is a very important element.  If this part is broken, the drum does not fill with water.  The drain pump is quite expensive.  The main causes of component failure are considered to be a defective valve and filter.  Also, the problem may be dirty water, which clogs the pump. </p><h2>  Pump repair </h2><p>  If the washing machine does not turn on Ariston, the error codes may appear different.  When the pump is faulty, error F05 often appears.  You can try to replace this part yourself.  For this purpose, it is recommended to prepare a wrench and a set of screwdrivers in advance.  The first step is to remove the protective cover from the washing machine.  Then you need to disconnect the rotor, get the pump directly.  The washing machine pump is fixed on a rack and secured with several clips. </p><p>  Check the traction before twisting the pump.  Pipes should be pushed to the side so that they do not interfere.  The pump is removed from the stand straight up.  At this point, it is important not to damage the valve.  If the pump has a damaged stem, the part must be completely replaced.  Some experts advise installing new pumps on two nozzles.  They have a larger pressure limit parameter and are manufactured with several linings.  Many models are equipped with a sealant.  If cracks are visible on it, the device will have to be changed.  After installing the pump, it is important to check the strength of the nozzles and tighten the screws securely. </p><h2>  Causes of Button Error </h2><p>  The Ariston Dialogic module is responsible for all washing machine programs.  This item is located on the system board and plays an important role.  When it fails, the code F06 is displayed.  If this problem is detected, you must disconnect the washing machine from the network.  The main causes of a module malfunction are considered to be thyristor overheating and diode wear. </p>

    <h2>  Module repair </h2><p>  Repairing a module in a washing machine is very problematic.  First of all, it is important to disconnect the element, check the resistance on it.  If the problem is diodes, then they can be replaced.  In this case, the board is removed and the thyristor is removed.  Resistance is checked at the input contacts of the element.  In normal condition, the model produces 55 ohms. </p><p>  When the thyristor breaks, the resistance is very high.  The item presented is quite expensive.  Modules of old models are problematic to get in service centers.  It is also worth noting that many elements differ in parameters. </p>

    <h2>  Errors TENA </h2><p>  TEN in washing machines plays an important role.  He is responsible for heating the water.  When an element goes out of order, the user sees F07 on the display.  If a problem is detected, you must disconnect the model from the network and understand the malfunction in more detail.  As a rule, the heater breaks due to dirty water.  Also, network problems can cause a malfunction.  However, the failure of the heater can be dealt with independently. </p>

    <h2>  Repair of heating elements </h2><p>  To change the heating element of the washing machine, you must completely remove the drum.  To do this, the user will need a set of keys.  The upper seal can be pulled together.  In this case, the tourniquet is often fixed on racks.  To disconnect it, you need to pry the edge of the tape with something sharp.  Then it remains only to unscrew the heater.  Some modifications are made with several elements.  In this case, you need to check each heater separately.  If a plaque is visible at the base of the heater, then the device can no longer be used.  You can change the part in any service center.  When installing a new heater, it must be tightened very tightly until it stops. </p><h2>  Causes of errors in the heater relay </h2><p>  The heater relay breaks very rarely in washing machines.  This element is responsible for heating water directly in the tank by applying voltage.  The relay quite often overheats due to network congestion. </p>

    <h2>  Repairing a relay in a washing machine </h2><p>  To repair the heater relay, you need to remove the protective harness and disconnect the tank.  Next, the element is directly unscrewed, checked for defects.  If plaque is visible on the relay tube, it must be cleaned.  The presence of black spots indicates the burning of the device.  In this case, the heater will have to be completely changed.  Elements are produced in different sizes, this should be considered when buying a device.  If we consider the early models, then the heating elements in them are attached to the level sensors.  To replace the item, small cross keys are used.  Before disconnecting the tank, the harness is removed. </p><p>  Some modifications are made with several rubber seals.  It is also worth noting that the new heating elements are fixed at the base of the frame and stand out in large sizes.  In order to replace the device, screwdrivers are used.  Protective plates are usually mounted on four screws.  For many models, the relay is fully welded and can be disconnected from the tube.  In this case, the part changes entirely. </p><p>  If a plaque is visible on the handset, then it is quite problematic to remove it.  In this case, it is advisable to completely replace the element.  Sometimes <span>Hotpoint Ariston (washing machine)</span> breaks down due to clamp problems.  As a result, the relay is not able to hold reliably.  In this case, you can contact the professionals to install additional fasteners.  Much depends on the frame, which is located in the washing machine. </p>
