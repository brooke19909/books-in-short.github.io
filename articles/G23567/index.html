What do people in this profession do and what do they study</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the world there are many diverse professions, fanned by romance and served as a theme for a huge number of feature films and documentaries.  Among these areas of activity is ichthyology, popularized by Cousteau‚Äôs naturalistic films, and horror films like ‚ÄúJaws‚Äù or ‚ÄúAttacks of Sharks‚Äù served well to create a romantic image. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ichthyologist who is it" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17472/356556.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  However, the real work of a person specializing in fish science has little in common with the magnificent panoramas of underwater filming of Cousteau, or with the frightening events of horror films.  So let's solve once and for all two issues: the ichthyologist - who this is and what falls within the scope of his professional interests. </p><h2>  The name of the profession and what it means </h2><p>  Ever since the popularity of Belyaev‚Äôs work, in particular the novel ‚ÄúAmphibian Man‚Äù with the main character named Ihtiander, well-read people of that era remember that part of the word ‚Äúichthys‚Äù means fish.  It is logically easy to calculate that the most accurate interpretation of the name of the profession will be precisely "fish specialist", "fish specialist".  We can say that the designation of a specialty accurately displays the knowledge and skills that should be inherent in a person who has decided to choose it as his main activity. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Ichthyologist's circle of interests </h2><p>  In order to be so called, it is not enough to know the names of individual fish.  Fish science includes the study of the structure of aquatic inhabitants, their development during evolution, habitats more characteristic of one or another species - and this is only a small part of what an ichthyologist should know.  Who does this research better than a fish specialist? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="work ichthyologist fish farmer" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17472/356555.jpg?1395265639334" width="600"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

    <p>  And this is not all the knowledge that work will require of him.  The ichthyologist-fish farmer must have a clear idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe vital functions of all species of fish and river (marine) organisms in the controlled territory.  For him, the specifics of the reproduction of aquatic organisms should not be secret.  Indeed, for this, there is a profession of ichthyologist.  He must know exactly who this is in the waters entrusted to him, in order to take into account all the subtleties and ensure the normal existence of all organisms in the reservoir. </p><h2>  Expected Results </h2><p>  All this knowledge is essential for the future fish farmer, it is precisely the profession of ichthyologist that requires them.  What exactly does a specialist of this profile do? </p><p>  First of all, such information will be needed to regulate fisheries - both on a state scale and in relation to private fishing.  Agree, it‚Äôs one thing to catch a couple of tons of salmon where there are hundreds, or even thousands, and another in a small lake, where this fish rests before the last spurt to the spawning ground. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The next task of fish science is the calculation of rational fish farming, so as not to overstrain the reservoir with excessive "population" and not bring it to complete exhaustion, which threatens a local environmental catastrophe.  It is for this that everything that the ichthyologist studies is necessary. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="profession ichthyologist what does" class="if" height="283" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17472/356554.jpg?1395265672358" width="367"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  And finally, almost the most important task remains to control the passage of spawning fish through hydraulic structures.  This is a very complex problem, for the solution of which an ichthyologist is required.  Who should regulate and check the accessibility of locks and canals for fish schools on the way to spawning sites, if not a specialist in fish farming? </p><h2>  Directions of ichthyology </h2><p>  Most professions suggest theoretical directions and their practical application.  Ichthyology in this differs from other sciences.  You can choose a theoretical orientation, but this will not save you from practical activity if you do not deal exclusively with the analysis of data obtained by other ‚Äútheorists‚Äù or choose a purely laboratory direction for your path.  Even scientists are closely connected with the subject being studied - the vivid example is still the same Jacques Yves Cousteau. </p><p>  The main difference between ‚Äúpractitioners‚Äù and ‚Äútheorists‚Äù is that the former are tied to some reporting area (and they will nevertheless carry out some kind of scientific work, at least observation), while the latter go where they send and collect various scientific material on your direction. </p><h2>  Requirements for those wishing to become ichthyologists </h2><p>  Field conditions determine the special requirements for the ichthyologist profession.  Whoever does not accept this restriction cannot become a fish scientist.  The list of mandatory requirements includes: </p><ul><li>  physical training - above average, without quality sports training in this profession there is nothing to do; </li><li>  health is excellent; </li><li>  the ability to "find a common language" with any living creature; </li><li>  patience; </li><li>  observation; </li><li>  endurance; </li><li>  sloppiness. </li></ul>

No offense - it was they who initially became sailors and fishermen.

    <p>  But the basic requirement that all teachers behind the scenes is guided by in respect of applicants who want to surpass the great ichthyologists, remains love (or at least sincere interest) to all aquatic inhabitants.  Without this, education, of course, can be obtained, but the profession is doubtful. </p><h2>  Job Prospects </h2><p>  In today's life, when choosing a profession, the decisive factor remains the real possibility of subsequent employment.  And in this regard, there is comforting information: regulating the number of fish is far from all that an ichthyologist does.  Even in cities, he can find a job (which does not exclude trips to ponds).  Fish scientists are needed when designing dams, power plants and locks.  In this case, it would be nice to get some knowledge from an adjacent field - understanding how the constructed structure will affect the sponsored reservoir will really facilitate the immediate task. </p>

Business trips are not canceled, but you will not be separated from your family for a long time.

    <p>  If a potential fish farmer lives close to the fishing lake, he will be greeted with open arms.  And next to the sea-ocean, fishing vessels will not refuse a specialist.  A specialist living near a fish processing plant will also find a place. </p><p>  And if it so happens that life is inextricably linked with a large city, you should look for an aquarium, dolphinarium or oceanarium in it - the knowledge gained during training will obviously not be superfluous there. </p><p>  So, if a young developing member of society wants to become an ichthyologist, parents should not get across the road - the profession is promising, and if there is a penchant for it, then it is also harmonious. </p>
