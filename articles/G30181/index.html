There are several reasons for this.  Firstly, it is one of the few most popular brands on the market that, despite their origin, are known all over the world and make millions of sales.  Secondly, among buyers, devices from Huawei are probably associated as powerful, with attractive designs and inexpensive devices.  This combination already makes them profitable for acquisition by mobile phones.  Finally, thirdly, we all know that the brand is constantly updating its products.  Instead of obsolete devices, more and more new ones come out that have completely different technical parameters and, as a result, have expanded functionality compared to their predecessors. </p><p>  This article will discuss just such a smartphone.  His name is <span>Huawei Honor 4C.</span>  <span>The review</span> will be devoted to this model, in it we will talk about its features, technical stuffing, about the advantages and disadvantages that it has.  In addition to that, reviews will be given that we will find about the device. </p><h2>  About phone </h2><p>  The Honor 4 Series smartphone was launched on the market in 2015 as part of a group of two devices - 4C and 4X.  By himself, he represents a budget solution that offers the user a fairly wide range of functionality (at least, the characteristics here are really promising - 2 GB of RAM, for example, as well as an 8-core powerful processor indicate high performance of the device). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Interestingly, at the time of the release of the model, a real stir was created around it - smartphones were bought up in the official Huawei store so quickly that they did not have time to deliver them.  Thus, there was a situation when the model was not on sale, although orders were received for it. </p>

    <h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  We will begin, first of all, with the delivery set of the smartphone - what we managed to find in the box immediately after its opening.  The stories that Chinese manufacturers like to pamper the buyer with an expanded list of accessories are inappropriate here - the phone is equipped quite modestly.  This, in particular, a proprietary charger, a cord for connecting to a PC, the device itself and instructions with a guarantee.  Unfortunately, we could not find a case for Huawei Honor 4C in the box.  If desired, the buyer will have to purchase it in a separate order.  This can be done, for example, at Chinese auctions, as well as directly on the website-store of Huawei equipment.  There is a separate section ‚ÄúAccessories‚Äù where you can choose not only your favorite case for Honor 4C, but also various add-ons.  For example, they include a headset, screen protectors, <span>portable chargers,</span> and more. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Design </h2>

    <p>  The appearance of the model can not be called any special and such that attracts the buyer.  The device has a plastic case, consisting of a diamond-shaped incised texture, from afar it can be mistaken for a metallic luster.  In fact, it is just the plastic on which the notches are made. </p><p>  The Honor 4C form (which we are reviewing) is classic - a typical ‚Äúbrick‚Äù from the world of Chinese smartphones - the owner of straight, albeit slightly smoothed, corners.  The dimensions of the model (143.3 by 71.9 mm around the perimeter and a thickness of 8.8 mm) indicate that the smartphone is quite comfortable in the hand, and also fits in your pocket.  Rounded corners do not press on the hand, but in general, the device because of its texture can not be called slippery and such that strives to fall out during a conversation.  Therefore, from the point of view of the case, the device can be called practical, although not the most attractive. </p><h2>  Navigation items </h2><p>  Following the classic layout of the case, one can note the standard placement of navigation elements.  In particular, conducting a review dedicated to the Honor 4C, one cannot fail to note the physical keys under the phone‚Äôs screen (a classic set of three elements that look like system buttons on Android 5.0 and higher).  This control panel looks harmonious and convenient. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  The display lock key is placed on the side, under the volume control.  In this regard, the Huawei Honor 4C <span>smartphone</span> will not show us anything <span>unusual</span> . </p><p>  The hole for charging the device is placed on the bottom, while the headphone input is on the top of the phone. </p><p>  The back cover contains a minimum of elements - this is a set of small holes for an external speaker, as well as a camera eye and a flash in the upper part of the body. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The Honor 4C display (the review cannot confirm this information exactly, you have to take a word) occupies about 76% of the total front area, which is a good indicator.  Looking at the device, I want to note the uniform distribution of space, which pleases the eye and makes working with the model convenient and enjoyable.  The developer chose the classic way of dividing the frames: above and below the screen they are thicker, and on the edges - on the contrary, much thinner.  This ratio is in perfect harmony with the image of the model. </p>

    <p>  Judging by the characteristics, the Honor 4C phone works with a display based on IPS technology.  Its size is 5 inches, resolution - 1280 by 720 pixels.  The last parameter is less than that of many Chinese models of the same class: we can conclude that the manufacturer saved a little on the screen of his product.  But here there is a protective glass <span>Gorilla Glass</span> 3, which will prevent scratches and abrasions that occur as the phone is used. </p><p>  Still, as the manufacturers claim, they <span>coated</span> the Honor 4C screen with a special <span>oleophobic coating</span> .  The review demonstrates that the latter has indeed become smoother and, as a result, convenient to interact with. </p><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  The fact that the smartphone has a powerful functional filling, we already mentioned at the very beginning of the article.  Indeed, the HiSilicon Kirin 620 processor is used here, operating on 8 cores, the clock frequency of which reaches 1.2 GHz.  This is a very good indicator, which is proved by reviews dedicated to Huawei Honor 4C.  The review conducted by us demonstrates really smooth operation and the absence of delays when communicating with the phone.  The only problem in this regard, judging by the reviews, may be the interaction of the model with some ‚Äútop‚Äù games.  In particular, the phone refuses to play a number of the newest, most bulky ‚Äútoys‚Äù.  Most likely, this is due to some features of the platform on which the device works.  For the rest, we can say that the Honor 4C smartphone is a very strong phone in terms of performance, especially considering its budget. </p><h2>  Battery </h2>

    <p>  The manufacturer paid special attention to the autonomy of the phone, equipping the Honor 4C Dual with a 2250 mAh battery.  In the technical specifications there is only this indicator - data on how much the phone can work on a single charge in video playback mode or, say, with the constant start of games or talking, are absent.  Therefore, we will be based on our own observations, as well as on recommendations left about the Huawei Honor 4C. </p><p>  Reviews indicate that on average the model is able to ‚Äúhold‚Äù up to 20 hours in the mode of moderate charge consumption.  That is, it will work for about 17-19 hours when connected to Wi-Fi, 9 - when working with 3G Internet, a couple more hours less - in case of video playback. </p><p>  Let's just say that in the market such a performance characteristic of the device is pretty good.  They achieved this, obviously, by properly optimizing the processor, as well as due to the capacious battery and not the best (in terms of resolution) screen. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  Characteristics of the model can be called typical for its class of devices.  In particular, the smartphone Huawei Honor 4C supports work in GSM networks (2G and 3G formats).  The phone has two slots for SIM cards, and both can be active for receiving calls.  The only drawback (albeit controversial) is the inability to work with LTE networks.  To consider this moment negative or not is an individual feature based on the requirements of users. </p><p>  There are also Bluetooth, Wi-Fi modules and, of course, GLONASS and GPS navigation aids.  This classic set makes the Honor 4C smartphone a typical Android device.  Recently popular chip NFC-connection is missing here. </p><p>  An interesting feature is a certain special option of the smartphone, working on a symmetric technology for receiving communications.  You can find out about its existence based on the official technical specifications of the device listed on the company's website.  In practice, it is unlikely to test its effect, so we could not find information about whether someone knows for sure how this system behaves.  In practice, everything seems as always. </p><h2>  operating system </h2>

    <p>  Since the smartphone was released in early 2015, it is not surprising that at the time of its presentation, the current version of Android was version 4.4.  The phone works on the basis of the shell from Huawei (EMUI), which differs from the ‚Äúbare‚Äù system in the appearance of some menu panels, icons and the like graphic elements.  The difference will be noticeable from the first minutes of accessing the device, especially if you previously used the ‚Äúclean‚Äù version of the system. </p><p>  There can be no complaints about the operation of the OS in this case, since this is one of the most stable versions released on this platform.  This thesis is confirmed by the fact that many devices work with 4.4.  Only now manufacturers are smoothly moving to the 5th and 6th generation of this system.  Among them, as you know, includes the smartphone Huawei Honor 4C. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The device, as it has become traditional, is equipped with two cameras.  The main one has a matrix resolution of 13 megapixels.  The shooting quality here, judging by the reviews, is superior to the positioning of the device - photos are obtained at the level of more expensive gadgets.  In addition, the model works with the use of automatic focusing technology, making pictures more clear. </p><p>  The front camera has a resolution of 5 megapixels.  The quality of the shooting, of course, is slightly worse.  In addition, judging by the technical descriptions, it supports the ability to create videos in FullHD quality. </p><p>  The camera menu here is standard, inherent in all Android smartphones. </p><h2>  Gadget memory </h2><p>  In total, the device has 8 GB of internal memory, of which about 3 GB is used for system data.  Thus, about 5 GB can be occupied by the owner of the device for downloading additional multimedia content.  Realizing that this is a very small amount, the developers went on to introduce the option of working with a memory card up to 32 GB in size.  This amount of space can be made from a Honor 4C smartphone (reviews can confirm this) a real portable storage medium or entertainment center.  All the possibilities for this, at least, are available. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2>

    <p>  Characterizing the recommendations of the buyers of the phone as a whole, we can conclude that they are mainly positive.  People say that working with the device is nice for several reasons.  They include an attractive design, powerful filling, the endurance of the model and its high-quality software.  But, as usual, we will look at negative reviews in order to know what might be wrong with this device. </p><p>  For example, a weak vibration alert is a common problem.  Users note that they do not hear his work and, thus, miss important alerts.  More buyers complain about the low volume level of the external speaker.  And although a small number of users work with it and play music files on it, it may still seem not loud enough. </p><p>  I would also like to note complaints about the poor reception of the 3G signal - they say, for some customers, the Internet speed for this reason often drops as they move away from settlements (even at short distances).  This indicates a weak GSM module. </p><p>  Among the reviews were complaints about the battery.  Some users claim that the latter is not hardy enough, which is why the device‚Äôs operating time is sorely lacking.  Others note that the cause of this may be the active heating of the model processor, which also causes a lot of inconvenience. </p><p>  In fact, there are a lot of smaller comments from buyers.  This is both the inconvenient location of the charging socket, the screen brightness of the Honor 4C device (black), and not the best standard keyboard preinstalled with the shell.  All these shortcomings are conditional and subjective, because they depend on the wishes and tastes of a particular person, so we will not focus on them. </p><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  The device is of some interest to those who are looking for a really powerful phone.  Take at least a processor that you simply won‚Äôt find on such cheap devices.  You should not talk about the quality of shooting cameras or a protected screen.  These are the obvious advantages of the phone, its advantages, for which you can pay a price of 9 thousand rubles, relevant at the time of writing. </p><p>  Yes, the smartphone has certain disadvantages - they can be identified by reviews.  There are even cases when buyers got a poor-quality device that lacked one or another function - and then the seller was forced to return the money, this, in principle, is normal.  In general, this state of affairs is also typical of other models. </p><p>  Therefore, summarizing the information we received during the review, I would like to make a positive conclusion in favor of the device we are describing.  Despite the cheapness and, to some extent, the manufacturer‚Äôs small experience in the market (this criterion is relative, of course), the Honor 4C device turned out to be worthy of attention.  It can be advised both to those who appreciate the power of the device, and people looking for an inexpensive device to perform basic tasks.  Both will suit Huawei Honor. </p>
