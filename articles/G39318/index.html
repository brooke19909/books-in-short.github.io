    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The city of Antalya is located on the southern coast of Turkey, on the Mediterranean coast.  It is thanks to the answer to the question how long to fly to Antalya from Moscow, this resort has become so popular among Muscovites.  It is safe to say that when saying ‚ÄúAntalya‚Äù, the majority speaks of the Mediterranean coast of Turkey as a whole, including Kemer, Side, and Alanya, which can be 2-3 hours by car from Antalya. </p><p>  This is a very picturesque region - there are also the sandy beaches of Side, and the high ridges near Kemer, when vacationers enjoy magnificent views of the mountains, splashing in the warm Mediterranean Sea.  The rocky coast of Lara has its fans - who do not need wide beaches, but the view of the sea stretching into the distance carries them into the world of dreams and dreams.  And in the sea you can dive from the pier. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Nearby are many interesting sights and <span>archaeological sites</span> from ancient times.  Local qualified guides and guides will be happy to tell everyone in detail about them. </p>

    <h2>  Tourist attraction center </h2><p>  Dozens of aircraft daily from all airports of the capital fly in the direction of Moscow-Antalya.  Flight time is an average of 3 hours.  It depends on the route chosen by the pilot, as well as weather conditions on the way.  If the aircraft has to go around the thunderstorm front, then the time may increase by 10-15 minutes.  Each time, no one knows for sure how much to fly.  Moscow-Antalya is a rather tense <span>route, planes</span> fly at very short intervals from each other.  Any hitch leads to flight delays, as well as to discontent of tourists who are inconvenient. </p><p>  But such troubles are extremely rare and often not the fault of air carriers.  Antalya combines amazing factors: proximity to location, comfortable resorts, reasonable prices.  All this makes it unique in the eyes of most tourists. </p>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Almost all tourists from Moscow choose the fastest and most comfortable option - flight by plane.  But some people decide to choose a more thorny, but surprisingly rich route - by plane to Sochi, and from there by ferry and bus in Turkey.  This path is much longer, but it has become popular lately.  Moscow-Antalya - as two starting points.  Between them you can visit many unique historical and architectural attractions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The flight Moscow-Antalya is probably one of the most popular routes on which hundreds of pilots and thousands of flight attendants work.  Well, the smallest passengers can ask the question more than once: "How much more will we fly?"  Antalya flies from Moscow with both school-age children and infants.  Time in flight is tolerated quite easily and quickly, and passengers do not have time to get tired during travel time. </p>

    <h2>  Air carriers </h2><p>  Absolutely the majority of aircraft in this direction are operated by charter flights.  This means that the tour operator that generated this <span>tourist product has</span> signed an agreement with the airline that buys a certain number of seats on each flight.  Depending on the projected demand, this quantity may vary each year.  If the tour operator cannot sell this number of seats, then he will still pay the air carrier for them, and thus incur financial losses. </p><p>  Almost all major airlines operate on charter programs.  How much to fly to Antalya from Moscow?  It does not depend on whether a scheduled flight or a charter flight.  And the quality of service, by the way, too.  Charter flights have only one feature - they are put on the flight schedule one day before departure, so changes can occur both in the departure time and even at the airport, from where the plane takes off.  This information should be remembered by all tourists, especially those who fly with a transfer from Moscow to other cities in Russia.  Count on strict compliance with the preliminary schedule is not worth it.  How many nerves and problems can this cause!  Therefore, it is better to play it safe. </p>
