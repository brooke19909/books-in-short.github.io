This is the second object from the Sun and the closest to the Earth among large bodies.  Venus, whose diameter is 95% of the diameter of our planet, constantly moves in the middle of the earth's orbit and can be between the Sun and the Earth.  This is an incredibly mysterious space object, which makes scientists admire its beauty and unusualness.  You can tell a lot about him, and all this will be very interesting for earthlings. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="venus diameter" class="if" height="325" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1501071.jpg" width="325"></div>

    <h2>  Venus in numbers </h2><p>  Venus, whose diameter is 12,100 kilometers, is in many ways similar to the Earth.  Its surface is only ten percent smaller than the surface of our planet.  In numbers, it looks like this: 4.6 * 10 ^ 8 km <sup>2</sup> .  Its volume is 9.38 * 10 <sup>11</sup> km <sup>3</sup> , and this is 85% more than the volume of our planet.  <span>The mass of Venus</span> reaches 4.868 * 1024 kilograms.  These indicators are quite close to the Earth's parameters, so this planet is often called the sister of the Earth. </p><p>  The average temperature of the surface of a mysterious planet is 462 degrees Celsius.  At this temperature, lead melts.  Venus (the diameter of the object is indicated above) due to the specific composition of its atmosphere is unsuitable for habitation of any form of life known to scientists.  Its atmospheric pressure is 92 times higher than Earth's.  The air is dusty with ash of volcanic origin, and clouds of sulfate acid soar in it.  The average wind speed on Venus reaches 360 kilometers per hour. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are incredibly aggressive conditions on this planet.  Probes built specifically for research work can withstand no more than a couple of hours.  There are many volcanoes at the facility - both sleeping and active.  On the surface of the planet there are over one thousand pieces. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="distance from the sun to venus" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1501072.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Traveling from Venus to the Sun </h2><p>  The distance from the Sun to Venus seems insurmountable to ordinary people.  After all, it exceeds 108 million kilometers.  One year on this planet lasts 224.7 Earth days.  But if we consider how long it takes one day here, we recall the proverb that time goes on forever.  One Venusian day equals 117 Earth days.  That's where all things can be redone in one day!  In the night sky, Venus is considered the second body in terms of brightness, only the Moon shines brighter. </p><p>  The distance from the Sun to Venus is nothing in comparison with the distance Earth - Venus.  If someone wants to go to this object, then he will have to fly 223 million kilometers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="venus and the sun" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1501073.jpg" width="489"></div>

The second place belongs to nitrogen, it is about 3.5%.  The indicator is five times higher than the earth.  MV Lomonosov was the discoverer of the atmosphere on the planet we are describing. </p><p>  On June 6, 1761, the scientist watched as Venus passed through the solar disk.  During the study, he noticed that at that moment when the planet found its small part on the disk of the Sun (this was the beginning of the entire passage), a thin, as if a hair, radiance appeared.  It surrounded part of a planetary disk that had not yet entered the sun.  When Venus left the disk, something similar happened.  Thus, Lomonosov concluded that there is an atmosphere on Venus. </p><p>  The atmosphere of a mysterious planet, in addition to carbon dioxide and nitrogen, also consists of water vapor and oxygen.  These two substances are present in minimal quantities, but nevertheless it is impossible to leave them unattended.  The atmosphere of the object included several space installations.  The first successful attempt was made by the Soviet station Venera-3. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="planet surface venus" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1501074.jpg" width="482"></div>

    <h2>  Hellish surface </h2><p>  Scientists say that the surface of the planet Venus is a real hell.  As we already mentioned, there are a huge number of volcanoes.  More than 150 areas of this body are formed precisely by volcanoes.  Therefore, it may seem that Venus is a more volcanic object than the Earth.  But the surface of our cosmic body is constantly changing due to tectonic activity.  And on Venus, as a result of unknown reasons, plate tectonics ceased many billions of years ago.  The surface there is stable. </p><p>  The surface of this planet is strewn with a large number of meteorite craters, the diameter of which reaches 150-270 kilometers.  Venus, whose diameter is indicated at the beginning of the article, practically does not have craters on its surface with less than six kilometers in diameter. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="atmosphere of the planet venus" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1501075.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Reverse rotation </h2><p>  The fact that Venus and the Sun are far apart, we have already found out.  They also established that this planet revolves around this star.  But just how does she do it?  The answer may surprise: vice versa.  Venus rotates very, very slowly in the opposite direction.  The period of her circulation regularly slows down.  So, since the beginning of the 90s of the last century, it began to rotate more slowly for 6.5 minutes.  Scientists are not completely sure why this is happening.  But according to one version, this is due to the fact that the weather on the planet is unstable.  Because of them, not only the planet begins to rotate more slowly, but also the atmospheric layer becomes thicker. </p><h2>  Hue of the planet </h2><p>  Venus and the Sun are two of the most interesting objects for researchers.  Everything is of interest: from the mass of bodies to their color.  We have established the mass of Venus, now let's talk about its shade.  If it were possible to examine this planet as closely as possible, then it would appear before the contemplator in a bright white or yellowish tone without any structures in the clouds. </p><p>  And if there was a chance to fly over the surface of an object, then people would consider the endless expanses of brown rocks.  Due to the fact that Venus is too dim clouds, little light reaches its surface.  From this, all images are dull and have bright red tones.  In fact, Venus is bright white. </p>
