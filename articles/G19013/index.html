Due to this, she is known far beyond the borders of the state.  What is so special about Monsanto in Portugal?  Sights and features of the village. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The fairytale village is located in Portugal on the slope of the mountain of the same name, which has a height of more than 800 m. The name of the peak is translated as "holy mountain".  Monsanto is located just 277 km northeast of the capital of Portugal - Lisbon.  At a distance of 306 km from the village is the city of Porto. </p><p>  Getting to the village is possible by public transport, which is quite well developed.  There is a railway connection, the only inconvenience of which is the need for a transfer in the city of Castelo Branco.  Travel time is about 3 hours if you get from Lisbon, and about 5 if you move from the side of Porto. </p><p>  It is also possible to get by bus, in which case you don‚Äôt have to spend time on transplants.  In addition, this method is faster. </p><p>  For those who love comfort in all its manifestations, it is recommended to rent a personal car.  In order to get to Monsanto, you need to move from Lisbon on the A23 or A1 highway.  From the city of Porto, the A25 motorway leads to the village.  At the entrance to a small town you can find free parking. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="40.0388745" data-lng="-7.115064999999959" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="9"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/3/2/8/17328.png"></div><h2>  Village features </h2><p>  The main attraction of the town of Monsanto in Portugal is the fact that it is located among huge stone boulders.  Historically, at the time of the formation of the settlement, local residents decided not to clear the slope of the mountain from large blocks of stone, but to build their homes between them.  It so happened that the stones were used as supports, foundations or even walls of individual buildings. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.atlasobscura.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="local beauties" class="if uuid-3213997" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53896/3213997.jpg"></div><p>  The result was a bizarre village, about which the locals themselves say that it is very difficult to determine where the stone ends and the apartment building begins.  This feature of the city was imprinted not only on the chaotic construction of residential buildings, but also on the roads.  Sometimes they are so narrow that you can only go on foot. </p><h2>  Climatic conditions </h2><p>  Due to the fact that the air temperature in the village of Monsanto in Portugal rarely drops below 0 degrees Celsius, the climate can be called temperate.  In the summer, the air temperature warms up to +15 degrees, so tourists travel to this country year-round. </p><p>  A warm and mild climate allows you to spend time in comfort.  However, when planning a trip to Portugal, it should be borne in mind that in winter the amount of precipitation increases, which can significantly interfere with sightseeing. </p><h2>  What to look for? </h2><p>  Reviews of Monsanto in Portugal are marked by the following attractions that are required to visit: </p><ol><li>  Local rocky and winding streets.  A feature of the territory is that they are all made of local stone, and the largest of them serve as the foundation or walls of some houses.  Many stones simply hang over residential buildings, which creates a certain flavor of the area.  You should also pay attention to the fact that some passages between buildings are so narrow and winding that they are made in the form of stairs.  Therefore, traveling through the city by car is not possible. </li><li>  The sculpture of a silver rooster, which is located on the building of the clock tower of the town hall.  It is a city award for winning the competition for an authentic city in Portugal, which was held in 1938. <div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="silver rooster" class="if uuid-3214010" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53896/3214010.jpg"></div></li><li>  The ruined castle of the Knights of the Knights Templar.  It is striking in its grandeur, despite the fact that it is in desolation.  It is worth paying attention to the curly battlements and high towers.  There is a legend that during the siege, the castle almost gave up when all the provisions were over.  However, a local resident was able to cunningly prove to the enemies that they did not give up and threw the last cow on them.  This proved that there was still food in the city, so there was no point in continuing the siege. <div class="photo" data-original="travel.sygic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Templar castle" class="if uuid-3214011" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53896/3214011.jpg"></div></li></ol><p>  The city of Monsanto in Portugal is also worth a visit because of the unique atmosphere that hovers among old houses and narrow streets. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Where to stay? </h2><p>  Due to the fact that the village of Monsanto in Portugal is popular among tourists from all over the world, it has a well-developed hotel system.

The knights built a fortress on the mountain, under which a stone city subsequently arose.  The fortress survived 800 years, replacing many centuries, rulers.  She heroically survived the siege, war and the change of climatic conditions. </p><p>  The castle of the Knights of the Knights Templar and today would be in pristine condition, if not for the explosion in the powder warehouse, which destroyed it.  Unfortunately, no one was already recovering. </p><p>  Today, in the town of Monsanto, there are only about 900 inhabitants, however, this does not prevent it from being an interesting tourist center of Portugal. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.heartofeverywhere.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="narrow streets" class="if uuid-3214004" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53896/3214004.jpg"></div><h2>  City holidays </h2><p>  Every year on May 3, the Holy Cross Day is celebrated in the village.  Travel guides advise visiting Monsanto on this day, as the city is transforming.  The solemn procession is different from ordinary holidays.  Residents who are dressed in national costumes go to the ruins of an ancient castle, carrying with them a large white pot filled with flowers.  It symbolizes a cow, which in the distant past saved the fortress and the city from a siege.  After some rites, he is thrown down from the cliff, thereby symbolizing the sacrifice that the townspeople make in honor of the liberation of the fortress. </p><p>  Despite the fact that these events are long in the past, the tradition of the annual celebration of liberation remains to this day.
