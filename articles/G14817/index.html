    <h2>  Lytkarino: a little about the city </h2><p>  Lytkarino is not the most populated city in the Moscow region.  There are not so many new buildings in it, as other <span>cities near Moscow</span> can boast <span>of.</span>  On the contrary, developers overlooked it with their attention, and therefore it now represents a quiet corner.  The charm of living in the Presidential LCD (Lytkarino) is the developer calls the favorable environmental situation, which is due to the fact that the city is located among the Tomilinsky forest park. </p><p>  Several thousand hectares of forest on the one hand and the Moscow river on the other, that’s what creates the ecology, about which they say that “you can breathe deeply”.  There is something to see in Lytkarino: the Petrovskoye estate, the Nikolsky temple with a belfry and the Peter and Paul Church. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Life in the residential complex “Presidential” (Lytkarino) is an opportunity to get everything from life to the fullest extent: life itself, and entertainment, and relaxation, and sports.  There are no tedious Moscow traffic jams, but there is an abundance of fresh air, and opportunities to spend family leisure as you like.  You can go skiing (mountain and water), bicycles.  A large ice rink operates annually in the city, and in the vicinity there are tracks for cars and motorcycle races.  Even horseback riding enthusiasts will find something to do.  The equestrian school operates in KSK "Creator", located in close proximity, and often there are various competitions in this sport.  There is also a pool and a fitness club. </p>

    <h2>  Location of the residential complex </h2><p>  As already mentioned, Lytkarino is located about 6-8 kilometers from the Moscow Ring Road.  In the area of ​​Kotelniki, you need to turn onto Novoryazanskoye Shosse and move along it for about 4.5 kilometers until the next roundabout in the Chkalovo area.  Then turn right onto Tokarevo and along Pervomaiskaya Street, which connects with Lytkarinskoye Shosse, without turning anywhere, go straight to Lytkarino itself. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Before the sharp bend of the highway, turn right onto Safonova Street, which will in turn connect with Ukhtomsky Street.  It houses the already built houses of the Presidential LCD (Lytkarino), building 2, which is still under construction. </p>

    <h2>  Description of the complex </h2><p>  The developer of this <span>residential complex is</span> positioned as a comfort class.  It will fit into the territory of the 11th Lytkarino microdistrict.  In addition to the construction of residential buildings, the builder, building the Presidential LCD (Lytkarino), is committed to reconstructing the existing social facilities, such as a school and kindergartens, to expand them.  For information: the project back in 2012 passed all town planning approvals, and it was recognized as the “Best Comfort Class Project in the Moscow Region”.  This speaks for itself about the reputation of the builder and what the residential complex will ultimately be like.  The planned place of the third building was previously a dilapidated housing, for the demolition of which the developer made all the necessary arrangements and approvals. </p>

    <p>  Thus, the Presidential LCD (Lytkarino) is called upon to form a new modern look of the city due to its architectural solution.  It will also be the dominant urban development value, the most ambitious new building in this city near Moscow. </p><h2>  Internal infrastructure </h2><p>  Residential buildings themselves are being built, as is now customary, with non-residential premises on the ground floor.  They will be given to tenants or owners for the placement of social infrastructure: shops, pharmacies.  In addition, the developer will carry out the improvement of the local area, the equipment of children’s, playgrounds and sports grounds, the landscaping of this territory.  That is, the creation of the most comfortable conditions for the rest of their future residents. </p><h2>  External infrastructure </h2><p>  New buildings in Lytkarino, including the “Presidential” residential complex, are also located in the city itself.  Therefore, the entire city infrastructure is provided to the residents of the complex.  Almost next to the complex are two schools, Lytkarinsk Central City Hospital, many hypermarkets and convenience stores. </p><p>  Also on the streets of Ukhtomsky and Oktyabrskaya, next to the complex, there are public transport stops.  This area is located in a zone of excellent transport accessibility.  At some distance there is a sports center.  And a few meters runs the Moscow River, the views of which can not but please the present and future residents of the complex. </p><h2>  Developer </h2><p>  The developer of the Presidential residential complex (Lytkarino; reviews about already built houses are only positive) is Kama-project.  The organization was founded in 2005 and carries out integrated design and development of urban and regional areas, micro-districts, towns.  The developer has a full package of documentation for the functions of the general architectural designer and developer of all engineering networks and structures. </p><h2>  Ecological situation </h2><p>  In this matter, the housing estate has no equal.  Its location a few kilometers from the metropolis, in a very cozy and most suitable place for the construction of a residential building and a comfortable pastime, speaks for itself.  The entire city of Lytkarino is surrounded by a green forest.  In addition, it is still a protected area - Tomilinsky forest park.  Several hectares of forest provide air of such purity and freshness, which can hardly be found in any other residential complex.  On the other side of the complex is the Moskva River, on the banks of which it is also good to fry kebabs on a warm summer day or look at its calm course. </p><p>  Therefore, those who have already moved permanently to apartments in Lytkarino, the Presidential Residential Complex, rush after working home to breathe the freshest air or take a walk after work along the river embankment. </p><h2>  Apartments of the complex, their cost </h2><p>  The developer offers to purchase one-bedroom, two-bedroom and three-bedroom apartments.  There are no studios or apartments with a large number of rooms in the complex.  But the smallest area of ​​the apartment starts from thirty-nine square meters and reaches more than eighty square meters - three-room apartments. </p><p>  The average cost of one square meter of area in a residential complex starts from seventy-four thousand.  The highest price is 83 thousand rubles per square meter. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The reputation of the developer gives hope that the construction of the complex will be carried out exactly on time specified in the project documentation and future residents will not have to defend their violated rights in court.  To date, residential buildings are being erected in accordance with the construction schedule, without violating it. </p><p>  Of the negative reviews, it should be noted that the layout of the three-room apartments is rather tight, the builder is not finished, and there are dilapidated unsettled houses in the neighborhood of the complex. </p>
