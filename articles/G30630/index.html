Here you will not only swim in the purest water, but also enjoy magnificent views, and you can also enjoy excellent fishing.  So feel free to pack your bags and head to Linevo Lake!  You must agree that the year 2014 turned out to be quite stressful, because rest on the lake is the most successful solution that will help relax your body and clear your thoughts.  The lake got its name because of the <span>tench fish</span> found in it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="linevo lake" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13530/468114.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The legend of the five lakes </h2><p>  Linevo Lake is part of a system of <span>five lakes that</span> are very close to each other, on the border territory of the Omsk, Muromtsevo and Kyshtovsky districts of the Novosibirsk Region.  According to legend, these lakes formed from a meteorite.  It is believed that the water in these reservoirs has healing power.  To do this, you need to swim in a certain sequence in all five lakes.  This system of lakes includes Shaitan Lake, Linevo, Urmannoe, Danilovo Lake and Potenoe.  Shaitan Lake is located near the mysterious village of Okunevo (a few words will be said below).  This pond is surrounded by swamps, and getting to it is not so easy.  It is believed that the road opens only to the elite.  But you can use the services of local guides.  The water in the lake is considered "dead", so even the locals do not dare to swim in it.  They say that the apparent transparency of the water is very deceiving, and the lake has a double bottom. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  According to another legend, under the bottom of the lake stands the temple of the monkey god - Hanuman.  In Kashtyrsky district is Lake Urmannoe, the water in which is also considered healing.  Danilovo Lake is located near Urmanny.  The reservoir has an elongated shape.  The length of the lake is about eight hundred meters, and the width is five hundred.  The depth reaches sixteen meters.  It is believed that this water contains a large amount of silver, however, as in the other four lakes.  Therefore, such a vodice is able to save the suffering from any ailments, and it does not deteriorate in closed vessels for many years.  The lurking lake is the most mysterious of all five.  The fact is that no one has been able to detect him yet.  According to legend, it is located somewhere among the marshes, on the right bank of the Tara River.  Well, the fifth body of water is Lake Linevo.  It will be discussed in this article. </p><h2>  Where is Lake Linevo located? </h2><p>  This body of water is located in the Omsk Region, west of Lake Danilovo, at the foot of the fortresses of the <span>Kuznetsk Alatau,</span> not far from the Sharypovo-Goryachegorsk road.  Near the river Tara. </p><h2>  Description of the lake </h2><p>  The lake is an irregular oval.  The size of this natural reservoir is approximately five hundred by three hundred meters.  Depth is eleven meters.  A large number of various fish is found in the lake: pike, tench, roach, perch and other species.  The vegetation of the reservoir is no less diverse: cattail, fancy algae, water lilies.  There are a huge number of them.  By the way, according to claims, the presence of water lilies indicates clean water.  But that Linevo Lake <span>(Krasnoyarsk Territory) is</span> clean, you will understand only by looking at the water surface.  Water is transparent in depth by two and a half meters.  The banks here are sloping, but the eastern shore is quite steep.  The lake is surrounded by a picturesque mixed forest, which is dominated by conifers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Linevo Lake 2014" class="if" height="284" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13530/468107.jpg" width="510"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to get to Lake Linevo from Sharypovo? </h2><p>  This body of water is very popular not only among local tourists - people come here from all over our country.  Someone, believing the legend, wants to improve their health, someone is interested in fishing, while others just want to enjoy the beautiful nature and swim in the famous lakes.  Let's figure out how to get to this mysterious reservoir.  Arriving in Krasnoyarsk (Sharypovo is 360 km from here), keep the path to the city of Achinsk.  There you will turn to the village of Nazarovo, and after eighteen kilometers you will see a turn to Sharypovo.  Without turning anywhere, go straight: Lake Linevo (Sharypovo) is located twenty-five kilometers from the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Linevo Lake photo" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13530/468105.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get to Lake Linevo from Omsk? </h2><p>  If you keep the path in the direction of Omsk - Linevo Lake, then follow this route.  From Omsk you need to get to the village of Muromtsevo.  Then you need to turn right, to Karbiza, and only then drive to the village of Kondratyevo.  From there to the lake - eight kilometers of a real Siberian country road, with pits and potholes.  It should be noted that in rainy weather you can hardly overcome this path by car.  Two hundred and thirty kilometers from Omsk to the lake, but due to the fact that the roads are very poor, it will take about four hours to get there. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest on the lake Linevo" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13530/468103.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Rest on the lake Linevo </h2><p>  On the shore there are seating areas, there are tables with benches.  There are also several wooden houses, but they need to be reserved in advance.  If you went to Lake Linevo (the photo is presented in the article) by your own car, then you will be charged four hundred rubles to enter the territory.  Since the shore is gentle, you can easily find a place for a campground.  It should be noted that at the weekend on the lake it is very crowded.  Therefore, if you want to retire, you will have to spend some time looking for a suitable place.  There are several small stalls in the recreation center where you can buy both alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks and snacks.  But the prices here are several times more expensive than in the city.  At your service - three Russian baths.  Having plenty of steam, you can immediately dive into the pond.  But you also need to reserve places in the bath in advance.  For lovers of outdoor activities equipped with a volleyball court.  True, there are always plenty of people who want to do this sport - you may not have time to get into the team of players.  In the evening, arrange a disco.  All those who visited Lake Linevo leave the best reviews, but perhaps this is not a good place for couples with young children: it is very noisy. </p>

    <h2>  Chalet "Fazenda" </h2><p>  Those wishing to spend more than one day on the lake are better off using the services of tourist camps, which are plentiful here.  Some of them will be described below.  And we‚Äôll start the excursion from the recreation center called ‚ÄúFazenda‚Äù.  This camp site is suitable for those people who love noisy fun and big companies.  Here you can fully enjoy the wonderful nature, go fishing, cook kebabs.  And also wander through the forest, where, perhaps, you will be able to see and feed the chipmunks, squirrels and wild ducks.  You can arrange excursions to the other three lakes, which are nearby.  Every year in August, a festival of an author‚Äôs song called OM Legends is held on the territory of the base.  Chalet "Fazenda" is located on the shore of the lake.  The staff will provide you with comfortable rooms.  Let's look at other recreation centers on Lake Linevo. </p><h2>  Chalet "Linevsky coast" </h2><p>  This tourist base is also located on the banks of the reservoir.  It is very popular not only among local residents, but also among visitors.  And this is no coincidence.  Good location, beautiful nature, well-established infrastructure - all this attracts many guests here.  On the territory there are specially equipped places for rest: gazebos with tables, a clean beach, changing rooms, toilets.

An excellent solution would be to send the child to the Brigantine children's recreation and educational camp.  It is located on the right bank of Lake Lineva, in a birch grove.

    <p>  Of course, each parent is concerned about the issue of nutrition.  Here you can reassure dads and mothers: your child will not be hungry - six meals a day are provided in the camp.  As for the rest on the water, here you can also not worry: swimming takes place only under the supervision of counselors.  In addition, the bottom of the reservoir is constantly cleaned by divers, and the water temperature is more than comfortable - 25 degrees.  Your child will really like the Brigantine Children's Camp, and he will return home rested, sunburned and full of energy. </p><h2>  Travel Tips </h2><p>  If you decide to visit Lake Linevo, it is worth remembering that the nearest shops are at least twelve kilometers away, and the products that are sold on the shore are very expensive.  Therefore, it is better to bring everything you need with you.  This is especially true for medicines and infant formulas.  If you decide to go fishing, then at the camps you can rent everything you need.  And further.  In rainy weather, it is better to abandon the trip, as there is every chance of getting stuck tightly on wet roads. </p><h2>  Fans of unexplained phenomena </h2><p>  Finally, one cannot fail to say about the unusual phenomena that, according to local residents, occur on the Omsk five lakes.  Okunevo is a small village, it is located on a steep bank of the Tara River.  Representatives of various faiths and beliefs live in Okunevo.  There is a legend that claims that this village is the cradle of civilization.  Locals often observe <span>unexplained phenomena:</span> luminous balls and spots.  In the forest and around the settlement, many trees have a bizarre shape: twisted trunks with cut tops.  At different times, villagers saw pillars of light and girls in fancy sundresses in the glades.  And sometimes transparent women in mournful poses appear in the sky above the village.  Psychics claim that on the territory of Okunev there is a powerful energy center, a gateway to a parallel world.  Is it a fiction or the truth - everyone decides for himself.  But be that as it may, be sure to come to the lakes, you will be charged with energy from the local nature for sure.  You‚Äôll also have plenty of fishing, and you will certainly want to come here again and again. </p>
