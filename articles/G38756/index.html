This little thing can be as decorative as it is functional.  And a made do-it- <span>yourself tack</span> made of fabric will be a pleasant gift not only on holiday, but also just like that, without any reason.  In addition, in almost every house you can find a bunch of things that are a pity to throw away, but somehow the hands do not reach to be remade, or simply the remaining rags are so small that it is impossible to create a full-fledged thing from them.  It is from such material that a do-it-yourself tack can be made of fabric, the master class of which will be discussed later. </p><h2>  What can be tack </h2><p>  Any tack should be comfortable above all.  But in addition, it should be well washed and fit perfectly into the overall design of the kitchen.  And of course, the tack must be beautiful. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself tack made of fabric" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30716/748706.jpg"></div>  Before creating kitchen do-it-yourself potholders from the fabric left in home chests of drawers, take a look around and find out what style is present in the room.  If the rural style prevails, then it is better to make potholders in the form of patchwork village rugs.  For hi-tech style, simple shapes and monophonic coloring are suitable.  And if the kitchen is bright, then oven mitts in the form of fruits or animals will perfectly fit here.  Of course, you can buy the material specifically, especially if you are going to create a whole gift set.

The main thing is that they are convenient for the hostess who will use them.  The shape can be round, square, in the form of a heart and even in the form of animals or dolls.  A do-it-yourself grab from a fabric can be made quite simply, in only two parts, and can consist of a huge number of different shreds. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself tack made of fabric master class" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30716/748702.jpg" width="600"></div>  Original potholders in the form of dolls will be a wonderful decoration of any kitchen.  In size, they may be small.  These are worn on one hand.  But also the size of the tack can allow you to grab the dishes on both sides.  Such options are usually elongated and pockets for hands on both sides.

    <h2>  Tack material </h2><p>  Of all existing fabrics, cotton or linen are best suited for tacking.  Such material is perfectly erased and heat-resistant.  These qualities are great for creating potholders.  <span>Synthetic fabrics</span> can melt on contact with a hot surface.  Drape is good.  This is due to the fact that it conducts heat poorly, which means that additional laying with a synthetic winterizer will not be needed.  In addition, the products from the drape do not require edge treatment at all, which is not only very convenient, but also saves time for making such a tack. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Do-it-yourself tack made of fabric.  Easy to perform </h2><p>  If you decide to try to create such a little thing for the first time, then pay attention to the simplest options.  It is best to start with the most usual tack, which consists of two halves. </p>

A do-it-yourself tack from fabric for beginners is easy to sew.  The material for its creation should be easily processed.  If you pick up complex products for your first job, then most likely you will abandon this business halfway and you will certainly not get anything in the end but disappointment.  And moving from simple to complex, you will notice that the process is becoming increasingly exciting.

    <h2>  Necessary tools and materials </h2><p>  What is needed so that in the end you get a do-it-yourself tack made of fabric?  Patterns - this is perhaps the first thing to prepare.  As a rule, in simple tacks, the pattern is simply drawn on paper in the form of a circle or square and cut out. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself fabric tack" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30716/748704.jpg"></div>  Sometimes contours can be immediately drawn directly onto the fabric, and sometimes it is better to make a paper blank, for example, for a heart-shaped tack with pockets for fingers.  In addition to patterns, it is necessary to prepare fabric blanks in an amount of two.  For one and the other.  And also one piece of the desired form of synthetic winterizer, which should be placed between the fabric.  You will also need a tape to edge the product.  Well, of course, you can not do without a ruler, pins, threads, scissors, as well as a tool for applying a picture to the fabric.  It can be a crayon, a piece of soap, a simple pencil or a self-disappearing marker.  There is already - what you prefer.

    <h2>  Sewing process </h2><p>  An ordinary do-it-yourself tack from a fabric is created quite easily and for a short time.  First we make a ‚Äúsandwich‚Äù from the blanks.  First, the fabric is laid with the wrong side up, then the synthetic winterizer, and then again the fabric, but with the front side up.  Now chop all three layers with pins or sweep them together. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself fabric tack for beginners" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30716/748705.jpg"></div>  Sew stitches with a sewing machine.  They can be straight, but you can also use curly stitches to sew stitches.  This will add some feature to even the simplest workpiece.  Now you need to fold the fringing strip in half and iron it well.  Such a strip is cut along the oblique from the fabric, or you can simply buy it already ready and even ironed.  After that, all sections of the fringing strip are bent to the inside and ironed again.  The whole tack is sheathed with a fringing strip, a loop is made, and the whole product is ironed again.  That's all - the tack is ready.

    <h2>  Patchwork for kitchen gloves </h2><p>  If you use the patchwork technique, then you can create both a very simple and very complex do-it-yourself tack made of fabric.  The scheme for such a product would not be superfluous. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY fabric tack" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30716/748707.jpg" width="508"></div>  You can come up with it yourself or use the finished one.  The simplest patchwork version of such a product will be a square consisting of smaller squares.  Make a cardboard blank, for example, with a side of five centimeters and cut such squares from different fabric flaps in the quantity necessary for you.  Do not forget that these squares on all sides should have allowances for seams in the amount of one centimeter.  You can stitch them in a checkerboard pattern or build some specific sequence and mark it on your diagram.  And then connect the square elements with each other, guided by their notation.  First, create strips from square parts, and then already connect these strips into a square half of a tack.  If you choose the right color, then even such a simple product will look very interesting.  After both halves of the flaps are created, proceed to sewing, which has already been considered earlier.

    <h2>  Tack with applique </h2><p>  The created do-it-yourself tack made of fabric can be decorated with applique elements.  Moreover, there can be a lot of such elements in one product.  Experienced craftswomen are able to create whole pictures using fabric applications even on small products.  To complete the application, you need to prepare a sketch of the future image.  Then divide this sketch into separate elements that you can cut from fabric and sew on.  When the preparation of the sketch is completed, select the appropriate material and cut out all the elements; in this case, stocks are not needed.  You can sew all the details manually or use a sewing machine.  First, an application is made on one of the halves of the tack, and then the product is sewn together by the method already known to us. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY do-it-yourself tack" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30716/748701.jpg"></div>  You can complement the applique with embroidery to make smaller details and even painted with acrylics <span>on fabric</span> or beads.  Such products are more used to decorate the room than for its intended purpose.
