    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get to the Blue Lakes (Chernihiv region) </h2><p>  Three reservoirs are located near the border with Belarus.  So close that mobile phones are constantly switching to roaming.  Lakes are 205 kilometers from Kiev.  You need to go along the Chernihiv highway for about three and a half hours.  Having passed the regional center, you should head for the village of Oleshnya.  There is no railway station in the village.  But from Chernihiv in that direction, three times a day, the train goes to the stop "Grybova Rudnya".  The train goes there for about an hour.  To get from the "Mushroom Rudny" to the Blue Lakes (Chernihiv region, Repkinsky district), you need to walk along a beautiful road among a pine forest less than a kilometer.  An asphalt highway leads to the reservoirs themselves, so there are always a lot of people there on a summer weekend.  Come and Chernihiv.  After all, the train schedule is very convenient.  You can come in the morning and leave for lunch or in the evening. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest on blue lakes Chernihiv region" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/923792.jpg" width="599"></div>

    <h2>  How lakes formed </h2><p>  It is hard to believe that these ponds are man-made.  And even more incredible seems the fact that the Blue Lakes (Chernihiv region) were formed as a result of industrial activity.  There was once mined fine <span>quartz sand</span> for the production of glass.  As a result, the workings reached the artesian layer.  Now, former quarries were filled with clear water from the depths.  The smallest quartz sand covers them.  The sun's rays, refracting, give the lake water a bright aquamarine hue.  Therefore, the reservoirs received the name Blue.  The lake is surrounded by a pine forest.  In addition to the healing air, drunk with the smells of pine needles, tourists can enjoy amazing water.  It treats diseases of the musculoskeletal system.  Well water procedures affect the condition of the skin and hair.  Therefore, swimming in the lakes can be called "baths of health and beauty." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Blue lakes Chernihiv region recreation center" class="if" height="354" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/923798.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How many Blue Lakes actually </h2><p>  Kievans and other visitors are sure that there are three reservoirs.  They are called unpretentiously, but for sure: Big, Medium and Small.  All tourism infrastructure is concentrated on the first reservoir.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Big Blue Lake is 20 hectares.  But even with such a long coastline in the weekend there is not enough space for everyone who wants to relax in this wonderful place.  And every year, more than two hundred and fifty thousand tourists from Ukraine and neighboring countries come to the Blue Lakes.  Chernihiv region is rich in other attractions.  What are the ancient churches in the regional center!  And one and a half kilometers from the lakes, in the village of Oleshnya, there is a museum-estate of Sofia Lindfors-Rusova, a famous teacher of the 19th century.  Now on its territory is a tourist complex.  The middle lake was chosen by fishermen, since its banks are steep.  Locals go to Maloe - there are remedies for healing clay that heals joints.  If you go further towards Belarus, you will come across another flooded quarry.  This lake has extremely soft water.  But the high forest along the shores does not let in the sun's rays.  Therefore, swimming there is cool. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Blue lakes prices Chernihiv region" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/923827.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Tourist infrastructure </h2><p>  Reviews of people who visited the Blue Lakes ten years ago are very different from those left by tourists who visited their careers this year.  Off-road driving with all the necessary products, living in a deserted wilderness and toilets under a pine have long sunk into oblivion.  Now rest on the Blue Lakes (Chernihiv region) has changed dramatically.  You can go here with a tent, as before.  But you can install it for 50 hryvnias on an equipped campsite.  Entrance to the Big Lake remained free.  But when various cultural events and festivals are held, you need to buy a ticket.  At Bolshoi there are two dedicated beach areas.  One of them is for those who have come overnight.  Here you have cottages, and secure parking, and a cafe, and a grill bar, and a wood-fired sauna.  The surface of the lake is cut by catamarans, jet skis.  There is also a slide and other beach activities.  Litter bins and picnic tables have been set along the shores. </p><h2>  Where to stay </h2><p>  Tents (own or rented on site) are the most popular accommodation for those who come for a weekend to the Blue Lakes (Chernihiv region).  <span>The recreation center</span> is an alternative.  The one located directly on the shore has summer houses with a minimum of amenities.  But there is also a warm cabin designed for four people.  More comfortable conditions are offered in the eco-estate ‚ÄúAt the Village at the Grandfather‚Äù, in the private cottage ‚ÄúBlue Lakes‚Äù, in the tourist complex ‚ÄúEstate of Sofia Rusovoi‚Äù.  These recreation facilities are located within a mile from water bodies.  On their territory there are cafes, barbecue facilities, hookah bars and other public catering places.  On the shore, there is only a kiosk where you can buy beer, ice cream, snacks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest in Ukraine" class="if" height="425" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/923801.jpg" width="600"></div>
