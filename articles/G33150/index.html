    <h2>  The son of the hero Yesugei </h2><p>  Temujin - as Genghis Khan, the future ruler of Mongolia and Northern China was named at birth - was born in a small tract Delun-Boldok, sheltered on the banks <span>of the Onon River.</span>  He was the son of an inconspicuous local leader Yesugei, who nevertheless wore the title of bagatura, which means "hero".  He was awarded such an honorary title for the victory over the Tatar leader Tmujin-Ugra.  In battle, proving to his opponent who is who and captivating him, he, along with other booty, captured his wife Oelun, who became nine months later the mother of Temujin. </p><p>  The exact date of this event, which was reflected in the course of world history, is still not exactly established, but the most probable year is 1155.  Reliable information was also not preserved about how his early years went, but it is known for certain that already at the age of nine, Yesugei, in one of the neighboring tribes, married his son a bride named Borte in one of the neighboring tribes.  By the way, personally for him this matchmaking ended very sadly: on the way back he was poisoned by the Tatars, in which he and his son stopped for the night. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Years of wandering and misfortune </h2><p>  From a young age, the formation of Genghis Khan took place in an environment of a merciless struggle for survival.  As soon as his fellow tribesmen learned about the death of Yesugai, they left his widows (the ill-fated warrior had two wives) and children (who also had a lot of them) left to the mercy of fate, and, taking all their property, went into the steppe.  An orphaned family wandered for several years, on the verge of starvation. </p><p>  The early years of Genghis Khan (Temujin) coincided with the period when, in the steppes that became his homeland, the local tribal leaders fought a fierce struggle for power, the purpose of which was to subjugate the remaining nomads.  One of these contenders - the head of the Taichiut tribe Targutay-Kiriltukh (a distant relative of his father) even captivated the young man, seeing him as a future rival, and kept him in wooden blocks for a long time. </p>

    <h2>  Fur coat that turned the history of peoples </h2><p>  But fate was pleased to grant freedom to a young captive, who managed to deceive his tormentors and break free.  The first conquest of Genghis Khan dates back to this time.  It turned out to be the heart of the young beauty Borte - his named bride.  Temujin went to her, barely finding freedom.  A beggar, with traces of pads on his wrists, he was an unenviable groom, but is it possible to embarrass a girl's heart? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As a dowry, Father Borte presented his son-in-law with a luxurious sable coat, with which, although this seems incredible, the ascent of the future Asian conqueror began.  No matter how great the temptation to show off in expensive furs, Temujin preferred otherwise to dispose of a wedding present. </p><p>  With him, he went to the most powerful steppe leader at that time - the head of the Kereite tribe, Tooril Khan, and offered him this unique value, not forgetting to accompany the gift with a suitable occasion.  This move was very far-sighted.  Having lost his fur coat, Temujin acquired a powerful patron, in alliance with whom he began his path of conqueror. </p><h2>  The beginning of the way </h2><p>  With the support of such a powerful ally as Tooril Khan, the legendary conquests of Genghis Khan began.  The table given in the article shows only the most famous of them, which have become historically significant.  But they could not have taken place without victories in the small, local battles that paved him the path to world fame. </p>

    <p>  While raiding residents of neighboring uluses, he tried to shed less blood and, if possible, keep his opponents alive.  This was not done at all out of humanism, which was alien to the inhabitants of the steppes, but in order to attract the defeated to their side and thereby replenish the ranks of their troops.  He willingly accepted to himself and nukers - foreigners who were ready to serve for a share of the booty stolen in campaigns. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  However, the first years of Genghis Khan's rule were often overshadowed by annoying miscalculations.  Once he went on another raid, leaving his camp without protection.  The Merkit tribe took advantage of this, the soldiers of which, in the absence of the owner, attacked and, having plundered their property, took all the women with them, including his beloved wife Bothe.  Only with the help of the same Tooril Khan did Temujin succeed, having defeated the Merkits, to return his missus. </p><h2>  Victory over Tatars and capture of East Mongolia </h2><p>  Each new conquest of Genghis Khan raised his prestige among the steppe nomads and brought him to the ranks of the main rulers of the region.  Around 1186, he created his own ulus - a kind of feudal state.  Having concentrated all power in his hands, he established a strictly delineated power vertical in the territory subordinate to him, where all the key posts were occupied by his close associates. </p><p>  The defeat of the Tatars became one of the largest victories with which the conquests of Genghis Khan began.  The table given in the article relates this event to the year 1200, but a series of armed clashes began five years earlier.  At the end of the XII century, the Tatars experienced difficult times.  Their camps were constantly attacked by a strong and dangerous enemy - the troops of the Chinese emperors of the Jin dynasty. </p>

    <p>  Taking advantage of this, Temujin joined the Jin forces and, together with them, fell upon the enemy.  In this case, his main goal was not prey, which he willingly shared with the Chinese, but the weakening of the Tatars who stood in his way to undivided dominion in the steppes.  Having achieved what he wanted, he took control of almost the entire territory of Eastern Mongolia, becoming its undivided ruler, since the influence of the Jin dynasty in this area was noticeably weakened. </p><h2>  Conquest of the Transbaikal Territory </h2><p>  We should pay tribute not only to the leadership talent of Temujin, but also to his diplomatic abilities.  Skillfully manipulating the ambition of the tribal leaders, he always directed their enmity in a direction favorable to him.  By entering into military alliances with his enemies yesterday and treacherously attacking his recent friends, he always knew how to be a winner. </p><p>  After the conquest of the Tatars in 1202, Genghis Khan's aggressive campaigns began in the Trans-Baikal Territory, where the tribes of the Taijiuts settled on vast wild expanses.  It was not an easy campaign, in one of the battles of which the khan was dangerously wounded by an enemy arrow.  However, in addition to rich trophies, he brought the khan confidence in his abilities, since the victory was won alone, without the support of allies. </p><h2>  The title of the great khan and the code of laws "Yasa" </h2><p>  The next five years were a continuation of his conquest of the many peoples living in the territory of Mongolia.  From victory to victory, his power grew and the army increased, replenished due to yesterday‚Äôs opponents who had switched over to his service.  In the early spring of 1206, Temujin was proclaimed the great khan with the assignment of the highest title of "kagan" and the name Chingiz (water conqueror), with whom he went down in world history. </p>

    <p>  The years of the reign of Genghis Khan became a period when the whole life of the peoples subject to him was regulated by the laws he developed, the set of which was called Yasa.  The main place in it was occupied by articles prescribing the provision of comprehensive mutual assistance in the campaign and, under pain of punishment, prohibiting the deceit of a person who trusted in something. </p><p>  It is curious, but according to the laws of this half-wild ruler, fidelity, even shown by the enemy in relation to his sovereign, was considered one of the highest virtues.  For example, a prisoner who did not want to renounce his former master was considered worthy of respect and was willingly accepted into the army. </p><p>  To strengthen the <span>vertical of power</span> during the life of Genghis Khan, the entire population subject to him was divided into tens of thousands (Tumens), thousands and hundreds.  A leader was placed above each group, its head (literally) responsible for the loyalty of its subordinates.  This made it possible to keep a huge number of people in strict submission. </p><p>  Every adult and healthy man was considered a warrior and at the first signal he was obliged to take up arms.  In general, at that time, the army of Genghis Khan was about 95 thousand people, constrained by iron discipline.  The slightest disobedience or cowardice shown in battle was punishable by death. </p><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><caption>  The main conquests of the troops of Genghis Khan </caption><tbody><tr><td>  Event </td><td>  date </td></tr><tr><td>  The victory of Temujin‚Äôs troops over the Naiman tribe </td><td>  1199 year </td></tr><tr><td>  The victory of Temujin's forces over the Taichiut tribe </td><td>  1200 year </td></tr><tr><td>  The defeat of the Tatar tribes </td><td>  1200 year </td></tr><tr><td>  Victory over the Kereites and Taijuit </td><td>  1203 year </td></tr><tr><td>  Victory over the Naiman tribe led by Tayan Khan </td><td>  1204 year </td></tr><tr><td>  Genghis Khan's attacks on the Tangut state of Xi Xia </td><td>  1204 year </td></tr><tr><td>  The conquest of Beijing </td><td>  1215 year </td></tr><tr><td>  Conquest of Genghis Khan Central Asia </td><td>  1219-1223 year </td></tr><tr><td>  The victory of the Mongols, led by Subedey and Jebe on <span>the Kalka River</span> over the Russian-Polovtsian army </td><td>  1223 year </td></tr><tr><td>  The conquest of the capital and state of Xi Xia </td><td>  1227 year </td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  A New Way of Conquest </h2><p>  In 1211, the conquest of the peoples of Transbaikalia and Siberia by Genghis Khan almost ended.  From all ends of this vast land tribute flocked to him.  But his rebellious soul did not find rest.  Ahead was Northern China - a country whose emperor once helped him defeat the Tatars and, having gained strength, rise to a new level of power. </p><p>  Four years before the start of the Chinese campaign, wanting to secure the route of his troops, Genghis Khan captured and plundered the Tangut kingdom of Xi Xia.  In the summer of 1213, he, having managed to capture the fortress that covered the passage in the Great Wall of China, invaded the territory of the state of Jin.  His campaign was swift and victorious.  Caught by surprise, many cities surrendered without a fight, and a number of Chinese military leaders sided with the invaders. </p>

    <p>  When North China was conquered, Genghis Khan moved his troops to Central Asia, where they were also lucky.  Having conquered vast expanses, he reached Samarkand, from where he continued his journey, conquering Northern Iran and a significant part of the Caucasus. </p><h2>  Genghis Khan's Campaign in Russia </h2><p>  To conquer the Slavic lands in 1221-1224, Genghis Khan sent two of his most experienced commanders - Subedei and Jebe.  Having crossed the Dnieper, they invaded the territory of Kievan Rus at the head of a large army.  Not hoping to defeat the enemy on their own, the Russian princes made an alliance with their longtime enemies - the Polovtsy. </p><p>  The battle took place on May 31, 1223 in the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov, on the Kalka River.  It ended in the <span>rout of the Russian-Polovtsian</span> troops.  Many historians see the reason for the failure in the arrogance of Prince Mstislav Udatny, who crossed the river and started the battle before the approach of the main forces.  The desire of the prince alone to cope with the enemy turned into his own death and death of many other governors.  Such a tragedy for the defenders of the fatherland turned out to be Genghis Khan‚Äôs campaign in Russia.  But ahead of them were waiting for even more difficult trials. </p>

    <h2>  The last conquest of Genghis Khan </h2><p>  The conqueror of Asia died in the late summer of 1227 during his second campaign against the state of Si Xia.  Even in winter, he began the siege of his capital - Zhongxing, and, having exhausted the forces of the city‚Äôs defenders, he was preparing to accept their surrender.  This was the last conquest of Genghis Khan.  Suddenly, he felt ill and fell down, and after a short time he died.  Not excluding the possibility of poisoning, researchers tend to see the cause of death in the complications caused by an injury received shortly before falling from a horse. </p><p>  The exact burial place of the great khan is unknown, as is the very date of his last hour.  In Mongolia, where the tract Delyun-Boldok was once located, in which, according to legend, Genghis Khan was born, today a monument erected in his honor stands. <sub></sub></p>
