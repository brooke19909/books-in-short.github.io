    <h2>  <span>Cathedrals, churches</span> and palaces </h2><p>  If you figured out the city center, you can move on.  One of the main and most important sights of Valladolid can be considered the Cathedral.  This cultural and religious value began to be built back in 1582, more than four hundred years ago, and has not been fully completed to this day.  Having entered this huge building, you can walk inside several exhibition halls of the city museum located directly in the cathedral, examine, for example, many valuable relics, which include a large stone altar.  It has not only religious value, but also cultural value - made in the Baroque style, this altar attracts the attention of many professional art historians, not to mention tourists.  Near the cathedral is the church of Santa Maria la Antigua, as well as the old palace of Pimentel, the former residence of the kings, and today the government is located there. </p>

    <h2>  National Museum of Sculpture </h2><p>  The imagination of tens of thousands of tourists cannot fail to capture the pinnacle of architectural creativity - the National Museum of Sculpture.  The building itself is already a masterpiece: unimaginable frescoes, many walls and ceilings decorated with hand- <span>carved stone</span> - together with the high severity of the walls, more reminiscent of a fortress, not a museum building.  Inside, there are no less impressive collections of wooden sculptures, as well as frequently changing expositions, which will be interesting to see for anyone visiting Valladolid. </p>

    <h2>  Universities and schools </h2><p>  Another noteworthy building worth seeing is Universidad.  Valladolid (Spain), whose photo of attractions is presented in the article, is also famous for such monuments as the National Museum of Sculpture and the Cathedral, so do not miss the opportunity to see everything with your own eyes.  Tourists and a guide lead along the same route, telling in detail about all the sights.  So, Universidad, as you can understand, even without knowing Spanish at all, is an ancient university building.  It was discovered more than five hundred years ago, and like any old monumental building, it attracts the attention of travelers.  The facade of the building is decorated with symbols of sciences, thereby giving it an extraordinary medieval poetry.  Directly opposite the university, the Santa Cruz School is located, like all the old buildings in the city - it is decorated with unique stone carvings. </p>

    <h2>  Legacy of Castile </h2><p>  It is in Valladolid that a tourist can feel the depth and originality of the culture of Castile, the medieval severity of fortresses and Catholic cathedrals, see the unique and exciting stone paintings on most of the old buildings that excite the imagination of any traveler.  The Valladolid people themselves are very sensitive to their cultural heritage, preserving some of the city corners since the time of the early Middle Ages.  Small, narrow streets seem to carry us into <span>chivalrous novels,</span> and the baroque-style buildings <span>,</span> which are breathtaking for people who are used to the gray landscapes of the panel neighborhoods, will become a kind of revelation from above.  Excursions in the city are carried out mainly along the same route as the sequence with which we described the sights of the city.  And besides this there is something to see, the historical center of the city is literally dotted with large medieval mansions.  There are more than a dozen magnificent churches and huge castles. </p>
