  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Human activities and their forms</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Activity is exclusively human activity, which is regulated by consciousness.  It is generated by needs, and is aimed at transforming the world around us, as well as its knowledge. </p><p>  Man, using his motives and needs, one way or another transforms the external environment, and this process is creative.  At this time, he becomes the subject, and what he masters and transforms - the object. </p><p>  In this article we will consider the main <span>types of</span> human <span>activities</span> , as well as their forms, but before proceeding with this, it is necessary to clarify a few points. </p><ol><li>  <span>The subject and the object of</span> activity are inextricably linked: the essence of man is manifested in his activity.  Inactive people do not exist in the same way as the activity itself without a person. </li><li>  Human activities are aimed at transforming the environment.  <span>Unlike animals, a person</span> is able to organize such living conditions for himself to be comfortable.  For example, instead of collecting plants or catching animals daily for food, he grows them. </li><li>  Activity is a creative act.  Man creates something new: cars, food, even displays new types of plants. </li></ol><p>  <strong>Human <span>activities</span> and structure</strong> </p><p>  There are three types of human activity: play, labor, and teaching.  They are basic, and its activities are not limited to these species. </p><p>  There are 6 structural components of activity that are formed in a hierarchical order.  First, there is a need for activity, then a motive is formed, which is clothed in a more vivid and concrete form in the form of a goal.  After that, a person searches for means that can help him achieve what he wants, and after finding it, he proceeds to action, the final stage of which is the result. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Human <span>activities</span> : labor</strong> </p><p>  There is a separate science that is aimed at studying the working conditions of a person and optimizing his work </p><p>  The work includes such activities, which are aimed at obtaining practical benefits.  Labor requires knowledge, skills and abilities.  Moderate work has a good effect on the general condition of a person: he thinks faster and is guided in new areas, and also gets experience, thanks to which he is capable of further more complex activities. </p><p>  It is believed that labor is certainly a conscious activity in which a person interacts with the world around him.  Any work is appropriate and requires a focus on results. </p><p>  <strong>Human activities: teaching</strong> </p><p>  Doctrine has one main goal - the acquisition of knowledge or skills.  This type allows a person to begin more complex work, which requires special training.  Learning can be organized as when a person consciously goes to school, enters a university, where professionals teach him, or unorganized when a person gains knowledge as experience in the process of work.  Self-education is singled out in a separate category. </p><p>  <strong>Human activities: game</strong> </p><p>  Simply put, this is a vacation.  A person needs him, because the game allows you to relax the nervous system and psychologically distract from serious topics.  Games also contribute to development: for example, active games teach dexterity, and intellectual ones develop thinking.  Modern computer games (action) help improve concentration and attention. </p><p>  <strong>Human activities</strong> </p><p>  There are many forms of human activity, but they are divided into two main groups: mental and physical labor. </p><p>  <span>Intellectual activity</span> is the processing of information.  The process requires increased attention, good memory and flexible thinking. </p><p>  Physical labor requires a large expenditure of energy, since muscles are involved in its process, a load is placed on the musculoskeletal system, as well as the cardiovascular system. </p><p>  Thus, we can conclude that activity is a necessary and unique life parameter that contributes to human development. </p>
