Beer has a full malt flavor, golden color, the presence of moderate hop bitterness and excellent foam.  It is a characteristic representative of light dense "sunbeds".  It is a sample of real barley beer, which is brewed taking into account the strictest German traditions.  Alc .: 4.5%. </li><li>  Wheat light unfiltered.  The drink has a peculiar aroma with carefully selected delicate hop bitterness.  Users call it residually pleasant and easy to use.  In the production of this variety, exclusively high-quality German malt and aromatic <span>atec hops are used.</span>  Alc .: 4.5%. </li><li>  Dark barley unfiltered.  Beer is quite dense.  It has a rich taste.  The production combines light and caramel malt, which gives the beer a pronounced taste and soft light aroma of toasted malt.  A note of soft hop bitterness is also felt.  The drink has good foaming.  It is called the pride of the enterprise.  Alc .: 5.0%. </li><li>  Beer "Marathon".  Brewed specifically for a beer marathon!  The cost of 0.5 liters - 75 rubles. </li><li>  "Barsky sparkling."  Cost: 0.33 L - 57 rub., 0.5 L - 95 rub., 1 L - 190 rub. </li><li>  The Bavarian Porter.

For its production, different types of malt (dark, wheat, burnt), purified water, top fermenting yeast and two types of hops (bitter pearl from Germany and Czech aromatic zateck) are used. </li><li>  "Czech deserter."  The drink is brewed according to one of the recipes of Czech beer that never leaves the republic.  This drink is traditionally called a national treasure, part of the Czech Czech beer fund.  The recipe for this drink would not have been recognized abroad if it had not been accidentally discovered by a Czech who had settled in Russia.
