In general, you can get anywhere, and on foot. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About infrastructure </h2><p>  So, what can Baumanburi Hotel 4 * offer its potential guests?

    <h2>  Grand Deluxe and Family Apartment </h2><p>  A few words should be said about what are the best rooms in Baumanburi Hotel 4 *.  Reviews (TopHotels, by the way, contains a large number of them relative to the described hotel) help to understand that nevertheless the best choice here is a 2-seater ‚ÄúGrand Deluxe‚Äù.  Such apartments cost 74-82 thousand rubles for two people (with breakfast and for 14 nights). </p><p>  The conditions are excellent.  The room is comfortable, cozy, decorated in an interesting style, furnished with modern new furniture.  Two wide beds, characterized as single beds (although in reality 2 people can comfortably fit in there), pleasant bonuses as bathrobes and slippers, as well as other amenities are pleasing.  Wooden or parquet floors, a bathroom with shower, hairdryer, safe, flat-screen TV with cable channels, coffee maker with kettle, minibar ... The apartments really have all the necessary conditions for a comfortable stay and relaxation.  No wonder the guests are satisfied. </p><p>  And finally, a family suite is the most expensive option of all.  For five people - 302-324 thousand rubles for 2 weeks with breakfast.  But guests say that this is one of the best options, so this amount is really worth it.  And if there is such an opportunity to spend it on apartments, then there is no need to regret it.  Especially if you divide it into five, you get a little more than 60 thousand rubles for 2 weeks.  And this is about 4 thousand rubles a day, which is very cheap for Thailand. </p><p>  So, from the conditions - incredibly wide and comfortable beds, an area of ‚Äã‚Äã85 square meters, a spacious bathroom, a DVD player, a telephone, a pool view, a huge TV, a minibar and much more - all this is available in this category of rooms .  The best option if you want to relax with your family or a large company. </p>

    <h2>  About booking </h2><p>  Finally, a few words about how the booking process is carried out at Baumanburi Hotel 4 * (Phuket).  So, check-in and check-out is traditional - after 14:00 and in the afternoon, respectively.  Children are allowed to stay, and if the child is not 16 years old, then he does not need to pay the full price - only 400 THB from above.  If additional accommodation is required (that is, another person who is not registered as a guest, who also paid for the apartment), then you will have to pay 700 THB from the top.  You can put an extra bed in the room, but it will also be for an extra charge. </p><p>  In general, this hotel is ideal for a good time and comfortable stay.  People who have been here say that everything that is needed is combined in it.  Coziness with comfort, level of service with prices, atmosphere with decor.  Food, conditions, location - everything is on the level.  Everyone will find something to do here, starting with those who like to visit some piquant night club (there are plenty of them here) and ending with people who love shopping (there are also no shopping centers here).  And if you want to have a good rest - you should go here.  Only it is advisable to book a room for two months, otherwise there may not be any free apartments. </p>
