The head of the republic is the president. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Macedonia vacation" class="if" height="317" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20113/450344.jpg" width="400"></div>  Geographically, the country is located in the center of the Macedonian mountains, has no access to the sea.
