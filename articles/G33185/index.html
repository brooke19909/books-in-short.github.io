    <h2>  Remuneration: forms and systems </h2><p>  Typically, modern enterprises use the following forms and systems of remuneration: time-based (payroll according to salary, the calculation formula of which will be discussed below) and piecework. </p><p>  Piece-rate pay implies remuneration for the actual volume of work (the number of manufactured units of products or services provided) at the established rates for one unit.  Remuneration depends only on the number of units of products or services provided per month, does not depend on the amount of time spent or a fixed salary.  Piecework Forms: </p><ul><li>  piecework premium; </li><li>  simple; </li><li>  piecewise progressive; </li><li>  accordion, etc. </li></ul><p>  Time-based payment system involves payment of a salary or a fixed daily or hourly rate.

    <h2>  Remuneration for work on schedule </h2><p>  Often the question arises: "How to correctly calculate the wages of workers on a rolling schedule?"  or "How to calculate the salaries of the watchmen on schedule?" </p><p>  At enterprises, security guards (watchmen) often work according to a rolling schedule, and a monthly salary is stipulated by the labor contract. </p><p>  In this case, payment for the calendar month should be made according to the cumulative accounting of working time. </p><p>  With this accounting of working time at the enterprise: </p><ul><li>  Accounting for planned and actually worked hours is done by the hour; </li><li>  a regulatory local act establishes an accounting period (month, quarter, year, etc.); </li><li>  the amount of working time in the accounting period should not exceed the specified number of working hours; </li><li>  the number of working hours in the accounting period is set according to the amount of working time per working week (not more than forty hours per week); </li><li>  normative local act defines the rule for determining the hourly rate for the established salary: </li></ul><p>  Based on the planned norm of working hours of a calendar month according to the formula: </p><p>  hourly rate = salary / planned number of working hours of the calendar month for which the salary is calculated. </p><p>  Example: </p><ul><li>  monthly salary - 8300 rubles; </li><li>  salary is determined for July 2017; </li><li>  the planned number of hours in the month of July is 168 hours; </li><li>  hourly rate = 8300/168 = 49.40 rubles. </li></ul><p>  With this calculation, the hourly rate will depend on the specific month and "float" throughout the year. </p><p>  Or the second method, based on the average monthly number of slaves.  hours in a calendar year according to the formula: </p><p>  hour.  rate = salary / (the norm of working hours in hours in the calendar current year / 12 months). <strong><em><br></em></strong> </p><p>  Example: </p><ul><li>  in 2017 according to the production calendar with an 8-hour slave.  day and five-day slave.  week norm slave.  time is 1973 hours per year; </li><li>  monthly salary - 8300 rubles; </li><li>  hourly rate: 8300 / (1973/12) = 50.48 rubles. </li></ul><p>  With this calculation, the hourly rate is constant throughout the calendar year. </p><h2>  Payroll when working on schedule: an example </h2><p>  At the LLC Ogonyok enterprise it is established: </p><ul><li>  the established period of the total working time for accounting is a quarter; </li><li>  the tariff rate for the watchmen is 50 rubles per hour; </li><li>  the change is 16 hours - daytime, and 8 hours - nightly; </li><li>  surcharge for night time - 20%; </li><li>  for the first quarter, the watchman worked 8 days in January, 6 days in February, 9 days in March. </li></ul><p>  Payment for one shift of the guard is: (50 rubles x 16 hours) + (50 rubles x 8 hours) + (50 rubles x 8 hours. X 20%) = 1280 rubles. </p><p>  Salary is: </p><ul><li>  for January - 1280 rubles x 8 days = 10240 rubles; </li><li>  for February - 1280 rubles x 6 days = 7680 rubles; </li><li>  for March - 1280 rubles x 9 days = 11520 rubles. </li></ul><h2>  Dismissal payroll </h2><p>  Often the accountant has a question: "How to calculate the salary when leaving?" </p><p>  On the day of dismissal according to the Labor Code, the employer pays all employees the amount due to him on the payroll at the rate of: </p><ul><li>  wages for hours worked in the month of dismissal (the day of dismissal is paid as a working day); </li><li>  compensation for non-vacation leave; </li><li>  other compensation payments depending on the article of dismissal. </li></ul>
