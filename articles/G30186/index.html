Pupil of the hockey school "Torpedo".  For a long time he played in attack.  But, as the hockey player himself says, he always wanted to stand on goal.  As a child, he often went to hockey with his father, and he liked to watch goalkeepers.  One day, the coach invited him to try himself in this role.  When Nikolai Myshagin headed the Torpedo, Kolesnik played the main goalkeeper for three seasons. </p>

    <h2>  The saga of "Metallurg" </h2><p>  As part of the national team of Kazakhstan, Kolesnik Vitaliy Nikolaevich participated in the Olympic Games and the world championship in Austria.  The team took only tenth place, but Vitaliy became the second among goalkeepers.  Here, representatives of the Colorado drew attention to him.  At the same time, they offered to play for Metallurg, and in July Vitaly ended up in the Novokuznetsk club.  According to the results of the championship, ‚ÄúMetallurg‚Äù took one of the last places. </p><p>  In August, Vitaly spoke for the Novokuznetsk team for the LenVo prize.  But the representatives of Metallurg were in no hurry to conclude a contract, they were waiting for something, they looked closely.  Soon the agent called and said that ‚ÄúColorado‚Äù made a favorable offer to the hockey player.  They immediately realized that they were in Metallurg.  But by then the decision to sign a contract with Colorado had been made.  Vitaly Kolesnik went there without hesitation, as he always dreamed of the NHL. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Over the ocean </h2><p>  For two months he played at the Lowell Monsters Farm Club.  In early December 2005, they invited to Colorado, where Vitaly Kolesnik made his debut in the NHL against Boston.  The goalkeeper has three victories in the NHL.  But as Vitaly himself says, the most memorable is the game with the New Jersey Devils.  Then he repelled seven shot-goal shots.  In a match against the Phoenix, says the hockey player, he showed a not very good game.  Replaced already in the fourth minute.  And soon the hockey player went to the AHL. </p><p>  Over the year, an athlete in America has learned a lot: tactical training, attitude to work, physical and psychological stability.  So says Vitaly Kolesnik.  The hockey player believes that everything is completely different there.  Not like in Europe.  The speed, the number of throws, the intensity of the game are much higher.  You need to quickly pack up and react, as there is much less time to make a decision. </p><p>  At first, it was difficult to understand the nuances of the new rules.  Then I got used to it.  He does not regret anything - this is a great school for the goalkeeper.  In the spring of 2006, they offered to play again at the farm club, this did not suit, as he dreamed of playing at the highest level.  And he signed a three-year contract with Atlant in the summer of 2006. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  In Super League </h2><p>  There were suggestions from other teams, but the athlete preferred the ‚ÄúChemist‚Äù.  There are great coaches, an excellent roster, says Kolesnik Vitaliy.  The goalkeeper accepted Russian citizenship.  Despite this, for a long time he was considered a legionary in the Super League.  The club had to pay a tax for the hockey player, which is 9 million rubles.  In 2009, the goalkeeper transferred from the Super League to the Ufa Salavat Yulaev.  Then, from 2012 to 2015, he plays for Lokomotiv. </p>

    <h2>  Helmet with children's drawings </h2><p>  An interesting moment gave the KHL season in 2015 to not only hockey fans.  The goalkeeper‚Äôs act was widely covered in the press.  Vitaly Kolesnik decorated the helmet with children's drawings.  Usually goalkeepers are asked to draw on their helmet something related to a country or club.  The goalkeeper mask with children's drawings was a surprise not only for the fans, but also for the employees of the art studio who designed the helmet. </p><p>  The idea belongs to his wife Vitaly.  When they went with gifts to the orphanage, they saw in the eyes of the children a huge interest in a real hockey player.  They asked the children to draw drawings that should be associated with hockey and Lokomotiv.  The kids tried hard, because the drawings will then be applied to the goalkeeper mask.  Of course, I had to work hard enough when the children's drawings were transferred to the helmet, employees of the art studio recall.  But they are certain of one thing for sure: the children from the orphanage will remember this for life. </p>
