    <h2>  The beauty of the resort </h2><p>  The city itself is very beautiful, with various picturesque places and attractions.  It is located in Antalya.  This city is attractive to many.  Tourists coming to this place receive a huge amount of impressions and emotions - a golden tan, sunbathing, enjoying the azure sea and sandy beaches.  You can go yachting, go water skiing, surfing, diving - all the delights of a sea holiday are provided to visitors.  Local landscapes are also diverse, which combine the expanses of the Mediterranean Sea and the stunning peaks of the Taurus Mountains.  Of course, Kemer is inferior in size to Antalya, and significantly, but the infrastructure in these places is very developed.  Tourists take home a variety of things and souvenirs from Turkey, which for a long time will remind you of fun days.  But what does a person need for a complete comfortable rest?  Appropriate temporary housing.  <span>Hotel, hotel,</span> hostel, apartments - a cozy place where you could stay and comfortably live these days of vacation. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  External Benefits Club Beach <span>Park Hotel</span> 3 </h2><p>  This is not to say that this hotel attracts a lot of tourists, but guests are always there.  One of the main advantages is its own pebbly and sandy beach, located three hundred meters from Club Beach Park Hotel 3 itself. And to the sea there are a hundred meters.  Near the hotel there are discos, bars and restaurants.  Nearby is one of the main attractions of the city - the Ethnographic Museum.  Free mattresses, sun loungers and umbrellas are provided.  And, it should be noted, the very location of the hotel is very advantageous - the very center of Kemer.  The airport is also not very far, only 45 kilometers. </p>

    <h2>  but on the other hand </h2><p>  Based on the above, we can conclude that the hotel is pretty decent both in terms of the services provided and the location.  And the prices are not sky-high.  However, everywhere there is a ‚Äúbut‚Äù, and Club Beach Park Hotel 3 is no exception in this case. Reviews of guests who stayed at this place are different.  Many complain about food, claiming that it simply is not there.  But in fact, not everything is so bad, they are fed vegetables with a side dish at the hotel, and many are quite happy with such food during their holidays, especially since the hotel is economical. </p><p>  Tourists who are not resting for the first time at this hotel say that Club Beach Park Hotel 3 used to be completely different. Reviews confirm this.  Someone is not happy with the repair, others do not like the staff and service.  Some claim that there were problems with settlement.  Of course, unpleasant situations happen, but if the money is paid, then usually such problems are solved, and quickly. </p><h2>  Reviews of grateful guests </h2><p>  But wherever there is something bad, there is a place for good.  There are also grateful guests of Club Beach Park Hotel 3. Turkey is a welcoming country, and tourists will be welcomed at this hotel as well.  Probably, the diversity of reviews is due to the fact that, as mentioned earlier, a variety of people come to the hotel.  Perhaps someone is more finicky, and already rested in more comfortable conditions, so he did not like the service, service and rooms.  But to another person who bought a last minute package at an attractive price, and even settled in a three-star hotel, I like everything.  As they say, <span>everything is known in comparison.</span>  Apparently, this is exactly the case.  Many people go swimming in the sea, bask in the sun, get acquainted with the new culture and local attractions, so they only come to the hotel for the night, and they are completely happy, especially if they are initially positive. </p>

    <h2>  Meet by clothes </h2><p>  Another winged expression.  Usually people, before making a choice in favor of this or that hotel, look at its pictures.  Club Beach Park Hotel 3 should also be considered. Photos can fully show the hotel, both inside and out.  The first impression is quite pleasant, in the exterior design you can see a certain national flavor, which is characteristic of many buildings in this amazing eastern country.  A pool with crystal clear water, a white tile, comfortable-looking sun loungers and umbrellas that protect well from the sun - outwardly everything is as it should be in a three-star hotel.  The rooms are not luxurious, but they have everything that is necessary for life.  In addition, everything is decent in the photographs.  But one thing is for sure: until a person arrives here, tries on himself, he will not be able to accurately characterize the hotel.  How many people, so many opinions.  In general, you should choose carefully, carefully, preferably based on the feedback of your friends, if any.  After all, rest is at stake, and it is important that it be held at the highest level.  After all, I want to take home exclusively positive emotions. </p>
