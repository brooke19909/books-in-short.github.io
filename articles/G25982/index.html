    <h2>  Gelendzhik </h2><p>  Just want to say that in the immediate vicinity of Gelendzhik there are several resort places.  Before the trip, you should clarify the exact destination, since you can get to Kabardinka, Maryina Grove without reaching the city itself.  To do this, you need to know their removal (how many kilometers from Novorossiysk to Gelendzhik) so that you can get off the road.  If you are in Divnomorskoye, Dzhanhot, Praskoveevka and other settlements, then you can get into them by stopping by the city for a transplant. </p><p>  The city of Gelendzhik is located on the shore of the <span>Gelendzhik Bay,</span> in which the water warms up faster than on the Sochi coast.  The places here are amazingly beautiful, so the city has gained such popularity among vacationers.  A large number of resorts and health resorts, a lot of great affordable housing for any budget attracts a huge number of vacationers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A modern airport was built in the city in 2010, so Gelendzhik can be reached by plane.  True, the airport capacity is small, and not every city in Russia can fly here without transfers.  Therefore, most holidaymakers get in other ways.  The shortest runs from Novorossiysk.  Many travelers are interested in: how many km are from Novorossiysk to Gelendzhik?  The distance between these cities in a straight line is 31 kilometers, the travel time is from 40 minutes by car.  It should immediately be noted that the track runs along the serpentine, which increases the travel time and affects the speed of the car. </p>

    <h2>  How to get to Novorossiysk </h2><p>  In principle, you can get here from any city in the Krasnodar Territory, but the shortest and most convenient way is from Novorossiysk, which can be reached by any means of transport: by rail, by plane, by car.  Most people who want to relax on the Black Sea coast of the Caucasus prefer the railway, as this is the most convenient and less expensive way to travel. </p><p>  There is no railway in Gelendzhik, therefore, having arrived in Novorossiysk, it is necessary to decide what transport to get next.  The bus station is located at some distance from the railway station, so first you need to get to it.  There are several options to do this - taxi, bus and trolley. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  We get to Gelendzhik by taxi </h2><p>  The easiest and most expensive way is a taxi.

    <h2>  Get by bus </h2><p>  From Novorossiysk bus station to Gelendzhik, buses leave every 2 hours, so you can leave without problems.  The bus going to Gelendzhik calls at the railway station, but not the fact that there will be empty seats. </p><p>  In order to get to the bus station, you need to take the trolley bus, which in the city runs along the only route.  Therefore, sit on it boldly, and in 10-15 minutes you will be at the bus station.  You can also use a taxi, but if you are not very loaded with luggage, then the best option is a trip on a trolley bus. </p><p>  A bus "Novorossiysk - Gelendzhik" runs from the bus station.  The first flight leaves at 11:24 local time, the last at 18:08.  There are 7 flights a day. </p><p>  In addition, you can leave the bus station by passing buses that go to Gelendzhik.  These are buses from Tikhoretsk and Rostov-on-Don.  They stop (if available) at the train station. </p><p>  You can also leave for the Janhot from the bus station.  The bus performs 5 flights per day.  The first leaves at 06:15, the last at 19:10. </p>

    <h2>  How to get to the place in Gelendzhik </h2><p>  I would like to note that the advantage of the trip will be the map "Novorossiysk - Gelendzhik", according to which you can navigate in the location of settlements.  If there is no card, you can use the Internet. </p><p>  There are 2 bus stations in the city.  The buses of this flight arrive at the New Bus Station.  If you need to get to the Thin Cape, you need to go out on a stele with the inscription "Gelendzhik", go to a stop located not far from it, and catch a shuttle bus No. 16 or No. 5. </p><p>  If you need a city center or the Cape of Tolstoy, then you need to go to the final stop.  Arriving at the New Bus Station, take the city shuttle buses that will take you to the right place.  In extreme cases, you can get to the stop "st.  Kirov.  Market ‚Äùand transfer to the necessary bus.  All buses of the city pass through this stop. </p><p>  You can get to the Blue Bay by getting off the Novorossiysk-Gelendzhik bus at the traffic police post at the entrance to the city, cross the road and go towards the stop, where you can take the shuttle bus No. 14 or No. 15. </p><p>  If you need to get to Divnomorskoye, Praskoveevka or another settlement, then you need the Old bus station, which is located in the city center.  Almost all buses go to her from the New Bus Station. </p><h2>  How to get to Gelendzhik by car </h2><p>  Getting to Gelendzhik by car is possible in about 40-60 minutes.  The Gelendzhik-Novorossiysk road itself is good, but when choosing this type of transport, some features must be taken into account.  Although the distance is small, it is necessary to go along the serpentine road, which starts right after Novorossiysk and ends near Kabardinka.  The speed of movement on it is limited.  If your journey takes place on the weekend, it must be borne in mind that most locals in cars rush to the sea at this time, the road is very busy, and there are even traffic jams. </p>
