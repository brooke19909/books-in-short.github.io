From the upper tier offers a magnificent view of the sea.  Haifa is the world famous tourist center of Israel.  There you can enjoy the beautiful nature, beaches, as well as cultural attractions. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Where is he located, the city of Haifa?  Located in the northern part of Israel at the foot of Mount Carmel and the southern part of the Zvulun Valley.  From the southern and eastern sides, the city goes around the mountains and descends to the Mediterranean Sea, resulting in a wide cape and bay. </p><p>  Haifa has a good location, thanks to which it has become a large port city, in which ships from different countries sail, maintaining trade relations between other countries.  Tel Aviv, which is the economic center of Israel, is not so far located. </p><p>  Haifa can be divided into three tiers - lower, middle and high.  Nizhny is located on the coast and there are industrial enterprises, the Government quarter and beaches.  The middle tier is very busy, because there are a large number of shops, markets, places for cultural entertainment and attractions.  On the upper tier are the sleeping areas with comfortable hotels, holiday homes and villas. </p><p>  Haifa was built from the bottom up, which is why old buildings are located at the very bottom.  The uniqueness of this city is that there is the only metro in the country, that is, it connects the Lower Tier with the Upper. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nbn.org.il" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãlandscape" class="if uuid-3215782" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54146/3215782.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  There are several ways you can get to this beautiful city.
