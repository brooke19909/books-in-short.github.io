It is believed that <span>European countries are the</span> most developed, and some of them belong to the G7.  These are countries such as the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Germany. </p><h2>  Europe: countries and capitals (list) </h2><p>  The whole of Europe is usually divided into eastern, western, northern and southern, but the countries are unevenly located, and somewhere there are 9, and somewhere 15. In addition to 44 countries, there are states that were not recognized or partially recognized - Kosovo, Transnistria and Sealand.  There are also European countries with capitals that are dependent states (countries that are not considered independent, but have their territory, borders, population), there are 9 of them, and most of them belong to the UK, such as Guernsey, Gibraltar or Jan Mayen. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="List of European countries and their capital" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25615/1650299.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It is impossible to unequivocally answer and divide all countries into parts, because each organization (ONN, CIA, SGBNS, etc.), for its own reasons, differentiates them itself.  In this article, a list of countries will be shown in accordance with the UN Decree. </p><h2>  Eastern Europe </h2><p>  Before giving a brief description of this region, you must provide a <span>list of European countries</span> and their capital.  10 countries belong to Eastern Europe, some of which were part of the USSR until 1991: Ukraine (Kiev), Poland (Warsaw), Romania (Bucharest), Bulgaria (Sofia), Slovakia (Bratislava), Moldova (Chisinau), Hungary ( Budapest), Russia (Moscow), Czech Republic (Prague), Belarus (Minsk). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Europe, countries and capitals, list" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25615/1650303.jpg" width="300"></div>

But if you adhere to the UN Decree, then the population of this part is about 135 million inhabitants, not counting Russia.  The largest population is in Poland, the smallest is in Moldova, and the majority of the population belongs to the Slavic group: Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians and others. </p><p>  <span>By area</span> , Ukraine is considered <span>the largest country</span> in the eastern part, followed by Poland and Belarus. </p><p>  After the collapse of the USSR, much has changed in the political system, and the economy of most Eastern European countries has suffered greatly, which is why today they are not in the first positions in terms of the development of the state system and life. </p><h2>  Northern Europe </h2><p>  The list of European countries (and their capital) is much shorter when looking at the northern part of Europe, and here, mainly on the Scandinavian peninsula, the following states are located.  First of all, it is Finland (Helsinki), as well as Norway (Oslo), Denmark (Copenhagen), Estonia (Tallinn), Lithuania (Vilnius), Sweden (Stockholm), Iceland (Reykjavik), Latvia (Riga). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Northern Europe: countries and capitals" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25615/1650300.jpg" width="525"></div>

    <p>  Northern Europe is a small part of the whole of Europe and occupies only 20% of the total area, and the population is only 4%.  These are small states, Sweden is considered the largest country, where about 9 million people live, and the smallest is Iceland, where the population does not exceed even 300 thousand people. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <span>The countries of Europe and their capital</span> (in the northern part) are one of the most developed <span>countries in</span> terms of economic indicators and living standards.  Compared to other regions, their economy is stronger, the percentage of unemployment and inflation is low, and external and national resources are used more efficiently. </p><p>  Only high-tech equipment and skilled workers are involved in production; quality, not quantity, is considered a priority in the economy. </p><h2>  Western Europe </h2><p>  The list of European countries (and their capital) in the western part mainly takes into account the states where mainly the peoples of the Romano-Germanic and Celtic language groups live.  This is one of the most developed regions in the world, and this includes such countries: Great Britain (London), Austria (Vienna), Ireland (Dublin), <span>Luxembourg (Luxembourg),</span> Germany (Berlin), Switzerland (Bern), Belgium (Brussels) , Liechtenstein (Vaduz), the Netherlands (Amsterdam), Monaco (Monaco) and France (Paris). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="European countries and their capitals" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25615/1650301.jpg" width="234"></div>

    <p>  About 300 million people live in Western Europe, with 20 million being immigrants.  It is in Western Europe that the so-called immigration center is located, where people from all over the world come, including from poor African countries. </p><p>  <span>The largest country</span> in Western Europe by area is France, and it is also the oldest and richest. </p><h2>  Southern Europe </h2><p>  The largest list of European countries (and their capital) is presented in the southern part, which includes 16 states: Italy (Rome), Portugal (Lisbon), Greece (Athens), Serbia (Belgrade), Malta (Valletta), Albania (Tirana), Bosnia and Herzegovina (Sarajevo), Spain (Madrid), San Marino (San Marino), Slovenia (Ljubljana), Andorra (Andorra la Vella), Montenegro (Podgorica), <span>Vatican (Vatican),</span> Macedonia (Skopje), Croatia (Zagreb), Cyprus (Nicosia). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="European countries with capitals" class="if" height="227" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25615/1650302.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Many countries in the southern part are located mainly on the Mediterranean coast, and the population is 160 million people.  Italy is considered the largest country, and San Marino is the smallest, with no more than 30 thousand people living there. </p><p>  Its good location and subtropical climate allows many countries to farm and export food products.  The countries of Europe and their capitals are actively developing tourism.  For example, Spain is considered the most visited country after France.  Many travelers love holidays on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, which is why they choose these countries. </p><p>  In addition to agriculture, the economy is developing at the expense of the mining industry, the production of machinery and equipment, fabrics and leather. </p>
