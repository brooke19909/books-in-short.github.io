Irish volcanoes on the classic look a little.  The vast majority of them are not impressive.  Only some "crossed" the 2 km mark, the rest stay within 1-1.5 km, and many are even less.  For example, Hverfyadl, Eldfedl, Surtsey barely reach a height of several hundred meters, more reminiscent of ordinary hills.  But these seemingly peaceful and safe creations of Mother Nature in reality can bring troubles no less than the famous Etna or Vesuvius.  We offer to get to know them better, and start with their homeland. </p><h2>  Harsh island </h2><p>  Nature loves to surprise.  For example, she created the island of Iceland, lifting part of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge above the ocean, moreover, in the place of a huge tectonic seam.  Its <span>lithospheric plates,</span> one of which is the foundation of Eurasia, and the second of North America, still diverge little by little, thereby prompting Icelandic volcanoes to be active.  Small and large eruptions occur here approximately every 4-6 years. </p><p>  The climate of Iceland, given the proximity of its location to the Arctic Circle, can be called mild.  True, there is no warm summer here.  But harsh winters are also rare, but there is a lot of rainfall.  It would seem that unusually favorable conditions for all kinds of vegetation, which should be buoying here with fantastic force.  But in reality, 3/4 of the island is a rocky plateau, in some places covered with mosses and rare herbs.  In addition, out of 103,000 square kilometers, about 12,000 are occupied by glaciers.  Such a natural landscape surrounds Icelandic volcanoes and decorates their slopes.  In addition to visible to the eye, around the island there are many volcanoes hidden by the thickness of icy ocean waters.  All together there are almost one and a half hundred, among which 26 are active. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Icelandic volcanoes" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1068773.jpg" width="573"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Geological features </h2><p>  The shape of Icelandic volcanoes is overwhelmingly shield.  They are formed by liquid lava, repeatedly pouring to the surface from the bowels of the Earth.  Such mountain formations have the appearance of a convex shield with rather gentle slopes.  Their tops are crowned with craters, and more often the so-called calderas, which are huge basins with a more or less flat bottom and steeply breaking walls.  The diameter of the calderas is measured in kilometers, and the height of the walls is hundreds of meters.  Shield volcanoes tend to overlap due to lava flowing from them.  As a result, an extensive volcanic shield forms, which is observed on the island of Iceland.  They are composed mainly of basaltic rocks, which in the molten state spread like water. </p><p>  In addition to shield, there are stratovolcanoes in Iceland.  These have the shape of a cone with steeper slopes, since the lava erupting from them is viscous, solidifies quickly, without having time to spill for many kilometers.  A striking example of this type of formation is the famous volcano of Iceland Hekla or, for example, Askya. </p><p>  According to their location, terrestrial, underwater and under-ice mountain formations are distinguished, and according to their ‚Äúvital functions‚Äù they are dormant and active.  In addition, there are many small mud volcanoes that spew not lava, but gases and dirt. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúGateway to Hell‚Äù </h2><p>  So they dubbed the volcano in the south of Iceland called Hekla.  It is considered one of the most active, since eruptions occur here almost every 50 years.  The last time this happened was at the end of February 2000.  Hekla looks like a majestic white cone rushing into the sky.  It is a stratovolcano in form, and by its nature it is part of a mountain range that extends over 40 km.  It is all turbulent, but shows the highest activity in the region of the Heklugia fissure with a length of 5500 m, which belongs to Hekla.  From Icelandic this word can be translated as "hood and cloak."  The <span>volcano</span> got this <span>name</span> because clouds often cover its peak.  Now the slopes of Hekla are practically lifeless, but once upon a time trees and shrubs grew on them, grasses raged.  Not so long ago, the country began work on the restoration of fauna on this volcano, mainly willows and birches. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Iceland has suffered from seismic activity in the area more than once.  Hekla Volcano (according to scientists) has been actively spitting lava on the Earth‚Äôs surface for 6,600 years.  Studying volcanic strata, seismologists found that the strongest eruption occurred here in the interval from 950 to 1150.  BC.  By the amount of ash emitted then into the atmosphere, he was given 5 points out of 7 possible.  The power of the eruption was such that the temperature in the entire Northern Hemisphere of the Earth decreased for several years.  The oldest documented eruption on Haeckle occurred in 1104, and the longest - in 1947.  It lasted more than a year.  In general, on Haeckle, all eruptions are unique, and all are different.  There is only one pattern - the longer this volcano sleeps, the more violent it is then rampage. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Icelandic volcano eruption" class="if" height="391" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1068774.jpg" width="557"></div>

    <h2>  Askya </h2><p>  One of the most ‚Äútourist‚Äù and most picturesque is considered to be this particular volcano located in the eastern part of the island, in the Vatnajokull National Park, named after the huge glacier (the largest in Iceland and the third largest in this indicator in the world).  Askya is located at its northern edge and is not covered with ice.  It rises above the plateau by 1510 meters and is famous for its lakes - large Escuvati and little Viti, which appeared in the caldera due to the eruption of Askya in 1875.  Eskuvati with a depth of about 220 meters is considered the deepest lake in the country.  Viti is much smaller - only up to 7 meters deep.  It attracts hundreds of tourists with its unusual milky blue color of the water and the fact that its temperature can rise to +60 degrees Celsius and never drops below +20 degrees.  Viti's mirror is almost perfectly round, and the banks are very high (from 50 m) and steep.  The angle of their slopes exceeds 45 degrees.  Translated from Icelandic, ‚ÄúViti‚Äù means ‚Äúhell‚Äù, which contributes to the constantly present smell of sulfur.  The last eruption of the Icelandic volcano Askya occurred in 1961, and since then he has been sleeping, although it is considered active.  This does not frighten tourists who visit Askew so actively that they even laid 2 tourist routes, and built a camp 8 km from the caldera dish. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Baurdarbunga </h2><p>  The name of the Icelandic volcano Baurdarbunga is often shortened to Bardarbunga.  It arose on behalf of Baurdur.  That was the name of one of the ancient settlers of the island, who obviously lived in these places, since in translation from Icelandic ‚ÄúBaurdarbung‚Äù means ‚ÄúBaurdura hill‚Äù.  Now it is deserted and deserted, only hunters and tourists wander here, and even then only in the summer.  The volcano is Askya‚Äôs neighbor, but it is located a little to the south, just below the edge of the Vatnajokull glacier.  This is a relatively high (2009 meters) stratovolcano, periodically ‚Äúpleasing‚Äù with its eruptions.  One of the largest, having received 6 points, happened in 1477. </p><p>  The last "trick" of the Icelandic volcano Bardarbunga pretty patted the nerves of the inhabitants of the island, especially airline workers.  In 1910 there was an eruption, but not particularly strong, after which the mountain calmed down.  And now, after almost a hundred years, namely in 2007, seismologists again noticed its activity, which was gradually increasing.  Achieving maximum waited any minute. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the name of the Icelandic volcano" class="if" height="392" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1068776.jpg" width="598"></div>

    <h2>  Eruption </h2><p>  At the beginning of the summer of 2014, instruments recorded significant magma movements in the Bardarbunga chamber.  On August 17, tremors occurred in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe volcano 3.8 points, and on the 18th their magnitude increased to 4.5 points.  Urgent evacuation of residents of nearby villages and tourists was made, part of the roads were blocked, a yellow code for airlines was announced.  The eruption of the Icelandic volcano Bardarbung began on the 23rd.  The code color was immediately changed to red, all flights over this area were banned.  Although tremors with a strength of 4.9-5.5 points continued, there was no particular danger for airliners, and already in the evening the code color was changed to orange.  On the 29th magma appeared.  It splashed out of the mouth of the volcano and spread in the direction of Askya, going beyond the glacier.  The code color was again raised to red, stopping all flights over the volcano, which greatly complicated the work of airlines.  Since magma spread quite peacefully, by the evening of the 29th, the code color was again reduced to orange.  And on August 31, at 7 am, magma spilled out of the previously created fault with renewed vigor.  The width of its flow reached 1 km, and the length was 3 km.  The code turned red again, and in the evening fell back to orange.  In this spirit, the eruption lasted until the end of February 2015, after which the volcano began to fall asleep.  After 16 days, tourists poured here again. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="eruption of Icelandic volcano Eyyafyadlayekyudl" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1068778.jpg" width="565"></div>

    <h2>  Eyyafyadlayekyudl </h2><p>  Only 0.005% of earthlings can correctly pronounce this name of the Icelandic volcano.  Eyyafyadlayekyudl - something close to the "true" in the Russian version.  Although this volcano is located in the south of the island (125 km from Reykjavik), it was all covered with a glacier, which was given the same complex name.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe glacier is more than 100 square km.  At its top is the source of the Skogau River, and just below the waterfalls attractive for tourists are the Skogafoss and Kvernyuvoss waterfalls.  A more or less significant eruption of the Icelandic volcano Eyyafyadlayekyudl happened in 1821.  And although it lasted almost 13 months, there was no trouble except for melting the glacier, since its intensity did not exceed 2 points.  This volcano was considered so trustworthy that at its southern tip even the village of Skougar was founded.  And suddenly in March 2010 Eyyafyadlayekyudl again woke up.  In its eastern part, a 500-meter fault appeared, from which puffs of ash soared into the air.  It all ended by early May.  This time the intensity of the eruption reached 4 points.  Now the slopes of the volcano are covered not with ice, but with green vegetation.  Many people are interested in which Icelandic city is closest to Eyyafyadlayekyudl volcano.  It should be called the village of Skogar, with as many as 25 inhabitants.  The next is the village of Holt, then Hvolsvulur and the town of Selfoss, located about 50 km from the mountain. </p><h2>  Katla </h2><p>  This volcano is located just 20 km from Eyyafyadlayekyudlya and is more restless.  Its height is 1512 meters, and the frequency of eruptions is from 40 years.  Since Katla is partially covered by the Myrdalsj√∂kull glacier, its activity is fraught with melting ice and floods, which occurred in 1755, and in 1918, and in 2011.  And the last time it was so massive that it demolished the bridge on the Mulakvisl River and destroyed the highway.  Scientists have absolutely determined that the eruption of the Icelandic volcano Eyyafyadlayekyudl every time is an impetus for the activity of Katla.  In any case, such a pattern has been observed since 920. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="volcano in the south of iceland" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1068779.jpg" width="546"></div>

    <h2>  Surtsey </h2><p>  Active volcanoes in Iceland are extremely beneficial for Icelanders.  They help enrich the country, and geysers located in their area are used to heat houses, greenhouses, pools.  But that is not all.  Volcanoes in Iceland increase the country's territory!  The last time this happened was in November 1963.  Then, after the eruption of submarine volcanoes on the southwestern coast of the island, a new land area appeared, called Surtsay.  It has become a unique reserve where scientists track the emergence of life.  Formerly completely lifeless at first, now Syurtsay boasts not only mosses and lichens, but even flowers and shrubs in which birds began to nest.  Now there are gulls, swans, eels, petrels, puffins and others.  The height of Surtsey is 154 meters, the area is 1.5 square meters.  km, and it still continues to increase.  It is part of a chain of submarine volcanoes in Vestmannaeyjar. </p><h2>  Esia </h2><p>  This extinct volcano is famous for the fact that at its foot is the capital of the state - Reykjavik.  When the last eruption of the Icelandic volcano Esia occurred, it‚Äôs hard to say, but it doesn‚Äôt interest anyone.  The volcano, the peak of which is visible from almost anywhere in the city, is loved by all its inhabitants and is unusually popular with tourists, climbers and all lovers of the harsh beauty of nature.  The ridge, of which Esia is a part, begins at the fjord above the capital and extends to the Thingvellir National Park.  The height of the volcano is about 900 meters, and its slopes, covered with bushes and flowers, are unusually picturesque. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="active volcanoes in iceland" class="if" height="416" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1068775.jpg" width="515"></div>

    <h2>  Lucky </h2><p>  This shield volcano is an adornment of the Skaftafel National Park.  It is located near the city with the uncomplicated name of Kirkubeiarklaustur.  Laki is a member of a chain of Icelandic volcanoes 25 km long, consisting of 115 craters.  The volcanoes of Katla and Grimsvotn are also links in this chain.  The height of their craters is mostly small, about 800-900 meters.  Laki Crater is located somewhere in the middle between the glaciers - the huge Vatnajokull and the relatively small Mirdalsj√∂kull.  It is considered valid, but for more than 200 years does not cause problems. </p><h2>  Grimsvotn </h2><p>  This volcano is the top of the chain in which Lucky is a member.  Nobody knows its exact height.  Some believe it is only 970 meters, others call the figure 1725 meters.  The size of the crater is also difficult to determine, since after each eruption they increase significantly.  The word "Grimsvotn" in Icelandic means "gloomy waters."  It arose, possibly because after eruptions of the volcano, some part of the Vatnajokull glacier melts, which covers it.  Grimsvotn is considered almost the most active on the peninsula, as it is activated every 3-10 years.  The last time it happened was in May 21, 2011.  Smoke and ashes escaping from its crater then rose to the sky for 20 km.  Many flights were canceled not only in Iceland, but also in Britain, Norway, Denmark, Scotland and even in Germany. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Iceland's famous volcano" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1068777.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Fatal eruption </h2><p>  Lucky is quiet and calm at the moment.  He rarely rages, but, as they say, aptly.  In 1783, the once again awakened volcano in Iceland - Lucky - combined the devilish force with its neighbor Grimsvotn and a boiling lava flow hit the neighborhood.  The length of the <span>fiery river</span> exceeded 130 km.  She, sweeping away everything in its path, spilled into an area of ‚Äã‚Äã565 km <sup>2</sup> .  At the same time, poisonous vapors of fluorine and sulfur swirled in the air, as in hell.  As a result, thousands of animals died, almost all the bird and fish in the area.  From high temperatures, the ice began to melt, their waters flooded everything that did not burn.  <span>This eruption</span> killed 1/5 of the country's inhabitants, and the luminous fog, observed all summer even in America, lowered the temperature in the entire Northern hemisphere of the planet, causing hunger in many countries.  This eruption is considered the most destructive in the 1000-year history of the Earth. </p><h2>  Erayvayokull </h2><p>  These are they, Icelandic volcanoes.  I would like to end our story with a story about Erayvayok√ºdle, the largest on the island.  It is on it that the highest point of Iceland is located - the peak of Hvannadalshnukur.  The volcano is located in the Skaftafedl nature reserve.  The height of this giant is 2119 meters, its caldera is not round, like most other similar formations, but rectangular with sides 4 and 5 km.  Erayvay√∂kull is considered to be active, but his last eruption ended in May 1828, and he still does not bother anyone else - he is standing, covered in ice, and delights in its harsh beauty. </p>
