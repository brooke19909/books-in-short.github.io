    <h2>  Comments from our compatriots on the location of the hotel </h2><p>  Travelers also liked the location of The Light 2 Hotel 3 * <span>(Nha Trang).</span>  <span>The reviews of</span> our compatriots boil down to the fact that the hotel is located in the very center of the resort capital of Vietnam.  Therefore, all the entertainment and the entire infrastructure of this city for guests will be at hand.  In addition, in its vicinity there are many restaurants and bars where you can eat very tasty and cheap enough or have a good time with a glass of your favorite drink.  Our compatriots also liked the proximity of the hotel to the beach.  According to them, you can reach it literally in five minutes at a slow pace.  It is convenient from here to make trips to the sights and other settlements of Vietnam.  By the way, experienced travelers are advised to use a gray taxi.  They have the most attractive prices.  You can also rent a motorbike.  However, it is recommended to drive very carefully, as traffic in Vietnam is very chaotic, and many drivers simply ignore both the rules and the traffic signals.  For the same reason, you should be very careful when crossing the road. </p><h2>  Impression of tourists about food and staff </h2><p>  Guests at The Light 2 Hotel 3 * are offered breakfast only.  Moreover, they are quite tasty and varied.  So, you can taste cereals, pastries, salads, sausages, and even soups.  Some tourists considered the breakfast time a little inconvenience - from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m.  Therefore, those who like to sleep longer were sometimes late for a meal.  On the other hand, the need for early awakening contributed to the fact that the vacation did not take place in bed (you can sleep at home), but on the beach, on walks or trips to interesting places in this amazing country. </p><p>  As for the hotel staff, our compatriots left mostly positive impressions about it.  According to them, the employees here are very welcoming and pleasant people, and also do an excellent job with their duties.  Also note that almost none of the hotel staff speaks Russian.  However, you can always explain in basic English. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews of tourists about beach vacations and entertainment </h2><p>  The vast majority of our compatriots were very pleased with their beach holidays in Nha Trang.  Moreover, The Light 2 Hotel 3 * is located just a five-minute walk from the coastline.  According to tourists, here you will find the cleanest fine sand and warm clear water.  In addition, the beaches have everything you need for water sports.  Since the beaches in Nha Trang are municipal, renting sun loungers and umbrellas here will require an additional charge.  Experienced travelers also recommend, if possible, at least a couple of times to travel outside Nha Trang.  Indeed, in the vicinity of this city there are also magnificent beaches, characterized by snow-white sand. </p><p>  As for entertainment, the hotel in question in this vein cannot offer anything special to its guests.  The only thing you can book here is a tour, rent a motorbike, and use free Wi-Fi.  If you have a desire to spend time by the pool, you can go to one of the bars.  By the way, one of them bears the name ‚ÄúGorky Park‚Äù, familiar to everyone since childhood.  These bars have large, luxurious open-air pools.  In addition, experienced travelers without fail recommend that all tourists traveling to Vietnam not only taste local dishes and drinks, but also join the nightlife, but also visit interesting sights and cultural monuments of this country. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we got acquainted with the impressions of our compatriots about their vacation in The Light 2 Hotel 3 *.  Reviews about the hotel were mostly positive, however, admittedly, there were those who were not completely satisfied with this hotel.  This fact is mainly due to the fact that some tourists inattentively study the description of the hotel, which leads to the fact that their expectations from this or that place do not coincide with the real state of affairs.  Be that as it may, most of our compatriots liked the hotel.  In their opinion, it represents the optimal ratio of price and quality. </p>
