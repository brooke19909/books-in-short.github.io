Holidays on the Ligurian coast</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It would be a mistake to think that C√¥te d'Azur ends where France ends and Italy begins.  The Ligurian coast is a logical continuation of the famous Riviera.  The same picturesque cliffs, lush Mediterranean vegetation, picturesque villages that have preserved the elusive charm of former fishing villages ... And at the same time, the same high level of service!  Curved by a graceful horseshoe along the Ligurian Sea, this coast is not in vain called the Flower Riviera.  Up to Tuscany, bizarre rocks (actually, spurs of the Alps), houses descending along sheer cliffs directly into the emerald-clear sea, and oleanders along the roads delight the eyes.  The secluded bays seemed to have come down from advertising posters.  And their names are eloquent: Paradise, Fairytale, Echo of the Sea, Sirens ... Let's look at where to stay on the Ligurian coast, what kind of beaches there and what type of hotels to choose. </p>

    <h2>  Climate and coastal features </h2><p>  What can oppose Gangnam and Antibes Italy?  The Ligurian coast is reliably sheltered from the cold northern winds of the Alps.  Thanks to this, the tourist season in this region lasts from the beginning of May to the very end of October.  The thermometer column stably holds at +22 ... +28 degrees Celsius.  The temperature is more than comfortable, isn't it?  There is no ringing heat, as in Tuscany, in Liguria, because the coolness of the summer brings sea winds.  With a fairly high humidity, the local climate is easily tolerated.  By the way, glamor does not end at all on the <span>French Riviera.</span>  Hollywood stars, first-rate politicians and businessmen also have a rest in Italy.  But the prices of some goods and services are somewhat affordable.  And this is already noticeable in the border Ventimiglia.  True, there is one drawback, compared with France or Spain.  These are paid beaches.  For some of them, the entrance costs fifteen euros! </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Administrative submission of resorts </h2><p>  The Italian province of Liguria stretches along <span>the Gulf of Genoa</span> for more than two hundred kilometers.  Popular resorts stretch almost in a continuous series.  In the middle of the Flower Riviera is the provincial capital - the brilliant white marble Genoa.  The city divides the Ligurian coast of Italy, the map of which is presented here, into two halves.  The western part is called the Riviera di Ponente.  Riviera di Levante stretches east from Genoa to Tuscany.  Both of these parts have their own characteristics.  Riviera di Ponente is considered a place of elite relaxation.  Alassio, Bordighera and Diano Marina are often visited by celebrities.  And the Riviera di Levante attracts vacationers with enchanting landscapes, first-class beaches and bays with crystal clear water.  The most famous resorts in this part of the Ligurian coast are Portofino, Santa Margherita and Rapallo. </p>

    <h2>  Genoa </h2><p>  Wherever you spend your vacation on the Ligurian coast, and this city is worth a stop.  And not just to board a plane - there is an international airport (named after Christopher Columbus) in Genoa.  The capital of Liguria is already self-sufficient.  Many museums, ancient temples, a beautiful port, medieval walls and gates - sights can be seen here for weeks.  And in Genoa there is an Oceanarium and ... one of the houses where Columbus was born.  No, this is not a mistake, just one of them ... Those who have traveled a lot around the world know that different countries are defending the right to assert that it was precisely their homeland that belonged to the great navigator.  Be that as it may, Genoa has something to surprise an inquisitive tourist.  The city that arose in the ancient era, the medieval Republic, the ‚ÄúLady of the Seas‚Äù, the throne of the archbishop and the place where the university has been working since fourteen hundred and seventy-first ‚Äî all centuries left their mark on the architecture of the Ligurian capital.  Hotels are sometimes occupied by ancient palaces and chic mansions of the century before last.  But all these are city hotels that do not have their own beach. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Arenzano and Varazza </h2><p>  These cities of the Ligurian coast are located ten to thirty kilometers west of Genoa.  In fact, Arenzano is the new suburb of the provincial capital.  These are typical Riviera di Ponente resorts.  Gorgeous seaside boulevards, an ideal climate with mild winters and not very sultry summers, proximity to Genoa make these cities excellent places for families.  However, Varazze can boast of ancient antiquities.  Here the remains of the fortifications and shipyards of the Roman sailing military fort.  And since the Middle Ages, the companilla of the monastery church of St. Ambrose has risen here.  But the main wealth of Varazze is a mile and a half sandy beach. </p><h2>  Spot, Finale Ligure and Pietra Ligure </h2><p>  Ten kilometers from Varazze and 40 km from Genoa is the ancient town of Spotorno.  In addition to medieval and Renaissance sights, this resort is famous for its parks and well-groomed beaches.  There are excellent conditions for practicing water sports.  In Finale Ligure, a series of sand interrupts pebbles.  Therefore, the best hotels in Italy with their own beach have focused on this resort.  Curious tourists can visit the 16th century <span>Benedictine monastery</span> and several Romanesque churches.  Of the five ancient bridges, three are in good condition.  At this resort, fans of windsurfing, tennis, golf and horse riding love to relax, as there are all conditions for practicing these sports.  In Pietra Ligure, the sand does not end, and there are also enough hotels that have their own beach. </p>

    <h2>  Alassio </h2><p>  This town is the uncrowned capital of the Riviera di Ponente.  He is known far beyond Italy for celebrities who regularly spend their holidays in this charming place with sandy beaches.  This is the peculiar answer that Gangnam, Nice and Monaco can give Liguria.  Alassio boasts an interesting attraction - the wall of Muretto.  This is part of the city fortifications erected in the 16th century to protect against pirates.  Covered with ceramic tiles, the wall served as a place for autographs of various celebrities.  <span>Ernest Hemingway,</span> Winston Churchill, Louis Armstrong, Sophia Loren and others left their signatures on it.  In addition to Muretto, in Alassio there is a Romanesque church of St. Ambrose, and other architectural monuments.  In the 19th century, doctors sentenced Alassio: the local climate and sandy beach work wonders for pulmonary patients.  First, the local, Italian, elite, and then the aristocracy from all over Europe came here.  But even if you are in good health, the ‚ÄúGulf of the Sun‚Äù (the so-called local bay) will raise your tone and provide a good mood. </p>

    <h2>  Laiguelia and Diano Marina </h2><p>  We continue to study the Ligurian coast.  The map shows that to the west of Alassio, almost merging with it, there is a small village of Laiguela.  Her story is firmly connected with the name of <span>Thor Heyerdahl, a</span> Norwegian archaeologist and traveler.  In 1958, he was captivated by the provincial spirit of this typical Ligurian village and built a house here, along with the restoration of old houses on a hillside.  The attention of tourists is attracted by the majolica-covered domes of the baroque church of St. Matthew.  A sandy beach surrounded by majestic mountains will be an added bonus for those who have chosen this exemplary resort for their holidays.  Diano Marina is famous for having budget hotels here.  And in this resort there is a water park of attractions "Caravel". </p><h2>  San Remo and Bordighera </h2><p>  Every year in February there is a pop song festival that Italy is proud of.  The Ligurian coast of the Riviera di Ponente cannot be described without mentioning San Remo.  The capital of the Italian stage can please visitors to the city with a concert hall, the legendary Casino and the Orthodox Church, which was built by the Russian community in the 20s of the last century.  And Bordighera, which is twelve kilometers from San Remo, has a completely different, sporting glory.  It hosts the Grand Prix of Formula 1 racing.  And Bordighera is known for its championship of fireworks.  In addition to interesting events, the resort boasts a museum of cave paintings of primitive people. </p>

    <h2>  Camogli </h2><p>  Now we are transported to the resorts of the Ligurian coast of the Riviera di Levante.  The most famous of them is Ca-Moli.  The name of the village is translated as "House of Women."  In those days when tourists on the Ligurian coast still did not smell, all the men in the village went out to sea every morning.  Their wives patiently awaited the return of the fishermen.  Now the resort is famous for the bronze statue of Christ.  Cristo degli Abyssi does not rise above the city, but rather, is deepened into the sea by 15 meters.  In calm calm the statue is clearly visible - such transparent water off the coast of Camogli.  In the same town, tourists can see nice little old houses, street-stairs, Benedictine abbey and the palace of the XIII century.  Only by sea can you reach the village of San Fruttuoso.  To attract early tourists, the Sagra del Pesche festival is held in Camogli in May, where all participants are treated to fish fried in huge pans. </p><h2>  Portofino </h2><p>  This former fishing village is also visited by world celebrities.  And the French writer Guy de Maupassant began the pilgrimage.  He loved to be here and wrote about Portofino, that "this is a realm of harmony, so contrasting with our world of vanity."  The resort is located on a cape, so that the sand and pebble beaches of the Ligurian coast surround it on three sides.  Many years have passed since the days of the classic of French literature, and in modern Portofino shops, restaurants, ATMs, hotels and other signs of our busy world have appeared.  But nature still captivates tourists with its pristine cleanliness.  Olives, pines, palm trees and cypress trees climb the hillside, at the top of which stands an old lighthouse. </p>

    <h2>  Santa Margherita Ligure </h2><p>  The resort is convenient for tourists traveling by car.  The main highways intersect here.  You can easily get to Milan, Turin, Florence, Nice.  Existing in the era of Ancient Rome, Santa Margherita Ligure bloomed during the Renaissance (as, indeed, the whole of Italy).  The Ligurian coast at this place is called Tigullio Bay.  Most of the postcards of Santa Margherita are the old port with a cascade of houses going down to it.  Seaside Boulevard is decorated with an elegant Renaissance palace - Villa Durazzo, surrounded by gardens and fountains.  The fact that Santa Margherita became a resort as far back as the century before last is evidenced by beautiful Art Nouveau mansions and palm-tree-lined boulevards.  It often hosts flower fairs.  At the same time, this is a town where young people like to relax: there are many discos and clubs. </p>

    <h2>  Sisters Levante </h2><p>  This pearl of the Flower Riviera is located at the foot of a high rocky cape.  Its peak is crowned by the church of San Nicollo, erected in honor of the patron of sailors in the Early Middle Ages.  Since the town stands on a cape, it has at its disposal two bays at once - Favole (Fairy Tales) and Silencio (Silence), which are famous for their beauty on the entire Ligurian coast of Italy.  Hotels here are on the first line and have their own beach.  You can recommend Miramare 4 *: 75 rooms and suites are located in an old white-marble building.  In addition to the beach services, which are free for guests, the hotel also provides spa pleasures, a variety of baths and procedures.  Although the coast is pebble, the combination of high green cliffs, a turquoise sea with crystal clear water and clear aquamarine of the sky creates marvelous, bewitching landscapes.  And Sestri Levante is famous for the fact that in this park physicist Marconi set up his experiments with broadcasting on ultrashort waves. </p>
