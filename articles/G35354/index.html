Find out where to relax in Baku</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Perhaps no city in the world is of such interest to tourists as Baku (Azerbaijan).  This is the sun and the sea, the most beautiful monuments of antiquity and cutting-edge architecture.  Many parks provide the opportunity for a family vacation, which will be interesting for both children and adults. </p><h2>  Climatic features, or At what time of the year it is better to gather in Baku (Azerbaijan) </h2><p>  Each season has its own unique beauty and charm.  Lovers of both winter and summer holidays will like it here.  Azerbaijan is a unique country, there are 9 climatic zones.  This is due to the influence of the <span>Caspian Sea</span> and the chain of the Caucasus Mountains. </p><p>  Spring comes here early, so March and April are the best months for leisurely walks and exploring the local beauties.  The air temperature is quite comfortable, on average +15, but it's still cool for swimming.  May and June are the time when nature blooms with all its colors.  The sea warms up and the beach season opens, but it is not too hot.  July and August are the hottest months.  The air temperature rises to +38, therefore, at this time, alpine resorts are popular, where it is cooler. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baku, Azerbaijan" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/386196.jpg" width="600"></div>

Lifts, skis and snowboards will make it possible to throw out a lot of energy and get a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãadrenaline.

Such an abundance of huge stars you will not see anywhere!  The entire Milky Way burns over you with millions of lights. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sights of Baku" class="if" height="478" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/386198.jpg?1398942640220" width="600"></div>

    <p>  A special pleasure will bring Baku at night.  Such an abundance of lights and bustling life, even late at night, amazes and delights. </p><h2>  Souvenirs, or What you can bring from Baku for relatives </h2><p>  Of course, Azerbaijan is famous for its luxurious carpets.  There are many workshops in which needlewomen make and sell their goods.  But the carpet is a rather bulky baggage.  If you appreciate unique things, then pay attention to woven bags, caskets or coasters for a teapot. </p><p>  Crockery and ceramics with <span>oriental ornaments will</span> certainly interest you, unless you are afraid to break the jewel on the way back.  Wood carving is also popular here, in the shops of craftsmen you will find figurines, panels and many souvenirs. </p><p>  Silk shawls and scarves, as well as amazing wine can please your loved ones. </p><h2>  Moving around the city </h2><p>  The roads are excellent, so trips will give you a special pleasure.  It is easiest to get out of town on excursions by bus and minibus; for travel to the village, located 400 km from Baku, you will give only $ 10.  The city center is characterized by busy traffic, so the metro will save you time and money.  A ticket costs about 0.4 $. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baku night" class="if" height="303" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/386200.jpg?1398932203082" width="600"></div>

    <p>  There are a lot of taxis in Baku.  Travel around the city will cost you about $ 7.  If you enjoy driving, car rental is at your service.  The cost of this service is about $ 50 per day, depending on the prestige of the machine.  But on it for a vacation you can go round almost all of Azerbaijan.  Baku, whose map or GPS-navigator will help you not to get lost, will delight you with hidden corners. </p><h2>  Security </h2><p><strong> </strong>  It should be noted that in Baku it is very quiet and calm.  Azerbaijanis are the sweetest and most affable people who practically all speak Russian.  Until late at night, walks in parks and squares do not stop, children play in the yards, and parents do not stand behind each, closely watching. </p><p>  The hospitality of the local population is amazing.  Do not be surprised if the taxi driver who drives up calls you on a visit and introduces you to the whole family.  It is better not to refuse, because it will be perceived as an insult. </p><p>  Police officers are responsible for safety in the city.  They are distinguished by a dark blue shape and the inscription Polis.  For emergencies, there is a single emergency telephone number 103. </p><p>  But you need to cross the roads here quite accurately, because the locals poorly observe the rules of the road.  But at the same time, drivers are ready to let a pedestrian pass in any, even the wrong place. </p><h2>  cellular </h2><p>  To talk among themselves within the country, it is easier for you to buy a card of local telecom operators.  Its cost is $ 5-7.  A minute of conversation in this case will cost about 12 cents. </p><p>  Keep in mind that during hiking in the mountains, cellular communications are likely to be absent.  If during a walk around the city the phone is dead, use a payphone. </p><h2>  Travel Tips </h2><p>  As when entering any country, stock up on national currency and never use the services of street money changers. </p><p>  When leaving the hotel, do not forget your identity documents. </p><p>  Follow the rules of decency and do not go into the street while intoxicated.  This can lead to a fine and other troubles. </p><p>  In restaurants and cafes, it is customary to leave 10% of tips, they can even be included in the bill. </p><p>  Agree on the fare for a taxi in advance.  Do not rush to pay the declared amount in the market and be sure to bargain. </p><p>  If you want new impressions and a wonderful vacation, you like the frequent change of scenery (a large metropolis is pristine nature), then the <span>Republic of Azerbaijan is</span> at your service <span>.</span>  The city of Baku is many-sided, it is difficult to recognize it at a time, so you will probably want to return. </p>
