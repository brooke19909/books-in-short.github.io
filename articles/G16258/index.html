    <p>  The museum also has <span>ancient weapons,</span> because the population of the town has been hunting since ancient times, ancient manuscripts, and, of course, household items that have been used by the local population for centuries.  Some rare exhibits were delivered from other cities and villages of Georgia.  The halls of the museum are equipped with interiors of dwellings.  Also there are items of clothing.  It also presents an interesting collection of local musical instruments that were used at weddings held on an unprecedented scale, and were accompanied by bewitching singing.  After all, this area is the birthplace of the famous Georgian polyphony, which is recognized by UNESCO as a masterpiece of oral and intangible heritage. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Temples that have owners </h2><p>  In Mestia there are small churches, and, notably, many of them have owners whose family has owned such a temple for many years.  Sometimes tourists have to first find the owners of an ancient family building in order to open it and look inside.  In addition, each genus has its own cemetery. </p><h2>  Svan towers </h2><p>  Where is it worth taking beautiful pictures to those who are interested in Georgia, Mestia?  Photos in the old part of the town will turn out quite unusual.  After all, the famous Svan towers are located there.  They differ from each other in structure, internal structure and, of course, in age.  Some were built about a thousand years ago, others more than seven hundred.  Not all of them are equally preserved.  Depending on the functions that they performed, the towers were watch and signal.  Most of all, the defensive did not spare the time.  When passions raged in these parts, and there was <span>blood feud</span> in the course <span>,</span> then in some towers that belonged to a certain genus, not only family members, but also livestock could take refuge.  Since this is a mountainous area, in winter in these structures they took refuge from avalanches and snowfalls.  All towers have a manhole as an entrance, you can climb into it only by a ladder, and the entire first floor is a solid foundation that gives extra strength to the structure.  Upstairs is equipped with an observation deck.  If you climb up one of these towers, then the gaze of the traveler will reveal an unprecedented mountain landscape, regardless of whether it is summer or winter. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Unusual for some travelers, livestock may seem to be in Mestia.

Since there are bears and wolves in the mountains and, in some cases, not all cattle return home. </p><h2>  Hatsvali resort </h2><p>  What is Mestia, Georgia famous for?

    <p>  The famous Vladimir Vysotsky dedicated his song ‚ÄúTo the Top‚Äù to him.  Yuri Vizbor and <span>Yevgeny Yevtushenko</span> also dedicated their poems to a brave climber.  Unfortunately, as a result of a tragic accident, Hergani died in Italy during the conquest of the rock of Su Alto.  At the place of his death, the Italians erected a monument, and the illustrious climber was buried in his homeland, not far from Mestia.  Friends nicknamed Hergani "Tiger Rocks."  Every summer, in memory of this amazingly brave man, Misha Day is celebrated in his homeland, or, as the locals say, Mishaoba. </p><p>  A climbing prize was instituted in honor of Hergani.  In the village of Lagami there is a museum dedicated to this climber, an international master of sports.  In addition to personal belongings, it contains photographs taken by Hergani. </p>

    <p>  Also from Tbilisi to Mestia there is a minibus from a stop near the Didube metro station.  And you can use the services of taxi drivers, which will be about two and a half times more expensive. </p><p>  To get to Mestia, you can use rail and road transport.  By train "Tbilisi-Zugdidi", to the station "Zugdidi".  Such a journey will take about nine hours.  Then take a minibus to Mestia.  You can, again, take a taxi.  If you travel in early spring, it should be borne in mind that drivers charge more.  Since at this time of the year the road in the mountains is very dangerous. </p><p>  You can get to Mestia not only from Tbilisi, but also from Kutaisi by minibus from the bus station.
