But what about wealthy people, what are their preferences, in what hotels do they live, how do they travel? </p><p>  At the first step of the podium in the category ‚Äúmost expensive hotel in the world‚Äù, the Burj al-Arab Hotel, built in the capital of the <span>Arab Emirates of Dubai,</span> is deservedly located <span>.</span>  It is also called the ‚ÄúSail‚Äù, because that's how it looks from the outside. </p><p>  For some time, in addition to the first place in the nomination ‚Äúthe most expensive hotel in the world‚Äù, Burj al-Arab was considered the highest, but he was replaced by the Burj Dubai hotel in second place. </p><p>  This ultramodern hotel is built on a specially created artificial island almost three hundred kilometers from the coast.  Its height is 325 meters.  Even among other very expensive and chic, this most expensive hotel in the world looks luxurious.  It is connected to the shore by an original bridge ending with a beautiful fountain, on which vacationers on a Rolls-Royce drive up to the building.  The most respectable and presentable guests fly to the hotel by helicopters, because the main front door is on the roof. </p><p>  Everything is in tune here - convenience, comfort, wealth, taste, service at an unimaginably high level.  Connoisseurs joke that Burj al-Arab can be classified as seven out of five stars to prove once again that it is an order of magnitude higher than the rest. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is easy to guess that the most expensive hotel in the world is unlikely to be affordable for anyone.

A special feature of each room is the windows on the entire wall, the view of the sea from which calms the nerves and improves mood. </p><p>  The lobby of the hotel, whose walls are continuous aquariums, is no less original. </p><p>  The best hotel in the world - Burj al-Arab - is a symbol of Dubai's prosperity, at the request of Sheikh Mohammed, he also became the tourist logo of the United Arab Emirates. </p><p>  Burj Al Arab restaurants, one of which is located on the roof, and the other under water, offer visitors the most exquisite dishes, preferring the uniqueness of each served dish to the wide variety of the existing menu. </p><p>  On all floors there are resident assistance services working in any language of the world.
