In order to properly lead the country or negotiate, you need to make a lot of effort aimed at the desired result.  Political activity requires concentration, the ability to think logically and respond quickly.  Those countries and people who manage to combine all these qualities into a single whole and use them effectively have some superiority.  Earlier in history, such a separation from the general mass was called hegemony.  That this is not known to everyone, but the answer to this question can be very interesting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hegemony what is it" class="if" height="444" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/425409.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The concept of "hegemony" </h2><p>  Many influential people know: in order to achieve results, you need to work hard and have superiority over others, that is, to be a leader.  The meaning of the word "hegemony" has a similar meaning, because in fact, it is the ability to stand out among others, to have special influence or control. </p><p>  Most often you can find the concept of ‚Äúhegemony‚Äù in historical and political literature, as it mainly relates to relations between states.  Thus, there are countries that control others and influence them; accordingly, there are also those that directly play the role of followers.  To the question "Hegemony - what is it?"  there is a very simple answer: this is the political superiority of one state over another or several (a group of countries). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  The essence and meaning of the concept of "hegemony" </h2><p>  It is believed that the word "hegemony" came from the ancient Greek, which in translation means "submission."  As a rule, this applies to states.  Also, the option of worshiping the union of city-countries to one main policy is not excluded.  It is customary to call him hegemon. </p><h2>  Hegemonic influence </h2><p>  In order to understand the meaning of the word hegemony, what it is and how it works, you need to imagine the following situation.  Country A is interested in convincing the weaker group of the correctness of its decision.  In any way it establishes contact with country B and exerts a powerful influence on it.  As a result <span>, the government of the</span> first state receives some benefits and acts in its interests.  It is country A that will be the hegemon that has an impact on weak allies. </p><p>  The hegemon has power, strength and enormous influence on others.  He is able to control another country and even a group of states.  It is in his power to manipulate weak allies, imposing his ideas that can benefit the hegemonic country. </p><p>  The concept of ‚Äúworld hegemony‚Äù has become quite common, the essence of which is the dominance of one state in the sphere of international relations.  Such countries, starting from the seventeenth century, included the following: Holland, Britain and the USA.  America has consolidated its position and continues to control the actions of weaker players in the political map of the world.  Holland, in turn, lost such an opportunity, as did Britain.  The latter still has some advantages and influence on individual countries. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="world hegemony" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/425402.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The power of persuasion of hegemonic countries </h2><p>  Thus, after understanding the concept of ‚Äúhegemony‚Äù, what it is and how it works, it is worth saying a few words about the injustice of monopolistic countries, which have a huge influence on others.  Such states impose ideas on their allies, turning everything in their favor, that is, taking profits.  In addition, hegemons can achieve results without threats and the use of force, which makes them even more successful and powerful.  They can control the cultural, social, economic and political spheres of another state. </p>
