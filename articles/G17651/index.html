    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  The <span>Jasmine Hotel</span> Apartments 3 * (Cyprus) is characterized by some negative aspects.  Reviews allow us to draw conclusions about such shortcomings of this institution: </p><ul><li>  monotonous breakfasts with a fairly modest assortment of dishes; </li><li>  the staff does not speak Russian, and therefore you need to learn at least a few basic phrases in English; </li><li>  the maids are not thorough enough to clean the room (of course, there is no dust and debris, but practically do not pay attention to mirrors and plumbing); </li><li>  bed linen is changed very rarely; </li><li>  in the bathroom, the drain works terribly, and there is also an unpleasant smell of sewage and mold; </li><li>  the rooms, lounges and other rooms smelled of tobacco smoke; </li><li>  they do not clean or change filters in air conditioners, and therefore guests are forced to breathe dust; </li><li>  old furniture in the rooms; </li><li>  the hood does not work in the kitchen area, and therefore, if you want to cook something, the whole room will be filled with the smell of food; </li><li>  to get to the beach, you need to cross a busy highway; </li><li>  even if you book a room in advance, upon arrival it may turn out that your room is occupied, and therefore you will have to spend one or several nights in apartments of another category; </li><li>  the TV does not show Russian channels, and therefore it is boring to be in the room; </li><li>  the hotel has almost no entertainment (especially boring in the evenings); </li><li>  in order to use the TV, you need to make a deposit of 10 euros per remote control; </li><li>  at night, with a strong roar, garbage is removed in the hotel courtyard, which is especially audible if you like to sleep with the windows open; </li><li>  if the windows of your room overlook the outbuildings, many flies will fly into the room; </li><li>  maids do not wash the floor on the balcony; </li><li>  in order to get a cosmetic kit, you need to independently guard the maid and ask her; </li><li>  sheets on beds with holes; </li><li>  old plumbing in the bathroom; </li><li>  old repair; </li><li>  the room has poor lighting; </li><li>  in the rooms located on the ground floor, you can find insects. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  This hotel is quite old, and therefore the atmosphere in it is appropriate.  Repair has not been carried out for a long time, but because the walls, furniture and the whole interior are pretty worn.  As for the rooms, their equipment has also not been updated for a long time.  Nevertheless, the atmosphere is very comfortable due to the successful layout, large windows and concise design.  If we talk about nutrition, then it is not replete with diversity. </p><p>  The main advantage of the hotel is its convenient location.  It is located in the very center of Limassol near the beach and city infrastructure.  That is why this option of accommodation is chosen by lovers of outdoor activities.  If you prefer to spend most of the time on site, then after a few days the situation will seem depressing to you. </p>
