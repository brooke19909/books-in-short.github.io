    <p>  It is no coincidence that the monument to this animal was erected in Salekhard.  Deer are common in this city, and residents are not at all surprised to see an animal on the street.  It is also very symbolic that he looks at the other side of the river - the old and the new city.  The deer as if unites the epochs of life in the neighborhood with a person.  This animal is for local residents, and for other northern peoples, the same friend as a dog for us.  Deer is practically the only opportunity to move around this area.  Now it‚Äôs clear why this is one of the main and significant attractions of Salekhard. </p><h2>  Apartment L.V. Laptsuya </h2><p>  The museum, opened in 1994, is dedicated to the Honored Worker of Culture of the RSFSR, and part-time to the German writer Leonid Vasilyevich Laptsuy.  Having been here, you will be able to see the whole literary heritage of this person, as well as his household items, documents, photographs and books.  But just looking at the interior of the room and the exhibition is not enough.  A mandatory point on a trip to Salekhard should be a visit to one of the literary evenings devoted to the writer's work.  Only after such an evening will you be able to go with calm soul to explore the other attractions of Salekhard, photos of which can be found in this article. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  District Center for National Cultures </h2><p>  The center, which opened in 1987, is the organizer of most Salekhard events and festivals.  Any visitor goes to see the exhibitions taking place in the main building of the center.  Here you can see the products of talented people made of beads, stone or fur, as well as many other interesting things.  Such an exhibition will be a great start, continuation or completion of the program of sightseeing of the city of Salekhard. </p><h2>  Arctic Circle </h2><p>  In fact, this monument was originally called the ‚Äú66th parallel,‚Äù but for some reason the people call it the Arctic Circle.  The monument is a double pyramid divided by a semicircle in the center.  The monument was opened in 1980 in confirmation that the city is crossed by the Arctic Circle.  This fact explains the popular name of this landmark Salekhard. </p>

    <p>  And the real name of the monument comes from the coordinates of the beginning of the Arctic - 66 degrees, 33 minutes and 39 seconds north latitude.  Initially, it was made of iron, standing on a concrete base.  In the evenings, lights around the monument also turned on.  In 2003, the monument was replaced with exactly the same, but made of a fiberglass composite.  This was done in order to extend the life of the Arctic Circle. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Well, having looked with your own eyes at the evidence that this city is the only one on the planet crossing the line of the Arctic Circle, you can move on to the sights of Salekhard. </p><h2>  Cable-stayed bridge "Torch" </h2><p>  This bridge, passing through the Shaitanka River, which divides the city into two parts, was opened in 2004.  This incredible attraction of Salekhard, the photo of which you will find below, must be visited.  You can not only see unusual propylaea, but also have dinner in a chic restaurant located on the bridge.  And also you can look at the incredible effect of a bridge soaring above the water. </p><h2>  Hockey players </h2>

    <p>  This three-meter monument dedicated to hockey players was opened in 2001 in addition to the Ice Palace - one of the best in Russia.  The monument represents two hockey players made of metal.  The author was the famous Omsk sculptor Viktor Pogodin.  Eyewitnesses of his work were surprised at the speed of execution and passion of the sculptor.  And the results of this excitement you can see with your own eyes upon arrival in Salekhard. </p><h2>  Mammoth </h2>

    <p>  In 2005, a monument to the mammoth was erected at the very entrance to the city.  Why exactly a mammoth?  Because here and in the surrounding regions there are many remains of mammoths.  For example, the mammoth Luba, who was found on the Yuribey River in 2007.  According to scientists, she was about 6 months old.  Also on this river they found the ‚Äúyoungest‚Äù mammoth, whose age is 9600 years. </p>
