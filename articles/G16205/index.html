What is its difference from the wrong.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Before buying material for sewing, you should know how to determine the front side of the fabric by the edge, pattern, pile, etc. After all, the appearance of the product will depend on its choice.  But the most important thing to do is to determine the parties before cutting the product.  It is not recommended to do such an important thing in the evening and in very bright artificial lighting, since it distorts reality.  In the morning, it may turn out that the choice made was erroneous, and the blame for everything was optical illusion. </p><h2>  How to determine the front side of the fabric </h2><div class="photo" data-original="preply.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Scissors on fabric" class="if uuid-2963926" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102644/2963926.jpg"></div><p>  Arriving at the store or having examined the fabrics on the things that are available at home, you can notice that in appearance they differ quite a lot.  Their difference can be both in the type of surface (openwork, embroidered, with a woven pattern), and in the type of color (multi-colored, printed, smoothly painted or bleached).  There are jacquard multi-colored fabrics - tapestry.  Such fabrics are considered difficult to manufacture, but determining the front side on them is very simple. </p><p>  Many people know that depending on their fibrous composition, fabrics undergo different finishes.  Natural burns, bleaches, dyes.  All decoration is done on one side of the product - the front.  When weaving, all irregularities and knots are hidden on the wrong side, therefore, on the front side, all fabrics are smoother and brighter, with a clean surface or, conversely, with a relief, convex pattern.  To the touch, it will also be different (smooth and pleasant, has a clearer, embossed pattern). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="sewing.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nap fabric" class="if uuid-2963931" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102644/2963931.jpg"></div><h2>  How to distinguish the front side of the fabric from the inside </h2><p>  You should know that tissues are unilateral and bilateral.  The wrong side and front side of unilateral tissues are quite different.  The bilateral ones differ slightly or do not differ at all.  Sometimes both sides of the canvas can be used equally. </p><h2>  The front side of different types of fabrics </h2><p>  So, how to determine the front side on the plain fabrics and not only: </p><ul><li>  Printed fabric: where it is brighter, there is the front side. </li><li>  Fabric with a pattern (woven): on such fabrics, the pattern on the front side will be more clear and convex. </li><li>  Satin and satin weave fabrics.  On the front side, these weaves have a more shiny and smooth surface, the hem goes at different angles, have a beautiful appearance.  From the inside, these fabrics are more like fabrics that have plain weave. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.garmentsmerchandising.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Different types of fabrics" class="if uuid-2963918" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102644/2963918.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Fabric with sequin trim, metal thread ‚ÄúLurex‚Äù, embossed, coated ‚Äúunder the skin‚Äù, embroidery.  In fabrics made from mixed raw materials, the front side will always look ‚Äúmore expensive‚Äù.  In all cases, the wrong side will be superior in beauty to the front.  Embroidery threads will lie evenly, without knots, the stitch will cover the pattern completely. </li></ul><h2>  More complex features of determining the front side </h2><p>  Not all pile fabrics have a pile on the front side.  The bumazeya has a pile side - the wrong side, but usually this fabric has a printed pattern and a beautiful smooth surface from the face.  But velvet, velveteen, velor is beautiful from the side of the pile, so it is difficult to make a mistake in determining the front side.  For example, a plain flannel refers to a two-sided fabric - it has the same color, linen weave and villi on both sides. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="textilelearner.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cotton fabric" class="if uuid-2963869" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102644/2963869.jpg"></div><p>  The drape has a pile on the front side, and it is located in one direction, or there is a dense lint-free pattern.  The fabric of this type from the wrong side may have a more loose weave. </p><p>  This also applies to cloth.  It, in most cases, is <span>plain weave</span> and is heavily hairy, which leads to some difficulties in the process of determining the front side.  It is necessary with effort to draw fingers from different sides and in different directions, and that side where the pile is less dense, less quality, is the wrong side. </p><p>  What if all of the above methods for determining the front side of the tissue did not give an answer?  You can identify the side by the quality of the surface of matter.  That is, the front will be the side where the surface of the fabric does not have fluffs, nodules, it is smoother.  The presence of fluffs is inherent only in natural fiber fabrics. </p><p>  To determine the presence of villi or the brightness of the color, the matter should be brought to eye level and look at the light.  If it was not possible to detect pronounced defects, then such a fabric can be attributed to bilateral. </p><h2>  Edge side detection </h2><p>  You can determine the front side of the fabric by the edge (both by its quality and by the holes on it).  The edge will be better on the front side.  When the fabric is stretched over the calendars during the finishing process, holes remain.  It is commonly believed that they should be on the convex side above, and concave - from the inside, but in practice it happens and vice versa. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thesewingdirectory.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fabric with a pattern" class="if uuid-2963879" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102644/2963879.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Before cutting complex tissues, it is necessary to indicate the front side in several places, preferably in interlecular lunges.  This is usually done in small pieces, drawing crosses.  This is important not only in order not to confuse the details when grinding, but also for trimming strips, rebounds, valves, etc. </p><p>  If all the visual methods have been sorted out, and doubts have not disappeared, do not forget about the tactile sensations, because the sensitivity of the fingers will never let you down. </p><p>  It also happens that the seamstress obviously wants to choose the wrong side (the one that is the wrong side for people who created the fabric), because she seems to be more attractive to her. </p><p>  And if it was not possible with complete confidence to choose one of the parties, then no one except the owner of the finished product will know about it, because everything is known in comparison. </p>
