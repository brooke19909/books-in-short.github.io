Network technology has allowed a huge number of users to participate in world poker competitions, but only a few have achieved significant success, and those who are at the top become legends.  Tournament champions fans admire and sometimes envy the biography and career of their idols, hoping to at least partially repeat their triumph. </p><h2>  The beginning of the way </h2><p>  The star of a player named Jason Mercier, whose photo is shown below, rose rapidly in 2008.  Unexpectedly for everyone, he became the winner in the European poker tournament of the 5th season of EPT, held in the Italian San Remo.  The total win of the champion then amounted to more than a million dollars, which could turn the head of more experienced players.  As expected, an unexpected high-profile victory stunned the player and led to a series of major setbacks on the World Series of Poker the same year.  This did not break Jason, at the end of the year he was able to reconsider the tactics of the game and his personal attitude to poker and confidently performed at the WSOPE and WPT competitions, and also won the high-roller tournament. </p>
