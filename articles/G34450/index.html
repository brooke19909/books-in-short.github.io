Hotel classification is quite complicated.  Tourists, choosing a hotel, usually rely on three common variations of the separation of hotels.  They are primarily interested in stardom.  Then they specify the club hotel or not, and what HV 1 means for such hotel complexes. </p>

    <p>  Travelers' attention is also attracted by the letter <span>classification of hotels</span> from A to D, characteristic of southern European countries.  The stardom of a hotel affects its status, quality of service, price for services and composition of the public.  The most comfortable atmosphere <span>in</span> <span>5 * hotels.</span> </p><p>  3 * hotels located in different states are very different.  For example, apartments in Turkish and Egyptian hotels are quite spacious compared to rooms in European three-star establishments.  In Europe, only luxury hotels are equipped with large apartments.  In Asian countries, the hotel category is influenced by swimming pools and air conditioners, while in France such trifles as a bidet. </p><h2>  Club hotel - what is it? </h2><p>  With <span>star hotels,</span> everything is simple.  The high cost and quality service sparkle hotels with the maximum number of stars.  The information about Holiday Village hotels, designated in the tourist booklets as HV, has to be clarified.  Institutions listed in the HV category are called club. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Under such hotel complexes there are closed park areas, including the main building and compact cottages for tourists.  The infrastructure of the club hotels is built in such a way that they look like a tiny resort town with comfortable places for rest and living. </p><p>  Tourist apartments are located in separate bungalows.  The rooms of 1-2 storey houses are equipped with a separate exit to the street.  The number of rooms individually in each cottage.  Couples prefer to stay in double apartments with one extended room.  Family tourists choose one-bedroom houses.  Large companies are offered villas with many rooms. </p><p>  The houses differ in prestige and cost.  Standard rooms accommodate 2-4 people.  They are equipped with a bathroom, air conditioning, TV and telephone.  The suites have a balcony or terrace.  The cottages produce daily cleaning with a mandatory change of bed linen. </p><h2>  Club Hotel Classification </h2><p>  Of the many ordinary hotels, they stand out with a special designation.  There are three types of club complexes - HV, HV-1 and HV-2.  By the level of service they are equated with European hotels 3 *, 4 * and 5 *, respectively. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãrelaxing in a club hotel is reduced to providing guests with the maximum imaginable pleasures.  The service staff surrounds the guests with an incredible atmosphere of comfort, fulfills all their whims and whims. </p><h2>  Subtleties of HV Hotels </h2><p>  So what does HV 1 mean?  Club hotels are assigned the category HV-1 (and vice versa, HV-1 hotels are classified as club).  However, they have significant differences.  Complexes having a vast territory adjacent to the sea coast are ranked as HV hotel clubs. </p><p>  In the central zone of the towns are concentrated shops and restaurants, entertainment venues and establishments, places of recreation.  The rest is the main building and many houses, which are apartments of various types. </p>

    <p>  Guests are offered water activities.  Tourists gain vivid impressions, going down the water slides, riding catamarans, canoeing, surfing, swimming in the pools. </p><p>  The hotel category HV 1 meets the same requirements.  However, the prestige of the hotel-club HV is higher.  In terms of quality of service, it is equivalent to a five-star hotel.  The common thing among the hotel-clubs HV and HV 1 is to provide guests with free-standing cottages for their stay. </p><p>  To support services at the proper level, to satisfy the interests of guests, such complexes contain a huge staff.  The task - to ensure a comfortable stay - is attributed to cooks, animators, trainers, masseurs and other specialists.  Therefore, rest in such towns costs a pretty penny. </p><h2>  Difference of HV-1 from HV-2 </h2><p>  Hotel clubs have their own graduation.  With the rise of digital designation, the quality of service decreases.  Club-hotel status HV is assigned to tourist facilities with perfect after-sales service.  Then category HV 1 - what is it?  This includes complexes whose quality of service is not lower than in 3-4 * hotels. </p><p>  HV-2 clubs are just like 2-3 star hotels.  Their service is not perfect.  And the beaches, although their own, do not adjoin the territory.  They are a 5-10 minute walk from the town. </p>

    <ul><li>  Be sure to find out the category of the proposed complex (club hotel, category HV 1 or HV 2). </li><li>  It‚Äôs nice to ask about the exact location of the tourist site.  Find out how far the apartments are from the coastline (later it may turn out that you need to walk about 15 minutes to the beach, going uphill). </li><li>  Clarify the condition of the room offered for living, what kind of food they offer, how far the restaurant is located from the cottage.  Such information, supported by photographs and a map, as a rule, is posted on a tourist site. </li><li>  The equipment of the houses varies.  HV-2 hotel clubs are equipped with a minibar, but you have to pay for drinks in it.  They may not have <span>beach towels</span> issued without payment.  Some rooms have bathrooms with shower only.  Another thing is the clubs HV.  They do not need to pay for drinks in the minibar and towels.  The bathrooms in these houses are full. </li><li>  What else does HV 1 mean?  This category of tourist towns was originally designed for a relaxing holiday.  Guests are protected from the slightest anxiety, including from annoying animators.  They deliberately do not conduct entertainment programs. </li><li>  In an effort to ensure perfect silence, some clubs do not accept tourists with children.  Their distinguishing feature is the prefix ‚Äúadults only‚Äù.  Active travelers who do not know about this feature in a timely manner risk getting a boring vacation. </li><li>  Reviews posted on travel sites should be wary.  Of these, it is very difficult to understand what HV 1 means. After all, reviews are not always written by tourists who actually rested in a particular hotel.  Ideally, to obtain reliable information, it is worth reading reviews about the hotel complex on several resources. </li></ul><h2>  Club Hotel Benefits </h2><p>  Hotel HV 1 - what is it, what are its advantages?  Guests find everything they need here.  They provide a carefree vacation without going out of the resort town.  Tourists can enjoy shopping, relaxing in bars and restaurants, leisure time at sports and playgrounds. </p><p>  For little guests in the towns created a real paradise.  In pools, mini-clubs, on playgrounds, they are under the supervision of nannies, animators and trainers.  Restaurants make up a children's menu. </p>
