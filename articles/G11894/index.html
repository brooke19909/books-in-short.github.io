    <p>  <span>The recreation center</span> is located very close to Moscow.  Only twelve kilometers in the village of Ostrovtsy.  On the territory there is a pond with fish, so a good nibble for fishermen is provided. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  We hope that our article will help you find a suitable holiday home.  <span>The Moscow region</span> is rich in various bases, resorts, hotels - from the most expensive to very budget options.  You can organize a decent vacation not only on weekends, but also spend the whole vacation outdoors, while receiving wellness and medical procedures.  We wish you success and a pleasant stay. </p>
