This tool allows you to quickly pay off debt without leaving home.  To further increase the demand for this service, banks offer to issue a credit card online and receive additional bonuses. </p><h2>  Design scheme </h2><p>  To get a credit card, you need to fill out an application on the bank's website, indicating your full name and contact information.  The decision to grant a loan is made within 24 hours.  The courier brings the card.  To get it, you need to take a picture with the original passport in hand.  The courier sends this picture to the bank.  Immediately after activation, an SMS with a PIN code and password is sent to the specified phone number.  This is how credit cards are processed online. </p><div class="photo" data-original="brobank.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="recharge online" class="if uuid-2976123" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/2976123.jpg"></div><h2>  Terms of Use </h2><p>  Filling out an online application for a credit card promises a lot of advantages: </p><ul><li>  Applications are processed with only a passport. </li><li>  A courier brings a credit card at a convenient time. </li><li>  The cardholder gets access to borrowed funds.  If he repays the debt in 55-60 days, he can use the money for free. </li><li>  After the specified period, 12-24% per annum are charged.  Monthly payment is 5-7% of the principal amount. </li><li>  The cardholder automatically becomes a member of the cashback program.  For payment of purchases in certain stores 3-5% of the cost is returned to the card account. </li></ul><h2>  Limit </h2><p>  The maximum amount of borrowed funds is set individually for each client and depends on a number of factors.  Usually, after consideration of the application, 50-80 thousand rubles are issued.  If the borrower is officially employed and has a good credit history, then he can ask immediately for 250-300 thousand rubles.  Separately, a limit may be set on operations carried out abroad.  To quickly pay for your purchases in any country, you should immediately order a personalized card with a chip, since plastics of a different format are not accepted in all countries of the world. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.oceanbank.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="credit card" class="if uuid-2976115" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/2976115.jpg"></div><h2>  What else should you pay attention to? </h2><p>  Before you start issuing a credit card online at Tinkoff Bank or at any other institution, it is important to understand how much money you will have to pay for issuing and using it.  Bank employees immediately warn of a one-time commission.  Immediately after activation, 500-700 rubles are debited from the account.  Additionally, one-time annual payments in the amount of 200-350 rubles may be provided. </p><h2>  How much do you really have to pay? </h2><p>  <span>Issuing a credit</span> card online without reference entails a lot of risks for a banking institution.  All of them are laid at an increased interest rate (12-24% per annum).  If the borrower does not have time to pay off the debt on time, then the monthly payment includes 5-7% of the loan body and a commission for using the funds.  In addition, the interest rate may be increased during the term of the contract.  And not always the bank reports this to the client.  Therefore, the borrower should periodically monitor information on the official website of the bank. </p><p>  Example.  An operation in the amount of 5 thousand rubles was carried out on the card.  September 10, 2018.  The borrower returned to the account 2 thousand rubles.  October 1 and another 3 thousand rubles.  October 30.  However, the balance on the card on November 1 was -360 rubles.  Why it happens? </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <span>The grace period</span> in most cases is calculated not from the moment of purchase, but from the first day of the month.  So it turns out that 50 days ended on October 21.  For this period, the debt amounted to 5 - 2 = 3 thousand rubles.  Since the debt was not paid on time, the bank wrote off: 3,000 x 0.12 = 360 rubles.  at the expense of interest.  And subsequent receipts did not cover the entire amount of the debt. </p><div class="photo" data-original="brobank.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="plasticine credit card online application for registration" class="if uuid-2976117" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/2976117.jpg"></div><h2>  Why do you need cashback? </h2><p>  To consider loyalty programs and cashbacks as additional bonuses should be only if you really often make purchases in partner stores.  Otherwise, what's the point of a 10% cashback in a jewelry store if you don‚Äôt use jewelry?  The second pitfall is the amount of funds returned.  So, with a ‚ÄúPlasticine‚Äù credit card, an online application for registration of which promises a lot of advantages, it is possible to return bonuses after accumulating 1000 rubles in the account.  and applying for cashback payment.  Calculate how much you need to make purchases in order to accumulate this amount. </p><h2>  Credit history </h2><p>  Before deciding on a loan, the bank analyzes the credit history of the client.  This is a database that collects information about all the loans that a person has used throughout his life, with a detailed breakdown: when, on what terms, in what volume the loan was taken, timely payments.  A delay in payment of a monthly card payment of 1-2 days can significantly worsen a client‚Äôs credit history.  These are the worst consequences that illiterate use of a payment instrument may entail. </p><h2>  Withdraw funds </h2><p>  Although obtaining a credit card online at Sberbank or any other credit institution is very quick, it should be understood that such a payment tool is intended exclusively for non-cash payments.  For withdrawal operations, an overestimated rate (fixed amount + percentage of withdrawal) is provided, and the grace period is 30 days.  But banks welcome the desire of customers to keep their own funds on plastic. </p><h2>  How to apply for a credit card at Sberbank Online? </h2><p>  To apply, you need to click on "Card Transactions" on the official website of a financial institution on the "Cards" page and select "Credit Card Application". </p><div class="photo" data-original="sber-help.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="issuing credit card sberbank online" class="if uuid-2976121" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/2976121.jpg"></div><p>  The system will offer several service packages to choose from.  It is enough to click on any of them and in a special form indicate the contact details: </p><ul><li>  card name; </li></ul><ul><li>  FULL NAME.; </li></ul><ul><li>  city ‚Äã‚Äãname; </li></ul><ul><li>  passport data; </li></ul><ul><li>  telephone. </li></ul><p>  After that, the application is sent for consideration to specialists.  The decision is made on the day the application is received.  What the client will be informed about over the phone.  To get plastic, the applicant must personally visit the bank at the place of registration and provide a passport. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sber-help.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="application Sberbank" class="if uuid-2976113" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/2976113.jpg"></div><h2>  Top 5 best maps in Russia </h2><p>  So maybe it's better to take loans?  Making credit cards online makes it possible to pay for services, make purchases anywhere in the world.  If you need funds to buy some goods, then it is better to really get a target loan at a lower percentage. </p><p>  How to choose the best card?  Analyzing the conditions of banks, you need to pay attention to the limit, interest, grace period.  In 2018, Russians actively used Tinkoff Bank, Platinum cards from Russian Standard, and 100 days without% from Alfa Bank.  Let us consider in more detail the features of each of them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.oceanbank.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="online credit card application" class="if uuid-2976116" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/2976116.jpg"></div><p>  Making a Tinkoff credit card online takes only a couple of minutes.  The courier will bring the plastic to the client within 2-3 days after the confirmation of the application.  A holder of plastic within the framework of the ‚ÄúBravo‚Äù bonus program can receive up to 30% for cashback purchases on special offers in online stores, a network of cafes, restaurants, through ticket booking services and much more.  The main advantage of the card is the ability to "Transfer credit balance" from one bank to another and pay the debt within 120 days. </p><p>  You can withdraw money from a Platinum credit card at ATMs of the Russian Standard without a commission.  Annual account maintenance will cost 499 rubles.  If the debt is not closed during the grace period, then the balance is charged at 21.9%.  All purchases are covered by 1% cashback, 5% by category, 15% by partners. </p><p>  Alfa-Bank was the first credit institution to issue cards with a period of 60 days.  Today, a financial institution offers everyone to apply for a credit card for 100 days and not pay a fee for withdrawing funds.  This is an advantageous offer for those who are used to using the grace period in large purchases and often withdraw money from the account. </p><p>  This card will be beneficial for those who are used to using the grace period for medium and large purchases, as well as for those who often withdraw cash from a credit card (the grace period with Alfa-Bank card also covers cash withdrawals).  That is why the Alfa-Bank card can be considered one of the most profitable credit cards for withdrawing cash from ATMs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cdn.fishki.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="card &quot;Conscience&quot;" class="if uuid-2976125" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/2976125.jpg"></div><p>  We should also mention credit cards, on which you can purchase goods in installments for 12 months.  Using the Conscience card, you can buy goods and services from Kiwi Bank partners for a total of 5 to 300 thousand rubles.  No release fee is charged.  There is no annual service fee.  It is enough for the client to apply for a card once and continue to use it at any convenient time. </p><p>  A similar Halva card can be issued free of charge at Sovcombank.  You can keep your own funds in the account or use only borrowed funds.  For some operations, a cashback of up to 20 percent is provided. </p>
