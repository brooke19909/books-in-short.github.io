Currently, it is in the process of restoration, annually opening for visitors more and more new beauties. </p><h2>  Legacy </h2><p>  Like many churches in the country, his time did not regret it.  For many years its halls were desolate, casting gloom and hopelessness.  The colors of the frescoes decorating the domes of the domes are barely visible even in bright sunlight.  Pictures of the twelve apostles were laid out in the 13th century. </p>

    <p>  Today the Patriarchal Cathedral in Pitsunda is recognized as the largest building of its kind in the country.  Its dimensions surprise even experienced travelers.  The height of the skeleton reaches thirty meters.  The length is 37 and the masonry width is 25. </p><p>  The official date of construction of the complex is not known for certain.  It is believed that it was built at the very end of the X century.  For a long period, he played the role of the throne church and was an integral part of a single monastery compound. </p><h2>  Silent captivity </h2><p>  The Patriarchal Cathedral in Pitsunda is a pride and a symbol of the cultural heritage of the peoples living in the territory of modern Abkhazia.  Its walls, the thickness of which exceeds one and a half meters, are laid out of two materials at once. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Ancient architects used natural stone and brick, which create the very recognizable alternation of stripes of the main building of the complex.  The lower tiers are almost entirely represented by boulders.  The upper ones are made of bricks, from which miniature elements of the architectural ensemble are created. </p><p>  The outer side is decorated with narrow windows-loopholes, separated by crosses.  <span>The interior space is</span> plastered and decorated with frescoes.  Alas, only a fraction of the wealth that the Patriarchal Cathedral in Pitsunda was famous for centuries ago was preserved. </p><p>  In addition to the main spacious hall, the temple has a tomb that hides two shrines from prying eyes.  The relics of Simon Canait and Andrew the First-Called lie in them. </p><h2>  Lost heritage </h2><p>  The frescoes that still managed to be preserved and restored are truly priceless.  The fact is that the first attempts at restoration of paintings were made in the 19th century.  They were so unprofessional that they inflicted irreparable damage to the complex. </p>

    <p>  A certain architect named Norov led the process of updating church painting.  It was he, inspired by the samples of works of Italian artists, who gave the order to lighten old canvases. </p><p>  The Patriarchal Cathedral in <span>Pitsunda (Abkhazia)</span> did not spare the war, which lasted exactly one year.  In 1878, the interior of the monastery was barbarously plundered by Turkish warriors. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Soviet past </h2><p>  After the revolution, the <span>fate of the temple was</span> also unenviable.  In 1970, local authorities arranged a concert hall in it, covering the rare works of icon painters with a layer of plaster.  Having set a goal to improve the acoustic capabilities of the hall, the builders broke part of the frescoes, destroying them forever. </p><p>  Under the protection of the state, the Patriarchal Cathedral in Pitsunda (Abkhazia) was taken much later.  At that time, the paintings located in the inner part of the main dome, the images of seven angels and cherubs plus a part of the frescoes were subject to restoration. </p><p>  At that time, when the temple was used as a concert hall, an organ brought from Germany was installed in it.  Its weight exceeds twenty tons!  And the height of the instrument is 11 meters. </p><p>  The best stage for musical performances in Abkhazia is still considered the Patriarchal Cathedral in Pitsunda.  The body is in good condition.  The quality of its sound is not inferior to the previous acoustics. </p>

    <h2>  Modern realities </h2><p>  In 2010, serious controversy erupted around the scene in the temple.  Representatives of the Orthodox diocese of the country stated that the location of the body is unacceptable.  But the secular community defended the musical tradition that had developed within the monastery walls. </p><p>  The lion's share of priceless artifacts found in the vicinity of the cathedral is carefully stored in the art museum.  We are talking about fragments of the mosaic floor, icons and the royal seal.  Since 2006, archaeological excavations have been carried out on the territory of the church, which have already borne fruit.  The remains of the foundation and walls were completely cleared of soil. </p><h2>  Contact Information </h2><p>  Tens of thousands of tourists are eager to visit the Patriarchal Cathedral in Pitsunda.  How to get to it?  Everything is very simple.  The temple rises in the heart of the city of Pitsunda.  Within walking distance from it are public transport.  Immediately shuttle taxis run every now and then. </p>

    <p>  The doors of the monastery close at five in the evening.  If you arrive early, you can see not only the main structure of the ensemble, but also the monastery courtyard.  It contains the smallest dolmen in Abkhazia and a pair of well-preserved chapels.  In summer, loopholes in the walls are partially overgrown with grass.  Access to them can be difficult. </p><p>  The local history museum and souvenir shop are open until late in the evening.  The cost of admission for an adult visitor to the complex last year was 50 rubles.  For the tour, accompanied by a professional Russian-speaking guide, 150 were requested. </p>
