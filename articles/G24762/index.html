This is the route from St. Petersburg to Sortavala.  The proximity to St. Petersburg and at the same time secluded location attract tourists who do not want too expensive, but at the same time have a good rest in nature.  Here you can steam in a bathhouse, fish, cook it in the open air and go boating.  The name of the base is due to the fact that it really stands on the borders of Ladoga.  Further it is only an open lake.  Today we take a walk around this base and the marvelous places that surround it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Recreation center ravens outpost address and photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2177354.jpg"></div>
