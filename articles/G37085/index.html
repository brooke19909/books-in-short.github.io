Despite its small area, it is an important railway junction, as it is the first to meet all visitors to the peninsula.  Translated from the Crimean Tatar dialect, its name means "sweet village."  The first mention in the annals of this city was made in the eighteenth century. </p><h2>  Historical facts </h2><p>  Dzhankoy (Crimea) has a very rich past related to the activities of Jewish communities on its territory.  At the beginning of the twentieth century, a Zionist organization was founded here, as well as a center for preparing for agricultural work.  A little later, near the Kolay station, an agricultural commune of Jews was organized, and ten years later it was turned into a collective farm.  During the Second World War, this community was destroyed. </p><p>  Today, the city of Dzhankoy (Crimea) is one of the largest centers for the processing of agricultural products and the production of appropriate equipment. </p>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  This district center is located ten kilometers west of the inflow called Sivash and is under republican subordination.  Locals call this city ‚ÄúCrimea's Gate‚Äù among themselves, as vacationers often stop there, heading further to the peninsula. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  One channel passes through the entire territory of the district center, and two rivers also flow.  Therefore, Dzhankoy (Crimea) is well provided with fresh water, which cannot be said about other settlements of the peninsula. </p><p>  Its area is approximately 26 kilometers square of the North Crimean plain, so the relief of this area does not have large hills and drops. </p>
