Sports and language camps abroad</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Even before the onset of summer, one and the same question begins to worry all parents - "How to organize the leisure of their adored offspring?"  Naturally, adults want the kids to be safe, fed and passionate about something during the summer months.  In addition, it would be nice if the child received new knowledge and gained invaluable experience.  Of course, in an ordinary urban environment, this is not easy, or rather, simply impossible.  Therefore, parents are looking for camp tickets for the child.  But how to make him study during the holidays?  After all, ordinary shifts are designed only for rest and recovery.  In this matter, children's camps abroad come to the aid of moms and dads.  They successfully combine relaxation and an exciting language learning program.  The child is gradually immersed in a new world for him and quietly begins to speak a foreign language.  In addition to such shifts, there are specialized sports camps abroad.  They are designed for children who are seriously passionate about sports and cannot even forget about it even in the summer months.  Therefore, today we have prepared a brief overview of those overseas camps where the kids will have fun, interesting and informative. </p><div class="photo" data-original="clubtom.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ticket to the children's camp" class="if uuid-2564364" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2564364.jpg"></div><h2>  A few common words </h2><p>  Children's camps abroad provide invaluable experience and knowledge that a child will never gain elsewhere.  Shifts are usually formed for schoolchildren from seven to eighteen years old, very rarely camps accept children from five years old. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Outwardly, these institutions are not much different from similar ones in Russia: the kids live together, play, go on excursions and play sports.  However, if we are talking, for example, about a language camp, then from the very beginning of the shift, children are immersed in an atmosphere that is the best suited for learning the language.  It is spoken by educators, attendants and peers.  In addition, special classes are held daily.  They are made out in the form of games, competitions and excursions.  Thus, the child quickly adapts to the new environment and easily remembers a foreign language. </p><p>  In sports international children's camps abroad, the system of work is similar to that already described above.  The only difference is the emphasis on sports, although the kids are also involved in the language.  Thus, the child receives double benefits and, having arrived home, feels full of strength and new knowledge. </p><p>  Usually, camps abroad have their own rather large territories on which children are accommodated.  But in some cases, accommodation in host families is also provided.  When purchasing a ticket, parents are always informed about the features of accommodation. </p><h2>  What is included in the package? </h2><p>  When sending their child to a camp abroad, mothers and fathers should not worry about his safety.  Almost every minute the child will be supervised by adults, because this is certainly included in the price of the purchased ticket. </p><p>  Keep in mind that for the amount paid, the student receives a transfer, medical insurance, comfortable accommodation and full-board meals.  Also included are excursions, all recreational activities and educational materials.  After training, the child must be issued a certificate confirming the course taken. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="aizorel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="camp for children and youth" class="if uuid-2564352" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2564352.jpg"></div><h2>  Learning Features </h2><p>  Sports and language camps have a similar training program.  Of course, in each case there are a lot of nuances and features, but still the general features are clearly traced. </p><p>  The shift in the camp is designed for three to four weeks.  In language shifts, classes are conducted for forty-five minutes.  There should be at least twenty per week.  Thus, in four weeks there will be eighty of them.  As you know, this is an extremely rich course that will give the child a lot of new knowledge. </p><p>  In sports children's and youth summer camps abroad, the program is no less eventful.  The shift participants have at least two workouts per day, which are replaced by theoretical studies, entertainment and language learning. </p><p>  Usually the program in the camps is composed of three blocks.  The first includes games and entertainment.  It can be theatrical performances, vocal competitions, modeling, choreography and the like. </p><p>  The second block consists of sporting events.  They do not occupy the last place in the recreation program, even in <span>language camps.</span>  <span>In Malta,</span> for example, a child will be taught beach sports.  And in Switzerland, he will try climbing.  Each country offers its own sports program. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The third block is excursions.  Their frequency depends on many nuances, but less than twice a week they are usually not organized. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mama.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="language camps" class="if uuid-2564345" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2564345.jpg"></div><h2>  The most popular destinations for children's holidays abroad </h2><p>  Not all countries have bases for organizing summer vacations in different directions.  And our compatriots are not interested in all directions, as their children want to give the best and most interesting.  Most often, Russians purchase the following packages for their offspring: </p><ul><li>  To camps in Malta. </li><li>  To the camps in Cyprus. </li><li>  To camps in Turkey. </li><li>  To the Bulgarian camps. </li><li>  To the Spanish camps. </li></ul><p>  We will consider all the possibilities of rest in these areas. </p><div class="photo" data-original="smapse.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="language learning" class="if uuid-2564347" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2564347.jpg"></div><h2>  Children's Holidays in Malta </h2><p>  In Malta, mainly international language camps are located, giving the feeling of complete immersion in a new environment.  It is worth going here if your child is learning English and already has some communication skills in it.  Of course, on-site children are divided into groups depending on age and level of language proficiency.  But it will be more difficult for a child with basic knowledge to communicate with peers and local residents.  Indeed, during the excursions, students visit cafes, shops and other public places, where they are provided with an excellent opportunity to improve conversational skills. </p><p>  In Malta, the most popular are two camps: </p><ul><li>  JUNIOR CAMP.  This camp is located in a beautiful tourist place - the city of Sliema.  Children are accommodated on the basis of a well-proven three-star hotel in triple rooms with everything you need.  Across the street from the hotel is a municipal sandy beach that is clean.  The camp program is designed for children from eleven to seventeen years old.  It includes yachting, language training, participation in creative festivals, intellectual competitions and much more.  A two-week shift costs about one hundred thousand rubles without a flight to Malta. </li><li>  Perfect English.  Children from nine to seventeen years old can come here.  The change lasts two weeks, its cost includes air travel from Moscow and ranges from one hundred forty-five thousand rubles.  The camp is located in the resort of Bugibba, considered the best place for youth recreation.  There are cafes, shops, amusement parks, water activities, and cruise ships are on the pier.  By the way, one of the excursions includes a trip to Sicily, where children can see the volcano Etna with their own eyes.  Students are accommodated on the basis of a four-star hotel in rooms for four people. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="royalsky.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="international groups in camps" class="if uuid-2564362" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2564362.jpg"></div><h2>  Leisure and training in Turkey </h2><p>  This country has long been a favorite vacation spot of our compatriots.  But if you cannot go on vacation with a child to Turkey, then get a ticket to the camp for him.  Here the child will get a great opportunity to spend the summer with his peers and recharge with positive emotions.  In addition, an independent trip to Turkey will be a great adventure and life experience.  The following children's camps are worthy of the attention of parents: </p><ul><li>  "Naughty Orange."  Kids are accommodated in a large building with its own territory of five hectares.  All this beauty is located in Kemer, where students will relax while enjoying the sea and mountain air.  The rooms are designed for two to four people and have an area of ‚Äã‚Äãtwenty-five squares.  The recreation program is very saturated.  It is difficult to list all the activities that it includes: discos, aerobics, yoga, trips to Kemer, to the dolphinarium and water park, evening boat trips, horse riding and fishing.  This is a small fraction of what is offered to children in "Mischievous Orange". </li><li>  Adakule.  This camp is intended for teenagers and youth from fourteen to twenty two years old.  It is located between Kusadasi and Izmir in a beautiful resort place away from the noisy tourist crowds.  Two weeks of rest, which includes a flight, cost seventy-five thousand rubles.  Teens are accommodated in a five-star hotel in groups of three to four.  Children eat on a buffet basis, the hotel's beach is pebble with clean and clear water.  Entertainment includes mainly the standard program provided by the hotel. </li></ul><h2>  Children's camps in Cyprus with learning English </h2><p>  Which of the children did not dream of spending the summer on a sunny island surrounded by sea waves?  It is so easy to imagine yourself as a pirate or a brave captain studying the language of the natives.  In such an environment, everything new is easy to remember, and vivid impressions of the rest will please the child for a long time. </p><p>  The most famous language camp is the Junior Camp, where children from nine to seventeen gather.  Its feature is teaching English according to the level of knowledge of the child.  Moreover, groups are formed on the basis of the principle of internationality.  Thus, the child is much easier to learn, even if his level is not higher than the initial. </p><p>  Changes are designed for fifteen days, a ticket without a flight costs ninety-five thousand rubles.  The recreation program includes not only training, but also creative and intellectual activities.  Children become participants in competitions, workshops and creative parties.  Rest is not complete without sporting events: horse riding is organized for schoolchildren, they canoe, climb rocks and take windsurfing lessons. </p><div class="photo" data-original="polsha24.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rest of children abroad" class="if uuid-2564350" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2564350.jpg"></div><h2>  Children's camps in Greece </h2><p>  Greece is a magnificent country in which Russian tourists are so fond of and provide them with a lot of options for recreation.  Many in Greece and camps for adolescents and youths of different orientations.  You can send your child here to learn the language, do sports or simply improve your health at a seaside resort.  We will consider only two of a large number of camps: </p><ul><li>  EllinCamp.  The shift is mainly designed for this camp, which specializes in sports and learning English at the same time, for fifteen days.  But there are longer trips - for twenty-two days.  The average cost of rest slightly exceeds eighty thousand rubles.  Children from six to sixteen years old can come to EllinCamp.  The camp, located on the shores of the Aegean Sea, is distinguished by an abundance of activities and a strict daily routine. </li><li>  ONLY ENGLISH LAND.  Learning English in Thessaloniki is an interesting game.  Parents can purchase a ticket for children from eight to nineteen years old for fifteen and twenty-nine days.  The minimum cost of a shift is ninety thousand rubles.  A feature of training in the camp is a program that is designed in such a way that children even think in English. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="language programs" class="if uuid-2564354" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2564354.jpg"></div><h2>  Bulgaria: organizing children's activities </h2><p>  Russians come to this country with pleasure, since everything here reminds us of our homeland, but nevertheless it has some tangible touch of the West.  Therefore, it is not surprising that trips to children's camps are in great demand.  Almost the most famous camp in Bulgaria is the Matrix.  Trips here cost an average of sixty thousand rubles, but these are mere pennies for that unique program that makes the camp unique.  Children who come to the Matrix will go in for sports every day, since here they are primarily in favor of a healthy lifestyle.  However, creativity is not the last place in the camp.  Every day, children take part in a new role-playing game, all this is accompanied by incredible special effects and animation programs.  If desired, English will be taught to students for an additional fee. </p><div class="photo" data-original="staracademy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="football camps" class="if uuid-2564374" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2564374.jpg"></div><h2>  Where to send your child on holiday in Spain? </h2><p>  Sunny Spain with its amazingly beautiful coast is a great option for a summer vacation.  Parents often send young football players here so that they can not only have a good rest, but also not lose their physical shape.  I must say that football camps in Spain are quite common.  They are designed for different ages and are organized mainly by the country's football clubs.  For example, Real Madrid invites children from nine to eighteen years old in a camp where classes are taught in two languages ‚Äã‚Äã- English and Spanish.  Two weeks of relaxation mixed with training will cost parents one thousand three hundred euros.  There is a camp in Madrid. </p><p>  And in Valencia there is a camp for girls who are keen on football.  Young talents from six to sixteen can spend time in a great place, training with Spanish football stars.  The cost of the two-week program is slightly more than five hundred euros. </p><p>  You can also send your child to Barcelona.  It takes boys from eleven to seventeen years old.  The level of training here is quite high, and accommodation is estimated at a solid five.  This camp is considered one of the most expensive - one week in full board will cost almost two thousand euros. </p>
