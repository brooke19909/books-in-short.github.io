Change mobile number</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When we buy the starter pack of any mobile operator, a phone number is tied to it by default, using which our friends, relatives and other subscribers can call us.  We understand this, so we try to choose a package with the most “beautiful” combination of numbers. </p><p>  An unusual solution is offered by Beeline.  Anyone who wants it can change the number tied to the starter pack.  The service is available due to not so significant restrictions, therefore, any subscriber is able to use it.  We talk about how this works and what is the meaning of this option in this article. </p><h2>  Choose and pick </h2><p>  Beeline offers to change the phone number associated with your SIM card.  It is very simple to do this: it is enough to indicate your old number, and then create a certain combination that you would like to see in your number.  Further, the system will show which ones you can change the phone number of your package for, as well as give information about the cost of the transition.  After that, by following a few steps, you will be the owner of a new number.  Regarding the entire procedure, a couple of important points should be clarified.  We are talking about cost, as well as restrictions on combinations. </p>

    <p>  For the price it should be noted that it varies depending on which number will be chosen by the subscriber in the future.  Let's say beautiful and repeating numbers will be more expensive than combinations without any patterns.  This must be considered when you make a selection. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As for the possibilities of choice, here everything is limited only by what numbers are not already occupied in the Beeline subscriber network.  You can change the phone number, for example, to one that will include your date of birth, house and apartment number, or a number issued by another operator.  If there are no repetitions of numbers and “beautiful” combinations in such a number, the replacement cost will be quite low. </p><h2>  Why is this? </h2>

    <p>  Partly to the question about why the “Number to choose” service might be needed, Beeline gives on the site (namely, on the page where the description of the option is contained).  It says that the subscriber can make his number more memorable, “bind” its value to any event, date or digital combination.  On the other hand, with the help of a replacement, you can also get an “image” number that your customers will easily remember as well, which ultimately will be fruitfully reflected in your business. </p>

    <p>  There are lots of options.  Someone wants to please a loved one and take a phone number similar to his;  or someone just needs to get rid of the old one in order to lose touch with unnecessary acquaintances. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It really doesn't matter for what reason a person needs a new phone number.  The main thing is that Beeline allows you to change the number allows you to quickly and easily, but also inexpensive, if it comes to a simple digital combination. </p><h2>  Old or new "sim card"? </h2><p>  Another question that may arise before the user is whether to save the old SIM card or take a new one if you use the “Number to choose” service. </p><p>  Beeline on the official website notes that, if desired, the user can leave his old card to work with the new number.  This is convenient, because in this case the subscriber no longer needs to buy a new starter pack and, accordingly, make extra expenses. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  If you want to change the phone number through Beeline, the operator has a single tariff grid for such a service.  It is expressed in the amounts that must be paid for a number of one type or another.  For example, a subscriber must pay 30 rubles for the usual combination of numbers.  For a “bronze” number, the contribution amount increases to 1000 rubles.  A user who wants to switch to a silver number pays 5000;  and the one who is interested in the "golden" combination - all 15 thousand rubles. </p>

    <h2>  What are the "gold", "silver", "bronze" numbers? </h2><p>  To distinguish between these three categories, Beeline analyzes a phone number for duplicate numbers.  The more in a combination of identical digits - the more expensive the number is considered.  Well, and accordingly, it belongs to the more valuable category. </p><p>  “Bronze” is a number in which a combination of 3 digits is repeated;  “Silver” - from 4, and “gold” - from 5 identical symbols. </p><h2>  How to change? </h2><p>  There are several ways to change your Beeline number.  Via the Internet, directly at the office of the company, as well as through the operator, you can change your phone number to a new one using any of the above methods. </p>

    <p>  If this is easiest to do through the Internet (just go to the company’s website, enter your old number, provide a passport scan, then choose a combination for the new one), then other methods require additional efforts.  Read more about this - read on. </p><h2>  Change in company office </h2><p>  In order to get a new Beeline phone (change the subscriber’s number through the company’s office), you must provide a passport.  In addition, you need to explain to the consultants of the mobile operator what exactly you would like to see in your issue - what numbers should be present there.  Describe the combination that you would prefer. </p>

    <p>  In addition to this, of course, one cannot fail to mention the cost of services.  As already mentioned, the selection of the number is free, but the price of a new one will depend directly on the value of the final option, on the digital combinations in it. </p><h2>  Change by calling the operator </h2><p>  Another opportunity to change the number through Beeline is to call the operator.  You can do this by calling 0611 or 8 800 700 061 (for calls throughout Russia).  It is important to note that in order to identify you, an employee of the company may ask you to dictate your passport data. </p><p>  Another important point: when replacing through a specialist of the company, the subscriber is not given the opportunity to select a new number. </p><h2>  Limitations </h2><p>  If you want a new Beeline (phone number), you need to meet a number of requirements that apply in the system.  The first is debt.  A subscriber changing his number should not have debts both for the “On full trust” service and for other options, including a monthly fee.  The user must have a good reputation as a payer for mobile services - only then can he count on a new number. </p><p>  The second condition is the length of stay in the system.  In order for the subscriber to have the right to change the phone number, the period of use of the Beeline basic package should be more than 1 month.  This also includes another limitation - the period of one month, which must elapse from the moment of the previous number change. </p>

    <p>  The third, rather, feature is the form of payment, in which the client can make the payment.  If, in the case of work through a consultant by phone or via the Internet, repayment of the amount of debt from a subscriber account is allowed, then when contacting the office, the subscriber has the right to pay in cash. </p><h2>  Customer Reviews </h2><p>  Having learned all the details about this service, it would be interesting to look at the recommendations of simple operator’s customers - subscribers who have already used it. </p><p>  On numerous resources, ordinary visitors share their impressions of the option that was described in this article.  As you can judge by them, ordinary people really like the opportunity to switch to a more attractive number.  This is not only practical, but also adds some image to its owner. </p><p>  More people respond positively to the promotions that Beeline conducted to attract attention to the service.  For example, there was a period when “silver” numbers were connected at the price of “simple” ones.  You can imagine the hype of subscribers! </p><p>  Now, of course, the operator does not hold any shares, since the service is already well-known.  However, they provide you with an excellent choice: either pay and get an attractive number consisting of the same numbers, or just go to the one that you will remember because of the “peculiarity” of the numbers it will consist of.  And this, as previously described, is quite convenient. </p><h2>  Old number </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews from the forums, some subscribers have a question: "But what about the old phone number, which the user at one time refused, switching to a new one? </p><p>  The question is logical, but the answer to it is extremely simple - it is turned off.  According to Beeline rules, changing a number means deactivating it.  Further, everything happens according to the procedure in force with many mobile operators.  For a long period of time (usually a year) this number is disabled.  This means that when calling him, a person hears something like “incorrectly dialed number”.  Further, after this period, the new subscriber receives it and continues to use it for their own purposes. </p>
