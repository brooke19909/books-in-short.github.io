  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Perception is what?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Every day we are attacked by various irritants: faces, news broadcasts, buildings, advertising, conversations, even if we take into account what we hear or see from this a very small part.  I wonder why this is happening.  The answer is because of perception.  You should know that perception is a special process of obtaining all incoming information through the five senses of a person, awareness and giving it specific meaning.  It is caused by the influence of 3 components: </p><p>  - physical characteristics of various stimuli; </p><p>  - the ratio of such stimuli with their environment; </p><p>  - special moods of the individual. </p><p>  It is the last component that makes our perception individual.  After all, each personality considers the existing stimuli in its own coordinate system.  They often depict things that can be associated with the outside world.  But the total number of all stimuli affecting us complicates the whole process of perception even more.  We can absorb some of them completely, others only partially, some correctly, and some incorrectly.  In the end, we neglect some stimuli and choose others, because we are simply not able to perceive all the information coming to the brain at once. </p><p>  We select all impressions on two levels: external and internal.  Internal selection always occurs for physiological and psychological reasons.  Psychological selection, due to our feelings, experiences, or interests, makes us completely distort specific incentives or ignore them at all. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When perception occurs (this is a prerequisite), motor components take part in it (eye movement and palpation of objects; speaking or singing of appropriate sounds).  So perception will most correctly be designated as the perceptual activity of the subject. </p><p>  <strong>Types of perception</strong> </p><p>  All people feel the surrounding world in different ways, but, nevertheless, they distinguish 3 main types of perception: </p><ul><li>  auditory (perception of this happens with the help of sounds); </li><li>  visual (through pictures, images); </li><li>  kinesthetic (using <span>tactile sensations,</span> feelings). </li></ul><p>  People visuals basically see the world, people audio hear it, but kinesthetics feel it.  These three types of perception help us make decisions, suggest how to respond to certain situations that occur around us.  Therefore, they can even be called types of thinking. </p><p>  Naturally, the audio / visual / kinesthetic system seems a bit simplified.  After all, no one can perceive reality one-sidedly, with the help of just one type.  A person, as it were, switches from one type of perception to another and vice versa (which depends on what is happening around the situation). </p><p>  <strong>Perception development</strong> </p><p>  During human life, perception goes a rather complicated way in its development.  This development is especially intense in the early stages of a child‚Äôs life, in his early years. </p><p>  A child is born with a more or less highly developed analysis system, with a number of indicative unconditional reactions consisting in the installation of receptor apparatuses, which ensures optimal perception of the surrounding stimuli.  From the first day, the child feels significant changes in perception.  By the age of 6 months there are search active actions.  Over time, the baby begins to perceive complex stimuli more complex, can recognize and even differentiate them.  Then development goes to the next level - objective perception.  This is the period when the child can already recognize the mother.  And so, in stages, perception is becoming more active, it is associated with children's active activity.  Then it acquires an almost independent meaning and passes into the properties of <span>higher mental functions</span> (awareness and arbitrariness). </p>
