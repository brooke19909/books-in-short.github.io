Macrame technique is used to make various <span>wall panels,</span> flowerpots, lampshades, women‚Äôs jewelry, curtains, chair covers, <span>geometric</span> napkins and so on. </p><h2>  Materials </h2><p>  Macram√© weaving is not an easy job that requires special attention and patience.  Not all beginners know which materials are best used for macram√© technique.  Schemes for beginners will help you figure out how to weave a beautiful thing in stages.  First you need to choose a non-slip thread, for example, cotton or a thick clothesline. </p><p>  For the manufacture of jewelry and clothing accessories use floss, linen, woolen <span>threads, lurex,</span> iris.  Things that are made of leather cut into thin strips look very interesting. </p>

    <p>  The product will better keep its shape, if you use a thin wire, you can color.  First, a frame is prepared from the wire, and then threads are hung on it.  A lot of girls and women are interested in how to weave macram√©. </p><h2>  On a note </h2><p>  When working with silk threads or twine, moisten your fingers.  It is necessary to wear fabric gloves when weaving from tight ropes.  It is better to boil hard natural threads before use - they will be softer and more elastic. </p><p>  <span>Silk threads are woven</span> during work, so that it is easier to weave from them, you need to grease with glue or tie knots, and in synthetic ones - to melt the ends over a fire. </p>

    <p>  In the preliminary calculation of the material consumption, it must be remembered that the working thread becomes 4 times shorter when knots are knitted, when weaving with double flat knots - by 6-8 times, when weaving the net - by 3-3.5 times. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What is needed for weaving macram√© </h2><p>  When working with fine threads, you need a pad that is filled with sifted sand or foam and covered with a soft cloth.  For beginners, you can use the soft seat of the old chair, a foam board, as well as a wooden board (20 * 45, 20 * 35, 15 * 30 cm), on which cotton wool 6-8 cm thick or a layer of foam rubber is placed and then covered with a cloth. </p><p>  For such work, scissors, decorative pins, PVA glue, ‚ÄúMoment‚Äù, needles with a big eye are still needed. </p><h2>  ABC Macrame </h2><p>  First you need to learn the names of the threads that are used in macram.  The weaving pattern is simple, if you know some tricks. </p><p>  Carrier thread - in macram, it is a thread on which all threads for this product are hung.  Nodular thread or warp - knots are woven around it.  It must be tightly pulled, otherwise the knot will not work.  Working thread - knots are knotted around it around the warp, its length should be 30 cm. An additional thread is woven additionally into the product, despite all the previously hung. </p><h2>  Thread Attachment Methods </h2><p>  If you want to do macrame, weaving patterns are described in detail below. </p><p>  Front fastening of threads with a lock.  Fold in half the working thread, lower the base loop down.  The resulting two ends of the thread are lowered down to the base and into the loop.  The horizontal bar of the loop should be on the face of the set. </p><p>  Wrong fastening of threads with a lock.  They also fold the working thread in half, but they bring the loop up under the base.  Then the loop is lowered onto the base and both ends are passed into it.  The crossbar of the loop will be on the wrong side. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  <em>Expanded front thread mount</em> .  The thread is folded in half, strengthened with a lock on the basis of the front side.  Then the threads are disconnected: they take the right one, introduce it up under the base, then down to the base and into the loop;  on the left they repeat the same actions as on the right.  Such fastening of threads is used for a dense row of knots, between them the carrier thread is not visible.  If you make a larger number of turns at each end of the threads, then the fastening will be even denser. </p><p>  <em>Expanded seam lock with thread lock</em> .  Fold the working thread in half and lock with the lock inside out fixed on the base.  Then the right thread is brought up on the base, under it down and into the loop.  On the left, they do the same. </p><p>  Uneven fastening of the thread is used by performing a chain.  In this case, the working thread decreases 4 times faster than the knotted one. </p><h2>  Main nodes </h2><p>  <em>Hercules knot</em> .  Two threads of 10 cm are placed vertically on the pillow, the ends are separately secured with a pin.  The right thread is brought under the left, and the left - from the bottom-up and into the loop.  Then the knot is tightened. </p><p>  <em>Nodular chain</em> .  Take two threads.  In turn, each is sometimes working, then nodular. </p><p>  <em>Rep node</em> .  He is knitted from left to right, and from right to left. </p><p>  Rep node from left to right.  Before the working thread, the nodular is laid, the working one is thrown over the nodular on the left side and carried out on the nodular, then again the working thread is thrown over the nodular, but on the right side, the end of the thread is pulled through the loop formed.  Turns align and tighten.  This macrame technique, the scheme of which is described above, can be used to make any interesting thing. </p>

    <p>  The rep knot from right to left is knitted like that, only at first the working thread is thrown to the right, and then to the left. </p><p>  <em>Triple horizontal knot</em> .  A horizontal knot is knitted with a working thread on the nodular.  Then the spent thread is re-placed on the nodular and introduced into the loop down.  Of these nodes, you can weave patterns in the form of rhombuses, zigzags. </p><p>  <em>Diagonal rep node</em> .  They take three threads, they are hung on a nodular and weave a diagonal knot.  With their left hand they hold the first knotted thread on the right, placing it diagonally.  The second is thrown to the right through the nodular and pulled forward, up to the nodular on the left and down into the loop, the knot is tightened.  With the third thread, they do the same as with the second one using the macrame technique (the scheme will help to figure it out). </p><p>  <em>Double flat, or square knot</em> .  Most often weave it on 4 threads (2 workers and 2 nodules).  The leftmost thread is thrown over two nodular (they are located in the middle), the right one is passed over the left and then under the nodular ones and pulled over the left working thread.  A left half-node is formed. </p><p>  Put the rightmost thread over the knotted ones.  Left - on top of the right, passed under the nodular and displayed on top of the right thread.  The right half-node was formed. </p><p>  From two such half nodes a double flat knot is obtained, and when repeating the half node, you can get a twisted cord. </p><p>  <em>Chess</em> .  Having tied double flat knots in rows and leaving a distance between them, you can get a chessboard. </p><p>  Macrame weaving also implies a number of auxiliary knots: <em>simple, knot "horizon", knot through the arm, tatting, Chinese, capuchin, tie and Armenian.</em> </p><h2>  Beginning of work </h2><p>  Before you start working with macrame, you need to hang working threads on a nodular thread.  There are many different ways to hang: </p><p>  <em>Wicker ring</em> .  In order to make a sample, you will need only 10 threads: one thread one meter long, two 1.6 meters long, three 0.3 meters long, four - 0.15 meters.  One thread should be laid vertically on the pillow, pinned in the middle.  From the center in each direction you need to postpone 10 cm. </p>

    <p>  The second thread should be carefully folded in half and attached from the wrong side to the middle part of the first thread.  Next, you need to weave a chain of square knots 20 cm long. The chain needs to be folded in half, the ends of the first thread to be joined together.  After that, you should tie a flat knot in the following sequence: second - first - second. </p><p>  Next, you need to fix the thread using the "trap".  The last thread should be folded in half and looped down.  The third thread needs to be wrapped around the first thread, 7-9 turns should be made.  After that, you need to pull the loop for the two ends located on top. </p><h2>  Macrame workshop </h2><p>  In order to make a beautiful thing, you will need a frame from the old lampshade, it must first be covered with a new cloth.
