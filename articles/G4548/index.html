    <p>  Many men only once wore this stylish accessory, usually imposed by a woman.  Perhaps it was at the graduation party at school: at first the guys wanted to look beautiful in the photo, and then they got rid of the attribute.  Or at a wedding ceremony, where someone put a buttonhole on the groom at the last minute before the wedding.  Agree, this is not the best way to get acquainted with one of the best <span>men's accessories.</span> </p><p>  So how to make it?  You can make a boutonniere with your own hands from satin ribbons, foamiran and other materials.  Most often, women do this.  The way of creation is not so important.  After all, it all depends on what kind of flowers you want to use for the design of the buttonhole. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Flowers and masculinity </h2><p>  To begin with, it is necessary to clarify the moment with the perception of colors, as a purely female accessory.  There are many people who do not understand what a boutonniere is and attribute it to women's jewelry.  But such an opinion is very different from the truth. </p><p>  Great statesmen, warriors and poets wore flowers for over a millennium.  Soldiers went to war with pride and a flower on their chest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="wedding boutonnieres" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/1979822.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  When to wear a buttonhole? </h2><p>  Most men wore a flower on their lapels once in a lifetime, as we discussed above.  Perhaps it was at some official event, for example, at a wedding, anniversary, graduation party or theatrical performance.  But the only rule for wearing a buttonhole is that you do not need to wait for a special occasion to wear a flower in a buttonhole.  All that a person needs is self-confidence, the desire to swim against the tide. </p><p>  This is a very interesting situation - people around do not know what a boutonniere is and what its value is, but you know these nuances.  And people pay attention to you, try to consider your decoration.  However, a man should not wear such an accessory when he does not want to stand out from the crowd or can be condemned for it.  A funeral and an interview is not a place to attract attention or to demonstrate too obvious individualism. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  What is a boutonniere and how to wear it properly?  The accessory is mounted on the left lapel of a men's suit, sports jacket or jacket.  It can also be worn on a coat.  The buttonhole is always attached above the heart of a person, and it should be worn in a buttonhole on the lapel.  Special loops for her are often present only on expensive suits, but some make them on their own, sewing them from the inside to the lapel lining. </p><p>  A rare manufacturer is willing to invest extra money to make a special hole for a buttonhole in a jacket.  The presence of this device is an indication that the costume is not cheap.  But you can use special mounts and buttons. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="boutonniere photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14518/1980135.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  How to wear a boutonniere? </h2><p>  How to wear a buttonhole at a wedding or other special occasion, if the suit does not have a buttonhole?  There are several options.  You can simply attach the accessory to the lapel, as most people do.  This was once considered absurd, but in modern floristry, craftsmen have learned to make buttonholes so that the flower stalk looks attractive. </p><p>  Or you can cut the hole yourself.  This is a good solution if you have the time and the jacket is yours and not rented.  Any needlewoman can do this in 20 minutes.  You can also ask to make a boutonniere with your own hands from satin ribbons, as a substitute for a natural flower that can quickly fade.  Modern craftswomen are able to create bouquets from this material, indistinguishable from real ones, and often surpassing them in beauty. </p><p>  If the suit was rented, it is best to simply fix the accessory with a special clip.  In a festive photo, a boutonniere will be beneficial to distinguish you from the crowd of guests.  It is best to wear a light flower in the buttonhole, the stem of which is professionally prepared, and looks simple and attractive.  Sometimes brides and their friends make boutonnieres for the wedding with their own hands.  But it‚Äôs easier to entrust this work to a specialist. </p><h2>  Why wear a boutonniere </h2><p>  Why would a man wear a flower on his lapel?  There are three reasons for this: </p><ol><li>  This is a chance to start a conversation.  After all, maybe someone will ask you about what a buttonhole is and why you wear it.  If you do not want to answer, you can simply thank for your interest, and then stop the conversation or change its direction.  But it‚Äôs important to remember: nothing can ruin a conversation so quickly as a person who shows arrogance and talks too much about himself.  The flower on the lapel should be like a spark for starting a conversation, and not a topic for the whole conversation. </li><li>  You have something to give.  Suppose you had a wonderful evening with a woman you just met.  Really, at the end of the conversation you give her only your business card or phone number?  Try to leave it with something a little more unique and memorable: pull the bud out of the buttonhole and offer it to your lady. </li><li>  The presence of a boutonniere shows that you pay attention to details - when a man wears such an accessory, he thereby states that the little things matter. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself ribbon boutonniere" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/1979820.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ol><h2>  How to choose a flower on a lapel of a jacket? </h2><p>  Flowers in the boutonniere should be appropriate for the occasion - simple white or red shades are used for special occasions, while for less formal events, more colorful and exotic options are suitable.  It is important to remember several rules for wearing this accessory: </p><ol><li>  It should be matched with the clothes you wear. </li><li>  You can wear a tie and a beautifully folded pocket square at the same time as a buttonhole.  The rule here is balance.  Avoid too bright shades that muffle the color of your suit, or carry a white pocket scarf with you. </li><li>  The last factor in choosing a boutonniere is how long you plan to wear it: many flowers will fade in a few hours in the heat and without water.  So, if you are going to attend any long event, it is better to contact the florist for help or use a handmade buttonhole made of ribbons. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY wedding boutonnieres" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/1979819.jpg" width="400"></div></li></ol><h2>  Features of the carnation buttonhole </h2><p>  A white clove buttonhole is a simple and affordable option that is easy to find in any floristic department.  Of all the versions, this is perhaps the most versatile.  After all, cloves are very easy to pull out of the loop.  In addition, white is always acceptable, although it is better suited for more formal occasions.  Red is the second suitable option, and can be used with a black tie, an evening outfit or dress, a sports jacket and jeans.  It is better to give preference to miniature cloves. </p><p>  The only drawback of this flower: it will begin to sag after prolonged use.  Therefore, it is advisable not to wear it for a long time.  You can also use the bud, which will be professionally prepared by the florist.  Remember that flowers matter, and these meanings vary in different cultures.  Carnation is one of the most common boutonniere flowers in the United States.  She is the national flower of Spain, highly regarded in Korea.  However, in France, carnations are considered a mourning flower. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself boutonniere made of satin ribbons" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/1978376.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Rose Buttonhole </h2><p>  Rose buttonholes are more difficult to wear, as they are significantly larger.  The flower should be even and whole.  For the general public, they are considered the most formal option and are the perfect choice for a wedding or anniversary celebration.  For guests, rose boutonnieres can be prepared by professional florists. </p><p>  A red rose boutonniere is a message meaning passion and love.  A simple, inexpensive, and durable option is the lavender boutonniere.  Other color options: gardenia, lily of the valley, orchids, hyacinths, daisies and lilacs.  All of them are a great choice for buttonholes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself boutonniere made of satin ribbons" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/1979817.jpg" width="496"></div>

    <p>  The most important thing when using this jewelry: wear it with confidence and don't be afraid to be individual.  Wear a buttonhole because you want it.  Pay attention to the proportions.  If you are short, it is preferable to wear small flowers.  If you are a big man, consider flowers that fit your profile. </p>
