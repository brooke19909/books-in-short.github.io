    <h2>  RKO cost </h2><p>  Opening of the main and additional <span>foreign currency accounts is</span> sometimes charged.  This is a one-time and insignificant payment unlike, for example, from cash customer service.  A retail outlet needs to take cash proceeds to the bank every day.  For these purposes, collection is ordered.  This service is paid.  If the client independently brings cash to the department, then the fee for crediting it to the account depends on the number of transactions.  The more of them, the lower the cost. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Non-cash payments are also charged depending on the number of transactions.  Some banks charge a fixed monthly fee. </p><p>  Some financial institutions offer package services.  It includes a number of operations in limited quantities.  To calculate the profitability of this service, existing IPs can.  To do this, you need to compare the proposed number of operations in the package with the actual.  Why only IP?  Because only a private entrepreneur can carry out five operations per month: send taxes to the budget and transfer his salary from a current account to a card account. </p><h2>  Other payments </h2><p>  Enterprises that issue salaries to employees have to withdraw funds from the account at least once a month.  A commission is also charged for this operation.  The lion's share of the cost is the transfer of funds to plastic cards.  However, this cost item can be reduced by filling out a <span>salary project</span> at the bank. </p>

    <p>  Very popular today, remote service is used by both private entrepreneurs and organizations.  The system "bank - client - online" allows you to save time, paper and money on making payments.  Most credit organizations charge a fee for installing the program and providing electronic keys, but its maintenance is usually included in the total cost of the service package. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Service </h2><p>  An important role is also played by the quality and speed of service.  Before <span>opening a bank account of an</span> LLC or individual entrepreneur, come to the bank branch and talk with the staff to understand if you can cooperate with them.  At this stage, you need to evaluate the entire range of services provided, the lack of bureaucracy and the length of the working day. </p><p>  Settlement and cash servicing of clients is also evaluated by the speed of processing documents.  It is clear that payments are carried out in the general order.  But sometimes there is a need for quick processing of the operation, for example, if the payment is formed at the end of the working day.  In most banks, this problem can be solved with one call to the operators, asking them to quickly complete the transaction.  Others have to apply in advance for quick payment processing. </p><h2>  Location of the credit institution </h2><p>  This is not the most important, but still an essential factor.  The presence of a network of branches is very important if the entrepreneur is not concentrated in one city.  In this case, you can contact any bank branch and quickly withdraw cash from your current account. </p>

    <p>  This also includes the availability and cost of software.  The system "bank - client - online" allows you to make payments anywhere in the world if you have an Internet connection. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Getting a loan </h2><p>  The use of borrowed funds is also best discussed at the initial stage before opening an account.  It is always easier to negotiate with your own bank than to look for other offers in the market.  In turn, a credit institution requires fewer documents from its customers and quickly considers applications. </p><p>  The probability that the proposed conditions do not suit the entrepreneur is very high.  The easiest thing for this LLC.  They are allowed to have several checking accounts.  But the IP will have to look for another bank.  And amicably parting with a financial institution will not work.  For transfer of service to another credit institution, a penalty will be charged. </p><h2>  The situation on the Russian market </h2><p>  Having considered the main factors that you need to pay attention to when concluding a contract for the cash servicing of legal entities, let us turn to the description of service packages on the market.  All the banks considered below were evaluated by the factors described above. </p>

    <h2>  OJSC "Sberbank of Russia" </h2><p>  In order to draw up a contract for cash services for legal entities, it is necessary, in addition to the standard package of documents, to prepare a lease for the premises in which the organization‚Äôs office is located.  Next, you need to wait three days, pay at the cash desk one-time 2 thousand rubles.  for opening an account, and then pay the cost of the selected tariff (2.2-3.1 thousand rubles).  This fee includes the cost of account management services, remote maintenance, electronic payments, all cash transactions and the provision of certificates. </p><p>  As the largest lending institution, Sberbank has a developed network of branches, a wider selection of services that are provided at a low cost.  But customer reviews confirm that the quality of service is poor.  Constant lines at the cash desk, lengthy processing of payments and poor technical support are not in favor of the bank. </p><h2>  Gazprombank OJSC </h2><p>  Notarized copies of constituent documents that are attached to the application for opening current accounts for legal entities are considered for two weeks.  Moreover, the security service may come to the address of the legal registration of legal entities.  This is one of the minuses of a credit institution.  All services are provided not in batches, but separately.  Account maintenance is free.  But for its discovery, you need to pay 2.5 thousand rubles.  A commission of 13 to 100 rubles is charged for one payment. </p>
