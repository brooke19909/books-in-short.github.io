  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Insurance Contribution Reforms: Myths and Realities</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Insurance premiums are a separate headache for the head of almost every company.  If the company is professional <noindex>  <span>accounting services</span> </noindex>  , then, as a rule, there are no problems with the calculation and payment of contributions to funds.  But businessmen who have not yet decided on a service with the involvement of professionals have to independently understand the realities and myths of the same pension system. </p><p>  <em>IMPORTANT!</em>  From 01.01.2017 the control of payments to funds will again be transferred to the shoulders of the tax authorities.  In the recent past, it was.  The employees of the arrears departments in the tax inspectorate monitored the payment of insurance premiums, and in the absence of receipt of funds, were engaged in the recovery of accrued amounts.  A little later, the federal authorities changed the collection system, forcing the funds themselves to collect debts.  And in 2017, everything will return to normal. </p><h2>  "Ideas" of the future and the problems arising from them </h2><p>  The Ministry of Finance wants to introduce a flat rate of 26 percent for insurance premiums.  Moreover, it is proposed in 2017 to establish it at the level of 29%, and in 2018 - at the level of 28%.  That is, we are talking about a gradual reduction in rates.  In companies that provide <noindex>  <span>accounting services</span> </noindex>  , have already calculated that such a solution will not always allow enterprises to save and even add new problems.  For example: </p><ul><li>  firms in which wages are paid in excess of established limits will have to pay foundations more by 3-7 percent; </li><li>  there will be a danger of switching to salary in envelopes, because high wages for employees will go sideways to the employer; </li><li>  will have to equalize the salaries of employees belonging to high and middle class professionals, which will lead to chaos in the labor market. </li></ul><h2>  What will bring the new reform to taxpayers? </h2><p>  The basis of the reform in the field of insurance premiums is the desire of the authorities to reduce the burden on taxpayers.  Now, instead of a bunch of funds, only the Federal Tax Service will control the payment of contributions.  On the one hand, this is good news.  The number of regulatory authorities will drop to one single.  But really it will not be so.  The funds will work as if to help the Federal Tax Service, but at the same time functioning separately.  Accordingly, the number of control bodies will not decrease. </p><p>  In addition, we should expect a tightening of control by the tax authorities.  In connection with the transfer to them of the functions of collecting insurance premiums, even if you wish to submit zero reporting, you will need to use the help of professionals.  Employees of the Federal Tax Service will always be in the role of ‚ÄúCerberus‚Äù, who are always ready to prove that it was not in vain that control functions were transferred to them. </p><p>  Many companies will need to be prepared to be constantly monitored.  You need to know that with the tax authorities a high rate of tax collection is always required.  And in order to fulfill the ‚Äúplan‚Äù to raise money for the budget of the same FIU, it is definitely necessary to wait from the tax authorities for activation unnecessary for businessmen. </p></div></article>
