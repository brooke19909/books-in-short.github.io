  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Grounding and Grounding</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Experienced electricians claim that if grounding conductors are connected in the shield, and sockets and plugs are equipped with grounding contacts, you should not worry about anything.  Protective grounding and grounding is necessary for servicing electrical installations from electric shock when insulation is damaged. </p><p>  It is worth paying attention to the problem of connecting the ground wire to the water supply and heating pipes.  This can not be done in any case!  This can lead to human casualties, and you can safely fall under the article on violation of the rules of electrical safety engineering!  Her punishment will be imprisonment. </p><p>  Many craftsmen practice simulating a grounding circuit.  They connect the "zero" protective and working conductors in the Euro outlet.  This is extremely dangerous!  Often there are cases of burning in the shield "working zero".  At the same time, 220V is formed on the <span>computer</span> or refrigerator <span>case</span> and other devices.  As in the first case, victims cannot be avoided, only with the difference that there is no one to bear responsibility, except for the one who made this connection.  Most often, the owners themselves suffer, saving on the call of a professional electrician. </p><p>  Grounding and grounding are used, as a rule, as one of the options for safety.  On the housing of the distribution panel on each floor there is zero potential, which passes through the shield, has contact with the housing using bolt fastening.  <span>Zero conductors of</span> apartments located on the floor are also connected to the shield body.  Each end is connected to its own bolt, a ‚Äúgrounding‚Äù or ‚Äúgrounding‚Äù conductor is connected here, as you prefer to call it. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Electricity is a great, but quite dangerous force.  Despite the fact that it has been described, calculated for a long time, various tables have been compiled that are striking in their volumes, the regulatory framework that defines sinusoidal electrical signals with a frequency of 50 Hz puts neophytes in awe and panic.  One of the common questions is grounding and grounding.  Conflicting opinions on this topic do not give a clear answer.  <span>How to establish the</span> truth in this difficult and serious matter?  Protective grounding and grounding requires closer and more responsible consideration. </p><p>  Electrical safety in electrical installations is divided into: installations that have above 1 kV in a network with an effectively grounded or insulated neutral.  For the first case, work is provided with high currents, in the second - with small currents and earth faults.  There are also electrical installations up to 1kV in the network.  For them, grounded and isolated neutrals are provided.  Most office and residential buildings in Russia use a grounded version. </p><p>  The principle of operation of the circuit called grounding and grounding. </p><p>  When voltage or phase gets on the metal case connected to zero, a short circuit occurs in the network.  At this moment <span>, the current strength</span> increases to enormous quantities.  This causes an instant response of the devices responsible for safety and protection.  They are fuses, circuit breakers.  They will promptly disconnect the line that supplies the damaged device.  In any case, there is a time limit for the PUE for automatically disconnecting a faulty line. </p><p>  Grounding and grounding is carried out by special conductors provided for such cases.  In single-phase wiring, this may be the third core of a cable or wire.  In order for the protection device to turn off at the stipulated time, the phase-zero resistance in the loop must be small.  In order for grounding and grounding to be effective, very stringent quality requirements are applied to network installation and connections.  In addition to quickly disconnecting the power supply from the damaged line, the neutral is grounded, and in this case, grounding guarantees a low voltage.  When a person touches the body of the appliance, the probability of electric shock is completely excluded.  With <span>grounded neutral, grounding</span> is a specific type of grounding. </p>
