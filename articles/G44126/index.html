    <h2>  The Origin of the Shatsky Lakes </h2><p>  Where did the picturesque reservoirs in Volhynia come from, scientists still cannot determine.  Some believe that Svityaz and its brothers formed after the Dnieper glacier retreated from Polesye.  Lakes are considered relics, that is, the remains of one huge reservoir that used to be in this territory.  Different levels of depth, the presence of depressions is explained by leaching of limestone <span>by groundwater</span> .  Some researchers believe that Lake Svityaz has karst origin.  The third group of scientists argues that ponds in Volyn formed due to the glacier, but deep troughs appeared here due to the lowering and raising of some tectonic blocks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest on the lake svityaz" class="if" height="419" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10530/459123.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Legend of the origin of Svityaz </h2><p>  For many centuries, in Volyn, legends and legends about the formation of Shatsky lakes have been transmitted from generation to generation.  The most interesting of them is the story of the sorcerer.  Once, an old man passed by a meadow on which children grazed cattle.  There was a dog with the shepherds, who immediately attacked her grandfather and began to bark loudly.  For smaller children, the situation seemed funny, so they laughed with might and main, but the older boy and girl tried to drive the dog away from the old man.  As a result, the sorcerer called the younger shepherds with him and led them to a huge boulder.  Without difficulty, he lifted it with a cue, and water poured out, the children immediately drowned.  This is how Lake Svityaz was formed.  The old man led the boy and the older girl with him, but forbade them to look back.  The path was already almost passed, but the children could not stand it and turned around.  At that moment they turned into linden and sycamore.  That is how the legend explains the appearance of a wooded island on the lake. </p><h2>  Unique water Svityaz </h2><p>  It is difficult to find a lake in Ukraine cleaner and more transparent than Shatsk reservoirs.  Many people claim that in Svityaz the tastiest water, even a little harsh.  The lake is so transparent that even at great depths you can see small pebbles.  In winter, water is much cleaner than in summer, this is due to the minimum amount of impurities in it.  Svityaz is especially transparent at depth, but near the coast, in the bays, plant remains are often found, some areas are completely covered with algae.  In shallow water there is marsh vegetation.  Thanks to transparency, sunlight penetrates to a great depth, which contributes to the activation of biological processes in the reservoir. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Svityaz lake map" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10530/459126.jpg" width="600"></div>
