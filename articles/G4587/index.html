Kacha: photos, prices, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  We spend our holidays in different ways.  Some of us want to completely retire, enjoy the moments of silence.  Others love a noisy fun holiday full of entertainment and not letting you sit still.  But the mutual desire to get a lot of pleasure from the holidays unites us: everyone dreams of inhaling clean air filled with iodine, admiring the beautiful seascape. </p><h2>  Arrangement </h2><p>  Having decided to relax away from the hustle and bustle of the city, you can leave the city of Sevastopol.  Kacha is exactly what suits you.  It represents a small resort village, which is located on the southwest coast of the Crimean peninsula. </p>

    <p>  This item was founded on the site of a farm in the early 19th century, but became famous after the Higher Military Aviation School was opened here for pilots.  At first it was a closed zone, but over time, everything changed.  Picturesque green plains and hills became available for visiting tourists.  Thanks to this, the infrastructure began to actively develop, shops with a diverse assortment (products, clothes, souvenirs), small markets along the way to the sea, and supermarkets began to open. </p><p>  Also here at this time, they begin to build comfortable hotel complexes, pensions.  Local residents are ennobling the private sector.  It is here that you will be given a choice of a good combination of prices and living conditions. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Accommodation </h2><p>  When you leave the city of Sevastopol, Kacha will meet you in 23 kilometers.  The village got its name in honor of the river of the same name, which originates in its vicinity and after 4 km flows into the Black Sea.  The number of local residents totals a little more than 5000. It is worth noting that the settlement is located on a hill, and rises almost 20 meters above sea level, so steep clay shores hang over its beaches. </p><p>  The village of Kacha (Sevastopol) is one of the famous holiday destinations.  His beach was also famous, which stretches for 5 kilometers and has a width of 35 meters.  Its structure is sandy, pebbled or mixed.  The central coast is fully equipped for a comfortable stay for visiting tourists.  It is located near the military garrison, and access to the sea runs through the park. </p><p>  There are few noisy entertainments and attractions, so the village can be confidently called a cozy and quiet holiday destination.  Clean sea air, very beautiful landscapes will help to find peace of mind and completely forget about the problems. </p><p>  Having decided to take a longer walk and get acquainted with historical monuments, you can visit the city center.  To do this, use the shuttle taxi of the suburban communication "Kacha - Sevastopol".  The distance to be overcome has already been indicated, and it will take about 20 minutes. And already there you can get a wide variety of missing entertainment. </p>

    <h2>  Spacious beaches </h2><p>  Given the height of the slope on which the village is located, down to the beach you need to go down the stairs, of which there are two.  One of them is more modern, with playgrounds, benches for relaxation and a specially equipped descent for cars.  The other is older and not very comfortable.  You can also use the well-trodden paths of tourists. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The length of the beach allows you to completely retire.  But with all this, you should not forget that steep clay slopes hang over you, in connection with which you must remember safety precautions.  For this reason, it is necessary to settle down where they are strengthened and there are no cracks on their surface that can lead to soil shedding. </p><p>  Also, lovers of extreme relaxation are not bored here.  You can choose from a variety of water activities: riding a catamaran, scooter, parachuting flying over the sea.  You can go diving or enjoy the sea from a height by renting a hang glider. </p>

    <h2>  Holidays by the sea </h2><p>  In recent years, the resort business has developed very well in the village of Kacha (Sevastopol), the photo of which is presented in the article, and the number of people wishing to spend their summer holidays here is growing. </p><p>  Comfortable villas and hotels lined up on the promenade offer a full range of services: cozy rooms, meals, guarded parking, organization of excursions for tourists.  In addition - rental of beach and sports equipment, billiards, pitches for table tennis.  A bar and a first-aid post are also located on site.  For living in such conditions will have to pay about 1,500 rubles per person per day. </p><h2>  Budget vacation </h2><p>  Do not be upset if your financial capabilities do not allow you to relax on a grand scale and stay in a city like Sevastopol.  Kacha is a great option, here you can choose a house that will fully comply with the budget.  In this case, it is worth using the services provided by local residents - these are houses, apartments, mini-hotels in the private sector.  Provided living conditions are not worse than in expensive hotels. </p>

    <p>  Of course, there are small differences: firstly, you will need to cook your own meals (if the possibilities do not allow you to visit the cafe), and secondly, you will have to get to the sea for 7-10 minutes.  You will have to pay for such a vacation from 400 to 700 rubles per day.  The difference in price for such minor differences is significant. </p><p>  Therefore, if your vacation budget is not very large, then you should refuse to travel to the city of Sevastopol.  Kacha will provide you with conditions no worse, and the prices and quality will pleasantly surprise you. </p><h2>  Impressions of vacationers </h2><p>  After reviewing the reviews of vacationers, we can say that they were divided into positive, which are much more, and negative. </p><p>  So, visiting tourists are pleased with the clear sea and endless beaches, a small number of vacationers (which makes it possible to enjoy privacy), very cheap housing, reasonable prices in markets and cafes, friendly locals, beautiful sea landscapes. </p><p>  Fans of noisy fun, plenty of rides should go to Sevastopol.  Kacha is, on the contrary, a quiet and comfortable place for those who want to just relax in a relaxed atmosphere. </p>

    <p>  Among the shortcomings, the lack of entertainment facilities is noted (there is only one nightclub and disco in the village).  Also high clay slopes prone to collapse.  Some are not happy with the long staircase leading to the beach. </p><p>  Finally, I want to say: this resort village is just the perfect place for a relaxing, secluded vacation. </p>
