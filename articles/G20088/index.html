Social and economic development</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Time of Troubles caused irreparable damage to the Russian state.  It took many years to restore the previous level of well-being.  The economic development of Russia in the 17th century began in the 1920s, when the territories of the Volga Region, Southern Siberia, and the Northern Black Sea Region were developed.  The time has come to rewrite history in a new way and re-outline the boundaries of Russian lands.  The culture of Russia in the 17th century slowly changed its priorities - church dogmas were a thing of the past, the values ‚Äã‚Äãof worldly life and man himself became relevant. </p><h2>  Russian politics in the 17th century </h2><p>  The main directions of the state‚Äôs foreign policy will be shown in the table.  Russia in the 17th century for the first time after long years of war and chaos was able to declare itself as a strong and self-sufficient state. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="table Russia in the 17th century" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/690550.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <p>  In a new way, the country's foreign policy relations with other states began to develop.  During the Great Troubles, Russia lost territories in the north and north-west, in the south, constant raids of Crimean khans devastated fertile lands.  The unification of Russian lands, the strengthening of central authority, the restoration of the economy and trade are the main tasks that Russia set for itself in the 17th century. </p><h2>  Social and economic development </h2><p>  The country's economy was formed in difficult conditions of confrontation between archaic feudal serfdom and the class of the nascent bourgeoisie.  The policy of complete enslavement of the peasants formed the basis of the social development of Russia.  <span>The council code of</span> 1649 canceled the "lesson summers", the search for runaway peasants was declared unlimited, which finally deprived the farmers of the few rights that they inherited from their ancestors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The peasants were completely dependent on the lord-feudal lord, cultivated his land with their own equipment and paid him a rent.  It was corv√© that characterized the rural way of life, which forms the basis of the domestic policy pursued by Russia in the 17th century.  Socio-economic development was subject to the laws of absolutism, which was significantly strengthened, especially after the adoption in 1649 of the Council Code. </p><p>  By the age of 20, craft production is reviving in Russia, new manufacturing enterprises are being introduced - manufactories.  The new Trade Charter streamlined the rules of trade relations and stimulated the development of commerce. </p>

    <h2>  Strengthening Tsarist Power </h2><p>  As many as two chapters of the new code of the Russian kingdom legally protect the rights and prestige of the tsarist government in the country.  Gradually, all power is concentrated in the hands of one ruler - the king.  Zemsky Sobors, which had previously resolved crucial political issues, quickly lost their position.  Their privileges and power are now given to the Boyar Duma.  Relative stability in the economy and politics strengthens the autocratic system, even without the support of all segments of the population.  To maintain domestic policy, a centralized state administration apparatus is being formed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Orders </h2><p>  The role of representatives of the tsarist authorities in certain regions was carried out by orders.  By the 17th century, they had already been formed, but in these institutions there was no clear distinction between legislative and executive levers of power.  During the period of turmoil, the activity of orders was invisible and ineffective. </p>

    <p>  Tsar <span>Mikhail Fedorovich</span> instituted several temporary orders - after completing certain tasks, they disbanded.  His heir, Alexei Mikhailovich, had already established standing orders that performed their functions in certain territories - including those that Russia annexed in the 17th century.  The social and economic development of the state was fully supported by church reforms that took place in the middle of the century. </p><h2>  Centralization of the church </h2><p>  The accession of the Belarusian and Ukrainian territories to the lands of the Russian state led to a stream of various interpretations of the teachings of Christian Orthodoxy.  Nikon‚Äôs reform was designed to unite diverse church teachings and recreate a single Orthodox church.  But these transformations caused a serious murmur of the people, and the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe independence of the church authorities from the secular caused the autocracy's discontent.  As a result, the church split, and Nikon was deposed in <span>1666</span> . </p>

    <h2>  Russian culture in the 17th century </h2><p>  The development of printing in the Russian state begins with the publication of the first printed book "The Apostle".  New <span>literary genres</span> arise <span>,</span> and in the second half of the century portrait painting, <span>S. Ushakov,</span> became the ancestor of itself, declared itself <span>.</span> </p><p>  The principles of urban planning and architecture are changing.  A style appears that is characteristic only for Russia - Moscow Baroque, civil and <span>public buildings</span> began to be built of stone. </p><p>  Schools are being developed in which officials of state institutions were trained, and at the end of the century, a Slavic-Greek-Latin school appears - the first higher educational institution that Russia opened in the 17th century. </p><p>  The socio-economic development of the state and the revival of culture in Russia at that time slowly but surely led the country to new reforms and a different political system. </p>
