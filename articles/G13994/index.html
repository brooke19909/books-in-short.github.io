The feeling of relative isolation of the space is created thanks to the dense shrubs that separate the courtyard from the street.  Several trees and lanterns in front of the hotel give it a rural charm and set up future guests for the friendly atmosphere that awaits them here. </p><h2>  Large selection of rooms </h2><p>  Rest in <span>Esperia Hotel 3 * (Kavala, Rhodes)</span> will suit almost every tourist, excluding only those who are lovers of luxury and exquisite comfort.

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The Aegean Sea, next to which the hotel is located, is known for high waves and cool winds.  Therefore, even during periods of hot weather on a sandy and pebble beach, which is a little less than a hundred meters from the hotel, it is not too hot.  Gambling surfers and sailing fans, as well as lovers of colorful sunsets, for which the hospitable Rhodes is famous, traditionally occupy this part of the coast. </p><p>  Vacationers who do not part with the dream of a sea without waves and a quiet pastime on a cozy beach, try to get to the opposite east coast.  There are no colorful sunsets, but there are more opportunities for swimming.  Moreover, the waters of the Mediterranean Sea, washing the picturesque shores of this part of the island, are much warmer than the Aegean.  Moreover, the path on foot here from the hotel does not take much time - no more than 10 minutes. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Tourists coming to Rhodes note its similarity with other Greek medieval cities.  There are no wide avenues or hours of traffic jams.  The venerable age of the resort is felt, first of all, in the central quarters.  It is in one of them that Esperia is located.  Near the hotel you can find well-preserved medieval and more ancient buildings of the city, including the Acropolis.  The hotel is about 19 kilometers from the international airport located on the island. </p>

    <h2>  Esperia Hotel 3 *: hotel reviews </h2><p>  The main advantage of the hotel, according to almost all tourists staying here, is its proximity to two seas - the warm and calm Mediterranean and the cooler Aegean.  Many travelers also note the advantageous location of the hotel next door to a wide variety of drinking establishments, from inexpensive cafes to luxurious restaurants and cozy pizzerias.  It will take no more than 15 minutes for those who want to be in the "possessions" of the old city in order to wander along its medieval streets or admire the remains of once majestic ancient structures. </p><p>  <span>Esperia Hotel 3 * (Rhodes) received positive reviews and for the excellent</span> work of the staff.  Everyone notes the friendliness of the hotel employees, their responsiveness, the desire to help in solving any problems, as well as in the choice of excursions and places of leisure.  Although vacationers often have difficulties with the Internet in the hotel, this is offset by the opportunities offered at a low cost in cafes nearby.  Wi-Fi speed is much faster there.  But not all tourists really need the Internet on vacation days. </p><p>  Some vacationers complain of insufficient sound insulation in hotel rooms.  But there are no serious inconveniences due to this.  All hotel guests note a recent renovation, which is especially noticeable in rooms where new furniture is immediately evident.  As for the tiny pool, few are upset - because there are two seas nearby.  Vacationers always speak well of breakfasts.  Although they do not differ in variety, delicious croissants, as well as the opportunity to visit one of the neighboring cafes - all this compensates for this drawback. </p>
