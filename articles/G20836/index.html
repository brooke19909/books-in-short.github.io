Many of them are located outside the metropolis.  It is worth visiting this settlement only in order to admire the local nature reserves and national zones.  It is enough for any tourist to visit a park zone only once, and he will immediately understand how delicately, carefully and respectfully the local population treats its nature.  After all, all territories are very well-groomed, neat and, most importantly, comfortable and convenient for both four-legged inhabitants and visitors.  Sydney can rightfully be proud of its parks.  We will talk about some of them in our description. </p><h2>  Sydney harbor </h2><p>  Sydney boasts many natural areas.  Sydney Harbor Park is one of those places worth visiting.  Sydney Harbor is located on the coastal space of Sydney Harbor.  Small islands, coastal areas that are flooded by tides, steep peninsulas are almost untouched by people and belong to the category of protected sea and land landscapes. </p>

    <p>  At the end of the century before last, the idea to break up the park ensemble arose, but only in 1965 did active work begin on this issue.  Officially, the <span>Sydney Sydney Harbor</span> National Park opened in early April 1975.  Gradually, the territory of the object expanded, and now it reaches more than four square kilometers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Visitors can become participants in all kinds of excursions and educational programs.  They are given the opportunity to participate in a sailboat regatta or ride a kayak.  Also at their service are walking tours of any difficulty level.  And if you want to study the ancient cave art belonging to the Kadigal tribe, then this will be available to you.  The native conductor will happily become your companion in this exciting entertainment. </p><h2>  Park with a London name </h2><p>  Giant Hyde Park (Sydney) covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã16 hectares.  The name of the object was given in honor of the famous Hyde Park in London.  He became the first park in Sydney, and equipped it in 1810.  The founder of this place was Governor Laclan Macquarie.  Nowadays it is a center of mass recreation.  People come here to chat with friends on a bench, play with children, go for a morning or evening run, or just lie on the green grass and read a good book. </p>

    <p>  It is strictly forbidden to drink alcohol.  This is the most important rule of Hyde Park.  It also has its own attractions, such as the Captain Cook Memorial or the Archibald Fountain with always-playing live music. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The oldest park in the world </h2><p>  The Royal National Park was laid out in 1879.  He is the oldest on Earth.  There is an object near a city like Sydney.  This park was the first protected area to which the phrase "national park" was applied.  Its area exceeds 15 thousand hectares.  Here collected a huge number of different representatives of the animal and plant world.  Among them there are specimens that are under the threat of complete extinction. </p>

    <p>  The territory of the park on the east side is washed by the waters of the <span>Tasman Sea.</span>  In this natural area, you can meet many snakes, lizards and colorful flowers.  The trails of the park are lined with metal or wood.  This is done so as not to harm the vegetation.  Famous to many tourists, the snake head that hangs over the ocean is one of the symbols of the Royal National Park in Sydney. </p><h2>  Large public park </h2><p>  Well, how can do without public parks, such a metropolis as Sydney?  The Centenary Park since the founding of Australia is an incredibly large natural area for people to relax.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe object is 220 hectares.  As early as 1886, the planning of this area began.  But to realize all the plans never succeeded.  For example, the establishment of party congresses and the museum were never erected.  The grand opening of the park took place in 1888. </p>

    <p>  The Federation Monument has become an important attraction of the Centennial Park.  The Grand Drive Road runs through this natural area.  In 2002, she was the stage of the marathon at the Olympics. </p><h2>  In memory of the Olympics </h2><p>  Some Sydney parks are most directly related to the 2000 Olympics.  So, we are talking about the park, which is called the Olympic Park.  It is located in the western part of the village, 16 km from the main business district of the metropolis. </p><p>  The area where the facility is located, began its active development just before the 2000 Olympics.  Here they broke up a whole sports complex that met international standards and requirements.  After the event, the use of this area continued further.  Important business centers have moved here. </p>

    <p>  The main cultural events are regularly organized on the sports ground.  In addition, several exhibition halls are located on the territory of the complex, where exhibitions of contemporary art are often organized. </p><h2>  Botanical Garden for Kings </h2><p>  Sydney Central Park is another place I would like to talk about.  The Royal Botanic Gardens are considered the central park in the city.  It is located in the central part of the metropolis and is one of the most beautiful places in Sydney.  Every day thousands of guests come here and enjoy fabulous, truly royal landscapes. </p><p>  In the garden you can see many exotic representatives of the flora and amazing animals, such as <span>flying foxes</span> or possums.  There are also rare species of butterflies and birds that harmoniously fit into the look of this park.  Paid small train runs for the convenience of visitors. </p>
