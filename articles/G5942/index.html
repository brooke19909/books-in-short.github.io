    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Unfortunately, not only positive, but also a number of negative points are inherent in the Cornelia Deluxe Resort.  Guest reviews say the following: </p><ul><li>  All-inclusive drinks, slightly diluted; </li><li>  sometimes guests are not accommodated in the best rooms, then to offer the best apartments for a fee; </li><li>  sometimes maids forget to fill the minibar; </li><li>  the waiters in the restaurant are rather slow (but their politeness and smile compensate for this drawback); </li><li>  the complete absence of soundproofing in the rooms, which is why noise from neighboring rooms, from the corridor, as well as from the street may interfere with your relaxation; </li><li>  right above the children's corner in the restaurant is air-conditioned; </li><li>  despite the fact that the TVs are equipped with USB ports, you won‚Äôt be able to use them, because there are stubs in them; </li><li>  since smoking is not prohibited on site, you will always smell tobacco everywhere. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  This hotel is ideal for a quiet family holiday, or for living noisy companies.  With the exception of minor flaws, everything is worthy of 5 stars.  Particular attention should be paid to tasty and satisfying nutrition.  And gourmets, and vegetarians, and those who adhere to a diet, and children - all will find something for themselves.  And, of course, one cannot fail to say about animation.  During the day, you will have fun with active entertainment, and in the evenings you will find breathtaking shows.  Having visited this hotel once, you will certainly want to come back here again. </p>
