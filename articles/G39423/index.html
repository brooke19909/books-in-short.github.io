Nokia Lumia 920 phone: description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The launch of the <span>Nokia Lumia</span> 920 smartphone aroused maximum interest among users of the global telephone network.  The device with a case diagonal of 5.8 inches embodied all the relevant innovations, trends and technologies of the modern market.  It is not without reason that the Lumia 920 is not inferior in popularity to the flagships of such brands as Samsung and NTS. </p><h2>  General characteristics </h2><p>  The 920th model is primarily distinguished by its performance.  Qualcomm S4 series chipset with two 1.5 GHz cores is responsible for this property.  Also applies to the pluses of the Lumia 920 is the characteristic of the integrated memory bar.  Its volume is as much as 32 GB.  RAM by standard, as with all new Nokia devices, is 1 GB. </p><p>  The screen size is 4.5 inches.  Increased sensitivity and the presence of a special protective glass in the package are noted.  The camera boasts fast autofocus and optics.  Surprisingly, the Lumia 920 features a video stream.  The owner of the phone will be able to shoot in FullHD format without loss of quality. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lumia 920 feature" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/758590.jpg" width="600"></div>  The smartphone supports more than 20 wireless interfaces in a wide frequency range.  It is worth noting the decent <span>battery capacity</span> and the presence of multilingual software.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  External characteristics </h2><p>  The dimensions of the case are 13 by 7.1 cm. The thickness of the device is slightly more than 10 mm.  Weight varies by type of enclosure and accessories.  Pure - about 185 g. According to the above characteristics, we can conclude that the device is more suitable for men, since it is quite massive and heavy. <br><br>  Of the main design features, it is worth highlighting a convex screen that protrudes slightly above the level of the case.  True, with previous models it was much more striking. <br><br>  The back panel is represented by a matte cover.  This is also one of the advantages, since in the 900th version of the flagship the surface was glossy.  There were stains and fingerprints on it, and in hot or humid weather the device slipped noticeably in the hand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lumia 920 price" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/758591.jpg" width="562"></div>  To the touch, the case is as if made of cheap plastic.  The control buttons (volume, power and camera) are located on the right side.  For many users it is very convenient, especially for lefties.  The headphone jack, as well as the built-in microphone, are located in the upper area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe case.  The downside of the device is the inconvenience of inserting a micro-SIM card.  For this procedure, you need a needle or a thin clip, which is in the base kit.  This innovation of the developers of Nokia is only bewildering. <br><br>  At the bottom of the device is a connector for micro-USB and speakers.  Under the display on the front panel is a proprietary Windows button, which is a company logo.

This is the first model that has moved away from the usual 480 √ó 800. The Lumia 920 screen is quite large and comfortable.  Its diagonal is 11.5 cm (4.5 inches). <br><br>  The front surface of the display is a smooth glass plate.  Its main function is protection against minor scratches.  An anti-glare filter is also built into the screen, which significantly reduces the brightness of projections of reflected objects.  On the outer surface there is a special coating with an oleophobic film to prevent fingerprints from appearing on the display.  Thanks to her, you can quickly remove any stains. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lumia 920 screen" class="if" height="486" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/758592.jpg" width="600"></div>  Manual brightness control allows you to get optimal performance from 62 to 380 cd / sq.  m. As a result, you can read text from the screen without problems both in the daytime and at night.  It is noteworthy that instead of the traditional brightness slider in the 920th model, a banal regulator of three points is built in: maximum, medium and minimum.  But the auto-light adjustment by the sensor works perfectly.  This is the optimal solution for users who can‚Äôt quickly navigate to the appropriate level of brightness in a given environment. <br><br>  The device display is based on the IPS matrix.  Thanks to this technology, it has large display angles without any inversion of the picture and color shift.  It is worth highlighting and high contrast - 665: 1.  In turn, the color gamut is in no way inferior to the famous sRGB technology.  During testing, there was no significant deviation of the black body from the spectrum.  Color balance error at a minimum.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Performance indicators </h2><p>  Pleases with Lumia 920 characteristic frequency processing operations.  The device runs on a Qualcomm S4 processor.  The dual-core chipset has a total frequency of 3 GHz.  This is a major leap forward for Nokia developers.  It is enough to recall that the 900th model of the smartphone in its arsenal had only one core with 1.4 GHz. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lumia 920 firmware" class="if" height="420" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/758593.jpg" width="600"></div>  The S4 processor is based on two platforms - Adreno 225 and Krait.  It is worth noting LTE support and the lack of HDMI and MHL connectivity.  Nevertheless, the smartphone completely copes with the main tasks of performance: the interface does not slow down, FullHD video stream is played without distortion. <br><br>  Unfortunately, under the Windows OS there are still no serious games, however the supported ones go even at the maximum requirements without lags.

    <h2>  operating system </h2><p>  In Lumia 920, the firmware is no different from previous Nokia flagships.  This is the standard "axis" of Windows Phone.  The only advantage of the platform is that the operating system is represented by the new version of Eight.  Nevertheless, in the Lumia 920, Windows P8 does not justify itself yet.  The "axis" can not please anything advanced, if only a couple of new gadgets, utilities and shells.  In addition, software for WP8 is currently extremely difficult to find. <br><br>  Fans of colorful multimedia will notice the changing tiles of the main menu.  Now gadgets can be configured not just in size, but also in shape: from a large rectangle to a miniature square.  In general, the OS interface is affordable and simple.  Owners of the updated WP7 will not see any special differences from the new version. </p>

Now to access the list of programs you need to swipe the screen 1 time to the left.  But it became possible to update the system wirelessly and rewrite files using a regular manager-explorer.

    <h2>  Interface Features </h2><p>  When you turn on the device, the first thing that appears is a lock window, on which notifications about the current weather, time, date and messages on social networks appear.  Desktop tiles have remained informative.  Of the minuses, it is worth noting the fact that not all starting gadgets can be removed from the screen. <br><br>  The search box only works with an Internet connection, as the built-in browser immediately opens.  The Lumia 920 firmware includes a number of standard applications: Microsoft Office, drivers, Internet Explorer, banking utilities, Skype and a couple of banal games.  It is noteworthy that in WP8 the office suite was very weak.  Its functionality is limited to changing the contents of the text and saving the document only in basic formats. <br><br>  When connected to the Internet, only the built-in IE browser works correctly.  There are no complaints about other applications. </p><h2>  Navigation benefits </h2><p>  The developers of Nokia have always paid special attention to location capabilities.  In the 920th model, navigation has reached a new level thanks to the WP8 platform.  Now the user can download maps of any city directly via Wi-Fi.  Communication with the application is carried out by voice.  The navigator automatically announces the details of the selected route and analyzes the current movement along the tracks, helping to bypass traffic jams.  It is noteworthy that after the implementation of the search, the application can work offline. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone lumia 920" class="if" height="379" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/758595.jpg" width="600"></div>  Lumia 920 maps contain information not only about traffic, but also about the location of objects, metro stops, tram routes, trolley buses, etc. The image can be displayed in 2D, 3D and from a satellite on a small scale. <br><br>  It is important that the list of available maps includes Russian cities.

    <h2>  Camera specifications </h2><p>  When developing the optical part of the device, Nokia engineers decided to return to the standard of past years.  Despite the fact that the camera was created based on PureView technology, the resolution does not exceed 8.7 megapixels.  This is strange, because in the <span>Nokia 808</span> using the same technique, optics had 41 MP in its arsenal. <br><br>  The only thing that pleases the Lumia 920 is the characteristic <span>of the light sensor.</span>  Photos are obtained in perfect quality even in foggy weather at night.  When developing the camera, a BSI matrix was used, which not only suppresses noise, but also has an increased reverse photosensitivity.  An integrated <span>image stabilizer</span> and color saturation are also highlighted. </p><h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  The Lumia 920 is a non-removable Li-Ion battery.  The capacity is about 2000 mAh. <br><br>  With an average load on performance, the device‚Äôs operating time varies within 2 days.  In this case, the brightness should be in automatic mode.  It is worth noting that Wi-Fi and text managers do not drain the battery much, as in many other smartphones. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lumia 920 battery" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/758596.jpg" width="525"></div>  In passive mode, the battery can hold a charge of up to 3 days.  With a high load on multimedia, the battery lasts 12-14 hours.  Interestingly, in the settings there is an option to save power, disabling multitasking mode and extra utilities Lumia 920.

    <h2>  Smartphone Reviews </h2><p>  One of the main advantages of the device is the quality of photography and convenient integration of accounts.  In the new model, Zune is not required for synchronization with a PC.  File transfer is via a USB cable.  Also, you do not need to pre-convert video materials.  At a high level remained and navigation, which is thought out to the smallest detail. <br><br>  One of the main disadvantages of the Lumia 920 is the price.  This component makes the smartphone not as popular in Russia as the flagships of other brands with similar characteristics.  For the new Lumia 920, the price ranges from 25,000 rubles.  A used smartphone can be purchased 2 times cheaper. </p>
