    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  So what is banking?  This is a banking management system implemented outside offices.  That is, every citizen has every right to take advantage of the offers of a financial corporation without a personal visit. </p><p>  Most often, banking is available to those who are already a client of the organization.  For individuals, this is perhaps the best option for managing services.  It helps not only provide convenience to customers and employees, but also serves as a security system for operations.  Now, this option of providing services in the implementation of any action forces customers to undergo a series of measures to identify the person.  Only after that it will be possible to successfully use the system functionality. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Types </h2><p>  Banking is a remote banking service.  We can say a kind of new word in the provision of certain services.  Customers like this solution.  They can independently study the company's proposals, in case of any difficulties, seek help from employees of a financial organization, as well as bring any proposed function to life at any time without outside help.  Banking can be different.  Currently found: </p><ul><li>  web banking (via computer); </li><li>  mobile service; </li><li>  ATM banking </li><li>  SMS banking; </li><li>  PC banking. </li></ul><p>  All of these methods are very interesting.  And you can master them without any problems.  As practice shows, banking by a financial institution is provided to customers in all the types listed above.  Each person chooses how to receive remote services. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="remote banking" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1352797.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Functions </h2><p>  Of course, banking has certain functions.  Indeed, not all operations can be implemented remotely.  Therefore, it is customary to highlight some purpose of such a management system.  Now you can often get the following services: </p><ul><li>  opening / closing deposits; </li><li>  receipt of bank statements on accounts; </li><li>  taking a loan / loan; </li><li>  receiving information about services; </li><li>  registration of deposits; </li><li>  production of bank cards (credit, debit); </li><li>  making internal transfers between accounts; </li><li>  money transfers between other banks; </li><li>  money conversion. </li></ul><p>  But that is not all.  Internet banking for individuals (and other remote services) is useful in that it allows you to pay for purchases, mobile communications and utilities.  The main thing is to know exactly how this is done.  Usually there is nothing difficult about this.  Simply select the appropriate function among all the proposed operations. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  "Bank-Client" </h2><p>  In general, there are many remote banking systems.  The "Bank-Client" option is very popular.  In order to bring the idea to life, you must have a computer and the Internet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="VTB 24 Bank Client" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1352800.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Special software is installed on the client’s PC.  It stores all the information about the services and the state of the person’s account.  You can connect to the bank via the Internet at any time.  The service helps to quickly receive information and services.  Allows you to make payments and issue statements. </p><p>  There is also an Internet Client system.  In this case, no applications are required.  Instead, it’s enough to use a browser, as well as a special site for a financial company that manages operations.  A very convenient and modern approach to obtaining certain services. </p><h2>  Phone Client </h2><p>  <span>Remote banking services</span> can occur through the Phone-Client system.  As it’s not hard to guess, your mobile will come in handy here.  A special application is installed on it, which helps the activation of certain services. </p><p>  SMS banking is also included in the Phone-Client system.  Most often, this solution is primarily used to obtain information about services, as well as for money transfers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="web banking" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1352799.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It should be noted right away that each financial institution has its own applications.  Therefore, if you are a client of several banks, try to use telephone remote control of services from only one company, the one that seems most successful to you.  The rest is more suitable for web banking.  And in general, the latter is in greatest demand among the population. </p><h2>  Before use </h2><p>  Banking is a self-service system.  And it is in great demand among the population.  You can, as already mentioned, receive almost any service yourself and without a personal visit to the bank’s office.  It is enough to know how to translate the idea into reality. </p><p>  Please note that before using the bank’s services remotely, you must first obtain a “Banking Client”.  For this you need to register in the system.  Each bank has its own.  And the fact that you are a client of a financial organization does not mean that you are already registered.  Usually you must first declare your desire to use banking.  Employees of your financial institution will give you a login and password to enter, as well as tell you where to get the software to install the appropriate application.  For example, at VTB 24 Bank-Client can be downloaded free of charge in various stores and on simple (preferably pre-checked) sites.  In the same way as with most financial institutions in Russia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Internet banking for individuals" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1352798.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  ATM banking </h2><p>  Pay attention to the <span>ATM banking system.</span>  <span>This is</span> not a very common, but nevertheless existing in practice, scenario.  In this case, remote banking services will fully flow through an ATM or payment terminal. </p><p>  As you might guess, you will need either bank plastic or just cash.  You can carry out operations with the account, pay for services and <span>utility bills,</span> replenish the balance of your mobile phone.  A distinctive feature of the ATM system is that citizens have the opportunity to withdraw cash from plastic.  It is this function that ATMs are famous for. </p><p>  As practice shows, for other operations, either web or mobile banking is used.  And no matter what kind of financial institution.  It is worth getting to know these systems as close as possible.  Consider them with the example of Sberbank.  However, VTB 24 Bank-Client has a similar interface.  But only customers to a greater extent prefer Sberbank.  His banking is most often brought to life in Russia. </p><h2>  "Mobile Bank" </h2><p>  With the mobile option, everything is extremely simple and clear - the client must download and install an application called "Mobile Bank" on the gadget.  It is he who helps to remotely manage accounts and receive company services without a personal visit to the organization.  But this is not enough.  However, as for the use of Internet banking, it is necessary, as already mentioned, to undergo special registration. </p><p>  To <span>connect the "Mobile Bank" it is</span> preferable to use ATMs.  Go to this machine, go to the main menu.  Find "Mobile Bank" there.  Next, select the "Connect" function and follow the instructions.  Usually you need to provide personal information and your phone number.  After confirming the operation (SMS with a code will come to the cell phone) and download the application.  Without software, only SMS banking will work.  But in the presence of a "Mobile <span>Bank" operations</span> can be carried out without SMS commands. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="internet banking bank" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1352796.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Internet banking </h2><p>  As already mentioned, telephone remote control is good.  But it is not as popular as Internet banking.  The Bank (any) offers all its customers to pass a simple registration on a special website for remote control of services.  After that, you can receive information on accounts and make payments and transfers without visiting the office. </p><p>  Considering Internet banking using the example of Sberbank, it is worth noting that registration is not always necessary to use the Sberbank Online service.  In some cases (if desired) you can avoid this process.  To do this, get a check with one-time logins and passwords.  This is done using ATMs.  To do this, select the menu item in the car called “Connect Mobile Bank” or “Sberbank Online.” Then click on “Get a one-time password.” You will be given a check on which there will be data for authorization. </p><p>  Permanent login and password can be obtained by going through a simple registration in the system.  It is advisable to ask for help from Sberbank employees.  Banking is currently connected to everyone when receiving bank plastic.  If you have refused this service, ask your employees to help you.  Through ATMs, you can also register in the Sberbank Online system.  The process is similar to receiving a one-time password.  Only now you need to select "Connect the service."  On the issued check there will be no longer temporary data, but permanent. </p><h2>  Security </h2><p>  Internet banking for individuals is available at any time.  To do this, just log in to a special site that helps you manage your finances.  In the case of Sberbank, you need to contact the Sberbank Online service. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank Banking" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1352794.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Go to the banking site, on the left side of the screen, enter the identification number (login) and password.  Now you need to confirm the entry.  This is done using a mobile device - you receive a special verification code that is entered in the appropriate field on the screen.  This is such a security system.  This ensures that you are the true owner of the account.  People’s banking constantly uses a similar data security system.  That's all, you can use the services.  As for Sberbank, just go to the "Payments and Transfers" section.  Here you can pay bills, as well as make a money transfer.  Similarly, banking is managed by other banking companies. </p>
