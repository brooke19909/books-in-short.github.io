For a small surcharge, it is possible to purchase a full board. </li><li>  Good soundproofing, extraneous noise does not interfere, despite the fact that the hotel is located on the waterfront. </li><li>  Very polite and helpful staff, service at a European level. </li></ul><p>  And the cons of the hotel, which guests noted: </p><ul><li>  Too little time is allotted for breakfast - just an hour. </li><li>  Some rooms have a small bathroom. </li><li>  Little fun for the kids. </li></ul><p>  So, if you are looking for a hotel by the sea with delicious cuisine and decent service, but without any frills, Alexandria will gladly open its doors for you.
