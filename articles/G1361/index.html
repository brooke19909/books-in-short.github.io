Reviews will help you choose the best time.  So for those who do not like many hours of excursions and prefer walking to the sights located near the hotel, it is worth arriving in the country in spring or early autumn.  At this time in Armenia, the weather favors leisurely hikes.  No extreme temperature changes and sweltering heat. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In spring, nature comes to life.  Many tourists are attracted by flowering exotic fruit trees and flowers.  In the autumn, it becomes possible to taste a variety of fruits and take stunning photographs against the backdrop of mountains flooded with sunlight. </p><h2>  Traveling in Armenia independently: routes </h2><p>  For tourists who decide to visit the country on their own, it is recommended to choose combined routes, so that in one trip: </p><ul><li>  get acquainted with the life and customs of the Armenian people; </li><li>  visit a variety of historical and cultural monuments; </li><li>  walk along the streets; </li><li>  rent a bike and ride along forest paths. </li></ul><p>  You can take food supplies with you and arrange a camp dinner in the evening on the banks of the river.  Reviews of many tourists show that the starry sky against the backdrop of the mountains is simply mesmerizing.  But for such sorties it is necessary to choose the summer period or September, October. </p><div class="photo" data-original="armedia.am" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Armenia Attractions" class="if uuid-3212352" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46966/3212352.jpg"></div><h2>  Winter holidays </h2><p>  In winter, travel routes in Armenia necessarily include visits to the mountains.  Even if a tourist is not keen on extreme sports, he just needs to get to Tsaghkadzor at an altitude of 1,800 meters above sea level.  Here is the main sports attraction of the times of the USSR.  On its territory, training was held for all members of the national teams of the Soviet Union.  Today, Tsaghkadzor has turned into a unique corner that provides all the conditions for winter sports and just a relaxing holiday amid snow-capped peaks. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For comfortable movement, skiers are offered chairlifts that can lift them to the very top.  After exciting day adventures, you can relax in various pensions and hotels.  Moreover, rooms are offered for people with any income and preferences. </p><div class="photo" data-original="streettrotter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Winter holidays in Armenia" class="if uuid-3212356" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46966/3212356.jpg"></div><h2>  Features of the Armenian mentality </h2><p>  Stories about traveling to Armenia often begin with stories about the hospitality and hospitality of local residents.  The people of a mountainous country is its calling card.  Any native resident considers the guest of his home a messenger of God.  Traveling in Armenia on your own, you do not have to worry about possible problems.  Knocking at any home, the tourist will be provided with shelter and delicious food.  Even if the traveler offers money in return, the owners politely refuse. </p><h2>  General facts about the country </h2><p>  Armenia is a country with a rich history, beautiful nature and unique architectural monuments.  Experienced tourists strongly recommend independent travel because they will never offend a visitor.  Armenia has long adopted Christianity, so not many churches, monasteries and other religious buildings are located on its lands. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There are cities from the date of foundation of which more than 3,000 years have passed.  It is here that you can meet in unprecedented numbers large and strong fortresses, beautiful castles, striking in their architecture. </p><h2>  What is the best way to travel? </h2><p>  If you plan to travel to Armenia by train or car, Georgia will be on its way.  The route is considered the most suitable, but many, especially residents of the capital, prefer to travel by plane. </p><p>  Direct flights regularly depart from Moscow, the final point of which is the capital of Armenia, Yerevan.  A trip can be made spontaneously, because flights are carried out almost every day and at any time. </p><p>  If the tourist prefers the train, then you should consider that you will have to travel with transfers to make a trip to Armenia.  Georgia will be on this path, so those who wish can make two rounds in one. </p><p>  For those who wish to travel by car, one should remember that the distance from Moscow to Yerevan is just over 2,000 km.  Be sure to have with you identity documents and papers on the machine. </p><h2>  What to visit? </h2><p>  Traveling in Armenia involves visiting a wide variety of places.  Here for the tourist it is proposed: </p><ul><li>  delicious cuisine; </li><li>  wonderful climate; </li><li>  the mountains; </li><li>  ancient civilizations; </li><li>  monasteries. </li></ul><p>  First of all, you need to visit the capital of the Yerevan region.  Here in large numbers you can see the monuments left over from ancient times.  Also nearby is Urartu - the city, which is the capital of Armenia in ancient times. </p><p>  Further it is recommended to visit Dilijan.  A large number of sanatoriums and monasteries are located in the mountains.  For those who wish to heal, they offer bathing in thermal springs. </p><p>  Of course, a trip to Armenia involves not only admiring the ruins and ancient sights.  The country is curious in that it is one of the first where the people adopted Christianity.  It is recommended to visit the temple complex of Etchmiadzin.  It is he who confirms the acceptance of faith, because the Christian building dates from the very beginning of our era. </p><h2>  The origins of winemaking </h2><p>  Armenia is also famous for its winemaking successes.  An independent trip involves a mandatory tasting of local wines.  Even the ancient inhabitants of the country considered this drink a blessing of the gods.  They especially revered the place where the grapes grow - the valley of Ararat.  The area is recommended for visiting, as here you can taste real Armenian wines. </p><p>  The valley is a flat area where the Araks River flows.  On the other side of the coast is Turkey.  The Ararat Valley is also notable for the fact that here a tourist can see a beautiful natural phenomenon - sunshine. </p><h2>  Tips for motorists </h2><p>  Traveling to Armenia by car from Russia is easy to complete if you plan a route in advance.  It is useful for any traveler who wants to travel by car from our country to cross the Georgian border.  Judging by the reviews of drivers, customs officers work around the clock, which is an undoubted advantage.  It is worth preparing all the necessary documents for the car in order to speed up the process of checking them and, accordingly, driving directions. </p><p>  It is better to refuel at the exit from Vladikavkaz, because usually there is a large line at the border that is moving slowly. </p><p>  It is also necessary to devote more time to a trip around Armenia itself, because, judging by the reviews of the drivers, the roads are in poor condition.  The section from the border with Georgia to Yerevan is especially bad. </p><p>  Quite a lot of people want to visit Armenia.  Traveling by car imposes the fulfillment of road requirements.  Drivers should know that the vehicle will not be released from the inspection point if a fee is not paid for its entry into the country. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hellojetlag.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Traveling in Armenia by car" class="if uuid-3212358" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46966/3212358.jpg"></div><h2>  Tasty travel in Armenia </h2><p>  Armenia is able to surprise the most demanding gourmet.  One of the attractions is considered national cuisine for a reason.  Coming to any restaurant or small cafe, the traveler will be able to appreciate the taste of a variety of vegetables, meat, flavored with lots of herbs, cheeses.  An obligatory dish is pita bread. </p><p>  Also in the menu there will be such names as: </p><ul><li>  cheese made; </li><li>  sour milk matsun; </li><li>  salads with beans and herbs; </li><li>  a variety of salty snacks; </li><li>  pilaf; </li><li>  barbecue. </li></ul><p>  Of course, this is only a small part of the delicious dishes that cooks in cafes or welcoming homeowners will offer their guests. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hellojetlag.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tasty travel in Armenia" class="if uuid-3212359" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46966/3212359.jpg"></div><h2>  Accommodations </h2><p>  Even traveling in Armenia by car, one of the most pressing issues for any tourist is accommodation.  In major cities of the country are a variety of hotels.  You can also stay in a sanatorium if treatment is required. </p><p>  Of course, the most comfortable hotels are in Yerevan.  It offers not only comfortable rooms and meals, but also: </p><ul><li>  pool; </li><li>  solarium; </li><li>  winter garden for relaxation. </li></ul><p>  However, it should be remembered that the construction of new hotels is unacceptable luxury for the country.  Usually the service corresponds to the category of two, less often three stars, despite the fact that the hotel is assigned five. </p><h2>  Vehicle selection </h2><p>  Traveling in Armenia without a car involves the use of transport.  For movement inside the country, the main view is buses.  Their routes connect large cities.  But you must remember that a clear schedule of departure from destination, movement and arrival usually does not exist.  Basically, buses start moving as the passenger compartment is full. </p><p>  As a rule, you can always rent a car.  But this is recommended only for experienced drivers, because the roads are extremely worn.  If you plan to travel to the mountains, then there is only a country trail. </p><p>  When driving, you should be extremely careful.  Locals usually do not follow road markings and prefer to move around without using a signal. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Arriving in Armenia, it is possible to enjoy a beach holiday near Lake Sevan.  There is also a National Park and mountains. </p><p>  In addition to direct swimming in the water, tourists are offered to try their hand at catching zander, trout and barbel.  To do this, you need to purchase a license, which is offered by local companies that organize such tours. </p><p>  Arzni, Vanadzor and Ankavana, mineral spas, where small beaches are also located, are considered obligatory travel points in Armenia. </p><h2>  Major Attractions </h2><p>  Usually, tourists start exploring Armenia from its capital.  Mashtots Avenue, Republic Square and various museums are of interest to travelers here.  The city is easy enough to navigate.  If you are interested in historical places, it is worth visiting the Matenadaran fortress built in the 16th century.  It is a structure where manuscripts of ancient inhabitants are stored. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.india.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Traveling in Armenia" class="if uuid-3212346" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46966/3212346.jpg"></div><h2>  Further travel </h2><p>  When traveling in Armenia, you should not limit yourself to visiting modern cities.  It is recommended to go to Armavir, which is located on the left coast of the Araks River.  Initially, the town was a small fortress, which over time was transformed into a large settlement. </p><p>  Armenian Carthage is called Artashat.  This is due to the fact that the number of antiquities exceeds the number located even in Yerevan. </p><h2>  What else to see </h2><p>  It is recommended to include the city of Goris in a trip to Armenia.  It is located on the eastern edge of the country and, according to official figures, arose even before our era.  Historians claim that until the 20th century, local residents lived in caves, which were natural structures.  Of course, now such a need has disappeared and the village is gradually acquiring a civilized shape. </p><p>  In addition to the old part of the city that originally existed, a new one has now been added.  Inspection of her deserves interest.  After all, all architecture was designed by foreign experts, and local architects embodied their ideas, but observing their own construction technologies. </p><p>  In the past, due to its special proximity to Nagorno-Karabakh, the city was often bombarded.  But most of the old buildings have survived, which indicates their special strength. </p><p>  Of course, the situation in the city is peaceful.  Damaged buildings that suffered from shelling were restored, some were replaced with new ones.  Many tourists flock here for homemade pastries, which, judging by the reviews, are incredibly tasty.  Also, local residents are famous for the production of cheese and wine. </p><p>  Recently, a workshop specializing in the production of crocheted toys and a variety of household products has opened in the city.  Thanks to the active development of winemaking and restaurant business, the tourism industry is booming. </p><p>  Of course, Goris cannot be compared with Yerevan in the number of attractions located in the center.  Here, as in Vanadzor, it is necessary to study the outskirts.  Cave city, Stone Forest and Karahunj deserve interest. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.smithsonianmag.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cave city in Armenia" class="if uuid-3212360" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46966/3212360.jpg"></div><h2>  Youth vacation </h2><p>  For those who want to actively relax, Armenia provides many opportunities.  After sunset in Yerevan, life literally boils, illuminated by multi-colored lights.  On the old streets there is also a lot of entertainment, but only in the summer. </p><p>  Most active tourists and locals prefer to spend time on Revolution Square.  There are various cafes where you can enjoy a cup of delicious coffee or spiced wine.  Singing fountains, illuminating with colorful lights all around, add a festive mood.  They are turned on at 9 pm, so tourists take the most advantageous places in nearby cafes in advance and simply enjoy the enchanting atmosphere. </p><p>  Young people will not be bored in Yerevan and other large cities of Armenia.  There are many trendy cafes, clubs and wine bars.  Almost all of them are located in the center.  There you can listen to the music of local artists, as well as dance to the incendiary tracks of DJs.  It is noteworthy that, as a rule, entrance to such institutions is absolutely free for everyone. </p><h2>  The subtleties of staying in Armenia </h2><p>  Recently, the tourism business in the country is actively developing.  For a comfortable stay the traveler is offered ample opportunities.  There are many restaurants and small cafes in which services are provided both day and night. </p><p>  However, hotels and hotels almost all retained the Soviet way of service and identity.  Their owners, adhering to the national mentality, do not want to meet accepted standards.  Therefore, in the reviews of tourists you can often hear about incredibly tasty and satisfying dinners, but in the complete absence of the possibility of access to the Internet. </p><h2>  What to buy in Armenia? </h2><p>  Traveling independently in the country, you need to visit a variety of specialized stores.  Of course, if a tourist arrived by train, then such a peculiar symbol of Armenia as a carpet is difficult to take out.  But it’s worth buying at least a small rug, made by hand, characterized by the presence of national symbols and special color. </p><p>  As a souvenir for yourself or friends it is recommended to purchase cognac.  You can not doubt its quality.  Any store offers unique drinks.  A bronze figurine, a copper Turk or a doll amulet will help to complement the gift. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Traveling in Armenia contributes not only to a wonderful vacation, but also to recovery.  In addition to sightseeing and enjoying national cuisine, you can significantly strengthen your body when visiting thermal springs. </p>
