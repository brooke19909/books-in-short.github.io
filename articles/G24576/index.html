  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The history of advertising in Russia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Advertising in the world appeared almost simultaneously with the advent of trade, which was one of the first signs of a civilized society.  The most ancient example of advertising that has come down to our time is considered to be a fragment of the ancient Egyptian papyrus, on which a favorable offer for the sale of slaves is written.  With papyrus ads, the story of the appearance of advertising begins.  In ancient Rome and ancient Greece, advertisements were used that were engraved on copper and bone tablets or written on wooden planks. </p><p>  The history of advertising in Russia begins from the X-XI centuries.  At this time, Russian merchants began to use various methods in order to better sell their goods.  In those days, the commercial estate considered it normal to significantly embellish the qualities of the goods sold, deliberately misleading buyers.  The most common method was hiring barkers, who walked along the streets along the shops and loudly praised the shops and goods sold in them. </p><p>  The unsurpassed representatives of bright oral advertising of those years were the peddlers, who even got into folklore.  The peddlers performed ditties, nursery rhymes, jokes, which in a fun and understandable way advertised their small goods (lace, ribbons, scarves, combs, whistles, candy, bagels, gingerbread) and quickly sold them out.  The history of advertising in Russia also marks an invaluable contribution to the development of popular prints.  They were first mentioned in the XVII century, when the <span>royal chambers</span> were decorated with such amusing plates <span>.</span>  Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich liked to consider these pictures. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Over time, inscriptions began to appear on the pictures that simply and clearly introduced various information or events.  All this was framed very colorful and colorful.  Soon luboks could already be found not only in the royal chambers, but also in many houses.  In the distribution of popular prints, advertising information was also firmly established.  When the trade in foreign goods began to gain strength in Russia, new-fashioned foreign goods began to be advertised in the pubs. </p><p>  Already at the beginning of the 18th century, print ads began to appear in the Vedomosti published even under Peter the Great.  The history of advertising in Russia received an additional impetus when already in the 19th century the widespread dissemination of advertisements began in the press.  At the same time, in many Russian cities began to establish round pedestals on which advertising sheets were glued.  The same sheets were glued on trams and skates.  Right at the entrance of shops and other institutions, it was possible to get advertising price lists and calendars from the hands of smart boys.  The development of medicine at this time also led to the need for a wide public acquaintance with the possibilities of new patented drugs. </p><p>  The history of the development of advertising in Russia has taken a big step after the advent of new methods and forms of advertising led to the emergence of specialized advertising agencies, offices and bureaus.  Radically, the history of advertising in Russia turned after the October <span>Revolution of 1917</span> .  Advertising was completely monopolized by the state with the <span>first decrees of the Soviet government.</span>  It was forbidden to use advertising to sell goods, it received a purely political significance. </p><p>  The return of advertising to its destination occurred only during the NEP.  A striking example of advertising figures of that period can be considered V.V. Mayakovsky, who gave a lot of his talent to this business.  Its bright and catchy expressions invariably attracted the attention of buyers to a particular product.  However, Soviet society gradually adapted the unique possibilities of advertising to the requirements of the existing system in the country.  After the introduction of a market economy in the country and the collapse of socialist forms of management, advertising in Russia began to correspond to its true purpose - to familiarize a wide range of consumers with the important qualities of goods or services. </p>
