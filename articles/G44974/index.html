    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  Even despite the small size that Uruguay occupies on the world map, it is considered one of the cleanest, quietest and, very importantly, safe countries of the continent. </p><p>  The capital of the state is Montevideo.  Before the era of Spanish colonization, only Charroi Indians lived here.  Their peaceful life ended when the Europeans arrived here.  And although the Spaniards did not wield a sword here, as was the case in Central America, nevertheless they completely changed the way of Aboriginal people.  For example, they brought horses that no one saw here.  Soon, the whole continent learned about Uruguayan horses. </p><p>  A dispute began over this territory between Argentina and Brazil.  And only in 1828, between the two countries, a mutual rejection of claims to Uruguayan lands was signed.  It was at this time that the creation of an independent state was proclaimed.  The basis of the Uruguayan people today is not the Charroi Indians whom the conquistadors exterminated, but the Creoles - the descendants of the colonists.  In the second half of the nineteenth century, a flood of immigrants from Europe poured here.  These were Italians, Germans, French, Spaniards, Slavs.  Today, Uruguay is considered the most Europeanized country in Latin America. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

Along its eastern coast stretches a strip of sandy beaches and the marvelous beauty of the lagoons. </p><p>  In general, the natural conditions of this country are fairly uniform.  The climate of Uruguay is mild, warm, moderately humid.  On the plains prevailing everywhere, chernozem-like soil prevails.  This favors the cultivation of cereals and subtropical fruit crops. </p><p>  The fauna of Uruguay is also amazing.  Hundreds of mammals live here, among which there are species of fox, deer, etc. Flora of the country is the national pride of local residents.  There is a huge number of forests, incredibly beautiful beaches, lagoons, dunes and other beautiful natural landscapes.  Uruguay today is a member of the National System of Specially Protected Natural Areas - SNAP. </p><p>  The best time to visit this Latin American country is from January to April.

The most famous of them are Punta Colorada and Punta del Este.  The latter consists of a series of white beaches, hotels and hotels.  And although its population is only ten thousand people, Punta del Este annually receives about half a million tourists. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Outdoor enthusiasts will love cities like Carmelo or Mercedes.  Tourists are attracted here by sea fishing, yachting and surfing.  Those who prefer urban tourism should go to the Colonia del Sacramento.

The second largest settlement in Uruguay is Salto with a population of just over one hundred thousand people.  He gained the fame of local Ibiza thanks to the vibrant nightlife. </p><p>  Traveling in Uruguay, many visit the small town of Tacuarembo.  There are a lot of statues, sculptures and monuments.

    <h2>  Uruguayan architecture </h2><p>  There are not so many masterpieces of architecture in this country, as, for example, in Brazil or Argentina.  Nevertheless, travelers can see many architectural monuments.  The first buildings in the style of classicism in the country appeared after the founding of the fortress of Montevideo. </p><p>  The city of Punta del Este is famous for its colonial architecture.  Here, historical buildings are adjacent to fashionable modern hotels and chic villas, which are also considered attractions.  One of the most interesting architectural objects of this city is the unique Casapueblo - a complex that can be called a real work of art.  This magnificent building is located on the shore of the bay and is considered one of the symbols of the country.  The construction project was developed by the Uruguayan painter and sculptor Carlos Paes Vilaro.  The construction of Casapueblo lasted thirty-six years. </p><h2>  Capital </h2><p>  The main city of Uruguay - Montevideo dates back to 1726.  It was at this time that the Spaniards founded the fortress of the same name here.  The old part of the city is a massive building.  Here are such famous attractions of Uruguay as a fortress, a cathedral, a theater, a parliament building, the New Town Hall.  The developed infrastructure of the suburb of Montevideo contributes to beach and resort recreation. </p>

    <p>  In the capital is the official residence of the head of the country.  It is located on Independence Square.  The construction of the residence with the original name "Executive Tower" was started back in 1965.  However, turbulent events in the country prevented it from being completed on time.  And only in 2009, the president moved to this building, which is a real monument of modern architecture. </p><p>  Montevideo has the main attractions of Uruguay.  In the historical district of the capital, tourists can visit the Church of the Immaculate Conception of Mary and Saints James and Philip.  Guests of the city are better known as the Cathedral.  Montevideo annually receives about six hundred thousand tourists.  And in the list of attractions of almost all sightseeing tours, this temple occupies a major position.  The foundation of the cathedral was laid back in 1790.  Performed in a neoclassical style, it is currently considered a national monument of Uruguay. </p><h2>  Fairytale city </h2><p>  Montevideo impresses with a bizarre mix of different architectural styles.  It is here that many of the most amazing sights of Uruguay are located, for example, wonderful gardens and parks of Prado and Rodo.  It operates the National Museum of Fine Arts.  Tourists can see here more than six thousand works of Uruguayan and foreign artists.  The museum displays paintings by Pablo Picasso, Serrano and others. The exhibition includes both classical works and contemporary art. </p>
