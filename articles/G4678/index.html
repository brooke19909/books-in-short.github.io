In fact, everything is much simpler than it seems.  Sberbank offers its customers several options for the development of events.  The application of the established form is drawn up in a variety of ways.  All have their own characteristics and nuances.  So what should you look for first?  Almost every citizen has the right to implement ideas without any particular problems. </p><h2>  Who is eligible </h2><p>  Not everyone is able to leave a request at Sberbank for a loan.  There are some limitations to this.  Which ones?  Every potential client should know about them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="leave a request in a savings bank for a loan" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1454668.jpg"></div>

    <p>  First, loans to Sberbank are not issued to pensioners.  More precisely, if a citizen does not have official employment and receives only pension payments. </p><p>  Secondly, only an adult can draw up an application with the expectation of approval.  And he must either have a permanent source of income, or official employment.  As practice shows, the unemployed do not receive approval of the request in the specified organization. </p><p>  Accordingly, the requirements in order to be able to leave an application with Sberbank for a loan, as well as receive it, are as follows: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  adulthood; </li><li>  stable income; </li><li>  lack of criminal record; </li><li>  citizenship of the Russian Federation (not required, but citizens of the country are most often clients of the organization); </li><li>  full legal capacity. </li></ul><p>  Only in this situation can we hope for success.  Otherwise, even sending a request to the bank is not recommended.  What's next? </p><h2>  Application Methods </h2><p>  At the moment, as already mentioned, several options for the development of events are offered to all customers of Sberbank.  The thing is that if a person wants to get a consumer loan, then he must collect a certain package of documents, and then provide them to one or another financial organization. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to apply for a loan at Sberbank" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1454670.jpg"></div>
