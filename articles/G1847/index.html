    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  As we already mentioned, The Royal Paradise Hotel Spa (Thailand, Phuket) is located in the Patong Beach area.  The beach is sometimes called “Little Pattaya”.  By the way, it is the most popular and largest on the island.  Near it there are numerous four- and three-star hotels, <span>bars, restaurants,</span> massage parlors, night clubs and even guesthouses.  Patong is considered the Asian center of night parties.  All entertainment is concentrated on the famous Bangla Road. </p><p>  Patong beach is very large, but at the same time very crowded, funny and noisy.  Finding solitude or a quiet relaxing holiday on it is simply unrealistic.  In fairness, it is worth noting that Patong is known for its developed sex industry.  But this does not mean that only those who are interested in such services have a rest here.  There are always a lot of noisy and cheerful youth who travel for entertainment and night parties. </p><h2>  Reviews of The Royal Paradise Hotel Spa </h2><p>  Continuing the review of the institution, we turn to the reviews of the spa guests who visited it.  The Royal Paradise Hotel Spa (Thailand) refers to those hotels for which tourists leave highly conflicting reviews.  But let's talk about everything in more detail ... The complex has a rather good location, which is confirmed by the reviews of spa residents.  Despite the fact that the hotel is located on the third line, the road from it to the coast takes about ten minutes.  There is also a free shuttle service to Patong Beach.  Near the hotel there is a shopping center.  The main nightlife street, Bangla Road, is just a short walk away.  But there is one nuance that not all guests of the complex like.  The fact is that the hotel building is located just at the intersection of the gay street.  In general, this does not affect the vacation, but not everyone likes this neighborhood, because sometimes hugging male couples appear near the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the royal paradise hotel spa services" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2138920.jpg"></div>

    <p>  On the third line there are many hotels, which are ordinary city hotels, densely standing next to each other, adjacent to the ends of buildings.  The Royal Paradise Hotel Spa (photo in the article) stands out against their background, as it is a stand-alone building with beautiful views of the coast. </p><h2>  Reviews about the number of rooms </h2><p>  According to reviews, The Royal Paradise Hotel Spa has a fairly good number of rooms.  However, it is worth considering the fact that the institution’s apartments, their interiors and furniture are quite shabby and worn out.  According to many tourists, a tired institution has long been in need of updating.  And yet the rooms are quite suitable for living.  Therefore, if you do not belong to the category of demanding people, then you may like this institution.  Tourists do not recommend taking standards, since they are quite cramped and do not have balconies.  In addition, they are located on the lower floors.  On the one hand, this is not bad, but on the other, a beautiful view of Patong and the bay opens from a height. </p><p>  The hotel is equipped with panoramic elevators, so a ride to the upper floors is not a problem, especially if you admire the stunning scenery.  Apartments of higher categories have a large area and a spacious balcony.  Another advantage is the fact that they are located on higher floors, so the windows offer stunning views. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the royal paradise hotel spa hotel description" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2138922.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Room equipment is basically the same for all categories.  Bed linen is not changed often - once every four days.  Many tourists note that the linen is quite shabby, with holes and patches.  As for towels, they can also be quite worn out.  The rest of the rooms are quite good.  Maids are cleaned every day, but their financial interest is very noticeable.  If you don’t leave a tip, then do not wait for floor cleaning, as well as daily replenishment of drinking water.  Some tourists note the fact that upon check-in they offer unprepared rooms, which they hastily try to clean right when having a rest, which is unacceptable. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  Analyzing reviews about The Royal Paradise Hotel Spa, I would like to note delicious breakfasts in the main institution.  Many tourists are very pleased with them.  Of course, someone lacks variety.  But in general, the hotel pleases with a good menu.  In addition, vacationers praise the sweets of the confectionery.  The hotel complex is located in a very convenient location, there are a sufficient number of various restaurants and cafes nearby, so there are no problems with food.  In addition, if you prefer to spend all day on the beach, then in institutions on the coast you can have lunch so as not to lose time on the road.  As a rule, many tourists prefer to take only breakfast, and sometimes add dinner.  This makes it possible to visit different institutions and try many new dishes in order to have a more complete picture of the local cuisine.  If you are planning a cultural leisure, then you will definitely not need lunches at the hotel, and therefore you should not take them. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  The Royal Paradise Hotel Spa is a fairly popular place among tourists, despite the disadvantages and advantages.  Part of the staff speaks good English, so you can explain.  At check-in, guests are asked to make a deposit, which is then returned upon departure.  If during your stay at the hotel you used additional services that are not included in the price, then their payment is deducted from the deposit.  Tourists note that the hotel staff is very smiling and good-natured, although they do not always respond to requests to resolve a certain issue. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the royal paradise hotel spa thailand phuket" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2138931.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Experienced tourists recommend using additional services.  The Royal Paradise Hotel Spa has a beautiful salon where you can enjoy wellness and massage treatments.  By the way, according to vacationers, massage at the hotel is much better than in street venues, so you should definitely visit the spa and try out all the charms of the wonderful techniques of local masseurs. </p><p>  Description The Royal Paradise Hotel Spa would not be complete if not to mention the pool located on the fourth floor.  Despite the fact that the hotel is more like a city complex, it has a medium-sized pond with a children's area and a jacuzzi.  According to guests, the pool is very clean and beautiful.  The water in it is chlorinated.  Nearby there is a well-equipped relaxation area and a bar.  In general, you can have a great time if you do not want to go to the beach. </p><p>  Guests can take a leisurely stroll to Patong Beach.  Reviews about this beach certainly leave much to be desired.  A large number of tourists on the coast did their job.  And now Patong is sometimes quite dirty.  But natural beauty does not allow to notice such nuances.  The hotel offers a shuttle service to the coast for its guests.  Beachbas goes on a certain schedule, in principle, you can catch it, and go to the hotel on foot. </p><p>  The hotel makes a fairly good impression and is in demand among a certain category of tourists.  By the way, The Royal Paradise Hotel Spa rating is quite high.  So, for example, according to the version of such a well-known resource as "Booking", the hotel has a rating of 7.6. </p><p>  The hotel complex of the city type is good for all categories of guests.  But with small children, according to tourists, it is not very convenient to relax here, since the institution is not designed for people with prams to move around it.  It is worth noting the impressive size of the hotel and the restaurant on the top floor overlooking the coast. </p><h2>  Attractions and entertainment </h2><p>  The hotel is in a great and very convenient location.  If the purpose of your visit is not only a beach holiday, but also entertainment, then you will certainly enjoy the complex.  Just a few steps from the building is the famous Bangle Road with its nightly entertainment, cafes and restaurants.  Also nearby is a <span>large shopping center</span> and a lot of various bazaars with stunningly delicious fruits, which the hotel, unfortunately, does not give. </p><p>  Resting in Phuket, it is worth paying attention to its attractions.  And there are a lot of them on the island.  At the hotel reception or on the street, you can always choose the trip you are interested in and go for new experiences. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the royal paradise hotel spa thailand" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2138930.jpg"></div>

    <p>  From the hotel in tuk-tuk you can independently get to the main shrine of the island - Big Buddha.  The figure of the deity in the lotus position is visible from almost anywhere in Phuket.  She guards the temple, in which people come to ask for the health of their loved ones.  There is an excellent observation deck with great views.  There are always many tourists who are in a hurry to capture beautiful landscapes. </p><p>  If you came to the island as a family, then you will surely enjoy a trip to the island’s famous aquarium.  Its territory is divided into thematic zones, each of which has its own inhabitants.  So, for example, in coral reefs you can see living creatures that became prototypes of the characters of the cartoon "Nemo".  But the main pride of the complex is a multi-meter tunnel.  Walking along it, you can plunge headlong into the underwater world, but at the same time remain completely dry. </p><p>  Thailand is known for its amazing low-cost jewelry.  A beautiful half of tourists will certainly wish to visit a pearl farm.  On the island of Nakha Noi, you can see with your own eyes how pearls are grown.  In addition, employees will demonstrate the appearance of a pearl at different stages of its development.  On the farm you can also see how beautiful jewelry is made from cultured pearls.  And at the end of the tour, tourists are given the opportunity to purchase their favorite items in a local store. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the royal paradise hotel spa description" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2138932.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Among vacationers, trips to a snake farm are very popular.  If you are flying to Thailand for exotic, then you should definitely visit this place.  Here you can watch shows featuring cobras and pythons.  According to tourists, such a sight is not for the faint of heart.  Well, at the end of the show, guests go to the store with snake-skin products.  Such accessories are very appreciated due to their high quality, and therefore are in demand. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Royal Paradise is a good three-star hotel with its own advantages and, of course, disadvantages.  The hotel can be a good place to relax for uninhabited guests.  If you are ready to not pay attention to minor flaws or tired institution numbers, then you can safely choose it.  The excellent location of the hotel and the panoramic views from the windows of the apartments will complement the pleasant experience of a great time. </p>
