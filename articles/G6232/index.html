    <h2>  Introduction </h2><p>  A person with a lot of money will always take care of their safety and value.  Therefore, very often he invests money in any projects, developments, promotions.  With such investments, he still remains unsure of tomorrow.  The project may fail, or something may just go wrong, so you can safely say about the unreliability of such investments.  And here a logical question arises: "But what to do, what to invest in, so that at least not remain in the red after years?"  The answer is simple: investments in gold and other precious metals will help. </p><h2>  Precious metals: in which to invest? </h2><p>  These days, you can find many different investment options.  But whether they will be reliable for years or even decades, no one knows.  One mankind knows for sure: precious metals and stones will always remain in value.  For example, gold or silver.  These metals have constant and unchanging physical properties - this is what distinguishes them from cash.  Metals cannot completely depreciate, and a currency can become plain paper in seconds. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  And as we already guessed, investments in gold and silver are the most popular and affordable in our time.  History shows that these two metals have always been in price.  Investing in gold gives a lot of advantages: </p><ul><li>  Invested money can always be returned. </li><li>  Gold cannot lose its price. </li><li>  Gold cannot deteriorate (for example, burn out or get wet). </li></ul><p>  Thus, choosing to invest in a <span>precious metal,</span> you can be confident in the future and not be afraid of crises at all.  Investing in gold will not leave you in the red.  However, it is worthwhile to understand that such an investment is a long-term one.  And if you want to earn money, the investor needs to play on the difference between the purchase price and the sale price of his gold. </p><h2>  Gold as the main currency of the past </h2><p>  The past shows that gold was quite popular.  This is proved by all kinds of "gold rush" in the Wild West.  On this occasion, even works were published.  Nathan Lewis wrote the book Gold: Money of the Past and the Future.  It talks about the instability of a currency like the dollar, and the ever-lasting and unchanging value of gold, as well as the impact of crises and decades on these two currencies. </p>

Indeed, it is the yellow precious metal that has always been valued, appreciated and will be valued - only the equivalent of the valuation will change.

However, over time, people realized that it was unreasonable to use such an expensive metal to evaluate cheap things, and began to replace gold with cheaper options. </p><h2>  Where can I buy gold? </h2><p>  Today, in almost every good bank you can buy gold or, more correctly, invest in gold.  Sberbank of Russia, for example, can easily sell you this precious metal in several ways: </p><ul><li>  <em>Gold bars.</em>  They come in a variety of weights: from the smallest to the largest kilogram ingots. </li><li>  <em>Golden coins.</em>  Most often, such coins are also collectible.  Therefore, collectors pay more attention to them.  However, if you are rich, you can make a nice birthday gift for a friend by buying him a gold coin as a present. </li><li>  And the third type of investment in a precious metal is the <em>purchase of gold jewelry</em> .  If you buy gold for your beloved wife, it will be not only a luxurious gift, but also a good investment in the event of a collapse of the global economy. </li></ul>

Of course, the buyer must have a certain age.  In addition, desire and money are still necessary for its purchase.  Thus, it becomes obvious that investing in gold is available to everyone who has such an opportunity.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Trends in the popularity of gold and silver for a given year <strong> </strong></h2><p>  This year, 2014, the ‚Äúgold investors‚Äù were able to make good money on the difference between buying and selling gold.  This is primarily due to the fact that in recent years gold has been a bit cheaper, based on the price per gram.  This year, there is an increase in gold prices by about 7 percent of the value of 2013.  Looking at this percentage, we can congratulate investors with relatively large gold reserves - they have become a little richer compared to the past. </p><p>  It is worth noting that fractions of a percent of the cost are constantly increasing, and so far there are no prerequisites for stopping this growth, and even less for reducing this percentage.  And here is a tip for those who have not yet started investing in gold: it is better to hold on to money.  This is due to the high cost of metal at the moment.  Having invested money now, you can simply lose a certain part of the funds due to a fall in the price of gold in the future. </p><h2>  <strong>Gold Investment Storage</strong> </h2><p>  Many people have a question: "Where to store gold?"  At its core, it is very correct and problematic.  In modern world conditions, with the increase in the criminal component of society, most human habitats are unreliable for storing a large number of values.  Therefore, investors are looking for more secure places and keep their gold in them.  One of them is a bank with special vaults. </p><p>  For example, Sberbank stores gold in special rooms that are protected with the latest technology.  Neither thieves nor fraudsters can get there, and only the owner can look at his wealth.  In addition to banks, in Europe there are special private money vaults that keep any tangible assets safe and secret from everyone. </p><p>  If you think that all of these options are unreliable, you can organize your own storage by buying and installing a modern safe in your house, which is very difficult to crack, and even more so, to take it away.  Investing in gold requires special storage conditions for it. </p><h2>  Buying gold bars as an investment <strong> </strong></h2>

They can‚Äôt be looked at like coins, they can‚Äôt be worn like jewelry, but they can be stored in a very large amount, and this is the biggest plus of this type of investment.  The weight of gold bars can reach 1 kilogram.

    <p>  Sberbank sells gold in bars of various sizes, starting from 2 grams.  Thus, everyone can come and invest their money in metal currency.  Having bought this metal in this form, you can immediately open a gold account on which your grams or kilograms will lie.  It is very important when choosing a reliable bank for this business.  For example, some state or most quoted in the country.  Having done this, you can safely invest money in moments of falling gold prices. </p><h2>  Buying gold <span>collectible coins</span> as an investment </h2><p>  It has long been known to everyone that gold coins are also a subject of investment.  Those who are bored of storing gold bullion can buy it in coins.  This, in our opinion, is more interesting, and there is always some kind of variety. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rising gold prices" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23786/516045.jpg" width="560"></div>

    <p>  Buying gold coins is very simple.  First you need to find a bank that sells them.  Information on this should be known to any employee in the bank.  Having learned that such products are sold, we approach a competent employee and express a desire to buy <span>investment coins.</span>  If you are lucky, the bank will be able to offer several varieties of coins and set a price for them.  And then you yourself will choose one or another option and buy it.  Investments in gold through the purchase of coins are very developed in the countries of America, Europe, and recently began to develop in our country. </p><p>  If in the future you are planning to sell gold coins, it is best to donate them to private collections or pawnshops.  It is possible that the price in these places for the purchase of gold will be slightly higher than in the bank in which you bought.  And it‚Äôs worth considering.  After all, the main purpose of investments is to accumulate money, and not spend it. </p><h2>  Investment in Gold: Jewelry </h2>

However, this type of investment is the most pleasant for you.  Now let‚Äôs explain why.  Ingots and coins are, of course, good, but products made of these precious metals show your material status.  A person with beautiful, weighty gold jewelry is always perceived as a rich man.  In addition, it is much more pleasant to give your wife a gift in the form of a gold jewelry and, thus, possibly provide your family with a future.
