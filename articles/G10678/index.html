Despite the relatively large area (7.3 sq. Km), its maximum depth hardly reaches 3-4 meters, but the bottom is very muddy and the banks are swampy.  The name of the reservoir was given by local residents due to the abundance of <span>reed vegetation</span> around the lake.  This quiet, clean place is located away from large and noisy roads and towns. </p>

    <p>  Trosten Lake at the moment is the remainder of a very large body of water left over from the last ice age, before it occupied the entire basin.  Near it, human sites appeared in the <span>Stone Age;</span> archaeologists have found more than one burial site of ancient settlements.  On the rivers flowing into the lake, trade was carried out, and the forest was rafted to Moscow.  In the 14th century, Trostenskoe Lake became a battlefield between the <span>Principality of Moscow</span> and Lithuania.  In the 16th century, <span>this pond was</span> taken over by the monasteries and for a long time remained the property of the church.  During the Second World War, fierce battles were fought around the lake.  Under the Soviet Union (in 1966), a nature reserve was established here, which was under the jurisdiction </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Trostenskoe lake photo" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13375/236903.jpg" width="600"></div>  Military hunting society.  Two fishing bases rented boats from which visitors could fish or enjoy the views that Lake Trostensky gives.  But, unfortunately, the bases were liquidated in 2006.

Although the species composition was severely damaged after massive deforestation in the past, the forest almost completely lost valuable tree species.  For 150-200 meters to the coast, the forest passes into reeds, sedges and reeds.  Of the shallow vegetation, Lake Trostenskoe boasts rare species, some of which are included in the Red Book of the Moscow Region.  It is rich in water and ichthyofauna, it attracted and still attracts fishermen from all over the region and not only.  The most numerous populations of perch and roach, but fish live here </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Trostenskoe fishing lake" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13375/236902.jpg" width="600"></div>  and larger, for example, pike, burbot, bream and ide.  By the end of the 20th century, due to poaching, fish stocks fell sharply, the situation was complicated due to the closure of fishing bases and the weakening of state control.  But strangely enough, the Trostenskoye lake is famous for fish.

    <p>  Fishing and recreation </p><p>  Thanks to its good ecology and rich ichthyofauna, Trostenskoye Lake, whose pictures are picturesque, attracts many fishermen and tourists.  A number of rivers will flow into the body of water, but, which is noteworthy, a river also flows out of it, it is called the Lake.  The nearest settlement (Onufrievo village) is located 1000 meters to the south-east.  Previously, fishing camps provided visitors with everything they needed, but now, if you decide to fish, you will have to bring a boat and a tent with you.  This place is great for a family holiday in nature.  You can arrange accommodation with local residents, or you can relax with the "savages" in tents around the campfire. </p>
