    <p>  Thavorn BeachVillage Resort &amp; Spa is one of the most beautiful hotels on the island.  The hotel is decorated in a traditional Thai style.  The resort is famous for 191 villas, the categories of which correspond to Western quality standards.  Luxurious bungalows, made in the spirit of Thai traditions, located in a quiet secluded bay - a great place for your relaxation. </p><h2>  Acquaintance </h2><p>  Thavorn Beach Village Resort &amp; Spa has everything you need for an excellent leisure: several bars, two restaurants, wellness and spa treatments.  There is also a legendary swimming pool with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãover 4,900 square meters, immersed in the lush gardens of the tropics.  Thavorn Beach Village Resort &amp; Spa provides all the conditions for outdoor activities and exploring the nature and culture of Thailand. </p><p>  The latter is perceived by many as a great opportunity for entertainment and broadening one's horizons.  Guests of Thavorn Beach Village Resort &amp; Spa (Phuket) are advised by tour operators and numerous reviewers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Phuket: what is an island? </h2><p>  Phuket is a fabulous island washed by the warm waters of the <span>Andaman Sea</span> and the Indian Ocean.  It is the southwestern territory of Thailand.  At the same time, there is a province bearing the same name.  The word "phuket" is translated from Malay as "mountain": the island is mainly covered in mountains with dense green vegetation. </p><p>  The island is separated from the mainland by the Pak Pra Strait.  Two bridges connect the mainland of Phuket.  This small island is very popular as a place for tourists from all over the world to gather, so it has its own international airport. </p><p>  According to experienced travelers, striving for this island is exclusively for young people who want to get more vivid impressions and experience strong emotions.  Those who are interested in trying everything!  Because such a vacation is very specific.  Here, according to reviews, the tourist will benefit from the ability to look through many fingers at many nuances - the cuisine on the island is not always of high quality and democratic prices are not everywhere. </p><h2>  Hotel Selection </h2><p>  Here is truly a huge selection of hotels.  The island of Phuket is considered in Thailand a place of respectable relaxation, in connection with this the prices here are slightly higher.  You can choose a chic five-star hotel with a private pool, more reminiscent of the eastern Sultan mansions.  And you can stay in a secluded bungalow, hidden in the shadow of the jungle.  The cost of living is inversely proportional to the occupied area.  In the luxurious 5-star hotel you can also find quite budget offers: a neat private guesthouse with a minimum of services and air conditioning, an inexpensive guest house, a hostel in which a large and diverse company can live in one room. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In general, the concept of "starry" hotels in Phuket is quite loose.  According to tourists staying here, this resort is good everywhere, almost at home.  Vacationers should take into account that the hotels have a different focus: some are oriented to family vacations, others - to youth and party, etc.  You should also pay attention to the fact that not every hotel has its own beach. </p><p>  Hotel Thavorn Beach Village Resort &amp; Spa (Phuket), tourists call this "paradise", inviting you to stay on vacation here. </p>

    <h2>  The mirror of your soul </h2><p>  Tourists who love Phuket are sure that there are a lot of things on the island that are worth seeing, where to go and what a good way to learn!  Therefore, when going on vacation, it is important to consider all the nuances in order to correctly plan your future vacation. </p><p>  Travelers who are in love with Phuket and have studied it thoroughly, believe that this country is a real mirror of the soul of every guest arriving in it.  If you are a person with overstated ambitions and think that you should forgive the red carpet, then you will receive an appropriate attitude. Thailand is a very special world that plays by its own rules. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Tourists who have chosen to rest this country and decided to settle in Thavorn Beach Village Resort &amp; Spa (Phuket) or any other hotel of the resort island, need to know about these rules. </p><h2>  Rule number 1: smile! </h2><p>  Those who have chosen a tour at Thavorn Beach Village Resort &amp; Spa should be aware that a friendly smile is required in Thai culture.  Thais at the sight of an eternally dull sour face expressing constant discontent, are alarmed.  In this country, a person without a smile is a sign of inadequacy of a person.  Therefore, experienced Russian tourists advise their countrymen in Phuket: smile more often, dear vacationers! </p><p>  Experienced travelers warn that guests of any hotel in Phuket, including Thavorn Beach Village Resort &amp; Spa 5 *, should avoid quarrels with the local population.  Tourists are often shocked to see the real power of a common Thai spirit - everyone here stands up for each other!  In Thailand, experienced travelers advise, you should never raise your voice, you need to restrain your emotions and be sure to maintain dignity.  People with white skin for Thais are in fact the highest creatures.  Therefore, representatives of the white race should and behave accordingly. </p><p>  The authors of the reviews warn their fellow countrymen who gathered in Phuket: God forbid someone raise their hand on the Thai!  Those who decided to relax in Thailand and chose one of Phuket's hotels to check in, for example, Thavorn Beach Village Resort &amp; Spa, reviews of tourists recommend remembering that locals will never start a fight in their life.  First of all, because a foreigner in their understanding is a person of a higher origin, in comparison with them.  But if a guest starts a fight, he should be ready to either fight with all the locals who will run away from anywhere in a fraction of a second, as a result of which he will definitely have to be in the hospital (which is not the worst).  Or talk to the local police.  This experienced tourists advise compatriots in every possible way to avoid. </p><h2>  Rule number 2: do not spoil relations with the police </h2><p>  Guests of the island, including guests of one of its most magnificent hotels, Thavorn Beach Village Resort &amp; Spa 5 *, should know that the Thai police are always on the side of the locals. </p><h2>  Rule number 3: do not steal! </h2><p>  Thieves in this country are outcasts.  According to travelers who are familiar with local customs, those who are caught stealing are being harassed, as they say, by the whole world, by a huge crowd.  This usually ends with the fact that, at best, in the words of the authors of the reviews, ‚Äúthey hit me on the head‚Äù. </p><h2>  Rule No. 4: Honor the Royal Family </h2><p>  Regardless of whether the magnificent Thavorn Beach Village Resort &amp; Spa (Thailand) or any other hotel in the country is chosen for vacation, the traveler should also remember that the king and his whole family are very respected and loved here.  For Thais, the king and queen are father and mother.  Experienced travelers recommend that potential guests in Phuket ‚Äúkeep their tongue in their mouth‚Äù: a careless joke or phrase can lead to unpleasant consequences. </p><h2>  About the peculiarities of the local mentality </h2><p>  Guests of the island, guests of the Thavorn Beach Village Resort &amp; Spa Phuket 5 * or neighboring hotels, can relax here completely without fear that at some point they will overcome the feeling of loneliness in a foreign country.  Experienced tourists inform that local residents who are in trouble or have any difficulties will always come to the rescue.  ‚ÄúThey are extremely friendly and helpful people!‚Äù - many admire.  If a tourist takes out a bag, the Thais will surely catch up with the thief and things will certainly be returned.  A car breaks down at a guest in the middle of the road - the locals stop and will certainly provide assistance.  Even if it happens inadvertently stepping on a sea urchin - Thais will help! </p><h2>  Thavorn Beach Village Resort &amp; Spa Hotel: Location </h2><p>  The hotel is located in Nakalay, a secluded bay on the west coast.  Its territory stretches for 500 m along the coastline.  Its area is 11 hectares. </p><p>  40 kilometers from the resort is <span>Phuket</span> International <span>Airport.</span>  A trip to it takes 40 minutes.  Hotel guests are provided with parking (free).  Phuket Town is located 25 kilometers from the hotel.  The hotel runs electric vehicles.  Patong is a 10-minute drive from Thavorn Beach Village.  Not far from it is the beach of Kamala. </p><h2>  Thavorn Beach Village Resort &amp; Spa: hotel description </h2><p>  The hotel uses a traditional Thai style.  The hotel is located in a picturesque area with waterfalls and slides, among a lush tropical garden.  There is a beach (rocky), which is characterized by the tides.  The hotel is recommended for families without children.  Thavorn Beach Village Resort &amp; Spa <span>(Phuket) reviews</span> are called one of the best options that you can choose in Kamala.  The distance to the beach can be overcome in just three minutes. </p><p>  The establishment is part of the popular Thavorn hotel group.  The hotel was built in 1986, in 2013 it was redecorated.  The hotel is a 191 villa, which are located on the beach, on a hill and near the pool. </p><p>  Thavorn Beach Village Resort &amp; Spa (photo shows its exterior) offers beautiful views of the Andaman Sea.  The hotel provides vacationers with a variety of paid and free services, the opportunity to play sports, actively relax and have fun. </p>

There is a sufficient number of sunbeds, the sea, according to vacationers, is "very, very warm."  The bottom at high tide, according to reviews, does not cause discomfort to swimmers.  Visibility in the water is pretty good, allowing you to swim with a mask. </p><p>  The rooms are very spacious, they have everything you need for a comfortable stay.  Cleaning is done daily.  A shuttle runs free of charge 5 times a day from the hotel to Patong and back.  From the crazy heat saves the pool bar, which allows you to drink a cocktail and have a snack, without leaving the water. </p><p>  The hotel has many animals: ponies, rabbits, goats, turtles.

    <p>  Of the minuses, guests note: </p><ul><li>  Living on the top floor (sixth) is not the best choice.  It should be settled in a room no higher than the fourth floor.  A mini-tram drives guests to the rooms located on the mountain; guests describe its speed as rather unhurried.  If necessary, "often you don‚Äôt run into a room," they say.  A family with a child is better to choose rooms of other categories for living. </li><li>  Breakfast at the hotel, as noted by tourists living here, is plentiful, tasty, but not varied enough. </li><li>  One of the minuses mentioned by the hotel guests is the rather high price for a taxi, which will have to be resorted to by those who did not have time for the shuttle. </li></ul>
