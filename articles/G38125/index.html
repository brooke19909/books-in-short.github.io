Perhaps you should include Malaga in the route of Spain.  This is a city that is not at all well-known unlike Barcelona or Madrid, but, nevertheless, deserves special attention.  Among all the resorts in Spain, Malaga most of all impresses tourists with an amazing synthesis of beach holidays and a rich cultural program.  Here, many historical sights are organically combined with beautiful beaches.  After reading this article, you will learn new things about the <span>culture of Spain,</span> what to see in Malaga, what this wonderful city is famous for. </p><h2>  A bit of history and geography </h2><p>  Malaga is a city located on the Mediterranean coast in southern Spain in the Costa del Sol region.  It is believed that the city was founded by the Phoenicians in the VIII century BC.  That is, the history of the city dates back 29 centuries.  During this time, Malaga was constantly conquered and conquered.  The city was part of the Roman Empire, then became the capital of the Muslim state, and in the era of the industrial revolution, it was even the largest economic center in Spain.  Due to its rich and rich history, Malaga can offer tourists many attractions: from the Roman ancient amphitheater and Arab fortress to the cathedrals and museums of modern art. </p><p>  By the way, the city is also famous for the fact that it was here that the great <span>Spanish artist</span> Pablo Picasso was born, so painting lovers who come to Malaga have the opportunity to visit 2 museums that tell about the life and work of the legendary surrealist. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Malaga, Spain: how to get there? </h2><p>  Malaga has a major international airport, railway station and seaport.  Despite the fact that most flights from Russia to Malaga are connecting (with transfers), the most profitable route for Russians is the flight to Malaga by air.  If you are planning a big tour of Spain, and Malaga is not the first step by step route, then you can get to the city by land transport - by train or by bus. </p><h2>  Main Attractions of Malaga: Roman Theater </h2><p>  Malaga is a city in Spain, whose attractions are striking in a variety of eras.  For example, one of the oldest buildings in Malaga is considered to be the Roman Theater, built in the 1st century BC and still well preserved.  The theater was used for its intended purpose until the 3rd century AD, and later under the Muslim government it was turned into a quarry.  It is surprising that this archaeological find was discovered by accident - during repairs in the garden of the House of Culture of Malaga in 1951.  As it turned out a little later during excavations, just under the House of Culture was the theater. </p><p>  Having been in this place, you can touch history, learn more about the life of the ancient Romans, walk on the stones that were walked two thousand years ago.  This unique opportunity is used by many tourists, so the Roman Theater is a fairly popular attraction. </p><div class="photo" data-original="news.spainhouses.net" data-author=": " data-source="https://news.spainhouses.net/2015/09/visitor-centre-of-the-roman-theatre-of-malaga-by-tejedor-linares-asociados/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Roman theater" class="if uuid-2319463" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75632/2319463.jpg"></div><h2>  Fortress of Malaga </h2><p>  The fortress of Malaga (Alcazaba) is an ancient fortress, preserved from the time when Malaga was part of the Muslim state.  It was built in the XI century and, like any fortress, defended the city and its inhabitants from enemy troops.  Now Alcazaba attracts many tourists, not only as a historical monument, but also as a very picturesque place.  The fortress is located on a hill, so rising to the top, you can enjoy a beautiful panoramic view of the whole of Malaga. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.visitcostadelsol.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.visitcostadelsol.com/explore/monuments-and-areas-of-tourist-interest/the-alcazaba-p16031"><img itemprop="image" alt="Fortress of Malaga" class="if uuid-2319474" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75632/2319474.jpg"></div><h2>  Malaga Cathedral </h2><p>  Not far from Alcazaba there is one more architecturally impressive building - the Cathedral of Malaga (Cathedral of Our Lady of the Incarnation).  The construction work began several decades after the defeat by Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of the Castile Muslim state.  It was assumed that the cathedral would become a symbol of the greatness and victory of Christianity.  The construction of the temple was very long and lasted almost three centuries (1528 - 1782).  The cathedral‚Äôs tower is 85 meters long, making it the second tallest temple in all of Andalusia. </p><p>  Quite an interesting fact, which adds unusualness to the structure, is that the second tower is still not completed.  In this regard, the cathedral is sometimes called the "one-armed".  It is also surprising that the temple building combines several architectural styles at once: Baroque, Gothic and Classicism.  The vast majority of tourists who visited this monumental cathedral share genuine admiration and declare that it is a must-see for all visitors to Malaga. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": Danielmlg86, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Malaga Cathedral" class="if uuid-2319484" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75632/2319484.jpg"></div><h2>  Botanical Garden </h2><p>  If you get tired of the heat and want to hide from the rays of the scorching Spanish sun, be sure to visit the botanical garden "La Concepcion" - the most beautiful park in Malaga, created back in the 19th century.  Here are several thousand plants from all over Spain and not only.  After a walk along the hot European streets, you can be transported into the tropical jungle in an instant.  Many tourists admit that they don‚Äôt want to leave here - it‚Äôs so nice to slowly walk around the picturesque park.  Some even call it a "green oasis." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In addition to a variety of trees and flowers, you can see parrots, beautiful fountains and waterfalls.  Even if you are not at all interested in botany, be sure to visit the Botanical Garden of Malaga and enjoy the coolness of its green alleys. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.visitacostadelsol.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://blog.visitacostadelsol.com/en/botanical-gardens-costa-del-sol"><img itemprop="image" alt="Botanical Garden" class="if uuid-2319502" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75632/2319502.jpg"></div><h2>  Picasso Museum </h2><p>  The inhabitants of Malaga are very proud of their famous countryman, so visiting Malaga and not visiting the Picasso Museum is the same as coming to Petersburg and not going on an excursion to the Hermitage.  The museum is located in the Buenavista Palace and was founded in 2003.  The building used to be a royal residence, but the king of Spain, Juan Carlos, donated it for the museum.  The gallery presents a large collection of the master‚Äôs creations: about 200 paintings, as well as sculptures.  The ticket price includes an audio guide, including in Russian.  Most of the exhibits were donated by the artist‚Äôs relatives. </p><p>  Not far from the Buenavista Palace is the Picasso House Museum, which is more devoted to his biography than to paintings.  Even if you do not consider yourself a connoisseur of painting, do not miss the opportunity to touch the work of the great artist. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.andalusiaspagna.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.andalusiaspagna.com/malaga/museo-pablo-picasso/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Picasso Museum" class="if uuid-2319508" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75632/2319508.jpg"></div><h2>  Plaza de toros </h2><p>  If Italy is associated with pizza and the Colosseum, then when you think of Spain, two symbols most likely come to mind - flamenco and bullfight.  Holidays in Spain, in Malaga in particular, can not do without the first or the second.  As for the favorite entertainment of the Spaniards - bullfighting, in Malaga you can see this performance in the Plaza de Toros "La Malagueta".  The bullfighting museum is also located here, where among the exhibits are the clothes of the matadors, old posters and harnesses.  The arena building itself is a landmark in the city and is often depicted on all souvenirs.  You immediately pay attention to him when you look at panoramic photos of Malaga. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": DXR, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bullfighting in Spain" class="if uuid-2319513" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75632/2319513.jpg"></div><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  It is time to learn about the <span>beaches of Malaga.</span>  Spain is famous for its beautiful beach resorts, and Malaga is no exception.  The coastline is officially divided into 16 parts.  Most of the beaches are sandy, each of them has everything you need for relaxation - changing cabins, public toilets and a large selection of excellent restaurants with very affordable prices.  Having studied the list of beaches, each tourist can choose something most suitable for their preferences.  "Le Malagueta" is suitable for family vacations; lovers of outdoor activities and sports will like La Caleta beach.  The promenade of Pedregalejo is famous for its nightlife, and seekers of new sensations can undoubtedly be advised to visit "de Guadalmar" - the only official nudist beach in Malaga.  Most beaches are within walking distance of the city center. </p><h2>  Night life </h2><p>  Malaga, like any large, densely populated city, never sleeps.  At night, there are many clubs with incendiary dances and loud music, as well as bars where you can have a drink with old friends and make new acquaintances.  In many nightlife in Malaga, you can watch dance and music shows, including see how flamenco dance.  There are always a lot of noisy and cheerful companies on the streets at night, both for young people and families with children.  In general, Spaniards love and know how to relax both day and night. </p><h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  If you suddenly get bored with museums and the beach, go shopping.  In Malaga, you will find both boutiques with fashionable brand clothes and small shops with souvenirs.  One of the largest shopping and entertainment centers in Malaga - "Larios" have a huge area of ‚Äã‚Äã45 thousand square meters.  meters occupied by shops of famous brands (Zara, Mango, Tezenis and so on), restaurants and a cinema.  You can plunge into the atmosphere of street trading on Constitution Square, here you can buy souvenirs as a gift, ceramics and antiques.  For fresh products, head to the central market of Malaga Atarasanas, where you can buy fruits, vegetables, fish and jamon at very affordable prices. </p><h2>  Gastronomy </h2><p>  Gastronomy of Malaga is very diverse due to its mild climate and proximity to the sea.  It is represented mainly by Mediterranean cuisine at its best.  The most popular among tourists are seafood and fish.  One of the most famous dishes served almost everywhere - both in expensive restaurants and in beach eateries - ‚ÄúEspeto de Sardinas‚Äù.  These are sardines, traditionally charcoal grilled using cane as a spit.  Fish is pre-sprinkled with plenty of sea salt. </p><p>  Another way to cook seafood is called "Moorish saucepans", it is associated with the use of olive oil, herbs and garlic.

Therefore, even in winter it is relatively warm here, frosts are extremely rare.  The peak of the tourist season is summer, when the water in the sea warms up to 25 degrees.  The climate becomes very dry, there are practically no rainy days.  The air temperature reaches 30 degrees during the day, in such conditions it becomes very difficult to visit excursions and museums.

Holidays in Malaga according to tourists </h2><p>  Many Russian tourists have already visited Malaga and made up their minds.  After analyzing reviews of Spain and Malaga in particular on Russian-speaking tourist portals, we can conclude that most people just fell in love with this city.  Reviews with a rating of 5 stars significantly prevail, there are few reviews that indicate some shortcomings, but in general the tourists have a positive opinion.  If somewhere there are negative ratings about the resort, then this is more likely an exception to the rule.  What so attracts tourists to Malaga? </p><ol><li>  Many interesting sights, museums, places for walking - a surprisingly eventful excursion life. </li><li>  What attracts most Russians is the opportunity to soak up the sun and swim in the sea. </li><li>  A very large selection of cafes where you can enjoy delicious and unusual dishes. </li><li>  Stunning architecture, ancient buildings of different times and styles. </li><li>  Not a hackneyed resort, a small proportion of Russian tourists. </li><li>  Unique Spanish flavor. </li></ol><p>  Of course, you need to remember about some aspects that can cause discomfort during the trip in order to mentally prepare for them.  So, tourists noted the following shortcomings of Malaga as a tourist center: </p><ol><li>  It may be too hot in the summer. </li><li>  A lot of tourists. </li><li>  Too saturated rhythm of life, not suitable for a calm and measured rest. </li></ol><p>  However, if you know about all the shortcomings (which are not so many), and they won‚Äôt scare you, you can safely buy tickets to Malaga (Spain), you will find an unforgettable adventure in the sunny world of beautiful streets, delicious food and smiling people. </p>
