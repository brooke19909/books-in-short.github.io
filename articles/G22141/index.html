  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The story of the first bus</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Buses, like many things in everyday life, have a deep history of creation, ideas and its implementation.  Inventions of this type have deep roots and are continuously connected with the history of trams, trains and trolleybuses.  None of this could have appeared in its modern form without the steam engine, which appeared at the end of the XVIII century.  The invention of the bus was a huge leap in the world of transport technology of mankind. </p><h2>  The first steam-powered buses </h2><p>  The main person in the industry of creating vehicles for the period of the beginning of the XIX century was Richard Trevitik.  The young technician used the steam engine system already known at that time in his brainchild and improved it to transport a large number of passengers.  Of course, today 8 people are too few, but for that time it was something incredible. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="One of the first buses" class="if uuid-2973748" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/91865/2973748.jpg"></div><p>  The presentation (and the first bus flight), took place in December 1801 and made a lot of hype around the world.  Nevertheless, they were not widespread even in the territories of the leading world powers.  During the first buses, transport had an impressive size and consumed a huge amount of resources, but as a symbol of the industrial revolution it performed its role perfectly.  Such a machine inspired hope in ordinary citizens and inspired new discoveries. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Transition to electricity </h2><p>  The next step in improving the first buses was the concept of vehicles moving with electricity.  This happened in 1885, and the city of London was again created.  A new technological bus could reach speeds of up to 12 km / h.  In Russia, such a technological miracle has come into use since 1901.  Domestic counterpart of the brand "Duks" could accommodate up to 10 passengers and reach speeds of up to 20 km / h for three hours. </p><div class="photo" data-original="calgaryherald.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Electric Bus Prototype" class="if uuid-2973753" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/91865/2973753.jpg"></div><p>  The first electric buses far exceeded their prototypes in terms of power, but this was still not enough.  It was too expensive to generate current in such large quantities and constantly recharge vehicles, although low environmental pollution was an important advantage over buses of the past. </p><h2>  Buses with internal combustion engines </h2><p>  Transport capable of transporting a large number of passengers at high speed and without high energy costs was a real dream for the inventors of the XIX century.  The first concept of this type was used at the Benz brand factory in 1895 on the basis of already existing engine drawings and improvements to the first bus.  At the initial stages, the device had few advantages over competitors.  He still could accommodate no more than 8 people and develop a speed of only 15 km / h. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.expats.cz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="with internal combustion engine" class="if uuid-2973757" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/91865/2973757.jpg"></div><p>  In Russia, the time of the first internal combustion buses began in 1903 at the Frese plant.  It was a kind of limousine convertible for 10 people.  Transport had 10 horsepower and developed all the same 15 km / h. </p><p>  If we talk about the first bus services for urban transport, they appeared in London closer to the end of 1903.  The Russian analogue was launched in 1907 in the city of Arkhangelsk.  It was developed by German engineers and significantly improved.  The new bus weighed 6 tons and could accommodate up to 25 people. </p>
