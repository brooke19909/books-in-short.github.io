  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Wide angle lens</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>A wide-angle lens</span> is a lens whose <span>focal length</span> is shorter than a normal one.  Such devices allow you to cover a much larger angle of space than the human eye can see.  Due to the fact that the frame size does not exceed the usual, all objects that fall into it are smaller in the picture than when shooting with a conventional lens.  The degree of reduction directly depends on the length of the focal length.  The wide-angle lens makes it possible to obtain a very interesting result in terms of optics and expressiveness, since when shooting with it, the effect of removing different plans from each other and from the photographer becomes more noticeable.  It is generally accepted that such devices have a greater <span>depth of field</span> than telephoto lenses or standard models.  However, this is a very common misconception, since in the picture with the same size of the object, the depth of field, for example, a telephoto lens or standard, will be exactly the same as in the case of using wide-angle. </p><p>  The wide-angle lens has the following main features: wide viewing angle;  smaller value of the minimum focusing distance.  All other specifications are not unique.  Wide-angle lenses are also commonly referred to as ultra-wide-angle.  Regarding this type, there are no specific restrictions on which models to call so, however, among photographers, they are considered to be those for which the focal length does not exceed 24 mm. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Due to some specific properties of wide-angle lenses, shooting with them has a number of features.  One of them is considered to be a distortion of perspective, when the objects that are closest in size are transmitted noticeably larger than in reality, and the distant ones seem smaller.  To maximize the use of this effect, you need to get as close to the main subject as possible, be sure to include some object in the background in the frame.  Such a distortion of perspective is very useful especially in the case of landscape photography, while the scene takes on additional volume.  However, it is precisely such a feature that does not allow shooting people, since it greatly distorts the <span>proportions of the body</span> and face. </p><p>  You can use a wide-angle lens to shoot architecture or other objects, while avoiding tilting the axis of the lens relative to the horizon if there are many parallel vertical lines, as this will noticeably distort the space.  This will give the picture the effect of falling buildings.  When professional photography of architecture is carried out, masters try to avoid a similar effect, however, it can be applicable in some cases as an artistic effect.  It is important to note that for shooting architectural structures it is worth using a special type of lenses equipped with the ability to tilt the optical axis and shift it, which will allow you to adjust the perspective of distortion.  For example, <span>Nikon</span> wide-angle <span>lens</span> is quite capable of coping with such a task.  But during shooting in closed confined spaces, such devices become generally practically indispensable, because the photographer does not have the opportunity to step back to fully cover the scene.  When shooting interiors, this quality is very highly valued. </p><p>  Due to its optical features and design, the wide-angle <span>lens for Canon</span> is much more susceptible to extraneous light and glare.  This forces the use of a protective hood during shooting, which protects the front lens from direct sunlight and reduces the likelihood of glare in the picture. </p>
