However, the final impression largely depends on the resort where travelers will be staying.  So, quite popular among tourists is the Sharjah Carlton Hotel.  Reviews of 2016 about him contain such positive comments: </p><ul><li>  pleased with the presence of their own beach, which is not allowed outsiders (although some employees manage to do this for an additional fee); </li><li>  the hotel has a lot of travelers from the CIS countries, and therefore you can always find a fun company (although many consider this a drawback); </li><li>  very convenient gentle entry into the sea, which will be a particularly pleasant moment for guests with children; </li><li>  the staff is extremely friendly and attentive to the guests; </li><li>  free shuttle buses to Dubai daily; </li><li>  spacious rooms with good comfortable furniture; </li><li>  the air conditioner does not depend on a key card, and therefore the air temperature can be maintained even when you are not in the room; </li><li>  guests have the opportunity to go to lunch instead of breakfast (this should be reported to the waiter, who will make the appropriate marks); </li><li>  very good location, which is characterized by proximity to the sea, as well as a huge number of infrastructure facilities; </li><li>  the beach has very clean white sand, which is completely cleared of stones, algae and other debris; </li><li>  the hotel has a very quiet atmosphere (this is most likely due to a complete ban on alcohol); </li><li>  next to the hotel there is a restaurant serving traditional Russian dishes; </li><li>  if you arrive at the hotel late in the evening, then before registration you will be offered dinner; </li><li>  at the tour desk you can read brochures about local attractions for free, even if you are not going to buy a tour; </li><li>  the administration tries to take into account all special requests that were indicated by the guests when booking; </li><li>  quick placement without unnecessary bureaucratic procedures and delays. </li></ul><h2>  Negative moments </h2><p>  Unfortunately, not only positive reviews can be heard about such a resort institution as the Sharjah Carlton Hotel 4 *.  You may come across negative comments as follows: </p><ul><li>  the rooms have a very unpleasant smell of some paints and varnishes; </li><li>  In the rooms, wireless Internet practically does not work; </li><li>  wet bedding; </li><li>  the restaurant serves the same dishes for lunch and dinner; </li><li>  very weak water pressure in the bathrooms of rooms located on the upper floors of the main building, as well as in the chalet; </li><li>  the equipment in the gym is literally antediluvian, and it is completely unsafe to engage in some simulators; </li><li>  no fruit served for breakfast; </li><li>  the coffee in the dining room is of terrible quality; </li><li>  if you do not take a lounger by the pool or on the beach early in the morning, then later you simply will not find free space; </li><li>  not only in the hotel, but in the whole emirate, you will not be able to buy alcohol (and do not try to bring it with you, otherwise you will have problems with the law); </li><li>  despite the fact that when booking a service such as Wi-Fi appears to be free, you will be voiced a certain amount of payment at the time of check-in (do not hesitate to insist on your own); </li><li>  breakfast at the hotel is very expensive, and therefore it is recommended to eat in the surrounding cafes and restaurants, where prices are almost half lower; </li><li>  the bathrooms have a lot of mold and there is a terrible smell of dampness; </li><li>  It is highly recommended not to take complex meals, because for a lot of money you will be fed daily with the same meager assortment of dishes; </li><li>  the restaurant has a very powerful air conditioning, and therefore you have to wear warm sweaters; </li><li>  Due to the proximity of the port to the sea, garbage often floats, and water can emit an unpleasant odor; </li><li>  insufficient number of beach towels; </li><li>  several times a week in the pool swimming classes for local children, which occupy the entire space; </li><li>  from entertainments for children only the playground is provided; </li><li>  Considering that the rules and laws in the emirate are very strict, you should not count on vivid entertainment and cheerful animation; </li><li>  it is very strange that tea and coffee are served for breakfast in the restaurant for free, but you have to pay for ordinary drinking water; </li><li>  on weekends, a lot of local guests come to the hotel who behave quite noisily; </li><li>  beach workers behave very shamelessly with guests - about an hour before closing time they can come up and remove the umbrella, not paying attention to you. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Quite often, tourists choose such an option for accommodation and recreation as the Sharjah Carlton Hotel.  The UAE is characterized by strict rules regarding alcohol and noisy entertainment, and therefore you should not count on having too much fun.  This hotel is more likely for family vacations, as well as for people who just want to spend time in a relaxed atmosphere. </p><p>  Special attention deserves the private beach <span>of the Sharjah</span> Carlton Hotel (Sharjah).  It is strewn with white sand, and the water is quite clean and warm.  But everything changes when large vessels pass by.  Given the proximity of the port, you should be prepared for the fact that all the products of its vital activity will be in the water.  Fortunately, there is a pool. </p><p>  It should be noted that the contingent of vacationers at the Sharjah Carlton Hotel (UAE, Sharjah) is quite multinational.  But if you evaluate the attitude of the staff towards Arab tourists, you will notice that it is clearly better than to everyone else.  For the same money, they are provided with much better food than any other guest.  In addition, they come in very large delegations, flooding the beach and pool.  But given that the hotel Arabs rest only on weekends, you can well devote this time to excursions. </p>
