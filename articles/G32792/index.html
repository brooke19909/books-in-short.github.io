Technical specifications and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  All smartphones that are positioned as protected have a different degree of protection - the ability to withstand one or another impact factor.  This characteristic is measured by a numerical indicator that comes after the letters IP.  For example, the most popular formats are 67 and 68. </p><p>  According to the technical descriptions, the IP68-protected phone is able to withstand dust inside the case (this is considered the highest degree of protection).  According to the second figure, we can say how much the device is ‚Äúafraid‚Äù of contact with water.  Speaking about IP68, it should be noted: such gadgets can be immersed to a great depth (over 10 meters) without harm to the filling of the device. </p><p>  In this article, we will review phones that have just this degree of protection.  Also, those gadgets that are equipped with a more capacious battery than other batteries will be selected.  This determines the duration of the smartphone, its endurance. </p><p>  Therefore, in the review we will consider some of the most interesting models, after which we will draw the appropriate conclusions about them. </p><h2>  Snopow m8 </h2><p>  The phone that we present to you first of all, cannot be called a technological novelty or some stylish multifunctional smartphone.  The device has indicators quite usual for its class of devices, expressed in a display resolution of 960 x 540 pixels and a clock frequency of four 1.2 GHz processor cores.  In this case, we have IP68: a phone with a 3000 mAh battery, the capacity of which is enough for a decent time. </p>

    <p>  With such a device, it‚Äôs not scary to go camping, travel through the woods, mountains or go down in a kayak - it does not threaten him, since the case is securely soldered and ‚Äúclad‚Äù in thick plastic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hummer h6 </h2><p>  Another <span>interesting gadget</span> that represents the category of ‚ÄúIP68 protected phones‚Äù is a smartphone with a rectangular design named after the legendary SUV. </p><p>  It also has a powerful battery (3500 mAh), but a weaker processor.  On the one hand, as a result of this, performance is seriously affected (according to reviews, on the Hummer H6 there is no way to smoothly launch applications and games ‚Äúcongested‚Äù with graphics).  On the other hand, the physical characteristics of this IP68-protected phone are excellent. </p><h2>  Lamborghini v12 </h2><p>  Another phone, named after a well-known car, which meets high safety requirements, has a very thin case, sheathed with metal.  Because of this, the developers failed to install a more capacious battery here than 2500 mAh. </p>

    <p>  Nevertheless, even with it, the phone can last quite a long time due to a specially developed system of charge consumption, which allows it to be saved. </p><p>  The rest is a regular smartphone from China, which has 4 cores with a frequency of 1.5 GHz, equipped with a display with a resolution of 720 x 1280 pixels, as well as a camera with an 8 megapixel sensor.  We could not find feedback on the stability of his work. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Mann zug3 </h2><p>  This gadget has slightly simpler characteristics.  It is made in the design familiar to this class of devices, combining 3 color combinations: gray, black and yellow.  The protection class here, of course, is IP68.  The phone has a 2950 mAh battery, which will last for several days on a single charge, especially considering the not so powerful processor (Adeno 302 for 4 cores with a frequency of 1.2 GHz). </p>

    <p>  The phone also has a housing made in plastic and rubber, however, it has a high degree of impact resistance.  We can say that this is a worthy alternative to the <span>Nokia 1100</span> from the world of smartphones. </p><h2>  Land rover xs </h2><p>  This section is about one of the flagship devices of the XS modification, released under the name Land Rover.  The model has a processor for 8 cores with a frequency of 1.7 GHz each.  This means that in terms of performance the device can compete even with unprotected phones of ‚Äúcivilian‚Äù use. </p><p>  In addition to complete isolation from moisture and dust, the smartphone can also show high-quality assembly.  According to the reviews dedicated to the gadget, the quality of fitting parts to one another here is quite high, given the by no means low cost of the smartphone. </p><h2>  BlackView BV5000 </h2><p>  This generally unknown, but quite interesting manufacturer from China may be of interest to the domestic public.  The phone has nothing original in its appearance: it is ‚Äúwrapped‚Äù in all the same black and orange colors. </p>

    <p>  Its peculiarity lies not in the fact that it is part of the ‚ÄúIP68 indestructible flagship phones with a powerful battery‚Äù group.  Of course, he was not the flagship of Samsung, but of the unknown manufacturer BV.  Therefore, counting on some superpowers is also not worth it. </p><p>  The gadget has a very powerful 4780 mAh battery.  With them, the device can last longer than others. </p><h2>  No.1 M2 </h2><p>  You may not have heard of the No.1 brand.  This is a Chinese manufacturer of some copies that successfully disperse in the territory of the CIS countries, like hot cakes. </p><p>  The company has released its IP68 compliant telephone.  It looks unoriginal, but it is perfectly and reliably protected from any external influence. </p><p>  The smartphone has a lot of technical ‚Äúlotions‚Äù in the form of a powerful 13-megapixel camera, 1 GB of RAM, various sensors and sensors. </p><h2>  Jeep z6 </h2><p>  This smartphone should be remembered if you want to continue the ‚Äúautomotive‚Äù theme.  Of course, the name of the device does not mean that it has anything to do with car manufacturers.  This is just a successful marketing move that still works. </p>
