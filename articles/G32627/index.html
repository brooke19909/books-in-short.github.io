    <h2>  Not everywhere </h2><p>  It should be noted right away: most of the fees to the state treasury are regional in nature.  That is, they are not regulated by the Tax Code.  And the rules for their collection are established by each subject of the Russian Federation separately. </p><p>  Therefore, one cannot just say so whether there are benefits to pensioners in relation to the payment of taxes.  Much depends on your region of residence.  Somewhere older people are completely exempted from these payments, in some places they are given a discount.  And sometimes there are no concessions at all.  So the solution to this issue will have to deal with each region separately.  But there are some general rules that apply to the entire territory of the Russian Federation.  Benefits on property tax for pensioners have a number of features.  Knowing them, you can easily find the answer to the question posed before us. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Disability </h2><p>  So, the first thing you need to pay attention to the most common case.  Older people are most often recognized as disabled.  And people with disabilities in Russia have concessions, and regardless of age.  But he, of course, is also taken into account. </p><p>  The thing is that benefits for pensioners with disabilities in this situation are provided.  If you have a disability of 1 or 2 groups, then most likely you will be completely exempted from paying property contributions to the state treasury.  In most regions, this is exactly the rule. </p><p>  But people with disabilities of the 3rd group can only hope for certain discounts in respect of property tax fees.  The maximum that such citizens are entitled to is 50% of the benefits of the total payment.  If you think about it, these are also very good conditions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="property tax payment" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1195650.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Military and veterans </h2><p>  <span>Payment of property tax, as it</span> has already become known, is mandatory for all taxpayers.  But pensioners here have their own characteristics and benefits.  Not always, but very often. </p><p>  The next category of beneficiaries is veterans and people who participated in the hostilities, also equated to them categories.  Such citizens receive <span>property tax</span> benefits <span>.</span>  <span>For pensioners</span> who belong to this category, quite often there is a complete exemption from property contributions.  It is still difficult to find at least 1 region where this opportunity is ignored.  However, in reality, such a benefit is not used too often.  All this is due to the fact that there are few citizens belonging to this group of persons.  But there is still a discount, and this is a fact. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Transport </h2><p>  Benefits on property tax for pensioners can be different.  Just like the corresponding contributions.  The type of payments plays an important role in considering the question posed to us today.  What about the tax "levies" in relation to vehicles? </p>

    <p>  In general, the payment of property tax of this type is always and by all, without exception.  Unless some categories of beneficiaries (veterans, military, disabled people, employees, repairing roads) are completely exempt from it.  Pensioners, oddly enough, get a discount.  But no more than that.  For a complete <span>exemption from the transport tax, you</span> will have to have a low-powered vehicle in the property.  In this case, the exact conditions in each subject of the Russian Federation are established separately.  After all, the transport tax is regional in nature. </p><p>  How much should pensioners pay for their cars?  Most often, a privilege is provided for them, which allows not to pay up to 90% of the total amount of the fee.  It turns out that older people for transport to the tax authorities deduct only 10 percent of the accrued amount.  A good discount that works almost everywhere.  Although its exact dimensions will have to be clarified.  But you can rely on the above data. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Land </h2><p>  Move on.  Now it‚Äôs worth considering the land tax.  Often, people have land as property.  It‚Äôs no secret to anyone that you also have to pay for them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="benefits for pensioners" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1195647.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Land benefits are not provided to pensioners.  None at all.  That is, this means that the land tax in 2016 in Russia is the same for everyone.  Moreover, it is planned to increase it annually by 20% until 2020.  In this case, no discounts and concessions for the elderly are not provided.  And they do not plan to change such rules at all. </p><p>  Perhaps the land tax is one of the few moments in which all citizens are equal before the state.  So if suddenly one of the elderly offers to rewrite the land on it in order to exclude additional costs, they should not be trusted.  According to Russian laws, land tax in full is paid by all taxpayers without exceptions and discounts. </p><h2>  Income </h2><p>  This does not end there.  There is another tax on property of individuals.  Benefits for pensioners, as we found out, will not be provided in all cases.  What about the so-called income tax?  Do I need to pay it and in what amount? </p><p>  The answer here is unequivocal: yes, you need to pay the corresponding fee to the state treasury.  And in full.  In this case, a property tax return is filed within the time period established by law - until April 30.  That is, by this time, the senior citizen must declare the income received, record it and pay. </p><p>  How much will you have to give?  Like everyone - 13% of the amount received.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter if a pensioner works or not.  Whether he is engaged in his own business or simply decided to rid himself of some property and sold it.  In any case, income taxes are paid on the same terms by all citizens of the Russian Federation.  13% - neither more nor less.  Pension is not considered taxable income. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="land privilege for pensioners" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1195649.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Property </h2><p>  The last thing left is the so-called property tax.  Popularly, it is better known as property tax.  An annual payment for what you own.  For example, an apartment. </p><p>  There are benefits for property tax for senior citizens.  Elderly people are completely exempted from such payments in Russia.  Not everyone knows about this.  And therefore, tax authorities still send appropriate payments to pensioners from year to year, and they, in turn, pay them.  Doing so is not recommended.  After all, this is a direct violation of your rights. </p><p>  Remember: property benefits are provided in many cases.  But as soon as it comes to a fee for real estate for the elderly, you need to remember: such a payment is actually absent.  True, simply ignoring payment orders is not worth it.  This can bring you trouble and a lot of trouble.  The provision of property tax benefits occurs after contacting the tax office in your area.  What is required for this?  And is it possible to issue a refund if you paid this fee for some time? </p><h2>  About refund </h2><p>  The thing is that pensioners are able to return the money paid for property tax.  But only in compliance with certain rules.  For example, keep in mind that you cannot apply for full compensation for ‚Äúdamage‚Äù.  Money will be returned to you only for a period not exceeding 3 years.  If, for example, a pensioner paid 4 years for property for one reason or another, then the first funds will not be returned.  But over the past 36 months - quite. </p>

    <p>  If you have a property tax return, attach it to the application.  It is advisable to have such documents for each reporting period.  Also, in order to return money for a property tax, a pensioner must present: </p><ul><li>  statement (the reason for the appeal is written in it); </li><li>  all receipts for the last 3 years that you unknowingly paid; </li><li>  SNILS; </li><li>  pensioner's ID; </li><li>  passport; </li><li>  certificates confirming the ownership of the property; </li><li>  certificates for benefits (if any, not necessary, but desirable). </li></ul><p>  It's all.  You can then contact the appropriate organization for a refund.  It does not hurt to also have a separate bank account or provide details of an existing one.  On it you will be transferred as soon as possible excessively paid taxes.  And from now on, such receipts should no longer come to your address. </p><h2>  How to choose a benefit </h2><p>  It often happens that an elderly person has the right to apply for several tax benefits.  According to the law, he must necessarily declare his status as a beneficiary and choose only one type of discount.  What is required for this?  To the tax authorities provide: </p><ul><li>  passport of the Russian Federation; </li><li>  application for property tax relief (indicate which option is chosen); </li><li>  health certificates (to confirm, for example, disability); </li><li>  documents confirming the right to a discount; </li><li>  SNILS; </li><li>  pensioner's ID; </li><li>  retirement benefit statements; </li><li>  property documents. </li></ul>

    <p>  After that, your appeal will be considered.  And if you really have the right to benefits, they will be provided to you in the form that was chosen.  There is nothing difficult about this.  You just need to know your rights even in old age.  Then and only then no one will be able to deceive you and force you to pay non-applicable taxes. </p>
