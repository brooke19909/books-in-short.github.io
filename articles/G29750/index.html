Light Rail</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  We are all well aware of the tram as one of the forms of urban transport.  The history of its existence dates back almost two centuries.  Having appeared in 1828, trams gradually gained distribution in the world, and are still an integral part of the transport network of many cities.  Over the long years of its existence, this type of transport has constantly changed and improved.  Different types of trams appeared, among which were horse, electric, pneumatic and gas-powered.  Below we will consider in more detail the features of each of them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bbc.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="speed train" class="if uuid-2474005" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58617/2474005.jpg"></div><h2>  Equestrian </h2><p>  It is with the advent of the equestrian mode of urban transport (or horse tram) that the countdown of the history of the tram begins.  She is quite interesting and entertaining.  We will tell her in the article. </p><p>  The first tram was a closed or open carriage, harnessed by one or two horses, and sometimes mules or zebras, and moving on rails.  The coachman drove the horseback, and a conductor was also present, which (in addition to selling tickets to passengers) often helped the coachman in managing difficult road sections.  The first tram appeared in 1828 in the American Baltimore, and a few years later in other cities.  But this mode of transport got real popularity only after rails with gutters, not protruding above the road, were invented in 1852, and thus the horses stopped interfering with the movement of other vehicles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Already at the end of the XIX century horse trams became popular in Russia, moreover, two types of such vehicles were used in our country: one-story and two-story horses, the so-called imperials. </p><p>  But the heyday of Konka was short-lived.  Significant inconveniences in its use, for example, low speed, fatigue of horses and the need for their regular replacement, led to the fact that already in the late XIX - early XX centuries horse trams were replaced by electric trams in almost all major cities.  Moreover, this happened both in America and Europe, and in Russia. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tram history" class="if uuid-2474004" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58617/2474004.jpg"></div><h2>  Electric tram </h2><p>  The ideas that later laid the foundation for the creation of electric vehicles were voiced by Russian scientists back in the 1940s.  However, it took another half a century for these ideas to be implemented, only in 1892 the first electric tram was launched in Kiev.  Later they also appeared in Nizhny Novgorod, Moscow, St. Petersburg and other large cities.  A few years earlier, the first electric trams appeared in Europe.  But in general, we can talk about the almost simultaneous development and implementation of this type of transport in the Russian Empire and European countries.  This type of tram was characterized by a higher level of comfort and significantly higher speed compared to the horse tram. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Other types of this type of transport in history </h2><p>  A few more types of this urban transport are not widely used in the world.  So, for several decades in Paris there was a pneumatic tram.  The movement of the car was carried out by a pneumatic engine, and the compressed air was in special cylinders, the total supply of which was enough for a trip in both directions.  At the final station, gas cylinders were refilled with compressed air. </p><p>  In Russia (and later in the USSR), gas-powered trams existed in a number of cities.  Little information has been preserved about how they looked.  It is only known that they were trolleys without a roof, which were driven by light motor vehicles.  They did not get wide distribution, this is mainly due to the fact that the level of noise they create is many times higher than the permissible norms. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.railpage.org.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="first tram" class="if uuid-2474009" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58617/2474009.jpg"></div><h2>  20th century tram </h2><p>  Speaking about the fate of the tram in the XX century, it should be noted that during this period in its development there were both ups and downs.  The time from the beginning of the 20th century until the period between the First and Second World Wars is considered the so-called golden age of trams.  During this period, it gradually became almost the main form of urban transport.  Konki by this time had almost completely ceased to be used, and buses and cars had not yet received significant distribution.  However, already in the middle - at the end of the fifties, cars gradually began to replace trams on city streets.  Also by this time trolleybuses and buses began to make serious competition to this type of transport, the trips in which were much more comfortable, because the tram tracks were practically not repaired, so the traffic was no longer smooth and soft.  All this led to the decline of this type of urban transport. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Tram Rise </h2><p>  As the history of the tram says, its new ‚Äútakeoff‚Äù refers to the end of the seventies.  By this time, large-scale motorization led to such negative consequences as traffic jams, smog, lack of parking places.  All these factors led to the need to revise transport policy almost around the world, the advantages of the tram as an environmentally friendly mode of transport became obvious again.  In addition, the technical improvement of tram networks helped to reduce the number of cars and buses in cities, and this contributed to a decrease in the number of parking spaces and the emergence of more parks and squares. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãtram" class="if uuid-2474012" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58617/2474012.jpg"></div><h2>  Tram in the modern world </h2><p>  Nowadays, city trams not only continue to fulfill their direct function - transporting passengers on the established route, but can also be used for excursion purposes, to attract tourists or as an advertisement of a particular institution.  So, double-decker trams and convertible trams run through the streets, and in some cities they also serve as cafes or hotels. </p><p>  There are also trams used for technical and official purposes: for example, for repairing rail coverings or snow removal, for transporting goods. </p><h2>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãview </h2><p>  In a number of cities, <span>light trams</span> are widely used <span>.</span>  In general, any type of urban transport, the speed of which is or exceeds 24 km / h, is considered to be fast.  In practice, of course, the speed of modern trams can be several times faster.  So, in France, a light rail running between the city center and the airport can reach speeds of over 100 km in some sections of the track.  If we talk about our country, then, for example, a whole tram system was created in Volgograd, which includes 22 stations and partially passes underground to ensure the highest possible speed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nzhistory.govt.nz" data-author=": Alexander Turnbull Library, "><img itemprop="image" alt="types of trams" class="if uuid-2474030" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58617/2474030.jpg"></div><h2>  The most interesting trams in the world </h2><p>  The oldest operating tram in the world is Santa Teresa in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  Back in 1896 he was transferred from horsepower to electric traction, and since then has been driving through the city streets without any changes or improvements.  It is used to entertain tourists and conduct city tours. </p><p>  In Lisbon, you can ride on the so-called musical tram.  Traveling on it, tourists seem to be transferred to the past.  Like a hundred years ago, this tram is made of plywood, and throughout the journey, local performers create live music.  If the passenger wants to leave, he must pull the special cable located on top. </p><p>  In the French Alps passes the highest mountain <span>tram route</span> in the world <span>.</span>  Tram rails were laid here at the beginning of the 20th century, then this road was used mainly for purely practical purposes, that is, for transporting peasants from one village to another.  At present, this is a very popular route among tourists, since a trip on such a tram allows you to see Alpine beauties with your own eyes, and the highest point of the route is at an altitude of almost two and a half kilometers above sea level. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dailysabah.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="electric tram" class="if uuid-2474047" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58617/2474047.jpg"></div><h2>  Tram Museums </h2><p>  As discussed above, over the years of its existence, the tram has undergone many changes, one of its appearance was replaced by another.  The history of the tram is unusually interesting, therefore, both in Russia and in the world there are a number of museums of this type and electric transport in general.  One of them is located in Nizhny Novgorod.  This is no coincidence, because it is the Nizhny Novgorod tram that is considered the first in Russia.  The museum has a significant number of trams and trolleybuses, and since the museum is aimed at families with children, all the exhibits here can be touched and examined very carefully. </p><p>  Another museum of the history of trams and trolleybuses is located in Yekaterinburg; its opening was timed to coincide with the 275th anniversary of the city.  It details the history of the creation of urban electric vehicles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ymtram.mashke.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tram history" class="if uuid-2474054" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58617/2474054.jpg"></div><p>  As for the museums of the history of the tram abroad, an interesting organization dedicated to this type of transport is located in Amsterdam.  The museum features about 60 wagons brought from several European countries and belonging to different eras of the existence of this mode of transport.  In order to fully experience the atmosphere, here you definitely need to ride in an old carriage, the route of which passes all the main attractions of the city.  At the same time, the smallest tourists are also allowed to actively ‚Äúhelp‚Äù the movement of the tram: for example, call stops and ring the bell.  Another service the museum provides is the rental of historic cars for weddings, graduations and just photo shoots, which is very popular among locals and visitors. </p>
