  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to choose a radar detector</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  How to choose a radar detector, and what is its difference from a radar detector?  You should distinguish between these two, of course, different devices.  The principle of operation of the radar detector is the passive reception of the incoming signal, eliminating the possibility of its suppression.  That is, such devices act as a signaling device, warning the user about the reception of signals of those ranges to which he is currently configured.  Such devices are approved for use in Russia. </p><p>  The radar detector, in turn, is a device for actively counteracting the <span>types of radiation</span> to which it is tuned.  The specific impact of this device is contrary to the laws of the Russian Federation and is not subject to free sale to private individuals.  In fact, what is on sale in the Russian Federation, in fact, is a radar detector, but many still call it a radar detector. </p><p>  So, what should I look for before choosing a radar detector?  First of all, you need to consider the number of ranges in which the device has the ability to work.  Preferably, the operating ranges are as large as possible.  These characteristics will ensure the most efficient operation of your radar detector. </p><p>  There is also one more important criterion on which the operational efficiency of the device directly depends - this is the ability to filter signals.  This is necessary so that the device can distinguish signals from different sources, such as portable radios, door open sensors and other similar sources.  Another rather important point is the detector design, also before choosing a radar detector you should pay attention to various auxiliary accessories, such as a watch, compass and other similar technical accessories. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Different types of devices may vary depending on the type of mount and installation method.  The radar detector should be installed as high as possible.  The higher it is installed, the more its radius of action and the ability to pick up a signal at maximum distances will increase. </p><p>  Before you choose a radar detector and purchase it, you must take into account all of the above factors, so that in the future the device does not disappoint you.  The operating instructions for the radar detector will help you to understand in more detail the connection methods and the capabilities of the purchased device. </p><p>  Based on the capabilities and multifunctional characteristics, the cost of this device is determined.  The minimum price threshold is about fifty dollars, and the highest bar for this category of gadgets is a thousand or more dollars.  As is the case with any other product, not always the presence of a high price determines high quality and a guarantee of reliable uninterrupted operation of the device. </p><p>  For relatively little money, there is the opportunity to purchase a combined navigator device with a DVR and a radar detector, which will cost you a very modest amount of about nine thousand rubles.  Some firms offer models at even more modest prices of the order of four to five thousand rubles.  Such devices can also provide detailed information about the direction, route, and other necessary data in the recording playback mode.  Some of them have a function that helps you drive safely through unfamiliar intersections and difficult interchanges.  This function acts in such a way that when approaching such a dangerous section of the road, the data on the screen of the DVR and navigator are provided in a separate image mode: on one part of the display, the route continues to be displayed, and on the other part of the display a photorealistic image of this section of the road surface is displayed. </p><p>  These and other similar functions are designed to facilitate the life of the driver, to make driving on the roads safer and more comfortable. </p>
