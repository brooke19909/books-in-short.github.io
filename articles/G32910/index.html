High quality construction, affordable prices per square meter - this is what attracts potential buyers of real estate.  The project has already been put into operation, respectively, the first tenants have already managed to make up their minds and express it in reviews.  We will talk about how comfortable, thoughtful and successful the project was in the framework of this material.  The reviews of the first residents will be an excellent information base and will ensure the objectivity of the review. </p><h2>  about the project </h2><p>  MKR  "Amber" in Balashikha is a project of the leading developer of Moscow and Moscow Region - PIK Group of Companies.  21 business-class buildings from 14 to 25 floors are being built using panel and block technology.  At the moment, all houses are commissioned and put into operation.  The best specialists worked on the project, which became a guarantee of the impeccability of its construction. </p><div class="photo" data-original="irecommend.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amber microdistrict balashikha" class="if uuid-3164076" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3164076.jpg"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  For construction, a site was chosen near the Shchelkovo highway, which is part of Balashikha.  Only 2.5 km from MKAD, and you are in the microdistrict.  Currently, this is a promising direction, allowing residents to feel all the charms of suburban life, having the opportunity, if necessary, to get to any point in the capital in the shortest time period. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.8267417" data-lng="37.897314800000004" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="11"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/6/0/6/5/16065.png"></div><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  When planning the construction of the Amber microdistrict in Balashikha, the developer wanted to make it accessible to various categories of citizens.  You can get to the new buildings by personal transport, along the Shchelkovo highway.  If you do not have a car, this is not a problem in this case, because in the direction of the microdistrict, there are enough public transport routes that run with enviable regularity according to the timetable to the nearest metro station Shchelkovskaya, located just 6 km away, and the railway station. </p><div class="photo" data-original="smorovoz.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="apartments in microdistrict amber balashikha" class="if uuid-3164080" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3164080.jpg"></div><p>  Yes, the Shchelkovo highway is currently quite busy, so traffic jams accumulate on it during rush hour.  But md.  "Amber" in Balashikha is located only 2.5 km from the ring road, so temporary losses will be minimal.  In addition, the Shchelkovo highway is currently under reconstruction. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  The issue of environmental conditions is relevant for every modern resident of the complex.  In the suburbs, a huge number of undeveloped sites that previously occupied urban landfills, industrial enterprises.  So now they are being actively built up, and potential unsuspecting tenants are then forced to suffer from unpleasant odors. </p><p>  "Amber" in Balashikha is a pleasant exception.  The proximity to the Losiny Ostrov national park, the largest in Moscow, in this case affected the environmental situation.  The park is just 300 meters away.  On the other hand, the microdistrict is surrounded by the Gorensky forest park with its famous lakes.  The first residents of new buildings have already appreciated such a neighborhood, the forest belt has become for them a place for regular walks and outdoor recreation.  Perhaps, excellent ecology is the main feature of the project that sets it apart from the rest.  This is a great place for a quality life. </p><p>  The only drawback is the proximity to the Moscow Ring Road, which affects the noise level. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="g balashikha md amber" class="if uuid-3164077" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3164077.jpg"></div><h2>  Infrastructure  Amber </h2><p>  Balashikha is a district with developed and already existing infrastructure: within walking distance there are several kindergartens and comprehensive schools, clinics, medical centers, residents are certainly not deprived of food stores, which are presented in sufficient abundance, as well as service organizations.  But the developer went even further and was able to please his admirers with their own infrastructure, being erected simultaneously with residential buildings.  There is a kindergarten and a school, in which children of all residents received places. </p><h2>  Beautification </h2><p>  The area around the buildings is well-maintained: equipped with playgrounds and sports grounds, places for walking and outdoor recreation.  There is an underground and guest parking with a sufficient number of parking spaces.  Landscaping works do not stop to this day: new trees and shrubs are planted regularly, which in the near future will solve the problem of proximity to the ring road. </p><h2>  Apartments, layouts </h2><p>  Apartments "Amber" in Balashikha are represented by a variety of planning solutions.  At the choice of residents were offered one-, two- and three-room options ranging from 37 to 99 square meters.  The apartments are presented without finishing, but optionally, at the request of the client, a number of apartments were finished on a turnkey basis.  If we talk about the opinions of residents, they focus on the impeccable quality of all repair work, as well as the variety of design projects presented. </p><div class="photo" data-original="avaho.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amber microdistrict balashikha" class="if uuid-3164088" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3164088.jpg"></div><p>  Bright and spacious apartments in the neighborhood immediately attracted the attention of potential buyers.  Tired of the cramped, dark and completely uncomfortable Khrushchevs, Soviet-built apartments, modern Muscovites, finally, wanted to improve the level and quality of life. </p><p>  All apartments have rather large kitchens, where you can place not only a set with the necessary equipment, but also provide a place for lunch and dinner with households and guests.  Isolated rooms, an additional bathroom and a wardrobe allow you to competently organize the space, using every square meter of area.  In order to verify this, it is enough to personally visit the facility.  All apartments are equipped with high-quality double-glazed windows of European manufacture, metal entrance doors, as well as modern radiators with temperature regulators, which allow maintaining the optimal microclimate in the room. </p><h2>  Opinion of residents </h2><p>  In order to understand how it turned out md.  "Amber" in Balashikha, you should get acquainted with the reviews that the residents themselves leave.  During their stay, they already managed to make up their minds, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of the project. </p><p>  So, the construction of a new microdistrict was started by Morton Group of Companies, and later, after the merger, it passed into the hands of PIK Group of Companies.  According to residents, it was this mark in history that favorably affected the complex, because it was commissioned and put into operation on time, without delay.  The developer managed to develop the infrastructure of the complex and the entire district as a whole, creating the most favorable conditions for each resident. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bonton.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amber Balashikha" class="if uuid-3164086" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3164086.jpg"></div><p>  Residents attribute the location to the advantages of the project, namely the proximity to the MKAD road junction and the proximity to a posh national park.  The thoughtfulness of the plans is also impressive: the developer managed to translate into reality the ideas of modern Muscovites about really comfortable housing, where each family member has his own personal space.  Spacious bright rooms, an additional bathroom in three-room apartments are what many residents focus on. </p><p>  Speaking about the shortcomings, I still want to note the not the most rosy situation on the Shchelkovo highway and regular traffic jams that complicate life.  The train station and metro are quite far away, which also causes a number of inconveniences to residents. </p><div class="photo" data-original="novostroyki.flatfy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amber Balashikha microdistrict" class="if uuid-3164083" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3164083.jpg"></div><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Apartments in md.  Amber Balashikha is an excellent option for those who are looking for comfortable housing at an affordable price.  At the moment, all the houses are commissioned and put into operation, but if you wish, you can purchase an apartment with repair and furniture.  Be sure to personally visit the neighborhood in order to form your own opinion regarding it. </p>
