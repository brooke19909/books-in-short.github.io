    <h2>  Practical information </h2><p>  Finding the Finnish Dacha tourist complex is very simple: it is located 30 km from Gorno-Altaysk.  On the Chuysky tract, you need to drive to the village of Souzga, drive it and the new bridge and after 700 m turn right at the KiwiLodge sign, then turn right again through the wooden bridge.  For more detailed information, you can refer to the website of the base, where the interactive map is located. </p>
