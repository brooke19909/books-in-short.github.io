How to make mimosa from beads?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  How to decorate a house?  <span>Ornamental trees,</span> which can be made of fabric, polystyrene, satin ribbons, shells, coffee beans and other improvised materials <span>,</span> are best suited.  Today's workshop will be devoted to beaded topiary.  For beginners, it is best to start with a simple job, so this will be a mimosa from beads. </p><h2>  What do you need for work? </h2><p>  For any craft, you need to buy beads, thin and thick wire, threads, glue, decorative trifles, alabaster or gypsum.  If you plan a large thing, with a height of 15-30 centimeters and above, it is better to choose beads, bugles, large beads.  If the product is less than 20 centimeters, then pay attention to small beads. </p><p>  Use a thin wire for branches, and for a trunk and branches - thick, which is sold in different colors.  When purchasing material under the <span>crown of a tree, you</span> do not need to spend money on decorative threads and ribbons.  If there is no thick wire, then mimosa from beads is made using thin wires, threads, sticks and alabaster mixture.  The trunk is then painted with gouache and coated with colorless varnish. </p><p>  For weaving plants, you can buy cheap Thai beads.  Uneven material in this case will play a positive role.  The combination of different shades, transparent and opaque beads creates the effect of both sun glare and shadow areas of trees.  You can not make a tree, but weave huge branches of mimosa in a vase or basket.  In this case, only wire and beads are needed. </p><h2>  How to make mimosa from beads? </h2><p>  For a small tree, take a bag of yellow and green beads (about 150 grams each), thin <span>copper wire</span> (sold 30 meters each), thick wire for branches, green or brown threads, ordinary PVA glue, alabaster, gouache, varnish, wood form . </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bead mimosa" class="if" height="419" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/368256.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To make flowers, string yellow beads onto a thin wire.  Then step back from the edge of 10 centimeters, take one bead and twist the wire by 1 centimeter.  Then twist the end with beads at a distance of a centimeter again with one bead.  Thus, on the 10-centimeter left segment, you build up yellow mimosins.  Make them in a chaotic manner, creating lush branches. </p><p>  Weave the leaves according to the same principle, only leave 15 centimeters from the edge, and make twisting from 20 beads that create a petal.  On one branch, make the maximum number of petals.  Mimosa from beads will be more magnificent if there are a lot of branches. </p><p>  Next, tightly wind the branches of flowers with leaves of 5 pieces.  Then you collect them into a whole tree.  For the trunk, you can take a thick wire. </p><h2>  The final stage of the master class </h2><p>  We continue to work on mimosa.  Put a tree in a pot and fill it with alabaster diluted with water (1: 1).  For the trunk, add glue to this mixture and cover it, creating bumps in the bark with a toothpick.  Now it remains only to paint and varnish, and the mimosa from the beads is ready!  By the way, the pot can be decorated with paper, cloth, shells, coffee grains and other material. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mimosa beadwork" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/368257.jpg?1396783970729" width="600"></div>

Instead of alabaster, you can take gypsum.  Up the pot you can decorate with grass from beads or strings, with different buttons in the form of ladybirds, butterflies, flowers. </p><h2>  A simple version of weaving topiary </h2><p>  If you look at the photo of the mimosa, you will see a tree and a bush.  The tree has a lush crown, and the flowers interrupt the leaves.  And in shrubs, on the contrary, the green color interrupts yellow, since the flowers are visible on the top.  Therefore, for different purposes, make a different number of flowers and leaves. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make mimosa from beads" class="if" height="307" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/368264.jpg?1396784053744" width="305"></div>

    <p>  To create lush flower branches, the following method is suitable: </p><ul><li>  cut a thin wire 30 cm long; </li><li>  string 5 beads; </li><li>  fold the wire in half and twist it by 3-5 mm; </li><li>  Now on each side you string 5 beads and make similar petals; </li><li>  lift the resulting flowers up and adjust the shape. </li></ul><p>  Such branches then connect to each other, creating different forms.  The result is a natural mimosa from beads.  The layout of the leaves is almost the same as in the first method.  Just take 50 cm of wire and string beads on it (about 15 cm), twist at the base, getting a petal.  Now you simply twist it, creating relief forms. </p><p>  Since the wire is bent in half, then on both sides make similar petals, only of different sizes (10, 8 cm).  Collect the resulting flowers and leaves in a tree or branches. </p><h2>  <span>Beadwork:</span> mimosa in a basket </h2><p>  In this technique, we make leaves like fir needles.  That is, we string 10 beads on a wire, and we stretch the second end through the last bead, twist a little and also make the second leaf.  The more you make such needles, the more magnificent the branch.  This method is convenient in that the leaves can be given any shape. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mimosa bead pattern" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/368260.jpg?1396784129977" width="400"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  We make flowers from thin beads with loops, as in the second version, only on each end of the wire we create 5-6 or more loops next to round the very first flowers.  In this method, more magnificent and miniature flowers are obtained. </p><p>  Flowers gather in long inflorescences, which are tightly wrapped with a thread in the <span>color of a tree.</span>  You can alternate branches with flowers and leaves or mimosa overlay with greens only from below.  After creating a whole bouquet (if necessary, the ends of the branches are twisted into a long loop for the stability of the composition), insert it into a decorative basket.  Hands adjust the direction of the branches. </p><h2>  Mimosa branches made of beads </h2><p>  In this embodiment, the flowers are looped.  5 beads are strung on a meter wire, which are twisted by 7 mm.  Then retreat about a centimeter and again twist 5 beads.  Continue twisting in this pattern.  Then find the middle, hold the petal and twist the branch, spreading the petals on opposite sides. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mimosa bead weaving pattern" class="if" height="210" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/368323.jpg?1396784967611" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Leaves can be created in any way.  Consider two more weaving methods.  In the first version, create "spruce" branches, in the second - leaf-shaped.  Which option is better, proceed from the kind of bead mimosa you need. </p><p>  Master class on making "spruce" leaves: </p><ul><li>  string the bead </li><li>  bend the wire in half </li><li>  thread both ends through the beads and the bead, </li><li>  spread the ends of the wire in different directions, </li><li>  string on each side a bead and bugles, </li><li>  string 2 beads through both ends of the wire, </li><li>  spread the ends of the wire and repeat the whole process again. </li></ul><p>  Leaf-like branches are made in the same way as looped flowers from 5 beads, only from a wire of 30 centimeters. </p><h2>  The basic rules of weaving beads </h2><ul><li>  Buy all the material at once so that you don‚Äôt get distracted from the process. </li><li>  Arrange the beads in cups to make it convenient to take. </li><li>  For plants, you can buy ragged Thai beads, bugles, beads. </li><li>  Make jewelry from Czech even beads. </li><li>  Combine different shades of the same color to create <span>sun glare.</span> </li><li>  For branches in a vase, take large beads and beads. </li><li>  Miniature topiary is best made from small beads. </li><li>  For the trunk, take a few pieces of thick wire of different lengths. </li><li>  Fasten the branches tightly with a thread. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mimosa bead master class" class="if" height="316" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/368274.jpg?1396785026721" width="236"></div></li></ul><p>  From the proposed methods, select one technique to get a harmonious plant.  Otherwise, unnatural mimosa from beads will turn out.  Weaving patterns can be found in needlework magazines, but the work process is clearly described in the above article. </p>
