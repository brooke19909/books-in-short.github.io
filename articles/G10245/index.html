Top paid games on Android can easily be downloaded from PlayMarket and installed on a mobile device.  The more powerful the phone model, the more pleasant the user will get from the project. </p><h2>  General information </h2><p>  Entertainment applications have become part of everyday life.  There are times when you need to do something to kill time, but not everyone is comfortable buying a powerful PC to enjoy the product of a well-known developer.  This article will feature the best paid games on Android or iOS. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.washingtonpost.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Top 10 paid games on Android" class="if uuid-3029166" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/3029166.jpg"></div><h2>  This war of mine </h2><p>  The simulator of survival in a military conflict from the company 11 bit studios.  Only the player has to see the other side of the coin: they have to manage not a detachment of brave warriors who destroy the enemy left and right, but a group of civilians who have taken refuge from the horrors of war in the nearest dilapidated building. </p><p>  The project was included in the list of the best paid games on Android almost immediately after the release.  Its cost is approximately 800 rubles without discounts.  There is no paid content or advertising; upon the release of updates, it is enough to simply reinstall the application. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The plot is based on real events (the war in Serbia), the player will have to get food, ammunition and materials for the repair of the shelter - to prevent any member of the group from dying. </p><p>  The mobile application has a number of scenarios to choose from.  Two or three people are given at the start.  During the game, other survivors may come to ask for asylum, so the number of members of the squad is compensated. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="wWB4Yhu0p3U" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWB4Yhu0p3U" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/3/3/6/3/13363.jpg"></div><p>  It is important to monitor the psychological state of survivors: desperate people can do stupid things: get drunk, fight, run away or take their own lives. </p><p>  Increased difficulty - the game is one survivor at the start.  At night, it‚Äôs better to take all the necessary items for sorties, otherwise everything will be stolen by looters. </p><p>  Each of the survivors has unique features that must be considered in order to survive.  According to reviews, the game received a lot of positive ratings, thanks to a well-thought-out psychological component.  In many situations, you have to make a deal with conscience, make difficult decisions and live with the consequences. </p><p>  Negative reviews are a minority and they note the monotony and lack of multiplayer.  Of course, further development would not hurt the project, but the developers, apparently, all efforts were directed to another product.  Nevertheless, This War of Mine remains one of the best paid games on Android. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.godisageek.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Top 10 paid games on Android" class="if uuid-3029170" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/3029170.jpg"></div><h2>  The Room: Old Sins </h2><p>  A popular series of puzzles on a smartphone, where the user requires maximum care and the ability to notice little things.  Installed from PlayMarket for 399 rubles. </p><p>  The action takes place in a mansion in the attic of which a dollhouse was discovered.  It is necessary to find a valuable artifact that caused the disappearance of the famous engineer and his wife, a socialite. </p><p>  Each room is a portal to a different location, filled with puzzles and tips.  The game attracts with uplifting music and an amazing atmosphere, players leave only positive comments about it. </p><p>  Negative reviews indicate that it is short and does not have a Russian version.  Nevertheless, the game was in the top of the best paid games on Android. </p><div class="photo" data-original="igamestalk.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Top best paid games on Android" class="if uuid-3029174" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/3029174.jpg"></div><h2>  ZONA Project X </h2><p>  The project will appeal to fans of the post-apocalyptic universe of STALKER or Metro 2033.  The action takes place in the future, where most of the world's population is destroyed by radiation. </p><p>  Monsters, mutants, a wonderful plot and graphics - this is why the project was in the top of paid games on Android: 10 rubles and above (you can often see a discount) in PlayMarket. </p><p>  The game received many positive reviews thanks to an interesting idea and high-quality execution. </p><p>  There are few negative reviews: I don‚Äôt like the lack of an automatic health replenishment system, a free trial version and inconvenient controls. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gamesoftapk.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The best paid games on Android" class="if uuid-3029189" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/3029189.jpg"></div><h2>  Assasin's creed identity </h2><p>  The first mobile application for fans of the same name game, fully conveying the atmosphere and gameplay of the original.  Big cities of the Renaissance, RPG elements and dizzying acrobatic stunts - a pass to the top paid games on Android. </p><p>  Users gave 169 rubles for the application and were satisfied thanks to the graphics, gameplay, good physics and optimization. </p><p>  The disadvantages, according to reviews, lie in the high system requirements.  Still, such a dynamic application requires an expensive mobile device.  More profitable to purchase a PC. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidplanet.nl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The best paid games on Android" class="if uuid-3029203" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/3029203.jpg"></div><h2>  GTA Liberty City Stories </h2><p>  And this is a gift to fans of Grand Theft Auto, the action takes place in the town of Liberty City.  The project is characterized by high-quality textures, perfectly adapted for the smartphone.  It costs 529 rubles in PlayMarket. </p><p>  The player will control a former fighter of the Leone criminal family, who is hiding from revenge for the death of an influential mafia.  The city is in chaos due to the redistribution of spheres of influence by various gangs. </p><p>  Tony Kopiani is trying to regain the power of the Leone family, but he is interrupted by distraught murderers, greedy capitalists, hired killers and even close relatives. </p><p>  The game received positive reviews from gamers who were fond of the older versions of the project, which was released on a PC or PSP. </p><p>  Negative reviews suggest that, in the end, the project is obsolete and valued only by the above category of people. </p><div class="photo" data-original="squarefaction.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Top paid games on Android" class="if uuid-3029215" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/3029215.jpg"></div><h2>  Verdict </h2><p>  Top paid games on Android often change.  There are two ways to profit from mobile applications: selling paid applications or introducing shareware versions with an abundance of monetized actions and paid content. </p><p>  Paid applications combine the features of classic PC games, so for those who can‚Äôt afford to buy expensive hardware, this is a good way to spend time with pleasure. </p><p>  New gaming applications appear frequently, sometimes they get lost in the general information flow, therefore it is reasonable to follow the top of paid games on Android or iOS so as not to miss an interesting release. </p><p>  Online project developers often release mobile versions of products to expand their audience.  There are also interesting releases that deserve attention.  They have paid access or part of the content, thoughtful functionality and methods of interaction between players in multiplayer mode. </p><p>  Have a good time and don‚Äôt forget to follow the top of paid games on Android so as not to miss an interesting novelty. </p>
