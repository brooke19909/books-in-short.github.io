But how do you sometimes want to "dilute" the rich impressions of the canals of Venice and the museums of Verona and Trento with a simple beach holiday!  Where to plunge into this notorious atmosphere of the Italian ‚ÄúDolce Far Niento‚Äù (sweet idleness)?  For this, there are cities such as Caorle.  Italy offers travelers not only sightseeing, but also beach vacations.  And in some places you can enjoy both of these pleasures in one resort - such as Caorle.  This city, which now numbers less than twelve thousand inhabitants, is located in the Veneto region.  And it‚Äôs convenient to go here to relax after a busy excursion program in Venice, Verona or Trieste.  What to see in Caorle?  What beaches are better to go to?  Which hotel to choose for your stay?  All these issues will be covered in our article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Caorle Italy" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2005232.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is Caorle </h2><p>  Administratively, the city belongs to the province and region of Veneto.  Thus, the main city nearby is Venice.  But Caorle in Italy is not such an outback.  This city is the main one in the municipality of the same name.  It is fifty kilometers from Venice.  The city of thousands of canals and bridges is located southwest of Caorle.  Well, the capital of all Italy, Rome, lies 420 kilometers to the south.  Caorle is located in the northeast of the province, and near the city passes the administrative border with another region of Italy - Friuli Venezia Giulia.  So on occasion you can go and see the sights there.  However, Caorle has enough of its tourist spots.  If you came to the city for a couple of days, this will be enough to inspect them slowly and thoughtfully. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get to Caorle </h2><p>  The nearest airport is the one located near Venice.  But since its services are expensive, low-cost airlines flying to the north of Italy prefer to land in Treviso, Trieste or Verona.  Caorle has no <span>train station</span> .  Therefore, you need to get by train to the station of San Dona di Piave or the Venetian Mestre, and from there already follow the bus.  Organized tours to Caorle (Italy) also depart from Russia.  From Moscow, St. Petersburg, Sochi, Krasnodar and other cities fly charter flights with "package" tourists.  As a rule, such tours are divided into two parts: first, a rich excursion program with a visit to Venice, and then a few days at sea.  The cost of such trips starts from 36.5 thousand rubles for a ticket for a week.  Bus tours depart from Ukraine to Northern Italy.  Their cost varies between 110-200 euros for 5-7 days. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Caorle italy reviews" class="if" height="472" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2005233.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  When to go to Caorle </h2><p>  If you are interested in the historical and cultural attractions of the resort, then you can visit them at any time of the year.  And from late autumn to early spring it will cost you less, because it is believed that such a period is not a season.  But if you want to sunbathe and swim in the gentle waters of the Adriatic Sea, then the best time to visit Caorle (Italy) is the summer months.  You can swim in May.  The sea is shallow and warms up quickly.  September is also considered a good month to relax.  But you should be prepared for various surprises from the <span>Dolomites,</span> which are nearby.  Although the first month of autumn is usually dry and warm.  In October, rainfall may increase, and the sea - colder.  But when the sun peeks out, you are convinced that Caorle is heated by the rays of the hot Mediterranean sun. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Caorle italy photo" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2005231.jpg" width="600"></div>

The dense deciduous and coniferous forests along the coast are protected by the state.  In this conservation area it is impossible not only to make bonfires and stop in tents - even noisy water activities, such as water scooters, which can disturb the peace of the local fauna, are prohibited.  The most famous natural attraction is the Caorle lagoon (Italy).  Guides to the Veneto region adorn the photos of this scenic spot.  The cape can be reached with a small sightseeing ferry.  Needless to say, that in the protected area there are very clean beaches and the sea?  Swimming here is a pleasure.  There are a lot of fish and seafood in the clean lagoon of the Adriatic.  And the environmental friendliness of the area is reflected in the taste of these seafood.  On Saturdays, you can verify this yourself by visiting the market in the village of Duna Verde, which has already become a part of the resort town. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Caorle italy attractions" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2005224.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  General atmosphere </h2><p>  Holidays in Caorle (Italy) will appeal to those who are in love with the provincial, so to speak, typical Mediterranean.  The resort managed to create the image of a fishing village, although it is not.  Taverns on the shore, where open verandas are buried in flowers, old streets, multi-colored small houses - all this creates an unusual atmosphere of coziness, comfort and patriarchy.  The city is crossed by the picturesque Nic√®ssolo Canal, which is also a natural attraction and, to some extent, brings Caorle to Venice.  Deciduous and coniferous forests surround the resort from the north.  The salty sea breezes and volcanoes of Mediterranean pines fill the air with holiday aromas.  In Caorle, time seems to slow down.  I don‚Äôt feel like rushing anywhere, but I just want to stroll through the narrow streets or drink chianti on the terrace of the tavern, admiring the riot of colors of enchanting sunset. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Caorle italy city" class="if" height="237" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2005226.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  Caorle (Italy) is famous for its coast.  The resort‚Äôs beaches stretch for fifteen kilometers, capturing the territory of two villages - Duna Verde and Porto Santa Margherita.  The first village fully justifies its name - "Green Dune".  She looks like a blooming garden.  There is a weekly market in Madonetta Square that will delight all shopaholics.  But the greatest asset of Duna Verde is its beaches.  They are considered the best in the resort.  The village itself was founded in the 60s of the last century.  Now it is an elite village, built up with beautiful houses, among spacious golf courses.  Caorle, Duna Verde and Porto Santa Margherita are connected by a city bus.  The beaches here are comfortable, there is all the necessary infrastructure for recreation: toilets, showers, sunbeds and umbrellas, a first-aid post and lifeguards.  Soft sand attracts you to relax and indulge in ‚ÄúDolce Niento headlights‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Caorle Italy" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2005228.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Caorle (Italy) Attractions </h2><p>  But to devote the whole vacation to sweet doing nothing and beach bliss is still not worth it.  After all, Caorle has a glorious centuries-old history.  It was founded in the 1st century BC, and archaeologists find evidence of the existence of people from the Bronze Age on this site.  Caorle has always been an important strategic point that connected the Apennine Peninsula with the rest of Europe.  All the narrow streets of the resort breathe antiquity.  But there are real pearls among beautiful buildings.  What you should definitely visit in Caorle?  The city is under the Christian patronage of the First Martyr Stephen.  Therefore, the cathedral is dedicated to this saint.  The temple dates from 1038 and is made in the Byzantine Romanesque style.  The facade of this ancient building is decorated with figures of saints.  No less beautiful and inside.  The central apse stores traces of 17th century frescoes.  The walls of the cathedral are decorated with paintings by famous painters of the Venetian school, among which the Last Supper Giorgio Lazzarini stands out.  A true masterpiece is the golden altar of Pala d'Oro.  It was donated to the cathedral by the Queen of Cyprus Catherine Cornaro, who, after the shipwreck, found shelter in Caorle.  It will be interesting to pious tourists that a relic is stored in the cathedral‚Äôs cancer - the skull of the martyr Stephen. </p><h2>  Other Caorle Attractions </h2><p>  Near the main temple of the city, a bell tower rises up 48 meters.  It is unique in that it has an atypical cone-shaped spire.  The bell tower itself, according to the canon of Romanesque architecture, has a cylindrical shape.  It is ten years younger than the cathedral, that is, dates from the middle of the XI century.  The bell tower should be admired not only from the outside - be sure to go inside, because there is a museum of church utensils.  On the promontory overlooking the sea, near the port of Caorle in Italy, stands the Church of Our Lady.  Its foundation is very ancient, but since the location of the building made it a victim of storms, only the construction of the eighteenth century has survived to this day.  But the strict silhouette of the Church of the Virgin serves as a wonderful backdrop for beach photos. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotels caorle italy" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2005234.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Hotels Caorle (Italy) </h2><p>  Reviews report that the resort's hotel fund allows you to make a choice for both the picky tourist and the budget one.  You can recommend the inexpensive hotel ‚ÄúRialto‚Äù on Via Veronese, 22, where the room costs 3155 rubles per night, or ‚ÄúNederland‚Äù on V. Alfieri Street 6. There are plenty of luxury boutique hotels in Caorle.  In this price category you can‚Äôt remember the Splendid Hotel or Villa Olga.

A huge number of them are also for rent in Caorle. </p><h2>  Resort Activities </h2><p>  Do not think that a place of quiet family vacations is depressing with the silence of the cemetery or the monotonous flow of life of a nursing home.
