  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Lipetsk embankment: how to get, where is what happened before</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Modern urban studies believe that if there is a body of water in the city, then there should be a promenade.  This rule is based on the need for mandatory existence of recreational areas.  But in industrial cities, this rule can be very difficult to fulfill, due to the abundance of factories that occupied the river for their own purposes. </p><p>  Lipetsk embankment is an attempt to find a weak compromise between the interests of citizens, government and production. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="52.58963599999999" data-lng="39.588077" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/3/6/7/4/3674.png"></div><h2>  When built </h2><p>  Oddly enough, despite the fact that the city is located on the river, the embankment of Lipetsk appeared only in 2006.  For a long time, it was discussed exactly how the main recreational zone of the metallurgical capital of the Black Earth Region will look like. </p><p>  As a result, it turned out what happened - a metal colored fence, an inexpensive pavement, lined with not the most aesthetic tiles.  In general, they expected more and more. </p><div class="photo" data-original="forever-avon.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="embankment lipetsk" class="if uuid-2503177" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73489/2503177.jpg"></div><h2>  Where is it and how to get there? </h2><p>  When searching for the address of the Lipetsk embankment, it would be most reasonable to focus on NLMK 50th Street, along which this recreation area is located. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can get there either by personal transport, choosing the Naberezhnaya stop as a guide, or by bus to the public transport stop of the same name. </p><p>  For a lover to move on his own, minibuses No. 302, 9T, 28, 28A are suitable. </p><p>  It is worth noting that there is nowhere to put a car there.  Parking is provided, but there are categorically not enough places on it.  Therefore, before you get to the embankment of Lipetsk, think about parking places. </p><h2>  What happened before? </h2><p>  For many years, the territory of the modern embankment of Lipetsk was a huge landfill, consisting of city trash, tree branches, household garbage and other delights of aggressive city life.  Neither the city structure nor the volunteers even thought of cleaning the coast of the Voronezh and Lipovka rivers.  The reasonable result of such a short-sighted approach to the main city reservoir was the demands of the townspeople to change the appearance of the city. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the active construction of the embankment of Lipetsk led to a very interesting discovery.  When the builders uncovered the soil, it turned out that for many decades, urban garbage was stacked right on the ancient archaeological site. </p><p>  The modern embankment of Lipetsk stands on a real ancient settlement from the V-II centuries BC.  Scientists managed to conduct minor research and save some of the archaeological artifacts, but most of the settlement, of course, was destroyed by the builders in the process. </p><p>  So the modern embankment very symbolically combines the recreational zone of the present and traces of the deep past. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.bfoto.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="embankment of the river Voronezh Lipetsk" class="if uuid-2503185" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73489/2503185.jpg"></div><h2>  Things to do? </h2><p>  The modern embankment of Lipetsk is a place that was planned as a quiet recreational area. </p><ul><li>  There is a fairly extensive walking area where you can walk and breathe in the fresh river air.  True, the place for contemplation is very doubtful, because there is nothing special to watch, and ugly fences from a metal profile do not provide additional visual aesthetics. </li><li>  There is a promenade on the Lipetsk and the beach.  He was conceived as the main place in the city for swimming and fun youth beach parties.  But everything turned out a little differently.  Firstly, after the launch of the beach, it turned out that swimming in the river is strictly prohibited, due to the high pollution of the reservoir.  Secondly, equipment in the form of a volleyball net and other things very quickly becomes worthless. </li></ul><p>  However, not everything is so hopeless.  The embankment of Lipetsk has become a great venue for city events.  Here, on a regular basis, there are singers, and animators, and interesting presenters, and even local attractions. </p><p>  In general, there is everything to spend time in a calm or fun environment, depending on personal preferences. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lipetskmedia.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lipetsk embankment beach" class="if uuid-2503180" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73489/2503180.jpg"></div><h2>  What do you need to remember? </h2><p>  Firstly, toilets do not always work here.  So if you plan to soak up the kids on the beach, then some difficulties may arise. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yandex.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="embankment alley Lipetsk" class="if uuid-2503186" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73489/2503186.jpg"></div><p>  Secondly, it is important to remember that swimming is unacceptable here.  The river has a fairly rapid flow, but there is no rescue service on the beach.  In addition, the ban on bathing is quite justified - urban wastewater falls into the river. </p><p>  Thirdly, soon the embankment will be even larger.  In 2017, the city authorities announced the start of work to increase the embankment to the Petrovsky Bridge. </p>
