    <h2>  general characteristics </h2><p>  The Baltic played a special role in the plans of the military and political leaders of the Third Reich.  By controlling it, the Nazis were able to control the bulk of the Baltic Sea and maintain contact with the Scandinavian countries.  In addition, the Baltic region was a large supply base for Germany.  Estonian enterprises annually gave the Third Reich about 500 thousand tons of oil products.  In addition, Germany received huge amounts of food and agricultural raw materials from the Baltic states.  Also, do not lose sight of the fact that the Germans planned to evict the indigenous population from the Baltic states and populate it with their fellow citizens.  Thus, the loss of this region was a serious blow for the Third Reich. </p><p>  The Baltic operation began on September 14, 1944 and lasted until November 22 of the same year.  Its goal was the defeat of the Nazi troops, as well as the liberation of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.  In addition to the Germans, the Red Army was opposed by local collaborators.  Their main number (87 thousand) was part of the Latvian Legion.  Of course, they could not give due resistance to the Soviet troops.  Another 28 thousand people were part of the Latvian battalions of Schutzmannschaft. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The battle consisted of four major operations: Riga, Tallinn, Memel and Moonsund.  In total, it dragged on for 71 days.  The front was about 1000 km wide and about 400 km deep.  As a result of the battle, Army Group North was defeated, and the three Baltic republics were completely freed from the invaders. </p><h2>  Background </h2><p>  The Red Army was preparing a large-scale offensive in the Baltic States during the Fifth Stalinist strike - the Belarusian operation.  In the summer of 1944, Soviet troops managed to liberate the most important territories of the Baltic direction and prepare for themselves a foundation for a major offensive.  By the end of the summer, the bulk of the Nazi defensive lines in the Baltic states collapsed.  In some areas, the troops of the USSR advanced 200 km.  The operations carried out in the summer bound the considerable forces of the Germans, which enabled the Belorussian Front to finally defeat Army Group Center and break through to Eastern Poland.  Coming to the approaches to Riga, the Soviet troops had all the conditions for the successful liberation of the Baltic states. </p>

    <h2>  Offensive plan </h2><p>  The directive of the Supreme High Command to Soviet troops (three Baltic fronts, the Leningrad front and the Red Banner Baltic fleet) was tasked with dismembering and breaking up the Army Group North, while liberating the territory of the Baltic states.  The Baltic fronts attacked the Germans in the direction of Riga, and the Leningrad Front went to Tallinn.  The most important attack was a blow in the Riga direction, as it was supposed to lead to the liberation of Riga - a large industrial and political center, a hub for sea and land communications throughout the Baltic states. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition, the Leningrad Front and the Baltic Fleet were entrusted with the destruction of the Narva operational group.  Having recaptured Tartu, the troops of the Leningrad Front were to go to Tallinn and open access to the eastern shore of the Baltic Sea.  The Baltic Front was tasked with supporting the coastal flank of the Leningrad army, as well as preventing the arrival of German reinforcements and their evacuation. </p><p>  The troops of the Baltic Front were to begin their offensive on September 5-7, and the Leningrad Front on September 15.  However, due to difficulties during preparation for a strategic offensive operation, its beginning had to be postponed for a week.  During this time, Soviet troops carried out reconnaissance work, brought up weapons and food, and sappers completed the construction of the planned roads. </p><h2>  Forces of the parties </h2><p>  In total, the disposal of the Soviet army participating in the Baltic operation was about 1.5 million soldiers, more than 3 thousand armored vehicles, about 17 thousand guns and mortars, and more than 2.5 thousand aircraft.  12 armies took part in the battle, that is, the almost complete composition of the four fronts of the Red Army.  In addition, the offensive was supported by the Baltic ships. </p><p>  As for the German army, by the beginning of September 1944 the Army Group "North" led by Ferdinand Sch√∂rner consisted of 3 tank companies and the operational group "Narva".  In total, she had 730 thousand soldiers, 1.2 thousand units of armored vehicles, 7 thousand guns and mortars and approximately 400 aircraft.  It is interesting to note that the Army Group North had two divisions of Latvians representing the interests of the so-called Latvian Legion. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  German training </h2><p>  By the beginning of the Baltic operation, German troops were seized from the south and pressed to the sea.  Nevertheless, thanks to the Baltic bridgehead, the Nazis could inflict a flank strike on Soviet troops.  Therefore, instead of leaving the Baltic states, the Germans decided to stabilize the fronts there, build additional defensive lines and call for reinforcements. </p><p>  For the direction of Riga was responsible for a group of five <span>tank divisions.</span>  It was believed that the Riga fortification area would be insurmountable for the Soviet troops.  In the Narva direction, the defense was also very serious - three defensive lines with a depth of about 30 km.  To impede the approach of the Baltic ships, the Germans installed many barriers in the Gulf of Finland and mined both fairways along its shores. </p><p>  In August, several divisions and a large number of equipment were transferred to the Baltic states from ‚Äúquiet‚Äù sections of the front and Germany.  The Germans had to spend a huge amount of resources to restore the combat effectiveness of the army group "North".  The fighting spirit of the ‚Äúdefenders‚Äù of the Baltic was quite high.  The troops were very disciplined and convinced that a turning point in the war would soon come.  They were waiting for reinforcements in the form of young soldiers and believed in rumors of miracle weapons. </p><h2>  Riga operation </h2><p>  The Riga operation began on September 14, and ended on October 22, 1944.  The main objective of the operation was the liberation from the invaders of Riga, and then the whole of Latvia.  From the USSR, about 1.3 million soldiers were involved in the battle (119 rifle divisions, 1 mechanized and 6 tank corps, 11 tank brigades and 3 fortified areas).  They were opposed by the 16th and 18th and part 3-1 of the army of the North group.  The greatest success in this battle was achieved by the 1st Baltic Front under the leadership of Ivan Baghramyan.  From September 14 to September 27, the Red Army conducted an offensive.  Having reached the line of Sigulda, which the Germans strengthened and replenished with troops retreating during the Tallinn operation, the Soviet troops stopped.  After careful preparation on October 15, the Red Army launched a swift offensive.  As a result, on October 22, Soviet troops captured Riga and most of Latvia. </p>

    <h2>  Tallinn operation </h2><p>  The Tallinn operation took place from September 17 to 26, 1944.  The objective of this campaign was the liberation of Estonia and, in particular, its capital, the city of Tallinn.  By the beginning of the battle, the second and eighth armies had a significant superiority in relation to the German Narva group.  According to the original plan, the forces of the 2nd shock army were to attack the Narva group from the rear, after which the assault of Tallinn would follow.  The 8th Army was supposed to advance in case the <span>German troops</span> retreat. </p><p>  On September 17, the 2nd shock army set off to fulfill its mission.  She managed to break an 18-kilometer breach in the enemy‚Äôs defense near the Emaj√µgi River.  Realizing the seriousness of the intentions of the Soviet troops, Narva decided to retreat.  The very next day, independence was declared in Tallinn.  Power fell into the hands of an underground Estonian government led by Otto Typhus.  Two banners were raised on the central city tower - Estonian and German.  For several days, the newly-minted government even tried to resist the advancing Soviet and retreating German troops. </p><p>  On September 19, the 8th Army launched an attack.  The next day, the city of Rakvere was liberated from the Nazi invaders, in which the forces of the 8th army joined forces with the forces of the 2nd army.  On September 21, the Red Army liberated Tallinn, and five days later, all of Estonia (with the exception of a number of islands). </p><p>  During the Tallinn operation, the Baltic Fleet landed several of its units on the Estonian coast and adjacent islands.  Thanks to the common forces, the troops of the Third Reich were defeated in mainland Estonia in just 10 days.  At the same time, more than 30 thousand German soldiers tried, but could not break through to Riga.  Some of them were captured, and some were destroyed.  During the Tallinn operation, according to Soviet data, about 30 thousand German soldiers were killed, and about 15 thousand were taken prisoner.  In addition, the Nazis lost 175 units of heavy equipment. </p>

    <h2>  Moonsund operation </h2><p>  On September 27, 1994, Soviet troops launched the Moonsund operation, whose task was to capture the Moonsun Archipelago and liberate it from the invaders.  The operation continued until November 24 of that year.  The specified area from the Germans defended the 23rd Infantry Division and 4 guard battalions.  On the part of the USSR, parts of the Leningrad and Baltic fronts were involved in the campaign.  The bulk of the islands of the archipelago were liberated quickly.  Due to the fact that the Red Army chose unexpected points for landing its landings, the enemy did not have time to prepare the defense.  Immediately after the liberation of one island, the landing party landed on another, which further disoriented the troops of the Third Reich.  The only place where the Nazis were able to delay the advance of the Soviet troops was the Syrve peninsula of Saaremaa, on the isthmus of which the Germans could hold out for a month and a half, holding down the Soviet rifle corps. </p><h2>  Memel operation </h2><p>  This operation was carried out by the 1st Baltic and part of the 3rd Belorussian Front from October 5 to 22, 1944.  The campaign was aimed at cutting off the armies of the North group from the eastern part of Prussia.  When the first Baltic Front, led by the magnificent commander Ivan Baghramyan, entered the approaches of Riga, he faced serious resistance from the enemy.  As a result, it was decided to transfer the resistance to the Memel direction.  Near the city of ≈†iauliai, the forces of the Baltic Front regrouped.  According to the new plan of the Soviet command, the Red Army troops had to break through the defenses from the western and southwestern parts of Siauliai and reach the Palanga-Memel-Naman river line.  The main blow fell on the memel direction, and the auxiliary blow on the Kelme-Tilsit. </p><p>  The decision of the Soviet commanders was an absolute surprise for the Third Reich, which was counting on the resumption of offensives in the Riga direction.  On the first day of the battle, the troops of the USSR broke through the defenses and deepened in different places at a distance of 7 to 17 kilometers.  By October 6, all the troops that had been prepared in advance arrived on the battlefield, and on October 10, the Soviet army cut off the Germans from <span>East Prussia.</span>  As a result, between the troops of the Third Reich, based in Courland and East Prussia, a tunnel of the Soviet army was formed, the width of which reached 50 kilometers.  The enemy, of course, could not overcome this lane. </p>

    <p>  By October 22, the <span>USSR army</span> liberated almost the entire northern bank of the Neman from the Germans.  In Latvia, the enemy was driven out to the Courland Peninsula and reliably blocked.  According to the results of the Memel operation, the Red Army advanced 150 km, liberated more than 26 thousand km <sup>2 of the</sup> territory and more than 30 settlements. </p><h2>  Further events </h2><p>  The defeat of the Army Group North, led by Ferdinand Sch√∂rner, was rather difficult, however, 33 divisions remained in its composition.  In the <span>Courland cauldron, the</span> Third Reich lost half a million soldiers and officers, as well as a huge amount of equipment and weapons.  The German Courland group was blocked and pushed to the sea, between Liepaja and Tukums.  She was doomed, as there was neither strength nor opportunity to break into East Prussia.  There was nowhere to wait for help.  The Soviet offensive on Central Europe was very rapid.  Leaving some equipment and supplies, the Courland group could be evacuated across the sea, but the Germans refused this decision. </p><p>  The Soviet command did not set itself the task of destroying the helpless German group at any cost, which could no longer influence the battles of the final stage of the war.  The Third Baltic Front was disbanded, and the first and second were sent to Courland to complete what had begun.  Due to the onset of winter and the geographical features of the Courland Peninsula (the predominance of swamps and forests), the destruction of the fascist group, which included Lithuanian collaborators, dragged on for a long time.  The situation was complicated by the fact that the main forces of the Baltic fronts (including the troops of General Baghramyan) were transferred to the main directions.  Several severe assaults on the peninsula were unsuccessful.  The Nazis stood to death, and the Soviet units experienced a severe lack of strength.  In the end, the battles in the Courland Cauldron ended only on May 15, 1945. </p>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  As a result of the Baltic operation, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia were freed from the Nazi invaders.  The power of the Soviet Union was established in all the conquered territories.  The Wehrmacht lost its raw material base and strategic bridgehead, which it had for three years.  The Baltic Fleet now has the opportunity to conduct operations on German communications, as well as to cover ground forces from the Gulf of Riga and Finland.  Having recaptured the coast of the Baltic Sea during the 1944 Baltic operation, the Soviet Army was able to attack from the flanks of the troops of the Third Reich, who settled in East Prussia. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the German occupation caused serious harm to the Baltic states.  During the three years of Nazi domination, about 1.4 million civilians and prisoners of war were exterminated.  The economy of the region, city and towns was badly damaged.  For the full restoration of the Baltic, a lot of work had to be done. </p>
