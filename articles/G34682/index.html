Palace and Park Ensemble in Paris</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A real tourist, going on his next trip, always plans what sights to visit.  In Paris there are many such places - the Louvre, the Eiffel Tower, the Champs Elysees.  But the article will focus on the park, which must be seen with your own eyes.  This is the Luxembourg Gardens.  Located in the historical part of the city, it is part of the famous palace complex, which is not inferior to Versailles itself with its luxury and pomp. </p><h2>  History tour </h2><p>  The appearance of this magnificent park and palace was facilitated by the Italian Maria Medici.  In the XVI century, being the widow of King Henry IV, she made an order to create a garden around a country house, which was located away from the bustle of the capital.  The palace project was based on the image of the Palazzo Pitti.  Maria spent her childhood in it (far in Florence).  As you know, this Italian city is one of the main architectural gems in the whole world and still surprises modern engineers with the complexity and magnificence of the forms of buildings. </p>

In order for the plants to get everything they need (and the land was large enough), in 1613 the construction of the aqueduct began.  It lasted more than ten years.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1617, the Luxembourg Gardens in Paris expanded their holdings.  These were the adjoining lands, previously owned by the <span>monastic order of the</span> Roman Catholic Church. </p><p>  In the XVII century, the park was recognized by Parisians as a great place to relax.  He began to visit the masses of people.  In the 18th century, the Luxembourg Garden was a real place for inspiration.  The park was visited by the <span>French writer,</span> thinker and philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, as well as Denis Didro - a famous educator and playwright.  Guy de Maupassant was a fan of the botanical garden and tree nursery. </p><p>  Time passed, the owners of the palace and its parks changed.  Together with them, the territory was transformed.  The grandson of <span>Maria Medici,</span> Louis XIV, gave the order to change the site enveloping the structures in the middle of the garden.  It was complemented by a magnificent picture of Avenue de l'Observatoire. </p><p>  In 1782 the estate was restored.  During the work, several hectares of the park area were lost.  These changes were initiated by the Earl of Provence, who later became King Louis XVIII. </p><p>  After the seizure of church property, namely, the monastery‚Äôs monastery, the territory of the park has become larger and remains so to this day. </p><h2>  The "Heart" of the Luxembourg Gardens </h2><p>  One of the main attractions of the park is the palace erected by Maria Medici.  The Queen is bored with life in the Louvre.  Perhaps she was homesick for her home in Italy.  That is why I decided to set up an estate on the outskirts of Paris, where you could retire and forget about the city bustle. </p><p>  The architect, working on the Florentine model, still created something unique, filled with a French soul. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This architectural monument has survived the most incredible events, has changed several owners.  Even visited the role of a prison in which about 800 prisoners were held.  The famous revolutionary George Danton also visited the palace as a prisoner.  Arriving there, he stated that he planned to free the captives.  But fate decreed otherwise, and he himself had to become one of them. </p>

    <h2>  Carpo Fountain </h2><p>  In addition to the picturesque buildings, the Luxembourg Gardens in Paris has other attractions.  For example, the fountain of the Observatory.  It is located in the southern part of the park.  The fountain was created in 1874 thanks to the joint work of several architects. </p><p>  In the center of the structure, on a hill, there are four women who personify Europe, Asia, Africa and America.  With their naked bodies, they support the <span>armillary sphere,</span> inside which the globe is located. </p><p>  There are eight horses on the middle tier.  They are made in a dynamic style, as if rushing forward.  Next to them are fish, and below are turtles that release jets of water. </p><p>  This is not the only fountain in the Luxembourg Gardens that deserves attention. </p><h2>  Medici Fountain </h2><p>  By order of Mary, one of the most magnificent architectural structures of the park was created.  The fountain, which is called by her name, is the Medici.  The project was designed by Salomon de Bross.  Initially, the structure was a grotto, but was later changed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

On the sides are Leda and the swan, looking at each other.  The central composition appeared later, in 1866.  Its author was Auguste Otten.  It is an illustration of the myth of Polyphemus: below lay naked Galatea and Acis in each other's arms, and above them, ready to jump, is a huge Centaur.

    <p>  The front of the fountain is made like a pond.  Several species of fish inhabit its waters.  The largest population of them is represented by catfish. </p><h2>  Sculptures </h2><p>  Walking along the winding paths in the garden, you can see many more unique architectural monuments.  Hundreds of sculptures are located in various areas of the park. </p><p>  The first ‚ÄúStatue of Liberty‚Äù by Frederic Bartholdy, statues of French queens, outstanding women of the country, for example, Louise of Savoy, are just a few magnificence.  It all stores the Luxembourg Gardens. </p><p>  There are sculptures of heroes of ancient Greek myths and animals. </p>

    <h2>  Art Museum </h2><p>  Another place that attracts tourists is located in the park.  This is a museum in the Luxembourg Gardens.  In the middle of the XVIII century, exhibitions of royal canvases were held within its walls.  This was the starting point in the history of the museum, made it the first place where unique masterpieces were opened to the general public. </p><p>  At the beginning of the XIX century, contemporary works were exhibited here, which allowed artists to demonstrate their art during their lifetime. </p><p>  Today the museum is open for original exhibitions, organizing thematic events. </p><h2>  Nature in the park </h2><p>  Of course, the palace and park ensemble cannot be imagined without its green areas.  Plants in the park do not stop blooming throughout the entire warm period.  Gardeners working here are always on hand.  Three times in a year they change the types of plants in flower beds.  Thus, an incredible decorative landscape is achieved. </p><p>  In the warmest months, visitors can see plants in tubs.  These are date palms, oleanders, orange and pomegranate trees.  However, some species have been growing here for two hundred years.  At other times, they are exhibited in the greenhouse. </p><p>  Near the fence, apple and pear branches spread by their monks spread their branches. </p><p>  All the plants in the garden tolerate diseases and bad weather.  Trees such as chestnuts, lindens, maples, create an extraordinary atmosphere and are home to several species of birds. </p>

    <h2>  Mode of operation </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the park is not always open for visiting.  This is because employees carry out certain work to refine it, clean the area, and eliminate damage. </p><p>  From April to the end of October, the garden is open from half past seven in the morning until nine in the evening.  In November, the schedule changes, there is less time to visit - from eight in the morning to five in the evening. </p><p>  Getting to the park is not difficult - you just need to take the subway train and get off at Odeon station. </p>
