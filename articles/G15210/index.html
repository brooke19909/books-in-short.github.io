Located in the bay of the <span>Ligurian Sea,</span> Livorno is called the ideal city of the Renaissance.  The center of the province of the same name with centuries of history is famous throughout the world for its magnificent nature and cultural and historical monuments, which all of Italy is proud of. </p><p>  Livorno, which arose on the site of a fishing village a thousand years ago, is not in vain called the pearl of Italy.  The busy city with small streets is saturated with the special atmosphere of an eternal holiday.  He will captivate each guest with a huge amount of entertainment and make him lost among the old buildings and picturesque canals. </p><h2>  Port history </h2><p>  The origins of the modern resort originate from the XV century, since the reign of the Medici family.  The Grand Duke of Tuscany ordered the chief architect of the courtyard to turn a small settlement into the most beautiful port, and very soon the whole of Italy started talking about the city, eclipsed by its splendor Naples and Rome.  Livorno is recognized as the main commercial center of the Mediterranean, and after the expansion of borders, foreign ships enter the state‚Äôs sea gate. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="livorno italy beaches" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1328205.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Cosmopolitan city </h2><p>  At the end of the 16th century, a tolerance law was passed, and the port became a haven for all dissenters.  For Catholic Italy, this was an exceptional case, and residents of other cities of Tuscany reacted to this manifestation of tolerance very ambiguously.  In a cosmopolitan city, uniting people of all nationalities and different faiths, they are sure to find something akin to natives of all countries of the world.  No wonder they say that only in Livorno you can find the most incredible cultural and ethnic combinations. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Livorno (Italy): beaches </h2><p>  Now the largest business center of Tuscany enjoys stunning success among foreign tourists.  In the city itself, the beaches are not very adapted for a comfortable stay, and the proximity of the port affects the purity of the water.  However, in the northern and southern parts of the center of the province are wonderful places for swimming, where tourists rush. </p><h2>  Querchanella </h2><p>  The village on the edge of Livorno is known far beyond Italy, and it is not for nothing that Quercianella is called the Tuscan pearl.  The village washed by the azure sea is far from the noisy port, and here you can completely relax, succumbing to the charm of warm water and the friendly sun.  The rocky landscape is called the main feature of a well-equipped beach for relaxation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="italy livorno" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1328216.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Fresh air, the friendly attitude of local residents, delicious Italian cuisine will leave an indelible impression on all travelers who arrived in a picturesque place. </p><h2>  Tyrrhenia </h2><p>  Another beautiful beach located between Livorno (Italy) and the mouth of the Arno River attracts thousands of tourists annually.  Tirrenia, hidden in a pine grove, is not the best place for those who seek solitude.  The territory of the sandy beach stretching for ten kilometers is loved not only by foreign guests, but also by Italians, so it is extremely lively here on weekends.  In Terrenia you can go spearfishing and diving, and play tennis or football at the equipped sports fields. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The most romantic quarter </h2><p>  For many tourists, beautiful Italy has long been the favorite vacation spot.  Livorno attracts travelers with wonderful beaches and unusual sights, which will be discussed later. </p><p>  In the port city, which is quite young by the standards of the country, there are no antique architectural monuments, however, medieval buildings are of genuine interest. </p><p>  Of course, you cannot go past the place where the merchants lived.  The quarter Venezia Nuova (New Venice) was created in the XVII century in the likeness of an ancient <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãon the water.</span>  For the convenience of unloading ships, artificial canals were dug at the merchants' warehouses, and new houses were built near the waterways.  After the Second World War, this quiet corner has retained most of its historical values. </p>
