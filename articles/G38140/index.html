If he rushes to the island state for recreation, he is interested in when he can lay his tired body on the white sand of the beaches and plunge into the azure waters in Cebu.  And if a traveler flies to Manila for a business meeting, then the question of the duration of the move becomes even more relevant.  It is also important to know the number of hours spent on board if you intend to travel to the far <span>islands of the Philippines.</span>  In this article we will try to clarify this issue.  We hope that the information below helps you plan your trip and make the beautiful country of Philippines closer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How much to fly to the Philippines from Moscow" class="if" height="261" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1973850.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How much to fly from Moscow direct flight </h2><p>  A small state lying on the archipelago has about a hundred airports.  Practically every more or less inhabited island has its own take-off and landing field.  Some of the airports have international status.  If we talk about a direct regular flight from Moscow to Manila, then there is simply no such thing.  On this route you can fly with transfers - one or even two.  But we will talk about connecting and combined flights later.  Now we are talking about direct flights.  Unfortunately, this is only possible on <span>charter flights.</span>  Thus, Russians get to the Philippines only during the tourist season, when travel agencies send chartered planes there.  And as a rule, such airliners land by no means in Manila.  Traditionally resort islands, such as Mactan Cebu International Airport, become the point of landing.  It will be eleven and a half hours to fly such a flight.  The liner overcomes a distance of almost eight and a half thousand kilometers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Philippines how much to fly from Moscow direct flight" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1973831.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Cons of charters </h2><p>  So, we found out how much to fly to the Philippines from Moscow by direct irregular flight.  But this information is rather theoretical.  In practice, charter flights are often delayed.  And sometimes for the whole day.  Yes, and such air tickets are not cheap.  The main problem of charters is that it is quite difficult to get a place on them.  After all, the tour operators who chartered the plane, the first thing they want to fill the cabin with "package" passengers, that is, those who bought a ticket from them.  Tickets for the charter are thrown into free sale only when it becomes clear: the liner is not fully filled, that is, a few days before departure.  Thus, planning your trip with a charter in advance is unlikely to succeed.  Another disadvantage is the irregularity of flights.  In the summer, during the rainy season, charters do not fly to the Philippines.  And finally, it should be noted that such flights bypass the capital of the state, the city of Manila.  Since each island of the country has its own airport, charters prefer to land in Bacalod, Angeles City, Basco, Tacloban and other resorts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How much to fly to the Philippines from Moscow direct" class="if" height="376" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1973842.jpg" width="594"></div>

    <h2>  How many fly to the Philippines from Moscow by connecting flights </h2><p>  Without transplants, it will not be possible to overcome a route eight and a half thousand kilometers long.  Well, we will try to get to the Philippines with transfers.  Airlines that offer connecting flights will help us with this.  If we consider only those where one transplant is provided, a rather extensive list is obtained.  These are Qatar Airways with a connection in Doha, KLM in Amsterdam, Emirates Airlines in Dubai, Vietnam Airlines in Ho Chi Minh City, and Korean Air in Seoul.  How many flights to the Philippines from Moscow with such flights?  It depends mainly on the time spent at transit airports.  Least of all have to wait in Beijing or Singapore - five and a half hours.  The best time to have time to shop and explore the huge airport.  Thus, the entire air travel will last eighteen hours.  And if you fly through the cities of Western Europe, then you will need to spend about a day on the way. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How many hours to fly to the Philippines from Moscow" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1973848.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Combined Flights </h2><p>  If you want to get to the desired vacation spot as quickly as possible, you can choose another road map for the trip.  Let's try not to ‚Äúget attached‚Äù to one airline, but to combine the services of two carriers in order to minimize the waiting time at the connecting airport.  For example, if we fly with Aeroflot to Hong Kong and transfer to Philippine Airlines, we will be in Manila thirteen hours after the start from Sheremetyevo.  And how much fly to the Philippines from Moscow with Thai Airways through Bangkok?  Also a little longer than a direct flight - about fifteen hours.  You will spend approximately the same amount of time en route if you use the services of Etihad Airways and the Philippines Airlines with a connection in Abu Dhabi.  Combined flights have their own minus.  It consists in the fact that if the first plane is late, the second company does not bear any responsibility for this. </p><h2>  Time zone difference </h2><p>  You should not calculate how many hours fly to the Philippines from Moscow on the available tickets.  Departure and boarding times are indicated in them local.  And the difference between the belts is five hours. </p>
