What fairies needlewomen do not do with it!  These are toys, and handbags, and any accessories, and jewelry, and shoes.  Just do not list.  And you can crochet clothes, especially for children, absolutely anything: from underwear to a warm coat or hat. </p><p>  In addition to the main types of clothing, a separate article is the manufacture of dresses.  They fit in a long and difficult way, I must say bluntly, especially large sizes.  This is a very time-consuming process, even the simplest dress requires patience, perseverance, attentiveness, accuracy, the ability to take measurements and much more from the knitter. </p><h2>  Dress of individual motifs </h2><p>  Finding a scheme and description of a crocheted dress is easy. </p><p>  Women's or children's dress can be knitted in different ways, using a variety of knitting techniques and applying all kinds of patterns.  As a rule, this is not an easy job, which requires skill and experience. </p><p>  But a crochet dress for women can be a very good option.  It does not need to be knitted all at once, you can slowly knit the elements and put them in a basket for needlework.  And then, when the necessary number of motives for the planned dress will be connected, connect them together.  It turns out something like a designer or puzzle, which you need to carefully and competently assemble in a wonderful dress. </p><h2>  Choose a scheme </h2><p>  Schemes and description - mandatory and integral participants in the process of knitting dresses from crochet motifs.  The search for schemes should not be spared neither time nor effort, as in the end this will affect the result.  Yes, and in the knitting process itself, difficulties may arise if the scheme or description is not very sensible.  That is, the text on how to knit the product should be as detailed as possible, and the crochet dress scheme should be simple and straightforward.  It must be shown how to correctly combine the motives in this product, which finishing options will be appropriate here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Having spent a lot of time searching and choosing the right variant of the dress scheme, you need to do the work carefully.  Only then can you be sure that the result of the work will be amazing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="giftofknitting.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Partial application of motives" class="if uuid-2853525" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88350/2853525.jpg"></div><h2>  What are motives?  What are they like? </h2><p>  Only very brave and experienced craftswomen can take up immediately crocheting a dress.  But what about those who do not consider themselves as such?  Do not give up and act!  There is an option for such needlewomen - these are crocheted dresses, connected by motives. </p><p>  Motives - these are patterns of a certain shape that are knitted first separately, and then assembled in a conceived sequence using a hook into a single whole.  Crocheting dresses with motifs is quite popular, as it suits even beginner craftswomen, if the fragments are not very complex.  They can have the most diverse shape: round, square, hexagonal.  Sometimes they are tied in the form of a flower. </p><p>  There are a lot of options for the location of elements in the product: they can be placed only on the top of the dress or exclusively at the bottom, in the center or on the side.  And you can make the whole dress out of certain motives. </p><p>  In addition to dresses made with separate crochet fragments, which are then connected to each other in various ways, there are ways to knit clothes, where the motifs are knitted without tearing off the thread and connected immediately during work.  This is also a fairly convenient option for those needlewomen who do not like to mess with the assembly of the product. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Pattern matching </h2><p>  In order to crochet a dress of motifs, you first need to choose the right pattern for the future dress.  To do this, you need to find out for what season the thing will be done, for what age, what size it should be. </p><p>  Based on these data, yarn is selected, its color and size of hooks.  A thread for the dress will need a lot, especially if the item is made for an adult girl or woman.  Therefore, it is better to immediately stock up with material for work, since it will not always work to buy threads: either they will not be on sale, or the color will be wrong. </p><p>  Having found a suitable scheme and description for a dress made of crochet motifs, you need to carefully study them and consider in detail, pay attention to difficult moments.  Then, it is necessary to knit a motif sample from that yarn and the hook with which the dress is planned to be made.  This is necessary in order to correctly calculate the number of loops and the elements of the product itself. </p><p>  It is possible that you will have to recalculate this amount yourself if there are discrepancies with the pattern, that is, fit the pattern to your size and your yarn. </p><p>  When crocheting dresses with motifs, you can use threads of different colors, the main thing is that the colors and thickness of the yarn are combined. </p><h2>  Simple and complex squares </h2><p>  In order to gain experience, a novice craftswoman should take a crocheted dress of square motifs to work.  It does not require special skills from the lady in knitting the elements themselves, or when combining them. </p><p>  From the squares they knit both light airy openwork dresses and warm woolen dresses for cool weather.  This is a very convenient, universal motive; it does not create difficulties when connecting individual elements. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.crochetknitpattern.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crochet Squares" class="if uuid-2854347" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88350/2854347.jpg"></div><p>  The squares for the dress can be with a pattern inside, as in the photo above.  It is possible to connect the fragments with the simplest option, for example, a double crochet.  In this case, it is recommended to pay attention to the following scheme: </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kisspng.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Square layout" class="if uuid-2854261" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88350/2854261.jpg"></div><p>  Schemes and descriptions for a dress made of crochet motifs can be different in complexity, complexity.  You need to choose them for your level of crochet proficiency and perseverance. </p><p>  Suppose a circuit is found, the following question arises: where to start? </p><p>  And you need to start, as mentioned above, with calculations.  Yes, without mathematics, nowhere, and especially in knitting, especially when creating such a responsible and complex subject of women's wardrobe as a dress.  Having calculated the required number of elements, you can proceed directly to their manufacture from previously harvested yarn.  When the required number of square elements is connected, you can start assembling the product. </p><h2>  Square motif dress </h2><p>  The simplest version of the dress from square motifs is a copy with a straight silhouette.  First, bands of individual elements are formed, then fragments are connected together. </p><p>  When the desired length and width of the canvas of the future basis of the dress is dialed, the edges of the product are connected using columns without a crochet.  After the obligatory fitting, the work begins more complicated.  Need to do the decoration of the upper part of the dress.  It can be narrow straps, if it is a summer sundress, or a standard neckline for a universal product. </p><p>  And if an option was provided for according to the scheme of a woolen dress crocheted by motifs, then you need to connect the squares in such a way as to close the back and chest. </p><p>  From the squares, it is quite simple to make the neck or neckline of the dress, as well as the sleeves that can be made of any length and width.  The bottom of the dress and sleeves can be decorated with a fringe, for example, as in this photo.  You can simply tie the finishing border. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Color squares" class="if uuid-2853560" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88350/2853560.jpg"></div><h2>  Polygonal motifs </h2><p>  The fragments used when crocheting dresses with motifs can be not only square or round.  They are triangular, and hexagonal, and even octagonal. </p><p>  The sizes of these elements also vary from very small to simply huge.  Small and large fragments connected in different patterns can be combined in one product. </p><p>  They can be made in completely different colors.  To create an individual image, it is recommended to change the color within one element.  You can make a dress of two, three or more combinations of monochrome and color parts: it all depends on the taste and skill of the needlewoman. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Hexagonal motifs" class="if uuid-2854437" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88350/2854437.jpg"></div><p>  It will be very interesting dress crocheted from hexagonal motifs.  It is performed a little more complicated than from squares, because the needlewoman may have difficulty in matching elements.  The craftswoman needs to be very careful and careful so as not to redo the connection several times later and not to waste precious time on the same work. </p><p>  Therefore, you need to very carefully look at the description of the dress crocheted, connected by motives, in order to avoid annoying mistakes.  If the dress consists entirely of polygonal motifs, you need to pay special attention to the design of the top and bottom of the dress, as well as the sleeves. </p><h2>  Round and oval elements </h2><p>  More experienced craftswomen are widely used for crocheted dresses, not only square, but also round or oval elements.  To connect them together, you need to connect additional elements. </p><p>  For crocheting dresses with round motifs, lace patterns are best suited. </p><p>  Floral motifs also look very beautiful.  They are also usually round in shape.  But elements in the form of flowers are more often used for children's clothing, although sometimes they are appropriate in adult models. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.missguided.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Round motives" class="if uuid-2853545" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88350/2853545.jpg"></div><p>  To connect such rounded elements, a special mesh is used, which is crocheted separately, then flowers are attached to it. </p><p>  In general, there are many different ways and techniques to combine motives, from simple to very complex. </p><p>  There are also a huge number of schemes and descriptions for dresses made from crochet motifs.  The main thing is not to get confused and choose the most successful option. </p><h2>  Dress for the girl </h2><p>  In order to <span>crochet a</span> dress of <span>round motifs, you</span> will need a higher level of skill.
