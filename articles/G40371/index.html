    <h2>  Family and education of young Octavius </h2><p>  Augustus himself always ranked himself (according to Suetonius) as an ancient and wealthy race of horsemen.  His father, Guy Octavius ​​- wealthy and respected - became a senator.  He died and left 3 children orphaned.  We are most interested in his son from the second wife of Attius (Caesar's niece), who will later be called Augustus, the first emperor of Rome, orphaned at 4 years old. </p><p>  According to Suetonius, he was born before dawn, either on 23 or September 24, 63 BC.  e., presumably in the Palantine quarter in Velitra (historians do not exclude that in Rome), where later they would put him a sanctuary.  For some inexplicable reason, his children's room in his grandfather’s house in Velitra caused fear and horror for someone who entered it without a rite of purification.  Young Octavia was brought up by a grandmother, Caesar's sister, and at age 12 he made a speech at her funeral.  At 16, he received military awards from Caesar for victories in Africa, although he himself did not take part in the war.  Later, not gaining strength from a serious illness, he followed Caesar to Spain and received the title of patrician.  Caesar adopted the educated, cautious, intelligent Octavius ​​in 45 BC.  e.  The testament of succession was kept by the vestals in complete secrecy.  Caesar sent his heir to Apollonia (present-day Albania) in order to complete his education and prepare for a new war. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Legacy of the dictator (44 BC) </h2><p>  Upon learning of the assassination of Caesar, Octavius ​​sailed to Rome and inherited.  Showing the bitterness of loss, he grew a beard as a sign of mourning for the dictator.  In honor of his victories, he held games.  By the way, a comet appeared at this time, which the majority was afraid of.  But Octavius ​​managed to convince the Romans that this is Caesar's divine soul. </p><p>  Gaining popularity, he sold the inheritance and handed out to the Romans three hundred sisters.  At first, for 12 years, it was a joint rule with <span>Mark Anthony</span> and Mark Lepidus, and later - for 44 years - sovereign.  So briefly outlines the life that led the first emperor of Rome. </p><h2>  Wars </h2><p>  Octavius ​​conducted 5 wars: Mutin, Philippine, Peruvian, Sicilian and Actian.  As revenge for the murder of Caesar, he began to fight with Cassius and Brutus, but Consul Anthony did not support him.  Then he began to fight with Anthony.  But he unexpectedly received the support of commanders and troops, and therefore Octavius ​​used diplomatic abilities and reunited with Anthony. </p><p>  Destroying Brutus, together they successfully ended the Philippine war.  Anthony was sent to the East to establish a Roman order.  Octavius ​​was engaged in the resettlement of veterans on municipal lands.  At that time, a rebellion was raised in Perusia, and after its suppression, Augustus showed cruelty to the vanquished. </p><p>  The Sicilian war with Sextus Pompey lasted 4 years.  It was complicated by the weakness of Octavius ​​as a commander and natural conditions: storms destroyed the fleet.  At his call from Africa, the arrogant Mark Lepid came to the rescue and demanded first place in the state.  Anthony lured his army to himself, and Lepidus exiled to the Circe until the end of his days.  The alliance with Anthony was never lasting. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The war began, and in the battle at sea under the Action Anthony was defeated.  He was persecuted in Alexandria, where Anthony took refuge with Cleopatra and where he committed suicide.  Later, the son of Cleopatra Caesarion was executed.  So the future first emperor of Rome came to power. </p><h2>  Principle </h2><p>  By the year 27, Octavius ​​left in the Senate only those who were his obvious allies, and boldly declared that the state should belong to the people and the Senate. </p>

    <p>  The senators “urged” him to lead the empire, and Octavius ​​became governor of all the provinces in which the legions were located, that is, he led the entire army.  He received the title of Princeps - the first state senator.  This actually meant that he was the first emperor of Rome.  In addition, he was given an honorary name.  So the first emperor of Rome was Augustus ("divine").  A little later, he became the high priest, the great pontiff.  In the hands of Augustus concentrated all the power in the state: military, civil and priestly.  The sovereign master became the first emperor of Rome. </p><h2>  Foreign policy under Augustus </h2><p>  In his conquests were both good luck and defeat, but in general, the empire was significantly expanded.  Under the rule of Rome fell the Alps, the right bank of the Danube, all of Gaul and the Pyrenees, North Africa, Greece, Judea, Syria, the Bosporus kingdom. </p>

    <p>  All this became possible after the first emperor of Rome carried out a reform in the army, thanks to which the latter became professional.  The fleet was reformed.  On average, the maintenance of the army took 2/3 of the collected taxes. </p><h2>  Economy </h2><p>  Under Augustus, systematic coinage of money was established.  Barter relations began to be considered barbaric.  The first emperor of ancient Rome significantly strengthened trade - luxury goods were transported to the capital, and in the provinces the trade in grain, olive oil, and wine was briskly carried on.  Piracy was abolished and maritime trade flourished. </p><h2>  Pride of the Roman Emperor </h2><p>  The ruler gradually began to turn brick Rome into marble.  <span>Carrara marble</span> went to the construction of the temple of Apollo - the first major structure.  The forum (square) of Augustus with the temple on it to Mars Avenger has become a significant religious building. </p>

    <p>  A statue of Augustus was placed on a chariot in the square.  An altar of Peace was built in honor of triumph in Gaul and Spain.  In addition, a very early painful emperor began to conduct for himself and his relatives the construction of a mausoleum on the <span>Field of Mars.</span>  The emperor’s figure crowned the tomb roof. </p><p>  In total, he renovated and erected eighty-two sanctuaries in Rome.  And this markedly exalted his personality, and at the same time reduced unemployment. </p><p>  Intensive civil construction was also carried out: roads, streets, markets, warehouses, aqueducts, fountains, urban sewers, public baths, a public library. </p><h2>  What was August </h2><p>  Augustus was married three times, but had only one child from his second wife, daughter Julia.  However, her licentious behavior forced the emperor to send the girl into exile. </p><p>  The appearance of the famous emperor is well known for the surviving statues. </p>

    <p>  He was a man about 1 m 70 cm tall, which was higher than the average height of the people of that time.  But for the emperor he seemed insufficient, and Augustus therefore wore shoes with a platform.  He had blond hair and eyes and ugly <span>rare teeth,</span> and the skin of the ruler of Rome had a golden hue. </p><h2>  Character </h2><p>  Superstition, the belief that signs and dreams carry information and are very important, are some of the main personality traits of Augustus.  He was very afraid of assassination attempts, so when Octavian sat in the Senate, he had armor under his clothes. </p><p>  The ruler slept poorly, often woke up, because of which he got up late.  In winter, he was cold and wore a warm toga, wrapped his legs.  He was not greedy for food.  He ate simple food and drank little.  The emperor loved the game of dice, often played for money, and in addition, was fond of fishing.  He was engaged in physical exercises of various degrees of difficulty from his youth.  Augustus, the first emperor of Rome, knew Greek well, but never wrote on it. </p><h2>  Health </h2><p>  Octavian was a painful man, but his life was long - 76 years.  He did not tolerate both heat and cold.  Runny nose accompanied him almost all the time, and by old age rheumatism prevailed. </p><p>  Ironically, the name of the first emperor of Rome was also borne by his last emperor, whom contemporaries mocked not by his full name, but simply by Augustine. </p>
