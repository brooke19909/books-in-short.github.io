How many domestic wars were in the history of Russia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When during the war the whole nation stands up for the defense of the Motherland, regardless of the estate and property status, it is called domestic.  In other words, the domestic war is when the people are fighting for their country, for its independence and liberation from the invaders, not under duress, but on the basis of their convictions and moral principles. </p><h2>  How many wars in Russia are considered domestic </h2><p>  In Russia, the war with Napoleon was first called domestic.  By official decrees, two wars received domestic status: </p><ol><li>  Patriotic War of 1812. </li><li>  The Great Patriotic War. </li></ol><p>  Both in 1812 and in 1945, the people of Russia defeated the enemy, defended the independence of their state.  Russian troops paraded in Paris in 1814.  The same triumph was in Berlin in 1945.  These victories cost the country and its people tremendous stress. </p><p>  In addition to the fact that a huge amount of financial and material resources was spent on these wars, the most enormous loss was the death of thousands (1812-1814) and millions (1941-1945) of people.  Despite this, Russia defended its statehood, and as a result of these victories became a great influential world power. </p>

    <h2>  Napoleon’s troops attack on Russia </h2><p>  The war of Russia with France after 1810 was inevitable for many geopolitical reasons, but the violation of the Tilsit treaty became the formal basis for its beginning.  It began on August 12, 1812, when Napoleon’s troops captured the Russian fortress of Kovno.  The first clash occurred the next day.  The number of the advancing army was 240 thousand people. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The Russian military was not taken <span>aback by this</span> attack, since offensive and defensive plans for a war with Napoleon’s troops were considered starting in 1810.  The first rebuff to the attacking Napoleon was provided by the troops of the 1st and 2nd armies.  The first army was led by Barclay de Tolly, and the second by Bagration.  The total number of soldiers of these armies was 153 thousand, armed with 758 guns. </p><h2>  Partisan war as part of the domestic </h2><p>  One of the forms of military resistance to Napoleon’s troops was the partisan movement.  By decision of the leadership of the Russian army, mobile units were created that successfully operated behind enemy lines.  But on their own, without the support of the population, they would not be able to carry out their tasks.  The support of the people proved that resistance to Napoleon is a real World War II.  This was proved by the people's militia — the peasants participating in the battles, and those who provided the partisans and the Russian army with food and fodder. </p>

    <p>  The peasants sabotaged the orders and requests of the French by all means.  They refused to supply them with food - they burned all their supplies so that they would not go to the enemy.  They even set fire to their houses, after which they went into the forest and joined partisan detachments.

When the command of the Russian army was headed by Mikhail Kutuzov, a strategy was developed that would defeat the enemy.  The retreat for Moscow made it possible to maintain a combat-ready army and stop Napoleon's advance further into the interior of Russia. </p><p>  Kutuzov’s famous <span>Tarutin maneuver</span> - retreating beyond Moscow after the Battle of Borodino and stopping the army with a camp in Tarutino - allowed turning the tide of the war.  The Battle of Tarutino was the first major Russian operation that brought a landslide victory.  Over the years of World War II, there were about ten large-scale battles that influenced its course: </p><ul><li>  at the mole bog; </li><li>  under the Red; </li><li>  beyond Smolensk; </li><li>  at Valutin's mountain; </li><li>  near Borodino; </li><li>  Tarutino; </li><li>  near Maloyaroslavets. </li></ul>

    <p>  The war ended with the Napoleonic forces in May 1814 after the surrender of Paris and the signing of a peace treaty.  The Russian army paraded in Paris.  However, this is no longer a domestic war, it is one of the stages of the <span>liberation of Europe.</span>  And the <span>Patriotic War of 1812</span> , according to the published manifesto of Alexander I, was ended after the battle of November 14-16 near the Berezina River.  The war of 1812 is both a manifestation of the courage of the military, and the wise strategy of military leaders, and the feat of the whole people, who resisted the enemy with all their might. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The Great Patriotic War </h2><p>  Germany, not paying attention to the peace treaty concluded in the 39th year, in June violated the territorial borders of the Soviet Union.  On June 22, the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945 began.  Hitler's plans provided for a blitzkrieg - a lightning attack and the capture of the USSR in a few months.  Hitler used such tactics starting from the 39th year, which allowed him to capture half of Europe. </p><p>  However, in battles with Soviet troops, this tactic did not work out.  Although in the early years of the Patriotic War (1941-1942) the German army was able to conquer significant territories, but this did not correspond to the Barbarossa plan.  This plan provided for the end of hostilities by the end of 1941, and Russia, by then, was to disappear forever from the political map of the world. </p>

    <p>  <span>The Soviet people</span> showed that the Great Patriotic War is truly a people's war.  The unprecedented heroism of the military hindered the advance of German troops eastward.  In turn, the partisan detachments fettered large forces of the Wehrmacht, impeded the supply of food and ammunition.  These factors allowed to slow the attack as much as possible, accumulate military potential, and turn the tide of the war. </p><h2>  Soviet Manifestation of Heroism during the War </h2><p>  The Great Patriotic War revealed the best qualities in Soviet people.  Willingness to surrender for the sake of their homeland and courage - these qualities have become not the exception, but the norm.  The heroes of World War II are millions of people.  Over 11 thousand people received the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.  In the period 1941-1945.  About 38 million orders and medals were awarded.  A significant portion was awarded posthumously. </p>

    <p>  Many books describe the exploits of World War II, many films were shot that show the acts of heroism of Soviet soldiers and partisans.  Some of the clearest examples of courage are: </p><ul><li>  Feat of Matrosov.  He closed the enemy bunker with his body and allowed his unit to carry out a combat mission. </li><li>  <span>The feat of Gastello.</span>  Nikolai Frantsevich did not jump out of a burning plane, but sent him into the thick of enemy troops and equipment. </li><li>  Feat of Catherine Zelenko.  During the battle, when her plane was left without fuel, she went into a battering ram and shot down an enemy fighter. </li></ul><h2>  Timeline of the fighting </h2><p>  From the beginning of hostilities, Soviet troops fought defensive battles and were forced to retreat.  In late 1942 - early 1943, managed to take the lead in battles.  The battles of Stalingrad and Kursk turned out to be turning points.  The Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945  I was remembered by such events on the territory of the USSR: </p><ul><li>  June 22, 1941 - the treacherous invasion of German troops. </li><li>  From June to September 1941, Minsk, Vilnius, Riga, Talin, and Kiev were captured. </li><li>  From July 10 to September 10, 1941 the <span>battle of Smolensk</span> lasted <span>.</span> </li><li>  September 1941–27 January 1944 the blockade of Leningrad continued. </li><li>  September 1941 – April 1942  - German troops attacked on the outskirts of Moscow. </li><li>  The battle for Stalingrad (Battle of Stalingrad) lasted from mid-July 1942 to February 1943. </li><li>  July 1942 – October 1943  - battle for the Caucasus. </li><li>  In July – August 1943, a major tank battle took place (Battle of Kursk). </li><li>  From August to October 1943, the Smolensk offensive operation lasted. </li><li>  The end of September 1943 - crossing the Dnieper. </li><li>  In November 1943, Kiev was liberated. </li><li>  March 1, 1944 the blockade of Leningrad was completely lifted. </li><li>  In April 1944, Crimea was liberated. </li><li>  In July 1944, Minsk was liberated. </li><li>  In September – November 1944, the Baltic republics were liberated. </li></ul><h2>  Border recovery and victory </h2><p>  By the end of 1944, the territory of the Soviet Union was restored within the borders that they were before the German attack.  After that, hostilities began on the territory of European countries captured by German troops.  After their liberation, in 1945 an attack on German territory began.  The final victory in the Great Patriotic War came after the surrender was signed on May 8 by the German command. </p>
