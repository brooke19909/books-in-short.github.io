  <section class="page js-page"><h1>19th century inventions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Inventions of the 19-20th century are very numerous.  The most significant can be called photography, dynamite, aniline dyes for fabrics.  In addition, cheaper methods of making paper and alcohol were discovered, and new medicines were invented. </p><p>  Technical inventions of the 19th century were of great importance in the development of society.  So, with the help of a telegraph, people were able to transmit messages within a few seconds from one end of the world to the other.  The telegraph was invented in 1850.  Telegraph lines began to appear a little later.  Graham Bell invented the phone.  Today, people cannot imagine life without this discovery. </p><p>  Inventions of the 19th century from around the world were brought to the exhibition in 1851 in England.  It was attended by about seventeen thousand exhibits.  In subsequent years, other countries, following the example of England, also began to organize international exhibitions of recent achievements. </p><p>  The inventions of the 19th century became a powerful impetus to the development of chemistry, physics, and mathematics.  A feature of this period was the widespread use of electricity.  Scientists of that time were engaged in the study of electromagnetic waves and their influence on various materials.  They began to use electricity in medicine. </p><p>  The <span>phenomenon of electromagnetic induction</span> was noticed by Michael Faraday <span>, and</span> James K. Maxwell developed the electromagnetic theory of light.  <span>Heinrich Hertz</span> proved that <span>electromagnetic waves</span> exist. </p><p>  Inventions of the 19th century in the field of medicine and biology were no less significant than in other scientific fields.  A great contribution to the development of these industries was made by: <span>Robert Koch,</span> who discovered the causative agent of tuberculosis, Louis Pasteur, who became one of the founders of microbiology and immunology, <span>Claude Bernard,</span> who laid the foundations of endocrinology.  In the same century, the first x-ray image was obtained.  French doctors Brissot and Lond spotted a bullet in the patient's head. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Inventions of the 19th century were in the field of astronomy.  This science began to develop rapidly in that era.  So, a section of Astronomy appeared - Astrophysics, which studied the properties of celestial bodies. </p><p>  Dmitry Mendeleev made a great contribution to the development of chemistry by opening the Periodic Law, on the basis of which a table of chemical elements was created.  He saw a table in a dream.  Some predicted elements were discovered later. </p><p>  The beginning of the 19th century was marked by the development of engineering and industry.  In 1804, a steam engine car was demonstrated.  In the 19th century, an internal combustion engine was created.  This contributed to the development of faster vehicles: steamboats, steam locomotives, cars. </p><p>  In the 19th century, railways began to be built.  The first was built in 1825 by Stephenson in England.  By 1840, the length of all railways was about 7,700 km, then at the end of the 19th century it was about 1,080,000 km. </p><p>  It is believed that people began to use computers in the 20th century.  However, their first prototypes were invented already in the previous century.  The Frenchman Jacquard in 1804 discovered a way to program a loom.  The invention allowed to control the thread using punch cards, which contained holes in certain places.  Using these holes was supposed to apply thread to the fabric. </p><p>  <span>Lathes</span> invented at the end of the 18th century <span>,</span> were widely used in industry in the 19th century.  The equipment successfully replaced manual labor, processing metal with high precision. </p><p>  The 19th century is rightly called the century of the "industrial revolution", railways and electricity.  This century has had a huge impact on the worldview and culture of mankind, changing its <span>value system.</span>  The invention of electric lamps, radio, telephone, engine and many other discoveries turned the human life of that time. </p>
