On the one hand, it is very convenient: the payment speed is almost instantaneous, availability, the ability to pay without leaving your home at any time of the day or night.  But in some cases, it raises questions that can be difficult to figure out without looking for additional information. </p><p>  One of the most common systems for Russian-speaking users is Yandex.Money - a convenient, affordable and easy to use service.  But what to do if suddenly there is a need to cancel the transaction?  How to return money from Yandex.Money and when can this be done? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rd.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Yandex money how to return a payment" class="if uuid-2850320" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/2850320.jpg"></div><p>  This situation may occur in the following cases: </p><ul><li>  Entering the wrong details. </li><li>  Application crash. </li><li>  Weaning cash using various fraudulent schemes. </li><li>  Cancellations of the need to transfer funds (for example, default by the party receiving the payment). </li></ul><p>  Judging by user reviews, there are options for <span>how to return money from Yandex.Money</span> , but in practice this process is not entirely debugged.  If necessary, you can try to carry out such an operation, and with a competent approach, the chance of success is quite high. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Invalid funds transfer </h2><p>  If an incorrect wallet number was accidentally entered during the transfer and it is not registered in the system, then the money will be returned to the account automatically. </p><p>  If the payment was sent to the wallet of an unknown person, then the return will be associated with certain difficulties.  In this case, it is usually advised to make a repeated payment of a few cents with a message about the request to return the transferred money.  If the recipient of the funds voluntarily transfers them back, the problem will be solved. </p><p>  Otherwise, you can contact the appropriate law enforcement agencies by providing related documents and writing a statement.  Although, due to the small amount, it is unlikely that anyone will contact this.  In addition, if there is no corpus delicti in the actions of the recipient, the competent authorities will refuse to proceed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rd.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to return the transferred money Yandex" class="if uuid-2850315" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/2850315.jpg"></div><h2>  If the transfer was made using the terminal </h2><p>  Is it possible to return money from Yandex.Money in this case?  It is always necessary to keep a check for payment, which should contain data on the transaction.  Specialists recommend getting rid of documentary evidence of payment only after a successful transfer of funds to the beneficiary's account. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If after payment has not passed too much time, then perhaps the payment can still be canceled.  To do this, call the phone number indicated on the check and describe your problem.  This is the easiest way to return the transferred money from Yandex.Money.  In case of failure, you must contact the technical support of the payment system. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mobileecosystemforum.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="is it possible to return money Yandex money" class="if uuid-2850306" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/2850306.jpg"></div><h2>  Contacting technical support: user manual </h2><p>  The easiest way is to call the hotline, which can be found on the official website of the service.  Or you can fill out a written application form on the site.

If you find an incorrect or failed transaction, you should contact technical support.  Perhaps the service provider will take responsibility for such a problem. </p><h2>  How to return money from Yandex.Money if a wallet has been hacked? </h2><p>  First of all, it is urgent to inform the support service.

Yandex.Money returns the funds paid earlier if: </p><ul><li>  The goods were not delivered at all. </li><li>  The seller did not deliver what was ordered. </li></ul><p>  In this case, the conditions must be met: </p><ul><li>  No more than 90 days have passed since the payment. </li><li>  Payment was made from a wallet or from a card tied to a wallet. </li><li>  On the seller‚Äôs site was a green Yandex.Money icon. <div class="photo" data-original="yamobi.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Yandex money how to return a payment" class="if uuid-2850322" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/2850322.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  If you received a suspicious letter from Yandex.Money? </h2><p>  Most likely, the letter was sent by scammers if: </p><ul><li>  It contains requests to send passwords, codes or any confidential data. </li><li>  The sender address ends with something other than @ money.yandex.ru. </li><li>  When moving from any buttons and links, an unusual address is indicated in the address bar.  At the beginning of the line should be https, or at the end of the line should be an image of the lock. </li></ul><p>  If such a letter is found, it should be screened and sent to technical support. </p><h2>  How to save your money? </h2><p>  So that subsequently the user does not have a question about how to return money from Yandex.Money, it is worth taking care of their safety in advance.  To do this, it is recommended to adhere to the following rules: </p><ul><li>  Use caution when using such financial systems.  Before confirming the transaction, it is better to double-check all entered data several times. </li><li>  It is important not to fall for the tricks of scammers.  You should always check if someone is asking for help through social networks, instant messengers or SMS.  Calls from strangers should be double-checked.  Letters from unknown addresses should be ignored. </li><li>  Payment transfers should be protected with a protection code.  It is indicated when filling out the form for sending payment.  And until the recipient notifies him, he will not be able to receive the payment. </li><li>  You should contact the support service as soon as possible until the money has been withdrawn from the system or used up. </li></ul><p>  With the growth of the pace of life and the complexity of various technologies, it is not always possible to quickly work out the security of money and documents.  Many recognize the convenience of handling electronic payment systems, but are dissatisfied with their unreliability, opacity, and accessibility to fraudulent interventions.  Therefore, it is better to know the possible ways of returning money from the Yandex wallet in order to increase your chances of a refund if necessary. </p>
