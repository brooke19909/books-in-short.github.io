Many end their holidays and vacations, and then Crimea plunges into silence and complete tranquility.  Read more about vacation on the peninsula in September - further in the material. </p><h2>  Why September? </h2><p>  Many tourists believe that it is the velvet season that is the best to visit the resort town and improve your health.

Amazing landscapes are pleasantly pleasing to the eye, and surprisingly quickly green shades of foliage turn into hot orange and rich red.  This time is rich in healthy fruits: watermelons, apples, figs, peaches - which further saturates the rest in the Crimea.

    <p>  The month of September is the best time to restore strength thanks to the sea air.  The fall season is the period for preparing the body for the cold winter.  Doctors have repeatedly argued that rest in Crimea in September helps to get rid of nervous disorders.  In the Crimean sanatoriums there are many diverse health-improving programs for the treatment of the nervous system, heart, blood vessels and respiratory organs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Price policy </h2><p>  Also, holidays in Crimea in September cost tourists less than in the summer.  Rooms in <span>sanatoriums, boarding houses</span> and hotels can be rented at affordable prices. </p><p>  Ideally and comfortably, couples, people of old age, lonely and just those who like a quiet pastime in silence can relax in the velvet season.  When tired of the bustle of the city, the noise of cars, working days, rest in the Crimea will help to relax. </p><p>  September reviews of many vacationers are called the best month.  During this period, prices on the peninsula are reduced not only for housing, food, but also for excursions.  Some come here precisely for concerts and cultural and entertainment programs.  This is because the organizers manage to show the peninsula in all its autumn colors, which adds new impressions to each tourist.  Parks in the velvet season are simply mesmerized by their warm and rich tones, which makes a more relaxing holiday in Crimea.  The end of September on the peninsula is the time to visit the famous "Ball of Chrysanthemums", which is presented in the <span>Nikitsky Botanical Garden.</span> </p><h2>  The weather is just good </h2><p>  Almost every day the sun blinds, rains rarely go, the water in the sea is warm - and all this is a description of the velvet season in Crimea. </p>

During the day, the thermometer shows an average of 23-24 above zero, so direct exposure to sunlight is dangerous for the skin.  In the evening, the temperature drops slightly and is about 16 degrees.  There is a noticeable coolness.

    <h2>  Autumn Alushta </h2><p>  For many reasons, many tourists are attracted by the medium-sized city for various reasons.  He is Alushta.  I like the promenade, which pleases with entertainment: amusement park, clubs, cafes.  At the same time, the city is quiet and calm. </p><p>  Pure and clear water in the sea, medium-sized pebbles contribute to a comfortable stay.  Alushta tourists also like the fact that there are no mountains around, because of this everyone breathes fresh and clean air. </p><p>  There are also places for entertainment.  Like almost everywhere, you can go shopping or go to a movie session.  In the evening, many cafes attract with their promotions and pamper guests with goodies, some establishments have live music. </p><p>  There are always a lot of entertainment programs in the amusement park, in which magicians, dancers, and musicians demonstrate their talents. </p><p>  You can have fun and have a good time in clubs.  The show programs of these institutions will give the most vivid impressions. </p>

    <h2>  Mesmerizing ai-petri </h2><p>  A road with a breeze in a special trailer to the mountain will leave unforgettable emotions.  On Ai-Petri, tourists are expected to have fun from the Crimean Tatars.  There you can <span>ride horses</span> and camels, and enjoy the goodies of the Tatar cuisine, and enjoy the taste and aroma of homemade wine.  Since the height is decent, experienced tourists are advised to bring warm clothes.  The most important advice for ladies: during the tour on Ai-Petri, forget about heels and beautiful bright dresses.  The mountain is very damp and dirty. </p><p>  At the same time, tourists get a lot of emotions, since everyone can see the whole Crimea from a great height in full view.  While vacationers conquer the top of the mountain, adrenaline just rolls over.  However, when you go downstairs on the bus, another portion of unforgettable emotions is guaranteed to you.  The Crimean forest and the air, which you want to breathe more and more often, will not leave a single tourist indifferent. </p>

    <h2>  Great Sudak </h2><p>  Tourists write a lot of reviews about the city, which is famous for its large coastline with different beaches.  Sudak has a large selection of hotels of different price categories. </p><p>  Entertainment is also pleasing.  An interesting ride on an ATV will help to see the picturesque places of Crimea.  However, there is still a horse ride along the same route, so many are advised to immediately determine the vehicle. </p><p>  No less exciting fishing in this city, which will give an unforgettable experience.  A very exciting pastime for both a beginner and an amateur.  The horse mackerel itself jumps onto the bare hook of the fishing rod. </p><p>  For extreme lovers, tourists are advised to conquer Mount Alchak on their own, where everyone will like the beauty of nature, which must be photographed. </p><p>  Bars, <span>restaurants, cafes,</span> souvenir tents and all kinds of entertainment flooded the promenade, which fills with vivid emotions a vacation in September.  Sudak (Crimea) is popular for its <span>cypress avenue.</span>  Many advise it to just see with your own eyes, because words can not convey all the beauty. </p>
