    <h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  Getseg Novi is located in the west of Montenegro, ten kilometers from the Croatian border.  This small town is filled with a Mediterranean atmosphere.  Nature makes it a unique place in its own way.  The northern part of the village is surrounded by peaks, the height of which reaches 1800 meters, and the southern is washed by the <span>Bay of Kotor.</span>  The population of the town is only twenty eight thousand.  In the very center of Herceg Novi you can see typical very narrow streets, cozy <span>cafes, restaurants,</span> Mediterranean squares. </p><p>  From early spring to late autumn, a busy life boils on the promenade by the sea.  Not far from the city there is a settlement called Igalo, in which the famous thermal-climatic sanatorium with an international reputation works.  An hour away by car is Kotor - a city with a world heritage.  Also popular among tourists are Budva, the island of Sveti Stefan, Dubrovnik. </p><p>  Hunguest Sun Resort 4 * hotel, whose length is four hundred meters, is located on the boardwalk on the coast.  The complex consists of twenty villas and five buildings, which are buried in dense vegetation.  It is not difficult for guests of the country to get to the resort, since the hotel is only twenty-five kilometers from Chilipi Airport (the city of Dubrovnik) and as much from Tivat Airport. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  For those who plan to drive a car, they will have to get along the motorway leading from the Hungarian-Croatian border - this is approximately 750 kilometers from the border crossing Letenie.  You can also use the railway, for example, buy a ticket for the Budapest-Bar train, and then take a bus (88 kilometers) or book a transfer at the hotel.  By plane you can fly to two airports (Tivat and Chilipi).  As already mentioned, they are equidistant from the hotel. </p>

    <h2>  Hunguest Sun Resort 4 * (Montenegro): reviews <strong></strong></h2><p>  Montenegro is a good country for holidays, famous for its hotels.  And Herceg Novi is a small seaside town, somewhat reminiscent of Gurzuf.  I would like to discuss the impressions of tourists who visited the Hunguest Hotel Sun Resort 4 *.  Hotel reviews are mostly positive.  Guests of the complex believe that it really has a good location.  A taxi ride from the airport does not take more than twenty minutes.  Tourists like that the hotel is located right on the beach, there is a promenade and many cafes nearby, it‚Äôs not difficult to get to any point of a small town.  As for the rooms, they are different in all buildings.  Many visitors are delighted with bungalows with large terraces - this is a great option for families with children. </p><p>  Separately, tourists celebrate excellent cleaning.  According to them, it is produced in the rooms daily and with high quality, no one has any complaints about this.  All apartments are clean and tidy.  The settlement takes place very quickly, even if you arrive at night or in the evening.  Front desk works great.  Sometimes cards from numbers are demagnetized, but they are easily changed. </p><p>  In a word, a stay at a hotel with all tourists is associated only with positive memories, and this is very rare.  However, there are minor flaws.  So, vacationers emphasize the lack of animation in the hotel, although this is not surprising.  The hotel does not really practice recreational activities, but this is not a disadvantage of this complex, but rather local traditions.  In Montenegro, it is not customary to organize such a service - this is not Turkey for you.  Just those who are coming here for the first time to relax need to know about it. </p><p>  According to vacationers, they did not have to be bored.  Montenegro is a beautiful country, so there is something to see.  It is very convenient that you can rent a car right at the hotel, then you can go round everything you want, since the distances are small.  Those who are tired of excursions and sea vacations can go to the promenade in the evening and sit in one of the many cafes or in the restaurant.  In the light of the evening lights, the promenade becomes especially romantic and beautiful. </p>

    <p>  One gets the impression that in Herceg Novi mainly young people rest, who come here in search of vibrant nightlife.  At the hotel you will not meet people of advanced age, and not many children.  In general, there are not many Russians in the complex, although the housekeeping staff is very respectful of our compatriots.  It is very convenient to relax with children in the hotel, since there are all conditions, except, as we have said, animation.  But this is more than offset by a beautiful clear sea and a great beach.  For children, this is the most useful entertainment. </p><p>  Nutrition is a major concern for tourists.  What about him in Hunguest Sun Resort 4 *?  Reviews vacationers on this occasion even surprise by unanimity.  Without exception, everyone is satisfied with the food, emphasizing the variety of dishes, as well as the presence of a large number of fruits.  In the evening they even offer ice cream.  Local food is not as exotic as Turkish, and therefore there are no problems with the nutrition of the youngest guests.  Breakfast includes non-alcoholic drinks, but for dinner you will have to pay for them.  ‚ÄúConscientious‚Äù tour operators never talk about such nuances.  But water for dinner can be obtained for free.  Tourists like that the menu has a lot of meat dishes, there is a good selection of side dishes.  There is absolutely no need to buy something from the products. </p><h2>  Some more opinions </h2><p>  Holidays in Montenegro are distinguished by some positive.  Probably a considerable role in this is played by the attitude of the local population towards tourists.  Montenegrins are a very good-natured and hospitable people.  They are always happy to help if the situation requires it. </p><p>  A huge advantage of the hotel is the presence of its own beach.  Rescuers even work on it, which is very nice.  It is they who help maintain order on the shore and calm the most temperamental tourists.  Going down to the sea is necessary on a concrete platform, and not on a sandy slope.  But this does not interfere much, just a little unusual.  I am glad that the hotel has a swimming pool, because it is possible to bathe children in it when sea water is not very warm.  The sea immediately becomes deep, which is not particularly convenient for swimmers, but this moment will appeal to those who like to dive. </p><p>  The hotel is located in the historic center of the town.  You can reach any point in Herceg Novi at a slow pace.  You can even walk along the promenade to the nearest town of Igalo.  Very pleased tourists with the availability of free services: a jacuzzi, saunas, sports fields and a gym. </p>
