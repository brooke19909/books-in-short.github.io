This can lead to a person experiencing insomnia and chronic lack of sleep. </p><h2>  How to use the power of the amulet </h2><div class="photo" data-original="madeheart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dream catcher bracelet" class="if uuid-3185582" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44149/3185582.jpg"></div><p>  A self-made amulet can be placed at the head of the bed or hung on the wall in the center of the room.  You can weave a talisman in the form of a bracelet, pendant or key ring. </p><h2>  Create a talisman </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="dream catcher for interior decoration" class="if uuid-3185583" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44149/3185583.jpg"></div><p>  What to make a circle for a dreamcatcher?  The best material for creating the foundation is the willow branch.  You can make a ring of wood.  As for metal hoops, it is not recommended to use them.  The fact is that the amulet is considered magical, which means that it has a "shelf life", so it is better to create it from materials of natural origin.  As soon as the willow twig dries, the threads that wound the ring will break it.  If you make a charm of metal, it will be difficult to understand when it will lose its magical properties. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="in.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="basis for willow dream catcher" class="if uuid-3185607" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44149/3185607.jpg"></div><h2>  What feathers to use </h2><p>  When creating an amulet, it is important to consider that feathers need to be selected depending on who it is intended for: </p><ul><li>  For men, it is advisable to take eagle feathers - a symbol of courage. </li><li>  For women, owl feathers are suitable - the personification of wisdom, mystery and tranquility. </li></ul><p>  In order for the amulet to fulfill its protective functions 100%, it is important not only to choose suitable materials for the base for the dream catcher and his jewelry.  Finding the feathers of a live bird is quite difficult, because they conceal a positive energy.  If there are no owl and eagle feathers, they can be replaced with goose or cockerels.  But it is worth considering that the properties of the latter are not too powerful. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.perlesandco.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what you need to make a dream catcher" class="if uuid-3185604" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44149/3185604.jpg"></div><h2>  Which threads to choose </h2><p>  Strong weaving is required to weave the web.  It is preferable to use natural materials.  It can be linen or cotton.  The thread should not break, therefore, a voluminous glomerulus is required.  During weaving, certain rules should be followed: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  wrap the base for the dream catcher in a clockwise direction; </li><li>  wind the threads evenly. </li></ul><h2>  Master class number 1 </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dream catcher on the wall" class="if uuid-3185588" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44149/3185588.jpg"></div><p>  You can make a dream catcher at home.  In this master class, we will consider a phased scheme of weaving threads using the "web" technique.  What to make a basis for a dream catcher?  For this, a willow rod or a birch blank is ideal.  In addition to the ring, the following materials will be required: </p><ul><li>  Thread floss.  To make the knitting volumetric, you can purchase yarn in which silk is added. </li><li>  Gypsy needle.  It is necessary to choose one through which beads for decor will pass. </li><li>  Feathers - you can make the amulet plain or multi-colored. </li><li>  Cord of suede, leather or satin.  With it, you can fix the amulet on the wall or at the head of the bed.  If the amulet is decorated in ethnic style, you can use twine, strong wire or woolen thread. </li><li>  Large beads, bugles and other decorative elements. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.instructables.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dream catcher materials" class="if uuid-3185594" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44149/3185594.jpg"></div><p>  In order for the talisman to fulfill its magical functions, you need to take up work with a positive attitude.  It is advisable to create a talisman for relaxing music that will help focus on the process. </p><p>  A step-by-step diagram looks like this: </p><ol><li>  The basis for the dream catcher must be tightly wrapped with thread.  If a branch was used for the ring, it will have to be bent and secured with a cord. </li><li>  The free edge of the cord should be secured.  As soon as the basis for a dream catcher from a willow with his own hands is wrapped with threads, you can start weaving the inside according to the "spider line" pattern. </li><li>  Next, tighten 1-2 knots with the free end of the thread.  It all depends on what material is used. </li><li>  The thread must be stretched along the base and secured by wrapping around the workpiece.  All other turns must be fixed at an equal distance from each other. </li><li>  As soon as the first circle is closed, you will have to pass the free edge of the thread into the needle - it is easier to follow the weaving technique. </li><li>  The thread must be pulled through the first loop in the center with a needle and secured. </li><li>  Then it is necessary to weave the second circular row to the first, moving to the center of the base. </li><li>  After the two rows are woven, you can take on the decorative design of the amulet using beads and glass beads. </li><li>  Next, create the third row of weaving.  Before the next knot is tied, a decor element must be strung on the thread. </li><li>  As soon as the row of beads is ready, you will have to weave three rows, while maintaining the clarity of the lines. </li><li>  Then you need to create a new row.  This time you can use small beads. </li><li>  The final row of the amulet must be woven without decor elements.  The thread must be fixed in a knot and cut off the excess. </li><li>  Decorate the finished amulet at your discretion.  To do this, peacock feathers, colorful braid and other decorative materials are suitable. </li></ol><p>  That's it, the original dream catcher is ready.  It can be fixed on a ring or twig, and attach a hook to the upper lace. </p><h2>  Master class number 2 </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.instructables.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to use a dream catcher" class="if uuid-3186314" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44149/3186314.jpg"></div><p>  According to this instruction, you can create a triangular or eight-pointed amulet.  Even a novice will be able to cope with the task, because the weaving technique does not require special skills.  For the amulet you will need: </p><ul><li>  basis for a dream catcher (can be made of willow or birch branches); </li><li>  threads </li><li>  wooden or glass beads; </li><li>  thick needle; </li><li>  transparent glue; </li><li>  scissors. </li></ul><p>  The materials need to be laid out on a work surface and get down to business: </p><ol><li>  The basis for a dream catcher from willow or twigs of birch need to be wrapped in thread in a row.  The thread must be fixed so that during winding its end can be hidden inside the ring. </li><li>  Next, you need to tie a tight knot and divide the workpiece into eight identical points.  It is important that an equal distance is maintained between them. </li><li>  Then you need to tie the thread to the first point and go through it with the desired number of segments.  At the end of the first circle, the knot should be fixed in the same place where weaving began. </li><li>  Then weave the second circle and all subsequent ones (6 rows in total). </li><li>  The result should be a dense cobweb with rays forming a star.  The spider web needs to be made not too dense.  To do this, the thread needs to be fastened to the bottom row. </li><li>  After the base is ready, you can take on its decoration.  It is necessary to continue weaving in the same technique and fasten the beads in each row.  As decor elements, shiny or matte beads, beads are suitable. </li></ol><h2>  Master class number 3 - keychain or pendant </h2><p>  To design a keychain or pendant as a dream catcher, you will need the following materials: </p><ul><li>  basis for a dream catcher from wood; </li><li>  metal rings (feathers, beads, etc. will be attached to these elements); </li><li>  decorative details (feathers, beads); </li><li>  strong thread; </li><li>  holder on which the product will be fixed. </li></ul><p>  Once everything is purchased, you can begin to create an amulet: </p><ol><li>  First you need to weave a web inside the ring. </li><li>  Then weaving should be supplemented with decorative elements. </li><li>  Feathers should be placed on the sides of the keyring or pendant. </li><li>  From above it is necessary to fix the holder. </li></ol><p>  Using the same scheme, you can make a car pendant or bracelet.  As a <span>basis for a bracelet,</span> you can take a leather cord or a metal chain, which consists of three-dimensional links. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  After the amulet is made, you need to place it in the right place.  His strength can be felt on himself after a few days.  The holder of the magic ring will begin to get enough sleep, his health and well-being will significantly improve.  The talisman can be used to get rid of unpleasant dreams and as a magical tool that will help maintain the strength of the spirit of its master.  The main thing is to know what to make a dream catcher ring from and what decorative elements to use. </p>
