What is his biography?  You will find answers to these and other questions in the article.  Edelstein Wolf Isaakovich (1907-1983) - the father of the notorious Russian politician.  He is the hero of the famous winged expression "Mother - Russian, father - lawyer."  Zhirinovsky had incorrect data about his father and mother.  Therefore, mistakenly believed that Edelstein Wolf was a lawyer. </p><h2>  Oldest deputy </h2><p>  V.V. Zhirinovsky is a Russian and Soviet politician.  He was born in the city of Alma-Ata <span>(Kazakh SSR,</span> USSR) in 1946, April 25.  The future politician until June 10, 1964 was listed under the name Eidelstein.  Since December 22, 2017 he is a candidate for the presidency of the Russian Federation.  He served as head of the LDPR faction in the State Duma of the Federal Congress of the Russian Federation from 1993 to 2000 and since 2011. </p><div class="photo" data-original="twitter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="V.V. Zhirinovsky (son of a businessman)" class="if uuid-2237280" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14518/2237280.jpg"></div><p>  V.V. Zhirinovsky is also a participant in a number of scandals, one of the oldest deputies of the State Duma of the Federal Meeting of the Russian Federation (since December 12, 1993).  He is also the Deputy <span>Chairman of the State Duma of the</span> Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation (2000-2011), the founder and chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party, a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE). </p><h2>  School records </h2><p>  So who was Zhirinovsky‚Äôs father?  In the distant past, Vladimir Volfovich studied at school.  Today it is a very prestigious college for intelligent children from very wealthy families.  And earlier, in the fall of 1953, a boy came to this simple Soviet school on foot, almost from the outskirts of the city, with a bag of sandwiches and a small briefcase.  What was his name? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="alchetron.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nationality of Wolf Isaakovich Edelstein" class="if uuid-2237283" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14518/2237283.jpg"></div><p>  In order to find out his name, journalists had to spend four hours in the school archive.  This strange boy appeared in school records in at least four different forms. </p><p>  He changed his middle name and last name several times!  At first, the journalists thought that they were completely different children.  But Galina Sergeevna (the school principal) said that one journalist from the British newspaper The Sun wanted to buy the whole archive <span>for 20 thousand pounds.</span>  <span>Unfortunately, he could not do this.</span> </p><h2>  Father's biography </h2><p>  So who is Edelstein Wolf Isaakovich?  This man was born in 1907, on April 25, in the Russian Empire (on the lands of present-day Ukraine) with the well-to-do prosperous businessman Kostopol Eidelshtein Yitzhak.  He studied in the city of Rivne in the gymnasium.  After the Russian Empire collapsed, Kostopol with the population moved to Poland. </p><p>  In 1925, Edelstein Wolf Isaakovich entered the University of Grenoble of the Is√®re Department of France.  He decided to study at the commercial department of the law faculty.  That is why the myth arose that the hero of this material was a lawyer.  In reality, he was a merchant. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Agree, the biography of Edelstein Wolf Isaakovich is very interesting.  After law, he learned to be an agronomist (1925-1933).  Wolf spent some time in France doing business, then returned to Kostopol. </p><h2>  War years </h2><div class="photo" data-original="globalsib.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Biography of Wolf Isaakovich Edelstein" class="if uuid-2239286" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14518/2239286.jpg"></div><p>  In 1940, Soviet troops entered Eastern Poland.  It was then that Wolf and his brother Aaron were sent to Kazakhstan.  Their relatives remained in Kostopol.  In 1941, in the summer, the Germans occupied Ukraine.  During the liquidation of the Jews of Kostopol (in August), the Nazis killed Rivka, Yitzhak, Lyuba and Rosa Eidelshteinov.  Wolf Isaakovich returned to Poland in 1946, lived in Warsaw. </p><h2>  Correspondence </h2><p>  Alexandra (Zhirinovsky‚Äôs mother) went to her husband in June 1946 to show him Volodya (the baby was only 3 months old then).  She lived there with her husband for several weeks, but she was forbidden from staying at the Soviet embassy for long.  Therefore, Alexander had to return to Kazakhstan.  Wolf really wanted to leave with her, but they did not let him in. </p><p>  The next few months, Alexander and Wolf corresponded.  But in September 1946, Wolf Isaakovich wrote to his wife that in the USSR they were badly treated by those who contacted abroad.  He told her that he did not want to let her down, and therefore would no longer correspond.  More Alexander and Wolf did not hear about each other. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Lawsuit </h2><p>  Wolf Eidelstein in 1949 participated in Aliyah and moved to Israel.  Here he became a member of the Likud right-Zionist party, worked as an agronomist for 25 years, and in 1983 died under the wheels of a bus.  Soon Zhirinovsky learned about the fate of his father and sued the bus company of Tel Aviv.  He demanded compensation for the death of the pope. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mir24.tv" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Eidelstein‚Äôs son" class="if uuid-2239290" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14518/2239290.jpg"></div><p>  By nationality, Edelstein Wolf Isaakovich was a Jew, but had the citizenship of four countries: the Russian Empire, Poland, the USSR and Israel. </p><h2>  According to the book </h2><p>  It is known that the writer Alexander Namozov, in his book ‚ÄúVladimir Zhirinovsky, Returning to the Origins,‚Äù wrote that Edelstein Wolf was the head of three workshops that worked on the processing of wood for his father's plywood factory and cultivated hops on his own land. </p><p>  We have already said that when Western Ukraine was annexed, Wolf and his brother Aaron were relocated to Kazakhstan.  It was there that Wolf married and was later deported to Poland.  Then he repatriated to Israel, where he worked at an enterprise selling chemicals and fertilizers.  When he died, he was buried in a cemetery in Holon. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikiwand.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vladimir Volfovich Edelstein" class="if uuid-2237349" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14518/2237349.jpg"></div><p>  Eidelstein Itzek, his wife Rivka, granddaughter Lyuba, daughter Reizl and other relatives who remained in Kostopol at the beginning of World War II, were killed in 1941 on August 16 in the tract Lesnichevka along with two thousand local Jews.  In total, residents of 470 houses were shot. </p><h2>  Father's last name </h2><p>  And who is Edelstein Vladimir Volfovich?  This is a Russian politician.  It is known that until 1964 he bore the name of the pope - Eidelstein, and when he came of age, he changed it to the name of his mother and became Zhirinovsky. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gazeta.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Eidelstein‚Äôs son" class="if uuid-2239296" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14518/2239296.jpg"></div><p>  Other sources claim that Vladimir always bore this name, and that in the courtyard he was nicknamed Zhirik.  This fact is confirmed by his peers. </p><h2>  Profession </h2><p>  It was previously claimed that Wolf Isaakovich graduated from the University of Paris <span>(Sorbonne) and was a lawyer by profession.</span>  <span>However, Zhirinovsky found out that his father studied at the institute in Grenoble and, as it turned out, received not only a commercial education, but also became an agronomist (as we mentioned above).</span> </p><p>  In May 2006, a press conference was held in Tel Aviv, at which Zhirinovsky said: "Journalists mocked me:" the son of a lawyer. "  And I am the son of a businessman and an agronomist. ‚Äù </p><h2>  Mother </h2><p>  Volodya's mother was called Zhirinovskaya Alexandra Pavlovna.  She bore the name of her first husband and worked in the center of Alma-Ata in the city dining room.  Alexandra had to bring home leftovers from work home.  After all, the only way she could feed five babies.  After the death of her husband (Andrei Zhirinovsky), Alexander married <span>again - to Wolf Isaakovich.</span>  <span>He was from eastern Poland.</span> </p><p>  In Kazakhstan, fate abandoned Wolf in the 40th.  Here he worked as a legal adviser in the railway department.  According to the play of the case of Wolf Eidelstein, in accordance with diplomatic post-war agreements, they were sent from the USSR to Poland on April 25, the 46th year, on the birthday of his son. </p><div class="photo" data-original="alchetron.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Son of Wolf Isaakovich Eidelshtein" class="if uuid-2237354" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14518/2237354.jpg"></div><p>  Therefore, Vladimir Zhirinovsky never really saw his father.  He said that on that day one of the relatives ran to the station and told Wolf Isaakovich: ‚ÄúYour son was born.‚Äù  And my father seemed to cry.  Because he left his wife, a newborn baby, and had to go.  Then they sent all the foreigners to the place of their former stay. </p><p>  It is known that Wolf Eidelstein could not have a career growth. </p><h2>  Nuances </h2><p>  The ambulance did not manage to come to Alexandra Pavlovna.  Therefore, her sibling cut the umbilical cord with a kitchen knife himself.  Zhirinovsky is still very proud of this fact: "I went into life myself." </p><p>  So, in 1953, on September 1, a kid came to first grade, whose name was Edelstein Vladimir Volfovich.  Before the third grade, he studied very middle - there were too many triples.  In the lists for the fourth grade, another student was already listed - Vladimir Andreevich Zhirinovsky.  True, the estimates were all the same ... </p><p>  Five years passed, and in school papers this student was already listed as Vladimir Vladimirovich.  A certificate of maturity came to receive Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovsky!  Why did he change his middle name and last name? </p><p>  Classmates claimed that Volodya was afraid that his father's name would interfere with his life.  The surname of the mother‚Äôs first spouse, whom he had never seen either, Volodya took with pleasure.  Moreover, he served in the KGB.  And Volodya always really wanted to work in the organs. </p><p>  By the way, Vladimir Volfovich never had a relationship with the KGB.  And he never was a member of the CPSU.  In fact, Zhirinovsky tried to join the party, but it did not work out.  His last dreams melted when he went to jail (he spent 17 days in prison). </p><p>  By the way, Zhirinovsky continues to search for his father.  He knows for sure that he is not at the Jerusalem cemetery.  That is why he refused to give interviews to NTV reporters.  What if Wolf Isaakovich is still alive?  And still live somewhere in Poland?  And he doesn‚Äôt even know what his son has reached political heights.  Indeed, Wolf Isaakovich never saw him and does not know that Volodya still bears someone else's name! </p>
