Photos, reviews of tourists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There is probably no person who does not know how difficult it is to find decent housing in a season in such a famous Black Sea resort as Sochi.  And so this housing was also inexpensive ... Agree, this is something from the realm of fantasy.  Nevertheless, there is such an option.  His name is the three-star Marianna Hotel.  Sochi is a rather large city stretching along the coast.  The mentioned hotel is located approximately in its geographical center.  This institution has many other features that make it one of the best among the hotels of its category. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Hotel Marianna (Sochi) is located in the central district of the city.  Near the river of the same name flows from Sochi, on the banks of which a wonderful embankment leading to the coast with beaches was built.  The place where the hotel is located is quiet and calm, noisy discos and nightclubs are not nearby.  The hotel is convenient in that it is only 1.5 km from the railway station of the city.  Full address: Sochi, Marianna Hotel, ul.  Plastunskaya, 44a.  Vacationers will certainly enjoy the fact that a 10-minute walk from this place is a large shopping center "Magnet", which leads to the same Plastunskaya, no need to go anywhere.  Immediately after the "Magnet" is the Krasnodar Ring, which is the largest traffic intersection and the stopping place of many minibuses and buses.  In the same place a bridge was built across the river Sochi.  Having crossed it, you can get to the O'Key supermarket and the huge shopping and entertainment center MoreMall that literally merges with it, where there is a cafe and restaurant.  The road here from the hotel will take 15-20 minutes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-957475" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/957475.jpg?1549962721"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  In relation to the station, the Marianna Hotel (Sochi) is very conveniently located.  Plastunskaya is one of the main streets, along which there is a lot of public transport.  But there are no stops near the hotel, so it is best to take a taxi with things from the station.  In addition, you can order a transfer from the hotel, the cost of which is only 200 rubles.  In time, the road takes about 5 minutes.  To get from <span>Sochi Airport,</span> which is located 27 km from the hotel, is also the best way mentioned.  True, the transfer in this case costs 1200 rubles, and vacationers spend about half an hour on the way.  You can walk to the railway station on foot in 20 minutes, which is not so bad if there are no heavy bags in hand.  Without things, it‚Äôs convenient to go to the station and public transport.  From the ring there are buses No. 1, 3, 4, 7, 43, 95, 101, 180, 104 and 153. From the airport by public transport to the railway station you can get to "Lastochka" (electric train), and then - the above methods. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-957674" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/957674.jpg?1549962721"></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The Marianna Hotel (Sochi) is a city hotel, so it does not have a large territory with a garden.

Upon reaching the seaside <span>promenade of Sochi</span> , hotel guests have hundreds of beach vacation options, because the beaches here stretch in an endless sequence, unobtrusively and sometimes imperceptibly passing one into another.  An excellent choice would be the "Riviera" near the park of the same name.  Here you can combine swimming and sunbathing with entertainment on dozens of attractions.  You can also eat here.  Great private beach and at the water park "Mayak".  Outsiders are not allowed there, only those who buy a ticket to this establishment.  Almost immediately after the Riviera, the Star Beach begins.  This is the property of the hotel of the same name, but the entrance there is unhindered for everyone.  Next is the beach "Primorsky", then "Tinkoff", "Black Sea" (the property of the hotel of the same name, accessible to everyone) and so on and so on.  At the mouth of the Sochi River there is a seaport where you can catch a boat and take a walk along the sea.  All listed beaches are pebble.  Pebbles are small on the Riviera, medium and large on the rest.  Sunset in the sea is different everywhere, every vacationer can choose the best option for himself.  The beaches are beautifully equipped.  Here there are sunbeds, and <span>sunshades</span> or <span>parasols,</span> and showers, and cabins to change clothes, and a lot of water activities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-957686" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/957686.jpg?1549962721"></div><h2>  Additional Information </h2><p>  Hotel Marianna (Sochi) is located in a quiet residential area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city.

Marked pluses: </p><ul><li>  wonderful staff, well trained; </li><li>  chic rooms; </li><li>  cleanliness around; </li><li>  well-functioning appliances and plumbing; </li><li>  relatively low prices. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  location (far from the sea, to all entertainment facilities, to stops); </li><li>  poor breakfast; </li><li>  poor soundproofing in the rooms. </li></ul><p>  Conclusion: this hotel is difficult to recommend for a beach holiday, especially for parents with young children and people who are not able to walk a lot.
