    <h2>  What information should be known? </h2><p>  The main thing that you need to transfer money is information about the payee.  With any method of sending you need some of its data.  Find out from the person you want to transfer, his bank card number, last name, first name and patronymic.  It is worth noting that the article is about how to put money on a Sberbank card to another person.  Some of the methods are suitable for recipients - cardholders of other banks, as well as those who do not have "credit cards", but who are Sberbank customers by opening a current account.  Accordingly, it is possible to send money to another bank‚Äôs card at ATMs or by visiting Sberbank, but you will need to pay a fee for this.  And when sending to a bank account in another bank, be prepared to provide the full details of the institution (name, <span>correspondent account,</span> BIC).  The recipient of the payment, having only a current account with Sberbank, needs to know his account number. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Payee Initials </h2><p>  The name, patronymic and first letter of the surname of the payee are required to verify the correctness of the specified data.  This applies to any method of sending money.  After the card or account number is entered, the system will determine its owner.  For example, when sending money to Ivan Ivan Ivanovich, you will see: Ivan Ivanovich I. - this will be confirmation that the money will be sent as intended.  Of course, such a rule only applies if you are wondering how to send money to a Sberbank card.  The system does not identify cardholders of other organizations, you will have to rely only on your attention when entering sixteen or eighteen digits of the card number or twenty characters of the account number. </p>

    <h2>  Through an ATM </h2><p>  How to send money to a Sberbank card through an ATM?  This method, like the previous one, is suitable for those who want to put <span>cash</span> on the card <span>,</span> and for transferring from a bank account or card.  ATMs are found on our streets much more often than bank branches, which makes this method more convenient than the previous one.  The downside is that the transfer will need to be done personally, without the help of a consultant.  <span>How to transfer money to someone else's card of Sberbank?</span>  This process, however, as well as other services related to the movement of funds on a bank card, will be free only in that situation if you use a Sberbank ATM.  Otherwise, the service will be paid, and commissions will be charged from your card, in addition to the funds transferred.  The money transfer procedure itself is simple: </p><ul><li>  Insert your card into the opening of the ATM. </li><li>  Enter your PIN. </li><li>  Find in the menu "Transfer of funds" (the name and location of buttons in the menu may vary for different ATMs). </li><li>  Enter the details of the payee. </li><li>  Print the check. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to send sms with money to a sberbank card" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13354/774187.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Via Mobile Bank </h2><p>  One of the most convenient solutions to the problem of how to send money from card to card (Sberbank) is the Mobile Bank service.  In order to make a transfer, you only need a mobile phone and a phone number of the payee.  Of course, both participants in the procedure must have Sberbank of Russia cards, the Mobile Bank service is activated, and the phone number that is used to transfer money must be registered in the bank's system. </p><p>  Then everything is simple.  Send SMS number 900 with the following contents: TRANSFER NNNNNNNNNN SSS, where N..N is the telephone number of the payee in ten-digit format (without 8), SSS is the payment amount (in rubles).  The disadvantage of this method is the restriction on the amount of transfer.  It is eight thousand rubles a day. </p><p>  Still how to send an SMS with money to a Sberbank card?  In the previously described command, instead of the phone number, indicate the last four digits of your credit card number and the last four digits of the recipient's credit card number.  For example, 9999 8888 500, where 500 is the payment amount.  The limit on the amount of transfer is five thousand rubles per day.  Agree, convenient?  And this is not the last of the tips on the question of how to send money to a Sberbank card. </p>
