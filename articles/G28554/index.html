    <h2>  Some statistics </h2><p>  It is precisely such an implementation of their facilities that is very convenient and beneficial for state-owned construction companies.  In 2014, through electronic bidding, three hundred and ninety-two buyers purchased apartments, and Mosrealstroy helped in this.  Auction reviews have been posted by a wide variety of buyers.  The most interesting thing is that this form of real estate sales quickly gained momentum: already in the first quarter of 2015, two and a half hundred apartments were sold. </p><p>  Addresses are not as numerous as expected in the future.  For the time being, the Solntsevo LCD, On Bazovskaya Street and Nekrasovka will be considered.  All these <span>facilities were built</span> by the KP UGS (Treasury enterprise "Civil Engineering Department").  Apartments in these housing complexes were sold through the Mosrealstroy company.  Reviews about the auction were constantly added, they can be analyzed to form an objective opinion about the company before buying your own home. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  About company </h2><p>  Real estate auctions are held in Roseltorg, this is a single electronic trading platform in Moscow.  The higher the state‚Äôs participation in the construction industry turns out to be in the future, the wider the choice of new buildings for buyers.  Partners of the Mosrealstroy company also left feedback about the auction.  The BEST-Novostroy General Director, for example, noted the increasingly active year-on-year activity of electronic sales. </p><p>  And no wonder, such a purchase has many advantages.  Apartments are sold only fully finished, with decoration and documentation of ownership, which means that the buyer can move into new housing immediately.  Buying an apartment through the Mosrealstroy auction is beneficial for the client.  Electronic bidding makes real estate more or less, but still cheaper, in contrast to acquiring it in another way.  ‚ÄúMore or less‚Äù because the tendering process is basically unpredictable, the price rises differently each time, however, ten to fifteen percent of apartments go at the starting price. </p>

    <h2>  Payment and preparation </h2><p>  The purchase can be paid not only by its own, but also by borrowed funds.  A variety of mortgage programs are available from Vozrozhdenie banks and the reorganized Bank of <span>Moscow, loans are</span> provided for up to thirty years at twelve percent per annum.  Those who wish to purchase an apartment under a mortgage can only take a written confirmation from the selected bank on the approval of a decision on the issuance of a mortgage, but this must be done before the auction. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Many reviews of electronic bidders begin with a list of minuses, that is, those difficulties that had to be encountered.  But everyone notes that if they were initially familiar with the entire auction procedure, the assessment of this enterprise would be completely different.  The first step is to obtain an electronic digital signature, for this service you need to pay about four thousand rubles.  After that comes the turn of registration at Roseltorg, for which it is necessary to scan all the pages of the passport, account details and SNILS.  Only after that a specific lot is selected and a deposit of one hundred thousand rubles is made, which, if won, is counted towards the payment. </p>

    <h2>  Direct bidding </h2><p>  If bidding is not accepted, then one hundred thousand will be returned to the account in five days.  And if participation is accepted, but someone else won, then these one hundred thousand are frozen until the winner buys an apartment (usually ten days).  This is done in order to give the right to purchase to the next participant, if the winner does not make the required amount.  If the winner refused to win, then one hundred thousand will not be returned to him.  If he has not refused, he pays for services - thirty-five thousand rubles.  For these and some other reasons, the lines of many reviews read the chagrin. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Of course, such a process cannot be called simple, even the purchase scheme does not seem to be such.  And in the process of the auction, it becomes clear to many that certain skills are not enough for effective participation in it.  It should be noted that all over the world, through auctions, real estate is most often bought by professionals.  The right choice is important here, because a person cannot submit an application for all tenders at once, he chooses a specific apartment, and it may well turn out that there will be too many people who want to give a little more money for it.  You can combine several auctions, if working capital allows you to freeze it like that. </p>

    <h2>  Tactics </h2><p>  However, the feedback on the auction is very much positive.  Professionals have some tactics for participating in tenders; only very capable people can master it right away.  In Russia, the caste of professionals is just beginning to take shape, and it is precisely those who leave a mark at the auction, psychological observation, patience and the ability to think quickly.  These people call the advantage of electronic bidding much greater opportunities for acquiring a legally clean apartment and at a price sometimes much lower than the market price. </p><p>  They predict that the price advantage will decrease if the auction gains real popularity, and therefore they are reluctant to share secrets or not at all.  The first auction, for example, if there are few participants, leave the price unchanged or increased by one or two percent, but if there are even five or six participants, the price will increase by ten percent.  This, of course, is still small, it will turn out much cheaper than in the regular market.  However, the trend naturally worries them. </p><h2>  Procedure </h2><p>  An electronic bidder needs to have a number of completely specific legal and technical skills and knowledge, including the procurement procedure itself, which is carried out in full accordance with the legislation of the Russian Federation.  Of course, you can involve specialists in the work: entrust the technical questions to the programmer, he will set up the software, and legal issues - to be decided in consultation with a good professional in this field.  However, few buyers decide to independently participate in the auction.  For this purpose, Mosrealstroy offers excellent managers - both courageous and skillful. </p><p>  Turnkey installation of software and an electronic signature will cost at least four thousand, but on average it costs fifteen thousand if the person who wants to take part in the auction has no technical knowledge.  The main drawback of the scheme, as noted in the reviews, is that from the first steps a lot of atypical knowledge and skills are required from the participant, and much more that a limited circle of objects is put up for auction.  It is for the latter reason that buyers are people who are interested in a particular apartment in a particular house, or private investors who are only interested in price. </p>
