That is why the design of kitchen sets include a variety of objects that are not used for cooking.  In particular, a washing machine, built-in under the countertop, is increasingly appearing in the homes of our compatriots.  In fact, it can be put in the <span>bathroom.</span> </p><h2>  Which model is suitable? </h2><p>  It is advisable to choose models with side loading.  There are many modifications on the market that can become part of the kitchen set.  The furniture facade covers them in whole or in part.  Fixing is carried out directly on the body.  A washing machine built in under the countertop can provide considerable space savings. </p>

    <h2>  Important technical points </h2><ol><li>  The parameters of the models considered optimal: depth - 60 cm, width - 60 cm, height - 85 cm. </li><li>  It is advisable that adjustments with feet are available. </li><li>  Volumetric pipes located behind the equipment should be excluded.  Otherwise, it will have to be slightly advanced. </li><li>  To conveniently open the door, you need to allocate additional space (70 cm), but this depends on the design of the kitchen. </li><li>  Due to the rigid fixation in the niche, the washing machine, built-in under the countertop, produces much less noise and practically does not vibrate. </li></ol><h2>  Equipment </h2><ol><li>  If you do not have all the components available, it will not work to put the machine under the countertop.  Before buying, you should always check whether there are special fasteners to a niche.  You will need door hinges. </li><li>  Please note that the detergent drawer must extend for at least 100 mm.  Due to this, you will always have comfortable and easy access to technology. </li><li>  A good option is the built-in washing machines under the countertop, installed together with a <span>washbasin in the bathroom.</span> </li><li>  Models of household appliances that are allowed to be used in this case are approximately 30% more expensive than conventional ones.  If you want to buy them profitably, keep an eye on promotions and sales in stores. </li></ol><h2>  Built-in washing machine device </h2><p>  Take a look at the kitchen furniture.  Surely you will notice that she has a base in stock.  This provides effective protection against dirt and dust.  In addition, the floor in the kitchen is usually washed, not vacuum cleaned.  This is due to a number of limitations.  They concern, among other things, the dimensions that have built-in washing machines under the countertop. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  2 possible height indicators are allowed: </p><ul><li>  82 cm; </li><li>  67 cm. </li></ul><p>  The latest size equipment fits easily into the compartment under the countertop.  The front panel of large-sized cars has a complex shape.  They also have a base in the lower part.  Its outline repeats the outlines of furniture.  For this reason, household appliances are located directly on the floor. </p><p>  The presence of the cap allows to solve 2 problems: </p><ol><li>  The user gets convenient access to the loading window and the detergent drawer.  This may not seem to matter much.  However, if you had to pour powder over the edge of the package, then the importance of this moment is more than clear to you.  And it‚Äôs not so simple - to bend forward to place things inside the washing machine. </li><li>  The useful volume of equipment of this type is increasing.  Here it is possible to establish all sorts of additions.  These are pumps, protection against leaks, etc. The resulting space inside the drum allows, in the end, to place more things for washing. </li></ol><p>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe developers is that the front panel converges with the inner plane of the door.  You can find such modifications that are simply put inside. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  There are more advanced options.  These models have special metal fasteners in the design.  Doors are outweighed on it.  Thanks to this, it is simply impossible to notice the presence of household appliances from the outside.  At the same time, the volume of your kitchen furniture is used to the maximum.  Special elements for hanging magnets and other important products are also often present in it.  This prevents doors from being accidentally opened. </p><h2>  Installation </h2><p>  General tips: </p><ol><li>  Position the drain hose to a minimum height of 60 centimeters.  Relevant tips are also provided in the manual for connecting household appliances.  Do not ignore them. </li><li>  Pay attention only to built-in washing machines under the countertop.  The first model you like is not suitable for this. </li><li>  Installation should never be done on a pedestal, no matter how attractive it may look. </li><li>  Remove the transport bolts before starting work. </li><li>  Do not conduct any actions yourself if you are not confident in your abilities.  It is better to contact the master of the service center. </li><li>  Do not be surprised if, after installing a conventional washing machine, noise will be heard throughout the kitchen.  More often unpleasant vibrating sounds begin during the spin cycle.  This is due to the contact of technology with the countertop. </li></ol><p>  Now let's try to consider the installation of equipment in more detail.  The machine is placed in the space between the two boxes that make up the headset.  In addition, the installation of the furniture facade on the housing of household appliances.  But for this purpose, a separate cabinet can also be used.  The most common option is when a washing machine, built-in under the countertop, is placed between two boxes standing in the neighborhood.  Facades are fixed on their lateral side from the outside. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="countertop built-in washing machines sizes" class="if" height="358" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41149/1193075.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The false panel is needed in order to close the structure from below.  There is no need for a back wall.  Due to its absence, good air circulation is ensured.  In addition, in this case, built-in washing machines under the countertop are easier to connect to the water supply, electrical outlet and sewage system. </p><p>  Depending on the possibility of installing transverse slats in the rear of the cabinet, they speak of its rigidity.  This technique is best placed on the floor.  The design should be as even and strong as possible, if the machine is on the base of the furniture.  In this case, it is important to compare the height of the headset and the "washer."  In some cases, a non-standard countertop level arrangement is required. </p><h2>  Countertop built-in washing machine: dimensions </h2><p>  Differences in technology of this type may relate not only to functionality, but also to dimensions.  There is a huge spread.  As mentioned earlier, in our case, a front-loading model is required.  She will be able to take a worthy place in a small kitchen.  It can be installed under the countertop.  In this regard, often in the configuration there is a removable top cover. </p>

    <p>  Built-in washing machines under the <span>countertop dimensions</span> are standard with respect to height and width.  But their depth sometimes does not exceed 33 cm. For high-quality and durable operation, such indicators are optimal.  If you are going to put the equipment under the sink, you will have to pay attention not only to narrow, but also to low models. </p>
