    <p>  Among the first and most necessary clothes of a newborn man is his hat.  Such a baby is still very small, his skin is quite delicate, and therefore the cap for the newborn must meet a number of criteria. </p><p>  The very first and most stringent requirements are placed on the material from which it is made.  It should be a very soft, high-quality material or threads that will not cause irritation on the skin, and will not change their color in case of moisture.  Sometimes it is a combination of fabric and knitted fabric.  Moreover, what will be outside, and what is inside, will depend on the taste of the parents themselves.  If we are talking about a warm hat, then the material for its manufacture should be fleece, wool or woolen threads. </p><p>  If your baby will have a hat for a newborn with knitting needles, then pay attention to special threads for babies.  They can be synthetic, but the cap knitted from them will not only not inferior to the wool in its properties, but even surpass it in a number of parameters.  If the product is knitted for the summer season, then pay attention to the cotton threads.  Depending on their thickness, you will have a hat for the newborn for hot weather, protecting the baby from the scorching sun, or for a colder period when you need to not only protect the baby's head from the sun, but also hide the ears from the wind.  The color of the cap can be very diverse.  Some of the parents will prefer pastel colors, someone will have bright, fun coloring - this is not so important.  The main thing is that the dyes used in the manufacture of these materials do not cause any allergic reactions. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  No less stringent requirements than for the material are presented to the quality of sewing or <span>knitting hats.</span>  Everyone cuts out so that she does not slip off the baby and constantly covers his ears.  Seams are always cleaned out, since very often they are the main source of inconvenience and anxiety crumbs.  If the cap is two-layer, then the seams may appear inside between the layers.  But in any case, the child should not even guess what they are there. </p><p>  The variety of execution can only be envied.  Almost always, the cap accurately follows the contours of the child‚Äôs head.  In most cases, a hat for a newborn is, of course, a traditional bonnet decorated with various patterns, ornaments and lace.  You should not choose for her a very complex ornament or pattern.  Such a cap for a newborn may lose the ability to accurately repeat the contour of the child‚Äôs head.  It will no longer be soft, comfortable and light.  These are one more requirements presented to this class of products. </p><p>  If you decide that your child should have a hat-cap, then start knitting from the back, knitting a rectangular cloth, the width of which will be equal to the back of the head, and the height to the height of the product.  Since such a hat should knit seamlessly, dial an equal number of loops on both sides of the fabric.  Knit on a cloth equal in length to the distance from the crown of the child to the forehead.  Loops can be closed.  The base of the <span>cap for newborns with knitting needles</span> is ready.  Now it needs to be decorated.  Very often, the decoration element is lace, knitted or crocheted and sewn along the line where the extra loops were made to the initial rectangular fabric.  You can also buy satin ribbons, which will not only decorate the hat, but can also become strings for tying it.  However, the ropes can also be crocheted. </p><p>  In any case, no matter what hat you plan to tie to your child, the main thing is to do it with love and utmost accuracy, and then you will be guaranteed success. </p>
