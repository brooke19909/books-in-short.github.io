This word is primarily associated with the heroes of A. Dumas novels - the famous French musketeers.  Many will be surprised to learn that the first musket did not appear in France at all, and the French have nothing to do with its invention.  And for the first time they learned what a musket was in completely unpleasant circumstances. </p><h2>  The history of the appearance of the musket </h2><p>  By the beginning of the 16th century, soldiers' equipment had reached such a level that the ‚Äúlight‚Äù firearms available at that time simply lost their effectiveness.  Bullets fired from an arquebus (the forerunner of a musket), due to their low weight (18-20 grams) and small caliber, could not penetrate the armor and chain mail of enemy soldiers.  A new weapon was required, with increased destructive properties.  And the invention of gunpowder has become a fundamental factor in the modernization of weapons and the creation of a musket. </p>

    <h2>  Who invented the musket </h2><p>  The first musket (a gun with a long barrel and a wick lock) appeared in Spain, and it was invented by some historians, the Spanish gunsmith Mokketo from the city of Veletra.  His invention had a barrel, the length of which reached 140 cm. It was the increase in barrel length that made it possible to increase the caliber of the gun and the mass of the charge of gunpowder, and, accordingly, its firing range and penetration capabilities. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  But to increase the length of the barrel just allowed granular gunpowder.  He did not need to be pushed to the breech of the gun with a ramrod, as was required to do with the powder pulp sticking to the walls of the barrel bore.  Now the granules of gunpowder were poured to the breech without assistance, and from above the wad clogged with a ramrod.  In addition, such gunpowder burned tightly and evenly, which also increased the initial speed and range of the bullet. </p><h2>  Characteristics of the first musket </h2><p>  The total length of the musket was 180 cm, and it weighed about 8 kg, so when shooting needed support.  A buffet was set up (stand), which stuck into the ground at one end, and the supporting barrel lay on the other. </p>

    <p>  With an increase in caliber to 23 mm (in the arquebus, it was 15-17 mm), the weight of the bullet also increased.  At the musket, she began to weigh 50-60 grams.  The firing range was 200-240 meters, and at that distance the bullet easily penetrated the most durable armor.  However, to get into the enemy from the musket, one had to try very hard.  The probability that a two-by-two-meter target set at a distance of 70 meters would be hit was only 60%. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition, only a person who has good physical fitness could withstand a powerful return when fired.  In order to somehow soften the blow, a stuffed pillow was put on the shoulder, playing the role of a shock absorber. </p><p>  In order to charge the musket, a whole ritual was required. </p><h2>  How to charge the muskets </h2><p>  The musket was charged through the muzzle.  The powder necessary for firing a single shot spilled out of it from a special wooden case (charger).  Gunpowder in the chargers, which were suspended on the gunner‚Äôs belt, was measured in advance.  Fine powder was sprinkled on the seed shelf of the musket from sodas (small powder magazine).  The bullet was pushed into the barrel with the help of a ramrod.  The charge was ignited using a smoldering wick, which was pressed by a lever against the seed shelf.  Gunpowder ignited and pushed a bullet. </p>

    <p>  Thus, it took about 2 minutes to prepare for the shot, while it was considered a good rate of fire. </p><p>  Initially, only infantry was armed with muskets, and the calculation for serving the musket consisted of two people: the second number monitored the burning wick, and also carried ammunition and a buffet table. </p><h2>  <span>The battle tactics</span> for the musketeers </h2><p>  Due to the low rate of fire, special tactics were used to use the muskets.  The soldiers, armed with muskets, were lined up in a rectangular square, the depth of which could reach 12 lines.  After the first line made a volley, it gave way to the next, while itself retreated to the end of the line to reload the muskets.  Thus, the shooting was conducted almost continuously.  The musketeers performed all actions on command, including the loading process. </p>

    <h2>  Armed with muskets of Europe </h2><p>  In 1515, the French first learned what a musket is, in a battle with Spanish soldiers.  Musket bullets easily pierced the strongest armor.  The Spaniards, with the help of their long-barreled novelties, won an unconditional victory over the French. </p><p>  In 1521, the muskets were already massively adopted by the Spanish army.  And in 1525, again in a battle with the French, which received the historical name "Battle of Pavia", the Spaniards showed in all their glory all the superiority of muskets over other weapons.  The musketeers proved to be an insurmountable wall for the French cavalry. </p><p>  It was after this battle that the musket was decided to find out better in Europe.  They began to arm infantry units in France and Germany, and subsequently - and other European states. </p><p>  In the future, the musket began to undergo improvements.  The gunsmiths from Germany replaced the wick <span>lock with silicon.</span>  The trigger, which replaced the lever, released a spring with flint, which when struck on the chair, sparks sparked, igniting gunpowder.  The need for a wick has disappeared. </p><p>  The Dutch improved the barrel.  They replaced the metal from which it was made, with softer.  This ruled out cases of his rupture during the shot. </p><p>  The Spaniards, borrowing the experience of the Dutch and lightening the musket to 4.5 kg, created weapons for the cavalry.  Such a musket became universal, it could be used in any kind of army, which was done in all European armies. </p>
