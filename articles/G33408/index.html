After the decision to transform it into the liberated territory, they decided to make a green recreation area for the townspeople.  That is how a landscaped park appeared on this place.  A little later, it was decided to establish a sculptural composition in it.  In 1868, the monument was completed to the poet Alexei Koltsov, who was born in Voronezh.  The artist-architect Alexander Cui and the sculptor Augustino Tricorni worked on the creation of the monument.  The sculpture became the second largest and most important in the city, and the square chosen for its installation was called Koltsovsky.

Everything changed in 1877, it was then that a fountain appeared in the park.  All residents of the city came to see the novelty, and the square became a real attraction.  In fairness, it is worth noting that the fountain had a fairly simple design and minimal decor, but objects of this type themselves were rare for their time.  Not all areas of Voronezh could boast of their own water decorations.  Thanks to what the central fountain has become incredibly popular.  However, already in 1900 the park was partially abandoned, and this fact caused great discontent among the residents of the city.  Due to numerous complaints from the townspeople, the local government had to tackle landscaping again and strengthen the security of the facility.  But despite the return of the park to its original form, in the 20s of the XX century, according to old-timers, a flea market periodically developed here and there was no ideal purity.

However, this was not always the case.  During World War II, German soldiers buried their comrades who fell on the battlefield on its territory.  And immediately after the liberation of the city, the park looked deplorable, representing one large cemetery with rickety, hastily hammered crosses.  Fortunately, today only a few photographs that lost their colors from time remind of those times.  After the war, the city administration decided to rebury the remains and return the square to the townspeople.  Many other areas of Voronezh were restored by a similar principle. </p><h2>  Fountain in Koltsovsky Square </h2>

The new sculpture was made based on the poem "stolen sun."  A crocodile is located in the center, children dance around it, and fish are sprayed with water from above the kids.  But the transformations did not end there either, already in 1977 the fountain became light and music.  It is worth noting that the illumination of water cascades with colored lamps at that time also only began to be used in our country.  Nowadays, the object works not only in summer but also in winter - instead of water, you can admire LED strips instead of water, changing the brightness of the glow in time with the music.  Nowadays, one of the most interesting sights in the city center is the fountain in Koltsovsky Square.  Many tourists visit Voronezh not only because of it, but if you decide to come here, be sure to take the time to visit this park.
