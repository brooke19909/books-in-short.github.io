Owner reviews are not unambiguous.  On the one hand, users note the build quality, rich feature set and high quality wash.  But on the other hand, they point out minor flaws.

And this is a serious omission on the part of the manufacturer.  Another key feature of the machine is the presence of a superfast wash program.  The device launders things in just an hour.
