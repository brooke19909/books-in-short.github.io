    <p>  Abraham's father was a poor farmer.  A boy from a young age is used to hard physical labor.  The family was not able to pay for the child's education at school.  Abraham finished only 1 grade.  But this year was enough for him to learn to read and love books. </p><p>  Already as an adult youth, Abraham decided to engage in self-education.  He successfully passed the exams and was admitted to law practice. </p><h2>  The political career of Abraham Lincoln </h2><p>  The political career of Abraham Lincoln began with membership in the Legislative Assembly of his home state of Illinois.  Next - the post of congressman in the House of Representatives of the US Congress and the unsuccessful nomination of his candidacy for the post of senator. </p>

    <p>  The Lincoln initiative to create a Republican party that would fight slavery in the country was supported by many.  In 1860, when he was 51 years old, the Republican Party nominated him during the presidential election.  And the people gave the majority of the votes for him. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The southern states, having learned about the results of the vote, decided to create a Confederation, split the country into 2 parts.  In America, a civil war broke out, which lasted 4 years (1861-1865).  No matter how hard Abraham Lincoln tried to rally the people, calling for patriotism, he did not succeed.  Then the president had to send troops to suppress the rebellion.  The military operation was successful, and the southern states returned to America.  But during this period, another misfortune occurred in the president‚Äôs family - his third son, 11-year-old William Lincoln, died. </p><h2>  Presidency Results </h2><p>  For all the time during which Abraham Lincoln served as president, slavery was abolished in the country, a transcontinental railway was built, the Homestead Act was adopted, which solved all the problems in the agricultural sector.  He strongly promoted the Reconstruction of the State plan, involving even political opponents for the overall work of America's development. </p><h2>  The death of the 16th president </h2><p>  Abraham Lincoln is the first US president to be killed.  During a visit to the theater, a man was killed by a bullet.  The people of America still honor the memory of their beloved president. </p>

    <h2>  President's family </h2><p>  Abraham met Mary Todd when he worked as a lawyer in Illinois.  The girl held a high position in society, but this did not stop her from falling in love with her future husband.  Young people got married after 2 years - in 1842.  In this marriage, they had four children. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The fate of one of the children of the 16th president of the United States ended especially tragically.  Two younger sons of the president fell ill with a disease similar to pneumonia.  One child survived, the other did not. </p><h2>  Biography of William Lincoln </h2><p>  The boy was the third child in the family.  The years of life of William Lincoln: 1850-1862  In the family of the boy, Willy was most often abbreviated.  He and his younger brother Todd were the most mischievous children in the family and constantly turned their father‚Äôs law firm in Springfield upside down. </p><p>  After the inauguration of Abraham Lincoln, the whole family had to move to the White House.  There, the boys quickly made friends with the children of Julia Taft and dabbled all the time.  But one prank was especially remembered.  William Lincoln with Tod and the Taft brothers somehow drove a goat into the reception room of the White House.  There were a lot of visitors at this time.  People were shocked and scared by the appearance of an unexpected guest. </p><p>  There is information that during training, William Lincoln showed abilities in the exact sciences and mathematics.  In addition, the child loved creativity.  The boy successfully engaged in drawing and composed poems. </p>

    <h2>  The death of the president‚Äôs son </h2><p>  In 1862, during the Civil War, William Lincoln and his brother Todd fell ill with some unknown disease.  By symptoms, it resembled pneumonia.  An abdominal disease such as typhoid was unknown to doctors at the time.  Unfortunately, only one of the sons of Abraham Lincoln recovered from the disease - the youngest (Todd). </p><p>  William Lincoln was in a dangerous, unstable state throughout his illness.  Doctors tried to do everything they could, but did not save the child.  Early in the morning of February 20, 1862, the boy died. </p><p>  This tragedy affected everyone in the president‚Äôs family.  Abraham himself constantly cried for a month and was on the verge of a nervous breakdown.  For three months the president could not return to work.  His wife Mary locked herself in the room for a long time. </p><h2>  The funeral </h2><p>  The funeral of William Lincoln took place on February 24.  In 1865, after the death of the president, at the request of his mother, the boy‚Äôs body was exhumed.  The remains were transferred to the Abraham Lincoln hearse and taken to Springfield. </p><p>  At home, the boy‚Äôs body was reburied at Oak Ridge Cemetery next to his father.  And in 1871, the remains of William were transferred to the family crypt. </p>
