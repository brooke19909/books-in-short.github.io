  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Remote control and management S2000-M. Control and control panel fire and security</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In order to avoid fires at various sites, timely detection of fire hazardous situations is required.  For this, fire alarms were developed.  They represent a wide range of hardware and software elements. </p><p>  The control panel S2000-M is an integral part of this complex.  When integrated into the Orion security complex, PKU can control light, sound, and voice annunciators, control <span>fire extinguishing</span> using gas, powder, aerosol, and water fire extinguishing types.  The console is able to interact with smoke protection and engineering systems of the controlled facility. </p><h2>  Remote Assignment </h2><p>  When operating in a block-modular complex according to the instructions, C2000-M performs: </p><ul><li>  collecting data on addressable detectors, signaling loops of the control unit, receives information about the state of actuators and modules; </li><li>  control over light indication and sound notification when triggered by such modes as "Alarm", "Fire", "Start" and others; </li><li>  management functions for the supervision of the fire and security equipment;  This mode has protection against external unauthorized interference; </li><li>  control of executive elements, including smoke removal and fire extinguishing means, as well as signaling of the modes "Fire", "Fault", "Alarm" and "Start"; </li><li>  handling and recording of incidents with subsequent recording in memory; </li><li>  supervision of the presence of communication between modular devices and their information contact. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="molnia35.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fire alarm installation" class="if uuid-2357756" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/50398/2357756.jpg"></div><p>  The instructions for S2000-M indicate that the console is not equipped with its own circuits for switching sirens, it does not have outputs for working with actuators and transmitting signal information to other systems.  This work is performed by various units that are connected to the RS-485 trunk.  Such devices can be "S2000-Perimeter", "S2000-BI / BKI / K / KS / SP / KDL / SMK / IR", "Signal-10/20", "Potok-3N" and others. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Device operation </h2><p>  The visual notification of the Fire, Start, Fault, Shutdown, and Stop modes is represented by red indicators during a fire and start, as well as yellow during a stop, malfunction, or shutdown.  All this characterizes the presence of fire hazardous events, the functioning of activated or stopped protection devices, a malfunction or a complete shutdown of system elements. </p><p>  The S2000M control and control panel is equipped with a symbolic liquid crystal panel that displays data on recorded fires, activated or deactivated fire protection devices, and inoperative system elements.  The display shows when the "Alarm" mode is triggered. </p><p>  Sound notification during the "Alarm", "Fire", "Start" or "Fault" function is provided by the built-in sound speaker.  The signals of these modes are transmitted to the central console for recording incidents or to another system by controlling the outputs of the so-called "dry contact" type.  "Fire" and "Start" are triggered when the contacts are connected, and "Alarm" and "Fault" - when disconnected. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sursys.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="security system remote" class="if uuid-2357738" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/50398/2357738.jpg"></div><h2>  Control Panel Features </h2><p>  The controls of the S2000-M console allow you to control fire and burglar alarms.  The following command actions are available: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  the ability to reset <span>alarms</span> in the zone; </li><li>  resetting the operation of triggered sirens; </li><li>  activation or deactivation of certain zones or its individual elements, for example, alarm loops, detectors, etc. </li><li>  correction of the activation mode of addressable sensors from false or test exposure. </li></ul><p>  Sound and light annunciators should be controlled using launch blocks of type S2000-KPB or "Signal-20".  Voice announcements are carried out using serial devices such as "Shout". </p><p>  The S2000-M control and control panel activates detectors during situations such as: </p><ul><li>  triggering of one or more automatic warning devices; </li><li>  triggering of a manual warning device; </li><li>  signal about the operational start of the fire extinguishing system. </li></ul><p>  Alerts are also triggered by the manual manipulation of S2000-M controls and S2000-PT blocks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="partners.bolid.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="alarm management" class="if uuid-2357723" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/50398/2357723.jpg"></div><h2>  Additional functions </h2><p>  The S2000-M control device provides the ability to carry out repair measures by temporarily shutting down the controlled <span>fire extinguishing system</span> organs <span>.</span> </p><p>  It makes it possible to view information on the resistance of the alarm loop, according to the level of contamination of the detectors, provides data on the battery capacity, voltage in the power circuit, temperature and humidity.  The S2000-M control and control panel can work with a personal computer on which the Orion Pro complex software on the basis of the RS-232 shell is preinstalled. </p><div class="photo" data-original="po-krupnomu.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="control panel" class="if uuid-2357713" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/50398/2357713.jpg"></div><h2>  Device and appearance </h2><p>  The control panel is a plastic box measuring 140 x 114 x 25 mm.  At the top is a liquid crystal monochrome information display.  Below it are single light indicators: </p><ul><li>  "Fire" - a red indicator that indicates fire situations. </li><li>  "Start" - informs about activated devices by a red indicator. </li><li>  "Stop" - presence of suspended elements of the fire alarm, indicator - yellow. </li><li>  "Fault" - a yellow indicator of the presence of faults in the system. </li><li>  "Disconnect" - deactivated devices, yellow indicator. </li><li>  "Mute" - the internal signal speaker is turned off, the yellow indicator. </li><li>  "Power" - a green indicator informing about the state of nutrition. </li></ul><p>  An electronic board with remote control sensors is mounted inside the case.  The board has reserved a place for a battery for power supply in the absence of a network and inputs for external switching. </p><p>  The price of the S2000-M remote control depends on the region of sale and, on average, ranges from 6,500 to 7,000 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="-24." data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="alarm loops" class="if uuid-2357747" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/50398/2357747.jpg"></div><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The manufacturer's stated lifetime is 10 years.  The design features of the console allow it to function in emergency mode and suggest its fire safety in case of violation of the rules of use. </p><p>  The device is designed to work around the clock.  Power is supplied from sources with a direct current voltage of 12 or 24 V. The system must always have a backup power source. </p><p>  Link Length: </p><ul><li>  on the RS-485 interface - does not exceed 3000 m; </li><li>  on the RS-232 interface - 20 m. </li></ul><p>  According to the characteristics of S2000-M, the device can be restored, it is serviced and supports up to 2047 users. </p>
