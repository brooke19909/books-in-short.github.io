And though she is very beautiful, but he did not participate in its manufacture. </p><h2>  The main thing is participation </h2><p>  Psychologists believe that the child should prepare the crafts themselves, and parents can help him in something.  And this will affect its development, self-esteem. </p><p>  New Year is a magical holiday that all children are waiting for.

It will be very interesting for him.  Children love to sculpt, stick and paint something.  And here are a few options for how to make <span>winter crafts</span> yourself.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Snowman from a plastic plate </h2><p>  No need for a kindergarten child to offer to make too complicated winter crafts with their own hands.  He can‚Äôt do it on his own, and it‚Äôs completely uninteresting to watch how mom masters and glues something.  Offer to try to make such a cute snowman, which can then be hung on a Christmas tree. </p><p>  It‚Äôs better to get creative while playing.  First, you need to interest the child by asking which fairy-tale character you can fashion from snow, and then suggest making it from improvised materials.  A 4-5 year old baby with her mother‚Äôs help will be able to make a winter do-it-yourself craft from an ordinary plastic plate, paper and paints. </p><p>  On the table in front of the child should lay out everything that is needed in the process.  He must independently determine what part to work with at each stage. </p><p>  So, take a deep plastic plate.  A snowman's face will be made of it.  It should be in a circle to make incisions of 1-1.5 cm. </p><p>  Next up is work with colored paper.  Adults should help the child draw on a sheet of appropriate color a carrot, several circles for the mouth, a beautiful hat and jewelry for the toy.  Eyes can also be made of paper, but purchased ones, those designed for applications and fabric toys, will look prettier. </p><p>  Invite your child to try to cut out some detail.  Adapting to scissors is not so easy to small handles.  But carving is a great method for developing fine motor skills.  In the end, if the baby fails, adults will always help. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  When all the details are prepared, you can begin to design a snowman.  First, the child glues the eyes one by one, then with the help of PVA glue - a nose from a carrot and a mouth from black circles.  To make the snowman look elegant and festive, you should stick a hat on his head and decorate it to your taste.  Glossy paper, foil, beads and rhinestones can be used.  It remains to attach a rope, by which it will be possible to hang a snowman on a Christmas tree. </p><p>  This type of winter crafts (do it yourself) for the kindergarten are very suitable.  The child does everything almost independently, and in the creative process, motor skills, imagination, and thinking also develop. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY DIY crafts for kindergarten" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5137/1050594.jpg" width="396"></div>

    <h2>  The game of designers.  Family crafts for kindergarten - sleigh and snowman </h2><p>  Since the teacher gave the task to the competition to make winter crafts in the kindergarten with her own hands, it is necessary to fulfill it.  And best of all, by connecting the whole family to creativity, play designers. </p><p>  Each participant will have his own task.  Of course, the child will not only be busy in the process, but will also head the position of the head of the family design group.  Let the kid try to reveal his organizational abilities and feel like a real leader.  This will increase his self-esteem and affect the formation of character. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Creative process </h2><p>  Participants receive a task from the leader.  Mom will take care of a snowman.  From a synthetic winterizer with the help of a needle and thread, two balls should be made for the body of a winter fairy-tale hero.  From threads, multi-colored fabric and decorative wire wrapped in fluffy yarn, make him hands, headphones, pompons on the body and carrots.  After that you need to sew all the details of the snowman figure with a thread, finish the decorative elements, and glue the eyes.  Mom can be congratulated - she did her job. </p><p>  The kid, although a creative director who monitors how to make winter crafts with his own hands for the kindergarten, must also take part.  His task is to decorate ice cream sticks with multi-colored paints.  For a baby 3-4 years old, such a task is within its power.  If the child is older, you can entrust him with the cutting of small snowflakes from snow-white napkins and their subsequent gluing on a sled.  Then you need to glue the ice cream sticks so that you get a sled, attach a rope to them, and also firmly seat the snowman so that he does not accidentally fall at the crucial moment. </p>
