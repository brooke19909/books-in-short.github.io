But today every minute counts, and so I want to spend this time with benefit, and not waste it.  Naturally, I want to carry out calculations quickly and with maximum comfort.  It is for this that the terminals were invented.  So, let's figure it out: POS-terminal - what is it, how to use it, why is it needed. </p><h2>  What is a POS terminal? </h2><p>  This is a special set of programs in the device intended for retail.  In other words, this is a kind of cashier job.  It can easily replace a <span>cash register.</span>  As in a regular cash register, all operations are recorded on a receipt tape and stored in the device‚Äôs memory.  Today, the POS-terminal is able to displace conventional cash registers due to flexible software with the possibility of constant updating. </p>

They are even registered in the State Register, as well as ordinary cash registers. </p><p>  As for the device, it consists of a small monitor, a system unit, a display for a customer, a keyboard for data entry, a card reader, a printer for receipts, a fiscal part and a program. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How does a POS terminal work? </h2><p>  What is it, we imagine about it, but how does it work? </p>

    <p>  The operation of such a terminal is very similar to the way a regular cash register works.  Although this device not only takes into account the number of sales, it also saves other data that can later be retrieved for analysis.  In addition, this equipment allows you to receive information about purchases, check, change and perform various kinds of reporting.  Sometimes, customers think that such terminals only allow payments by credit card.  But this is a completely erroneous opinion.  Cash payment can also be made. </p><h2>  Where can I use the terminals? </h2><p>  What such a device allows you to do calculations, we have already figured out, but where is it used? </p><p>  Many external devices are connected to the device itself, which allows you to use it even in small shops.  There is nothing even to talk about large retail chains.  The terminal can work even in offline mode, so you can also use it in kiosks. </p><p>  The device weighs a little, it looks compact.  In addition, it consumes very little energy.  Selling with such a device is very easy and fast, because it carries out most of the operations on its own, and the resulting reports can be submitted to the tax office.  The machines also help prevent cashier errors. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  How to choose the right one? </h2><p>  So, let's figure out how to choose POS-terminals? </p><p>  What is a successful store?  This is not only fresh produce, low prices, but also high <span>quality service.</span>  Service becomes better if there is a POS terminal, but how to choose it? </p><p>  First of all, the choice depends on the format of the store and how the place for the cashier is arranged.  If the cashier is sitting facing the customer, as is usually done in hypermarkets, then only modular terminals can be used.  With a classic landing, special requirements are not presented, so you can use both modular and monoblock. </p><h2>  What is needed for installation? </h2><p>  In order to be able to install a POS terminal, a place must be equipped for it.  Requires an electrical outlet, a dedicated Internet or telephone line.  If all this is available, the installation will be carried out by a company that sells such terminals, and in a short time.  It is also required to register the device with a special service, especially if they do not use wireless channels for data transfer. </p>

    <p>  Despite the fact that cash registers, which we used to see, still occupy a leading position, they are actively using a new element base, just like hard drives are replaced by flash drives and SSD-drives.  Today terminals with touch displays are very popular. </p><h2>  Is it safe to use POS terminals? </h2><p>  In general, now we are well aware of what an ATM and a terminal are, as well as what they differ from each other.  Not a single outlet has the right to work without a cash register, therefore the reliability of POS-terminals is checked with special care.  They are manufactured to specific standards.  Debugged production, careful observance of quality control - this is what distinguishes these products from ordinary office computers.  As a rule, models have a production period of up to 7 years, this makes it possible not to run into marriage and guarantee the availability of spare parts if necessary. </p><p>  If we talk about what a terminal is at the airport, then it‚Äôs worth saying that it is no different from others. </p><p>  As for business, here it is necessary to point out the protection of investments.  Also, if you have the same equipment in all stores, you can many times reduce the cost of maintenance, updating and modernization. </p><p>  Today POS-terminals (what is described above) are sold by many companies.  It is best to purchase products from a reliable supplier who has been operating on the market for many years. </p>
