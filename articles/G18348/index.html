  <section class="page js-page"><h1>2 kopecks (1990). Description and cost</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Imagine a coin minted more than 2000 years ago.  This Greek silver coin is called Draha.  Perhaps you saw her at an auction, and you were offered to buy her for a decent price.  Would you agree? </p><p>  Even if you are not a numismatist, you would still think about this acquisition.  And all because this is a very rare and valuable coin, which went out of circulation at the end of the 1st century A.D.  Modern coins that are no longer used have a certain value.  In this article we will talk about one of them - 2 kopeks of 1990. </p><p>  It should be noted right away that the value of many coins varies for several reasons: </p><ul><li>  circulation; </li><li>  state; </li><li>  various marriages (flaws). </li></ul><p>  For example, if you have a coin in excellent condition, without any cracks, and the total circulation of which is several units, then its cost will be prohibitive. </p><h2>  Obverse </h2><p>  On one side (obverse) of this coin (2 kopeks of 1990) is the symbolism of the Soviet Union: in the center is the country's coat of arms, below it is the abbreviation of the USSR.  The coat of arms includes an image: </p><ol><li>  Planets in the rays of the rising sun, on which meridians and parallels are clearly visible. </li><li>  Sickle and hammer located in the center of the globe. </li><li>  A small five-pointed star above the planet. </li><li>  Framing the composition with spikelets of wheat interlaced with ribbon. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="coins.su" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="2 kopeks 1990 price" class="if uuid-2514418" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78450/2514418.jpg"></div><p>  Interestingly, there are 15 turns on the ribbon that weaves the wheat.  Why exactly 15?  This is a symbol: at the time when this coin was minted, the Soviet Union included 15 republics, so these turns were not set randomly. </p><h2>  Reverse </h2><p>  The reverse of the coin has always remained unchanged.  The big number ‚Äú2‚Äù, denoting the face value, the inscription ‚Äúpenny‚Äù and the year of manufacture ‚Äú1990‚Äù. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="2 kopeks 1990 price" class="if uuid-2514416" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78450/2514416.jpg"></div><p>  But there are several differences that can only be found on the reverse.  As you know, 2 kopeks of 1990 were minted at different <span>mints: Moscow</span> and Leningrad.  Therefore, if you look at the Leningrad instance, you can see that the face value of the coin - the number ‚Äú2‚Äù - is slightly thinner than that of the Moscow one. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the price of 2 kopeks in 1990 does not change.  Such differences do not affect its value.  But let's find out what exactly can affect the price. </p><h2>  2 kopeks 1990: price </h2><p>  This coin does not have any expensive varieties for which it can be sold at a higher price.  All copies are the same at any auction, but only if they are in good condition.  Therefore, for this coin, as a rule, they offer from 5 to 10 rubles.  But there is one feature: if it is in the UNC state, then its cost can increase to 110 rubles or more.  Therefore, if you have such a coin, and it has a great look, then you should immediately find a good buyer. </p>
