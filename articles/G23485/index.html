A. Lisavenko is one of the most famous nurseries in Russia.  Representatives of local flora are grown here, as well as plants from other climatic zones. </p><h2>  Create Arboretum </h2><p>  In 1933, under the guidance of the biological scientist M. Lisavenko, A.A. began to plant plants in the Altai stronghold of the Michurinsky Research Institute in Oirot-Tur. </p><p>  And in 1953 <span>M.A. Lisovenko created an arboretum in Barnaul, helped the scientist in this Z. I. Archer - the founder of decorative gardening.</span>  <span>The first seedlings were brought from the Altai mountains.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="vesti22.tv" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Arbor M.A. Lisavenko" class="if uuid-3242440" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102939/3242440.jpg"></div><h2>  general characteristics </h2><p>  Currently, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthis botanical garden is about 10 hectares, on which about 1000 species of trees and shrubs from 130 genera grow.  The nursery contains plants from European, Asian and North American regions. </p><p>  The work of arboretum specialists is as follows: </p><ul><li>  Conservation of rare and endangered plants.  Their collection has 71 species, of which 30 are listed in the Red Book of the Russian Federation.  For example, the Manchurian kirkazon, the cross-biota microbiota. </li><li>  Introduction.  When plants from other zones are acclimatized, special attention is paid to their frost resistance. </li><li>  Selection.  New varieties of tulips, primroses, phloxes, peonies, rhododendrons, blue Altai spruce were bred. </li><li>  Organized tours for city guests, schools and universities.  You can visit the arboretum in Barnaul on your own. </li><li>  For the improvement of the regions of South-Western Siberia, more than 230 plant species have been collected.  There is a large number of herbaceous perennials, as well as flowering shrubs and decorative deciduous trees. </li><li>  Realization of fruit, berry and decorative crops. </li><li>  Consultations when working on landscape design: the choice of plants and their placement on the site. </li><li>  Help in landscaping the Altai Territory.  For improvement, more than 4 million seedlings of trees and shrubs, and about 6 million perennial herbaceous plants were allocated. </li></ul><h2>  Principles of selecting plants in the arboretum collection </h2><p>  The climate in Siberia is continental and sharply continental.  This means that there is not only cold winters, but also a sharp drop in daily and annual temperatures. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Due to such climatic features, only hardy crops that can withstand short hot summers and long cold winters survive in the nurseries of the Barnaul arboretum. </p><p>  Each plant in the nursery has its own passport - a document that contains data on its development: germination time, development, acclimatization. </p><div class="photo" data-original="katun24.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Decorative planting plants" class="if uuid-3242403" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102939/3242403.jpg"></div><p>  In the photo of the arboretum (Barnaul) presented in the article, you can see a collection of decorative leafy perennials. </p><p>  The plant fund is replenished through special expeditions, as well as through the exchange of seeds and cuttings with other countries: Canada, USA, Germany, Great Britain, Belgium, China. </p><h2>  Departments of the Arboretum </h2><p>  The arrangement of plants in the park has a certain order.  They are grouped according to characteristics that combine their ecology and geographical location.  Departments are formed here: </p><ul><li>  Far East. </li><li>  Central Asia and Kazakhstan. </li><li>  The middle strip of Russia. </li><li>  Western Siberia. </li><li>  Eastern Siberia. </li><li>  North America. </li><li>  Japan, China, Korea. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.vipgeo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hybrid mock-up &quot;Camomile&quot;" class="if uuid-3242402" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102939/3242402.jpg"></div><p>  At the entrance to the arboretum in Barnaul, there is a flower garden, which includes one and a half dozen varieties of lilacs and mock orange, which is colloquially called jasmine.  After the flower garden, visitors go to the department of hybrids, forms and varieties.  Most of them relate to trees and shrubs. </p><p>  In the Far Eastern department, most of the species of maples that are located in the garden grows.  There are 24 varieties in total.  Of particular note is the riverine maple, whose leaves in autumn acquire a bright red color.  For this feature, the arboretum workers nicknamed the tree a ‚Äúred light‚Äù.  The Aralia Manchurian also lives here.  Because of the thorns, it is popularly called the Devil's Tree. </p><p>  The Central Asian department has the least representatives of the flora.  This is due to a significant difference in climate between regions. </p><p>  In the section of central Russia, the trees dominating for this region grow: linden, oak, elm and spruce. </p><p>  The Siberian department comprises the majority of familiar and widespread species for the Altai Territory.  However, here you can meet new plants.  For example, willow brittle, having a spherical crown shape. </p><p>  The North American division includes about 190 species of trees and shrubs.  One of the representatives - horse chestnut naked.  Its seeds and roots are covered with poisonous thorns. </p><p>  Plants from Japan, China and Korea are planted in a rocky garden.  These are mainly stunted flowering species with horizontal branches.  These include forzition ovoid - a shrub that is covered with yellow flowers in spring. </p><p>  Employees of the Institute of Horticulture in Siberia monitor the order and condition of the arboretum in Barnaul.  The garden provides guided tours for a small fee. </p>
