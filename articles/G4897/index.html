However, some people, in spite of this, prefer to make clothes, accessories and even shoes for themselves and loved ones on their own.  Why?  And because the creative process allows not only to get a unique thing, but also to have fun.  Here are just a lot of beginner needlewomen do not know where to start.  Especially for them, we have prepared an article.  In it, we will talk about how to knit slippers with knitting needles. </p><h2>  Features of the preparatory phase </h2><p>  Before you begin to study the instructions and the implementation of the original product, you need to think through or come up with the desired model.  After all, slippers come on a knitted sole, felt or the one that is left over from old shoes.  After that, you should choose yarn to the desired option.  It is best to use natural materials.  They allow the legs to breathe, do not cause sweating and unpleasant odors. </p><p>  It is also worth taking care of comfortable knitting needles.  The ideal option would be metal.  The main thing is to check whether they have defects.  In addition, it is important to note that you can knit slippers from old clothes.  But it should first be cut into strips about the width of a finger.  Having chosen the style and design of slippers, having prepared the material and the tool, you can proceed to the next stage. </p><h2>  Using the finished sole </h2><p>  In order to tie slippers that are very similar to real, you need to take any old or unnecessary shoes.  Carefully separate the sole, trying to keep the insole as possible.  Then take an awl or a sharp fork.  And using the selected tool, make holes equidistant from each other along the upper edge of the sole of the sole.  To make dense material pierced easier, professional knitters advise the tip of the fork or the awl to be preheated.  To do this, use an ordinary candle. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Felt-soled slippers </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to knit slippers" class="if uuid-2909601" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2909601.jpg"></div><p>  If you want to knit light slippers with knitting needles, it is not recommended to use a heavy sole.  A much more convenient option is a felt insole.  Although, if desired, it can be easily replaced with a cut from a piece of rubber, linoleum or old palace.  However, before embarking on the desired product, the insole must be tied.  Therefore, we take a sewing needle with a large eye and thread a knitting thread.  We surround the sole with a seam over the edge.  You can also use a sharp hook as a tool. </p><h2>  How to tie the sole? </h2><p>  Professional knitters are advised to crochet the sole, the rest of the slippers with knitting needles.  However, if desired, you can complete the entire product with one tool.  To do this, we invite the reader to study the diagram below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="scheme for slippers" class="if uuid-2909614" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2909614.jpg"></div><p>  However, to perform the sole, which is ideal in size, first you need to take measurements.  Therefore, we are preparing an elastic centimeter, a notebook and a pencil.  Then we proceed to the important stage.  We measure the length and width (at the base of the fingers) of the foot.  Then we put eight loops on the knitting needles.  In the next two rows, add one on each side.  If necessary, add more loops, guided by their measurements.  Next, we knit the sole by about 2/3 of the foot.  Add one more loop from each edge and knit the part to the base of the little finger.  In the next three rows we remove one loop from each edge.  And finally, close the loops. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Open toe slippers </h2><p>  After preparing the soles, you need to tackle the top of our product.  We will learn the technology of knitting slippers on two knitting needles.  But first you need to measure the girth of the foot through the base of the thumb and at the point of rise where the edge of the slippers will be located.  Then add the two values ‚Äã‚Äãtogether and divide by two, thereby finding the arithmetic mean.  This width will be the top of our slippers.  We knit a detail color, patterned or smooth.  Depending on your wishes and preferences.  Then with the help of a sewing needle and ordinary threads we sew it to the sole.  That's the whole technology. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make slippers" class="if uuid-2909625" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2909625.jpg"></div><h2>  Closed slippers </h2><p>  If the previous version of the product does not suit our reader, we suggest exploring a different technology for knitting slippers on two knitting needles.  It is also necessary for her to measure the foot.  But only in one place, in where the edge of the upper part will be located.  We divide this value into two and find out the length of the widest part of slippers.  After that we start knitting.  We collect four loops on the knitting needles and knit the first row.  In each next, add two loops from each edge.  We stop only when the width of our fragment is equal to that which we calculated earlier.  After that, we knit the part to the desired length and close the loops.  Next, with the help of a sewing needle and ordinary threads, we sew the missing part to the sole, ending with the implementation of home slippers with knitting needles. </p><h2>  Slippers </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting slippers" class="if uuid-2909639" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2909639.jpg"></div><p>  Another original model fits almost the same way as ordinary socks.  But first, we need to measure the length of the heel - from the floor to the edge of the product.  We pick up as many loops on the knitting needles as a result to get a canvas equal to two previously determined parameters.  We knit, moving back and forth, gradually knitting the cutout for the lower leg.  Having reached the desired point, we transfer the loops to four knitting needles and knit, moving in a circle.  Or we continue with an even canvas to the very end.  But then these slippers will have to be stitched.  Having tied to the base of the little finger, we begin to reduce the loop (two through one).  When at the end there are three to five loops, we break off the thread and stretch through them.  Tie and hide from the wrong side.  If desired, knitted home slippers can be supplemented with pompons, flowers or turned into a funny animal by adding ears, a tail and a muzzle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting slippers" class="if uuid-2909591" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2909591.jpg"></div><h2>  Slippers </h2><p>  Another interesting idea is implemented quite simply, but it looks very original (as in the photo at the beginning of the article).  But she will need a sole.  We prepare the desired option, tie and proceed to the implementation of the main stage.  Using a hook around the edge, we knit the stitches.  After we distribute them into four, we use the fifth as an additional one.  In the center of the toe of the very first row, we reduce two loops.  Thus, we gradually tie the products to the base of the lower leg.  If desired, we rise higher, turning slippers knitted (without seams) into house boots.  Or stop and close the loop.  We decorate the finished product at our discretion or we immediately knit with an unusual pattern. </p><h2>  Flat slippers </h2><p>  Professional knitters note that knitting slippers from the sole is quite uncomfortable, so it does not suit beginners.  Switching to the development of this technology is more reasonable after training on a simple product.  One of these options is the idea that we will study in the current paragraph.  For its execution only two knitting needles, a hook or a sewing needle, suitable yarn will be required.  When everything you need is ready, proceed to action.  We measure the length and circumference of the foot.  And then we knit the crocodile presented in the photo.  Its width is equal to the length of the sole, and the length is the circumference of the foot.  When the two necessary parts are ready, we fold each crochet in half and sew together, forming a toe and a heel.  Apparently, there is nothing complicated in the description of slippers with knitting needles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="two-pointed slippers" class="if uuid-2909687" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2909687.jpg"></div><h2>  Step-by-step master class </h2><p>  It's no secret that all people are different.  Moreover, we differ not only externally, but also in the way we perceive information.  Some understand the text instructions very well.  Another - detailed descriptions seem like an explanatory set of letters, which is not possible to understand.  Especially for them, we included video instructions in our material. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="4mHoeAQzP30" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=4mHoeAQzP30" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/0/3/9/1/10391.jpg"></div><p>  It presents a detailed master class for beginners.  Knitting slippers with needles is carried out by a professional knitter.  She explains and comments on the process.  Therefore, you can not just follow the actions, but also work with her. </p><h2>  Japanese slippers </h2><p>  Beautiful people love unusual products.  One of these is the option shown in the photo. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="japanese slippers" class="if uuid-2909691" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2909691.jpg"></div><p>  To knit this model of slippers with needles, you need to prepare the sole.  Then complement the piping loops.  Distribute them into four knitting needles and tie the tracks to 2/3 of the heel height.  In this case, you can choose any pattern for choosing slippers with knitting needles, but the straps are best made simple.  Then divide the loops into two parts.  After all, further we will knit the original straps.  We carry out each detail separately.  Decreasing one loop from each edge, we go up.  When there are six to eight loops, we knit a strap about 10-15 centimeters long.  Similarly, draw up the second.  Then cook the pompons.  We wind a knitting thread on two or three fingers together.  Carefully remove and bandaging in the middle, cut off the upper edges.  We form a pompom.  In the same way, we perform three more of the same fur balls and sew to the straps.  This technology for knitting slippers with knitting needles for beginners is best suited.  Because it allows you to perform an original and simple product. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted slippers" class="if uuid-2909585" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2909585.jpg"></div><p>  In the article, we examined the most interesting options for slippers.  But if desired, each knitter can come up with something different.  However, professionals are advised to beat simple products with color, while patterned ones, on the contrary, should be made plain.  This should be remembered when choosing a knitting pattern for slippers with knitting needles. </p>
