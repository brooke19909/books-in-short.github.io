    <p>  The Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp began its existence with the decision of Heinrich Himmler in 1938.  Work on its construction was carried out by prisoners from other camps.  By 1939, he received the first prisoners.  They were 867 women who continued its expansion. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since 1940, enterprises began to appear on the camp: </p><ul><li>  textile and leather production; </li><li>  electrical concern "Siemens"; </li><li>  military industrial. </li></ul><p>  The Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp had many sub-camps, which were located in different settlements. </p><h2>  Prisoners </h2><p>  Initially, representatives of Germany were stationed in the camp, who, through their behavior and lifestyle, ‚Äúdishonored the nation‚Äù.

    <p>  All women were given a striped dress and wooden slippers.  In this vestment they walked in any weather.  The Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp, stories of which are found in various memoirs, was particularly cruel.  Many prisoners were forced to walk barefoot all the time, because of which they got frostbite on their limbs. </p><p>  The camp used a system of rooms and winkels.  The prisoners did not have names; they existed under numbers that were sewn to dresses.  Above such an identification code was a triangular sign, which was called a winkel.  The category was determined by its color: </p><ul><li>  red - member of the Resistance, political prisoner; </li><li>  yellow is a Jew; </li><li>  green - criminal offender; </li><li>  purple - Jehovah's Witness (Protestant); </li><li>  black - gypsy, a woman of antisocial behavior. </li></ul><p>  In the center of the winkel was a letter that indicated nationality. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Every day, women got up at four in the morning, received the half-mug of coffee substitute laid by him and lined up on the street for roll call, which lasted 2-3 hours.  Then they went to workplaces for 12-14 hours. </p>

    <p>  Workers in the afternoon had the opportunity to get a half-hour break and lunch in the form of half a liter of water with potato peelings or rutabaga.  For those who worked at night, such a break was not provided. </p><p>  The evening check was the same as the morning check.  After it, the prisoners received 200 grams of bread from flour and sawdust and the same coffee substitute. </p><p>  Prisoners were allowed to send letters, but no more than once a month and under strict censorship.  At the slightest discrepancy, a letter or postcard was not sent to the addressee. </p><h2>  Killing Methods </h2><p>  According to various estimates, between 50 and 92 thousand people were killed in Ravensbr√ºck.  The main causes of death were malnutrition, exhausting work, inadequate sanitary and hygienic conditions, and gross bullying. </p><p>  Once every two weeks, camp staff selected prisoners to be destroyed.  First of all, these were those who were not able to work.  They were shot in the back of the head.  Up to 50 people died daily. </p>

    <p>  For mass extermination, prisoners were sent to Auschwitz and other similar camps.  Later, in 1943, women began to be massacred in the concentration camp.  For this, lethal injections and a crematorium were used. </p><p>  In 1944, Ravensbr√ºck (concentration camp) visited Himmler, who ordered that all old and weak prisoners be disposed of.  To this end, ‚Äúdestruction experts‚Äù from Auschwitz, Birkenau were invited. </p><p>  Women were checked at special parades and those who were given pink cards with Latin letters ‚ÄúV.V.‚Äù  ("Death camp, destroy") was transferred to Ukkermark.  There they waited for their death, although according to official documents they were transported to a health center located in Silesia.  At first, the owners of pink cards were executed by a bullet in the back of the head, but this process was too slow, so it was decided to build gas chambers.  In them, in 2-3 minutes 150 women died immediately. </p><h2>  Medical experiments </h2><p>  The first experiments on prisoners in the camp began on 08/01/1942.  It is proved that over the entire period of the existence of Ravensbr√ºck 86 prisoners underwent medical experiments. </p><p>  The purpose of the first experiments was to identify the effectiveness of new drugs for the treatment of deep lacerations, including gunshot wounds.  Women were made on the upper part of the thigh a deep, to the bone, incision and staphylococci was introduced there along with other types of bacteria.  This provoked the rapid appearance of gangrene and tetanus. </p><p>  In order for the wound to be similar to a gunshot, particles of glass, wood, and metal were often added to it.  All actions taken, as well as their consequences, were carefully recorded.  The slightest changes in the body of prisoners were noted - from the appearance of temperature to death.  The results of these studies were presented in the form of a report at the military academy in 1943.  The Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp, in which not all the prisoners were tortured, was famous not only for this. </p><p>  The purpose of the second experiment was to establish the possibility of bone transplantation.  To do this, healthy women were broken limbs and cast.  To see the process of the experiment, subjects were cut out pieces of living tissue to expose the bones.  A healthy limb or shoulder blade was amputated for some women and taken to surgeons in another camp, where they sewed these parts of the body to other people. </p><p>  This is only part of the experiment.  The most cruel experiments were the killing of healthy children by injection and termination of pregnancy in the last trimester with immediate burning of the fetus. </p><h2>  Camp guard </h2><p>  Guenther Tamaschke, Max Kegel, Fritz Zuner were the commandants of the camp at different times.  The staff was not only men, but also more than 150 women.  About 4 thousand overseers went through the training in it.  They, as a rule, were distinguished by excessive cruelty and a penchant for sadism. </p><h2>  Death March </h2><p>  With the retreat of the German troops, evacuation also began in the camp.  04/27/1945 prisoners were driven west.  Their number reached more than 20 thousand people, about 3 thousand were abandoned in a concentration camp. </p><p>  Two days later, the SS guards left the prisoners in the locked barracks of Malhovo, and the next morning the Red Army released them. </p><h2>  Release of prisoners </h2><p>  The date of liberation is considered 04/30/1945, when the forces of the 2nd Belorussian Front were saved.  After a couple of days, Ravensbr√ºck (concentration camp), memories of which will not disappear for centuries, was filled with doctors who created a temporary hospital. </p><p>  Until 1993, Soviet troops used this territory as a place to deploy their units. </p><h2>  War Criminal Trials </h2><p>  The first <span>trials of the</span> concentration camp personnel took place in 1946-1948.  Their result was 16 death sentences. </p><p>  Some SS employees fled to the United States, but even decades later they were calculated and deported to Germany for trial.  People who tracked down the Nazis for their crimes as part of the SS were called "Nazi hunters." </p><h2>  <span>The historical memory</span> of the prisoners of the camp </h2>

    <p>  In 1959, the GDR government ordered that the Ravensbr√ºck National Memorial Complex be established on the territory where Ravensbr√ºck (concentration camp) was located.  The following objects were left as genuine objects: </p><ul><li>  commandant's office; </li><li>  crematorium; </li><li>  building with cameras; </li><li>  underground road leading to the lake; </li><li>  fragment of the camp wall. </li></ul><p>  The stela ‚ÄúCarrier‚Äù, created by the project of Villa Lammerta, became the central element on the lake.  So Ravensbr√ºck (concentration camp), a monument to which was erected in Germany, for many forever became a symbol of a monstrous crime against humanity. </p><p>  In 1996, a documentary was released in which five former prisoners from different countries give interviews - Austria, Italy, the Netherlands, and Russia.  The Dutch directors and screenwriters were Anet van Barneveld and Annemarie Streibos.  The painting ‚ÄúThe Past Is‚Äù is called. </p><p>  In 2005, the creation of the director from the Federal Republic of Germany Lorett Waltz, which collected interviews of former prisoners for 25 years, was released.  The documentary consists of the stories of more than 200 prisoners and is called The Women of Ravensbr√ºck. </p><p>  The Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp (World War II 1939-1945) lasted six years, destroying tens of thousands of women and children who did not want this war. </p>
