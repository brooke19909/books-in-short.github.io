    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  <span>The strongest point is the screen in the</span> <span>Samsung UE48H8000AT.</span>  <span>The image quality is</span> <span>really beyond praise.</span>  <span>The matrix of the screen of this TV is made using LCD technology.</span>  <span>Considering the fact that at the time this solution entered the market, quantum dot matrixes were still at the development stage, this was the most advanced technology by the standards of 2014.</span>  <span>From this same position, the resolution of the matrix, which is 1920x1080 (1080p), is explained.</span>  <span>The ‚Äú4K‚Äù format at that time could only be found in exclusive television devices.</span>  <span>The key ‚Äúchip‚Äù in this case was the image refresh rate - 1000 Hz.</span>  <span>With its help, even the most dynamic scenes in this case were not distorted.</span>  <span>All this is complemented by support for the ‚Äú3D‚Äù mode.</span>  <span>Also, the delivery set included 3 pairs of glasses at once for viewing content in this format.</span> </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  <span>All</span> <span>Samsung TVs of the 8 Series</span> <span>are necessarily equipped with high-quality sound systems.</span>  <span>As a rule, they include 2 speakers, and this provides audio support in stereo format.</span>  <span>But in this case, the developers went even further and added a third speaker to the speaker system, which adds low frequencies to the sound.</span>  <span>Two of them have a power of 10W, and the third - 20W.</span>  <span>In total, we get 40W.</span>  <span>This is certainly more than enough for high-quality sound.</span>  <span>If desired, of course, you can connect an external stereo system.</span>  <span>This TV has all the necessary ports.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Assembly.  The setting procedure.  Recommendations regarding the choice of mounting system </h2><p>  <span>It is very simple to assemble and configure the</span> <span>Samsung UE48H8000AT.</span>  <span>Its</span> <span>configuration</span> <span>is standard and does not stand out against the background of most similar devices.</span>  <span>The procedure in this case is as follows:</span> </p><ol><li><p>  <span>To get started, prepare a place for assembly and a set of tools.</span>  <span>We remove from the transport box not only the TV, but also all the rest of its contents.</span> </p></li><li><p>  <span>When installing on a horizontal plane, we mount the complete support.</span>  <span>If you plan to hang this solution on the wall, you must additionally purchase the mounting kit for the</span> <span>Samsung UE48H8000AT.</span>  <span>What wall mount is needed</span> <span>in this case?</span>  <span>This is a VESA 200X200.</span> </p></li><li><p>  <span>We carry out all the necessary connections.</span>  <span>First, the power cord, then the signal wire, and finally, if necessary, a twisted pair cable (in the case of using a wired connection to the global web).</span> </p></li><li><p>  <span>Turn on the device.</span>  <span>We are waiting for the end of its download.</span>  <span>After that, in the query window, we set the date, time and location of the multimedia device.</span>  <span>If you try to cheat and indicate the wrong region, some functions of the software will be deactivated.</span> </p></li><li><p>  <span>The next important step is the search for channels.</span>  <span>To do this, go to the solution settings menu and select the ‚ÄúChannels‚Äù sub-item.</span>  <span>Then we activate the option ‚ÄúAuto tuning‚Äù.</span>  <span>Next, a special request window will appear in which we indicate the signal source.</span>  <span>In the case of a cable operator or a local antenna, the search procedure will go further automatically. But when using a satellite antenna, you need to specify the list of satellites and their connection ports.</span>  <span>At the end of the search, do not forget to save the result.</span> </p></li><li><p>  <span>At the next stage, we set the network connection parameters.</span>  <span>To do this, select its type.</span>  <span>It can be wireless Wi-Fi or wired RJ-45.</span>  <span>If necessary, set the subnet mask, network address, network name and password for connection.</span> </p></li><li><p>  <span>Then we activate the Smart TV function.</span>  <span>We go to the official application store and install all the necessary application software.</span>  <span>After installing each program, we check its performance without fail by launching it.</span> </p></li></ol><h2>  Reviews  Cost </h2><p>  <span>As noted earlier, the premium level solution to which the</span> <span>Samsung UE48H8000AT</span> <span>belongs is not initially affordable and has a low cost</span> <span>.</span>  <span>The price</span> <span>for it currently ranges from 27,000 to 29,000 rubles.</span>  <span>On the one hand, the similar cost of the TV is really overpriced.</span>  <span>But if you take into account its parameters, then everything falls into place.</span>  <span>Actually, the only drawback of such a TV is its high cost.</span>  <span>More than any shortcomings he simply does not exist.</span>  <span>And he, like any other</span> <span>Samsung TV Series 8,</span> <span>has a lot of</span> <span>advantages</span> <span>.</span>  <span>First of all, it is necessary to mention the phenomenally high image quality, which in this case is certainly beyond praise.</span>  <span>In addition, it should also be noted the sound subsystem, which includes 3 instead of the usual two speakers. Therefore, the soundtrack is not cut off at low frequencies and its quality is much better than that of any other direct competitor.</span>  <span>Another plus is the built-in tuner.</span>  <span>It is so functional that there is no need to purchase something else separately.</span>  <span>The number of connectors is also sufficient and there is no need to worry about their shortage.</span>  <span>In terms of energy consumption, this TV belongs to the most advanced class to date, ‚ÄúA +‚Äù, and with this it also has a complete order.</span> </p>
