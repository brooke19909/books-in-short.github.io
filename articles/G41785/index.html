At the hotel reception, guests will be able to choose an excursion program and book tickets for it.  The following routes are at guests' disposal: </p><div class="photo" data-original="victoryhotel.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Comfortable rooms" class="if uuid-2574338" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2574338.jpg"></div><ol><li>  Sightseeing tour of the most interesting places in the city. </li><li>  Decembrists in Irkutsk. </li><li>  Listvyanka village on Lake Baikal. </li><li>  Circum-Baikal Railway. </li><li>  The village of Ust-Orda. </li><li>  Arshan. </li><li>  Ski resort in the town of Baikalsk. </li></ol><h2>  Hotel Location Reviews </h2><p>  Continuing the review of the hotel, I want to pay attention to the reviews of tourists who have already managed to visit it.  It is worth noting that the hotel belongs to budgetary institutions.  According to guests, it is consistent with the ratio of "price-quality".  Experienced tourists note high prices for accommodation in hotels in the city, so Victoria is a great compromise if you are planning a budget trip.  For a reasonable fee, you get good apartments and decent service. </p><p>  According to reviews, the Victoria Hotel in Irkutsk has its advantages and disadvantages.  One of the main advantages of the institution is its convenient location.  The hotel is located next to the main street of the city, so getting to the most important objects or places is not ore.  In addition, public transport stops are nearby.  The hotel building is located in the courtyard, so the noise from the streets does not prevent guests from relaxing. </p><p>  Another important advantage of the institution is the parking.  It is very relevant, since there is no place to park a car in the nearest streets due to the traffic congestion in the city center.  The presence of parking will be appreciated by all guests arriving by car.  The weather in Irkutsk in May already allows the first tourists who want to see the beauty of the region to come together.  Therefore, it is recommended to book hotel rooms in advance.  Otherwise, you may not find available apartments upon arrival.  The hotel is in great demand at any time of the year due to its budget prices. </p><h2>  Reviews about the number of rooms </h2><p>  The hotel is not so vast and diverse.  Available apartments are presented in only a few categories.  According to reviews, the rooms are quite comfortable for living, because they have everything that guests may need.  The furniture in the rooms is not very new, but it does its job.  Some tourists note problems with plumbing.  The rest of the rooms can be a convenient place to stay during a business trip or vacation.  Bed linen and towels are in decent quality apartments. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rivage.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Restaurant hall" class="if uuid-2574340" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2574340.jpg"></div><p>  Maids clean and update detergents daily.  Not all apartments can boast a good view from the window, since the hotel is located in the courtyards, but this is not so fundamental.  The rooms have good internet access, which is very important for guests. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  There is a restaurant in the hotel building where you can eat without going outside.  Buffet breakfast is included.  The range of food in the morning seems scarce to some guests.  Nevertheless, early breakfasts are very convenient for those guests who come for work or plan to leave.  At the buffet there is cutting, pastries, several types of jam, tea, instant coffee, yogurt, kefir, juice, bread and butter, fruit slices.  Visitors can also order a hot dish, such as scrambled eggs or porridge, which is served literally for five to seven minutes.  But brewed coffee is not included in the buffet, it must be paid separately. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rivage.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Hall" class="if uuid-2574341" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2574341.jpg"></div><p>  In the daytime, the restaurant offers its visitors a set menu or lunch.  You can also spend a good evening at the institution if you do not want to go out.  In the immediate vicinity of the hotel there are many cafes and restaurants that are also worth a visit. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  The Victoria Hotel, according to reviews, occupies a worthy place in its price category and is very in demand among the guests of Irkutsk.  The city is very popular among tourists because it has many attractions.  Weather in Irkutsk in May (during the day the temperature reaches +15 degrees) allows you to visit Lake Baikal and other interesting places.  It is spring and summer that many travelers consider the most convenient time to travel to Irkutsk.  Therefore, rooms in local hotels should be booked in advance due to increased demand, especially for budget institutions, which are not so many in the city.  Hotel "Victoria" is the best choice in terms of price-quality ratio. </p>
