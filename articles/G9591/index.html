  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How many crows live in the wild and in captivity</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Birds such as Ravens and Ravens are permanent residents of our cities and parks.  They are also heroes of songs, sayings, proverbs and fairy tales, are present in heraldry.  Despite the similarity of their names in Russian, the raven and the raven are still different from each other, since they are different biological species.  A crow is less than a crow bird, and it lives less.  How many crows live is not exactly known.  In the wild jungles of large cities, these birds usually reach 10 years, but together with humans they can live almost twice as long.  The crow is easily tamed, it is non-conflict and can learn to make various sounds. </p><p>  As for a bird such as a raven, it must be said that it is not only larger than its black-gray ‚Äúnamesake‚Äù (the weight of a raven is 700 g, the weight of a raven is one and a half kilograms), but it also lives longer.  Of course, it's hard to track how many crows live in the wild.  But we can assume that a lot, because during the earthly life of any creature experience is accumulated and as a result, intelligence manifests itself.  And about the ravens it is reliably known that they are extremely intelligent birds.  For example, they soak stale pieces of bread in puddles.  <span>Tribal memory,</span> you say, is the same kind of inborn behavior as weaving a spider‚Äôs web.  Well, what‚Äôs the kind of behavior observed by the ravens: the birds specially put the nuts they find on the carriageway so that the passing cars crush hard shells.  And only urban crows do this, while rural crows continue to peck nuts with their beaks.  It is clear that in order to spy on the properties of car tires to crush solid objects, to draw an appropriate logical conclusion and put it into practice, a rather <span>long lifespan of a</span> raven is required. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is believed that in the wild a raven can live up to 30 years, but on average these birds live about 20. These are predators living in a flock.  That is, an aging and weakened individual has the opportunity, with the rich prey of his young and healthy brothers, to feed on crumbs from their table.  And, on the contrary, with a lack of food supply in the flock, weakened individuals can lose their own prey and die of starvation.  Therefore, it is somewhat difficult to averaged answer the question of how many crows live.  These are very social birds: it is known that crows, especially young ones, love to play with each other using various objects.  However, knowing well the habits of their relatives to take strangers, the crows carefully hide their supplies: they wait for the moment when no one is looking at them, bury the supplies in the ground, and cover the loosened place with fallen leaves. </p><p>  People, observing the intellect of ravens, in the Middle Ages endowed them with magical properties and considered them sorcerers.  Perhaps the ability of the ravens to imitate various sounds and even human speech played a role in this?  They can very similarly imitate the meowing cats, barking dogs, and now the rattling of a motorcycle.  But, despite the dark glory of birds, as companions of witches and sorcerers, that they do not disdain carrion, people very much respect ravens.  In heraldry, the raven represents wisdom, foresight and longevity.  People often tame them and keep them at home.  Therefore, it is known how many ravens live in the so-called captivity: 40-50 years.  And this is not the limit, since veterinary medicine has not so thoroughly studied the body of the raven as <span>poultry,</span> so the life expectancy of half a century is taking into account the absence of treatment or with its minimal use. </p><p>  Since these blue-black birds as pets often passed from father to son and even to grandson, various myths arose about how many crows live.  Legends give them longevity: 150, 200 years.  An undocumented case is known when a raven lived to see its 210th birthday.  But in fact, the oldest long-lived raven reached the 100th anniversary. </p>
