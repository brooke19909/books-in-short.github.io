    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  A consular post was first introduced in the first century BC.  During the rapid expansion of the empire, the endless wars of the state required new public office, simplifying the overall management of the country. </p><p>  The consul in Rome is one of the highest collegiate positions.  There were two at once, and they were elected for a term of one year.  A collegium of two consuls was established after the expulsion of Tarquinius the Proud.  At first, the consuls were chosen only from the patricians, but after the struggle between them and the plebeians, the latter also received the right to be elected. </p><h2>  Rights and obligations of consuls in ancient Rome </h2><p>  In Rome, a consul is a person who has the highest military and civilian authority.  They could recruit legions and lead them, convene comitia and the senate, presiding there, appoint dictators and conduct auspices.  Initially, the consuls had the right to conduct all trials, then it went to praetors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The consuls had assistants (questors) and insignia: togas with a purple wide border, an armchair decorated with ivory, and constant accompaniment of 12 liqueurs.  At the end of the consular term, they received the title of proconsul and province in personal administration.  Subsequently, the consuls lost their main power, and the post passed into an honorary title, and became appointed instead of an elected one. </p><p>  In modern times, in Rome, a consul is an official who is appointed by a permanent representative in a region or city of another country in order to protect the legal and economic interests of not only his country, but also his subjects.  The main line of work of the consulate is issuing visas and caring for citizens located in the territories of the states entrusted to them.  Basically, the functions performed by the consul of Rome coincide with those performed in the same position in Russia. </p><h2>  Duties of the Consul of Russia </h2><p>  A consul is a public position, therefore, it implies certain duties assigned by the state to an official: </p><ul><li><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lawyer consul is" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/409437.jpg" width="336"></div>  control visits by Russian ships to foreign harbors; </li><li>  the consul is obliged to take all necessary measures so that citizens who are in another country can enjoy all the rights in full in accordance with international treaties and customs; </li><li>  take measures in order to restore the violated rights of Russian citizens and legal entities; </li><li>  fulfill orders of the courts of the Russian Federation in relation to Russian citizens; </li><li>  ensure that all laws and treaties entered into with the state in which they reside are respected by citizens of the Russian Federation; </li><li>  on his own initiative, he is obliged to visit those persons who are in places of detention and to monitor the conditions of their detention; </li><li>  accept applications from citizens of the Russian Federation on changes, corrections, additions and restoration of records that were lost, as well as on the change of name, send them for consideration to special bodies; </li><li>  register acts of birth or death; </li><li>  legalize documents compiled by the consular district; </li><li>  take all measures to save the citizens of their country if their life or property is in danger of any kind. </li></ul><h2>  Consul Rights </h2><p>  A consul is a person representing the state and having certain rights by service: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>
