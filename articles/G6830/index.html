DIY selection and manufacturing tips</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Every woman wants to be beautiful and stylish, not only outside the home, but also for her beloved and relatives.  Long gone are the days when home clothes were considered the least important than clothes for going out, and were chosen according to the residual principle.  And today, many women are thinking about what clothes to choose for a comfortable stay at home.  Designers are also puzzled by this issue and are vying to offer their options for home clothes in their new collections.  Despite the large number of presented models, all kinds of shorts and trousers, the dress is considered the most correct and truly feminine attire.  If this wardrobe item is not included in your everyday toilet, then why not try wearing it at least at home?  Indeed, with such advantages that a dress has, not a single shorts can be compared, no matter how comfortable they are.  In today's article, we will tell you how to choose and how to sew a home dress that is perfect for any woman. </p><h2>  Choosing the best option for home </h2><p>  If a woman spends most of her time being at home, then the choice of clothes should be treated with special attention.  We list the main criteria by which to choose a home dress: </p><ul><li>  Convenience.  The dress should be as convenient as possible for moving around the house and doing household chores.  Do not interfere, do not cling or constrain movement. </li><li>  Lack of excessive decor.  A large number of stones, laces, rhinestones and fringes are likely to be also inappropriate. </li><li>  Simple cut.  Simplicity and accuracy, emphasizing the figure - this is all that is required from a home dress.  Too sophisticated cut is not only difficult to perform, but also not suitable for home wear. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="houseofsohn.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="White dress" class="if uuid-2411856" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63974/2411856.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Naturalness.  Given that a woman is at a sufficient amount of time at home, it is not difficult to guess that it is better to choose a fabric that is natural, light, and pleasant to the body. </li></ul><h2>  What are the models for the home? </h2><p>  As mentioned above, a home dress should have a simple cut.  Based on this, we can distinguish several models that fit this definition. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  1. Dress shirt.  A great option for everyday wear, combining style and simplicity.  By choosing a plain dress or a check, you can both receive guests and do cleaning in the house.  In the photo - a home dress made of thin jeans. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dressedupgirl.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dress shirt" class="if uuid-2411859" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63974/2411859.jpg"></div><p>  2. Dress tunic.  Also a frequent choice of women choosing a dress for home.  Comfortable and soft, it will serve as an excellent choice.  If the tunic is not long enough, you can supplement it with leggings that are suitable in color. </p><p>  3. Kimono.  Silk and painted, but very simple in cut, the kimono does the job of a home dress. </p><p>  4. Sundress.  Flirty short or more feminine on the floor, the length can be anything.  By choosing the right color and the right model, you will increase your self-esteem and make your man nice. </p><h2>  What colors and fabrics to give preference? </h2><p>  Regardless of whether you want to buy or make a home dress with your own hands, the choice of fabric and color is up to you.  Since the dress means wearing frequent and long, the fabric should be chosen as natural as possible.  Excellent if it combines the naturalness of the fibers and unpretentiousness in use.  Cotton, linen, silk or viscose are good for home dress. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As for the color of the dress, here it is more appropriate to focus on taste preferences.  However, there are universal tips that will help you choose the right option.  Definitely not worth choosing bright neon colors of fabrics.  Even if at first they seem suitable and able to emphasize your originality.  A bright dress very quickly from the original will turn into annoying and will be put on the farthest shelf.  In addition, bright colors are suitable mainly for women with dark skin.  If the skin is pale, then do not risk it.  An exception can be made only if your wardrobe has a large number of home dresses of various shades, and you just wanted something new. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bubbleroom.se" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Blue dress" class="if uuid-2411857" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63974/2411857.jpg"></div><p>  For all other cases, we advise women to choose neutral and universal colors.  Such as white, gray, pistachio, cream, powder, light purple, muted blue, blue.  Pastel shades go to absolutely everyone and are very easy to combine.  You can easily choose the right shoes for your home, a warm cardigan or jewelry. </p><h2>  How to sew a simple dress yourself? </h2><p>  If you do not have sewing skills, but the dresses offered in stores do not suit you for some reason, you can try to sew a home dress yourself.  Consider one of the easiest options to perform - a dress on a stencil. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sewingprincess.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dress pattern" class="if uuid-2411790" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63974/2411790.jpg"></div><p>  In order to sew this, you will need an existing dress from the closet, which will serve as a stencil for the new one.  For example, we offer the option of a dress-sundress.  All you need to do is attach the dress to the double-folded fabric and outline its contours.  Next, cut the resulting 2 parts.  Then sew the back and in front of each other, just like it was done on the dress-stencil.  Skipping the neck, hem and armholes for hands, respectively.  Further, using thin elastic, if desired, you can make a waist at the dress.  To do this, carefully sew the elastic band on the back side in a circle around the waist.  Calculate the size of the elastic so that the dress does not press at the waist.  Finally, sew all open areas so that the threads do not spill.  Sundress is ready for home! </p><h2>  Dress pattern </h2><p>  If you can sew by looking at patterns, we advise you to look at a pattern of a home dress and try to make it yourself.  This dress is perfect for any type of figure. </p><div class="photo" data-original="jeuxipad.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Home Dress Options" class="if uuid-2411801" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63974/2411801.jpg"></div><h2>  The basic rules of a successful bow for the home </h2><p>  If you set out to look at home at 100, then we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the rules of beauty for the home: </p><p>  1. Home shoes.  Throw away your old and worn slippers.  Are they worthy of your legs?  Pick up soft home ballet shoes.  They will make the leg more elegant and seductive.  In addition, they are as comfortable as any other slippers. </p><p>  2. Aroma and purity.  Remember to take a shower, even if you spend all day at home.  Clean hair and body create a special mood.  A drop of your favorite perfume will add charm, which sometimes is so lacking for housewives. </p><p>  3. Jewelry.  If you are at home, then this is not a reason to refuse jewelry.  Pick up a bulky pendant or a pair of bracelets and complement them with your home look. </p><p>  4. Beautiful underwear.  Appreciate yourself and get rid of ugly and worn underwear immediately.  Wear at home only that you would not hesitate to demonstrate to your man. </p><p>  Choosing beautiful and feminine dresses for the home, you retain the true woman. </p>
