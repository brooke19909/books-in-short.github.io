Its feature is its geographical location.  It is located in the Urals.  Almost on the border with Kazakhstan.  Hence, many borrowed customs in the southern <span>regions of the region.</span>  In addition, the story of Orenburg tells us that once part of the region belonged to a neighboring country. </p><h2>  Foundation of the city </h2><p>  This settlement was not formed spontaneously, like most settlements in <span>Russia.</span>  The idea to build a city occurred to the Kazakh khan.  He promised Empress Anastasia to protect the integrity of the land, protect the borders from attacks and help the merchants if in return they build a fortress that would serve as a shelter in case of danger. </p>

On August 31, 1735, the first stone was laid in the construction of a large and reliable fortress.  This building is located at the confluence of the rivers Or and Yaik.

    <p>  A funny situation happened with the choice of place.  The first expedition led by I. Kirillov determined the ideal location.  However, after his death, V. Tatishchev shifted the construction site downstream of the Yaik.  And again a mistake, since the area was rocky and far from the river. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  And only in 1739 the final version was defined and approved - the former Berd Fortress.  The history of Orenburg began, and the city was nicknamed three times conceived and once born. </p><h2>  Name origin </h2><p>  The origin of the name of the place becomes clear to anyone who has even delved into the geography of Russia, especially the Orenburg region.  All immediately connect it with the river Or and part of the "burg", which in German means "city".  Literally, the name, based on this concept, is translated as ‚Äúcity on Ori‚Äù.  It is believed that I. Kirillov gave such a name to the newly built settlement.  He also sent a package of relevant documents on the nomination to Empress Anastasia. </p><p>  Also, the history of Orenburg does not allow discarding the version that the name came from the Kazakh ‚Äúorybor‚Äù. </p><p>  It is worth noting that, due to misunderstandings with the location of the fortress, this name was long borne by the first fortress, founded by Kirillov.  However, over time, the empress issued a decree in which the right to be called Orenburg was assigned only to the place that this name still bears to this day. </p><p>  Since 1938, the city was renamed Chkalov, in honor of the famous pilot.  By the way, the latter had nothing to do with this area.  In 1957, the village again received its historical name. </p>

    <h2>  The first decades of life </h2><p>  The history of Orenburg, or rather, the territory of the modern city and region, changed dramatically after the construction of the fortress.  The land of nomads began to occupy the inhabitants of other Russian regions.  And next to this fortification, dozens of protective structures were erected, ditches were dug up and high walls were built. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Initially, soldiers were resettled here in the hope that they would begin to engage in farming.  But the history of the city of Orenburg indicates the opposite - the warriors who were not burdened by relatives did not require much, because they did not observe a desire to get rich and get hold of the household. </p><p>  Then it was decided to create Cossack irregular troops, where even fugitives were accepted.  The peasants began to master the steppe virgin lands. </p><p>  However, there were not many artisans.  The city grew and grew stronger thanks to trade and eventually became a powerful center, which turned into the Orenburg province with the adjacent lands. </p><h2>  World War I </h2><p>  In July 1917, the Alash party was formed, which discussed issues of governance and power.  Representatives were delegated from her to the All-Russian <span>Constituent Assembly.</span>  Thus, the history of Orenburg acquired its own political power. </p><p>  These years have become a difficult test for the city.  Cossack formations repeatedly suffered defeats from the Red Army.  At that time, many regiments began to call themselves White Cossacks and did not accept changes.  In addition, the national heterogeneity of the population made itself felt. </p>

    <h2>  Times of the Soviet Union </h2><p>  Everything changed with the advent of Soviet power.  The population has grown sharply, almost six times.  Since there were no fierce battles on the territory of this region because of its remoteness, it was customary to evacuate large industrial facilities here, many of which remained here. </p><p>  Orenburg became famous throughout the Union for its downy shawls, which, as a gift, was the highest sign of care. </p><p>  During the Second World War, planes and helicopters were produced in the city.  Then other <span>industries</span> appeared <span>.</span>  For Orenburg, this meant the creation of new jobs, so over time, residents of other regions began to move here. </p><p>  The history of the streets of Orenburg tells about all the changes that took place in the city. </p>

    <h2>  Modern period </h2><p>  After the <span>collapse of the USSR, the</span> city ‚Äã‚Äãlost its popularity for a while.  This continued until the end of the twentieth century.  However, in the 2000s, a course was taken to increase the prestige of Orenburg, the economy was rebuilt. </p><p>  The city has become more attractive to tourists thanks to development programs.  Old buildings began to be actively restored.  The network hosted events to familiarize users with the city and its history. </p><p>  The Museum of the History of Orenburg played an important role in this matter.  It contains exhibits telling about the life of the city.  A number of traditional events are held there annually, and field trips are also organized. </p><p>  The prices for visiting are more than loyal, and a convenient location is another plus that guests of the city will appreciate. </p><p>  Every street and house speaks about the city.  One way or another, they remind us of what is happening here in different periods.  To immediately cover the maximum <span>amount of information</span> about the area, residents, attractions, it is enough to visit the Museum of the History of Orenburg. </p>

    <h2>  Ghosts at the Medical Academy </h2><p>  Like any other settlement, Orenburg has its own legends and horror stories.  One of the most popular is the ghost stories that are teeming with the building of the Medical Academy.  None of the inhabitants can explain why the spirits are so dissatisfied that they cannot leave the monastery alone, however, this legend has been living for more than a century.  There are even documented memories of one of the teachers.  He says that once he was sent to reassure girls who were beside themselves with fear.  The cadets told them about the ghosts, wanting to scare the students.  However, the young people left, and the strange sounds did not stop, which made the girls make a fuss. </p><p>  Many students say that even troubled spirits roam the building today, they can often be seen in corridors or rooms. </p><h2>  The mystery of the first metro </h2><p>  Once lived in Orenburg a certain Gorodissky who worked as a lawyer.  His hunt for the female sex led to many folly - either he decorated the house with stucco molding to entertain the ladies, then the lady was ready to defend the honor, even if the forces were not equal. </p>
