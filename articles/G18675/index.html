    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The smallest apartment in the world" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/1734447.jpg"></div>  Many Chinese people would see the short-lived “Khrushchevs” scorned by our compatriots as real palaces.  In China, in Hubei Province, many young people have been forced to live in miniature apartments for years.  Often the total area of ​​such housing does not exceed 4.5 m <sup>2</sup> .  This is probably where the smallest apartment in the world is located.

    <p>  China today is a champion in this category, but Japan is not far behind it.  In many cities of the Land of the Rising Sun, there is an economy-class housing with an area of ​​about 6 m <sup>2</sup> .  Living space in Japan is measured in tatami (90x180 cm), apartments in 3-4 tatami are in demand.  Usually ordinary students live here, which is noteworthy, there is similar housing even in Tokyo. </p><p>  What are the advantages of such micro-apartments?  Rent is affordable for everyone and there is the possibility of choosing a suitable area.  What is noteworthy, as a rule, there is no normal shower in such apartment rooms. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  A sought-after mini-apartment in the UK </h2>

    <p>  In any country, housing in the capital is more expensive than in the provinces.  Many people dream of living in the most important city of the state, but real estate prices do not allow to make this dream a reality.  Many people in the UK believe that the smallest apartment in the world is in London.  This housing is only 7.5 m <sup>2</sup> in which there is everything necessary for the life of one person.  They designed micro-apartments specifically for those who want to live in the British capital, but are very constrained in their means.  What is noteworthy, after putting up an unusual object for sale in the first week, more than 100 people wanted to buy it. </p><h2>  Affordable Life in Manhattan </h2><p>  The most advertised smallest apartment in the world is in the USA.  On an area of ​​8.3 m2 there is a full-fledged sleeping place, many storage racks and even a shower with a toilet.  This housing is a prime example of ingenious longline zoning.  The bed is under the ceiling, the distance from the mattress to the bed is only 57 cm. Compact housing can be called elite, because it is located in the prestigious Upper West Side (Manhattan).  This smallest apartment in the world gained fame thanks to its tenant - Felis Cohen.  The woman works as a designer and is proud of how functionally and comfortably she managed to organize her living space. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  French chic on 12 m2 </h2><p>  The French also love to live in historical or simply prestigious areas of their cities.  Not surprisingly, it has its smallest apartment in the world in Paris.  The housing area is 12 m <sup>2</sup> .  Unlike all previous miniature apartments, the Parisian version is not intended for permanent residence of only one person.  The French mini-apartments feature a bar, a guest sofa and a double bed.  Sounds incredible?  But this is true thanks to the use of a large number of modern transformer furniture.  Depending on the mood and needs of residents, the room can change its appearance and functionality very quickly.  Such housing is available in many regions of France, and invariably it is in fairly high demand. </p><h2>  Russian small apartments </h2>

    <p>  In our country for a long period of time, communal apartments have been popular.  These are rather large residential apartments in total area, in which different owners owned separate rooms, and non-residential premises were shared.  The very idea of ​​individual small apartments is new for Russia.  In modern times, such housing is becoming increasingly popular.  And yet, if you look at the smallest apartments in the world (photo in our article), their Russian counterparts amaze with their size and degree of comfort. </p><p>  For example, in Moscow housing is recognized as a miniature record, the area of ​​which is as much as 16 m <sup>2</sup> .  There are such apartments in Lublino, especially their kitchens with an area of ​​3 m2.  Against the background of such options, the standard “Khrushchevs”, with a total area of ​​30 m2, really seem incredibly spacious and large. </p><p>  Should we expect a craving for minimalism from Russian developers?  That's a moot point.  On the one hand, there is a demand for small apartments (mainly “studios”).  But we must not forget about the simple law of the real estate market: the smaller the total footage of housing, the more expensive it is 1 m <sup>2</sup> . </p><h2>  Secrets of arranging small-sized apartments </h2>

    <p>  Can a small housing be comfortable?  It all depends on the number of people living in the apartment, their everyday habits and needs.  If desired, even on a minimum area, you can place all the necessary zones.  Look at the smallest apartments in the world, their layouts vary, but the general design rules remain unchanged.  Visually increase the volume of the room using light colors and glossy surfaces.  The most suitable interior styles for decorating small apartments are minimalism and hi-tech.  Refuse unnecessary decor in the interior. </p><p>  It is also useful to regularly audit personal items and get rid of excess.  This simple rule, combined with regular cleaning of the room, will get rid of the feeling of clutter and crowding. </p><p>  Furniture transformers are manufactured today in many factories.  And these are not only sofa beds that are familiar to us, but also modern partitions, folding tabletops and built-in berths.  Such solutions will create the most comfortable living conditions even on a limited area. </p><p>  Do not forget about the principle of vertical zoning.  An attic bed will be an excellent alternative to a traditional sleeping place, if you want to make a podium, do not forget to create storage boxes in it.  All these simple solutions perfectly save space and only increase the functionality of the room. </p>
