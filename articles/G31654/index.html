The metro station at Finland Station occupies an important place in it and is one of the most famous and passable. </p><h2>  Historic District at Finland Station </h2><p>  The metro station at the Finland Station, Ploshchad Lenina, is located on the right <span>bank of the Neva,</span> on the Vyborg side, along which the road to the Swedish <span>fortress Vyborg</span> passed in ancient times <span>.</span> </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="59.95530340000001" data-lng="30.355067100000042" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/6/0/8/608.png"></div><p>  This is one of the historic areas of the city.  In the XIX - early XX centuries - the working outskirts.  This territory began to be developed even under Peter I, when two military hospitals were opened here - a land and a sea one, on the site of which the Military Medical Academy later opened.  It also housed one of the oldest enterprises in St. Petersburg - the Sugar Yard (factory), on the site of which the toponym still remains - Sugar Lane.  Nearby, just between the Finland Station and the <span>Vyborgskaya metro station, the</span> church of St. Sampson the Stranopriemts was erected, the Sampson Church is laid out <span>.</span>  In the XX century, not far from Lenin Square, on which the metro station and Finland Station were built, one of the first city cultural centers, Vyborgsky, was opened.  And on the corner of the square and Arsenalnaya embankment is the district administration. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Metro station in the transport system of St. Petersburg </h2><p>  The metro station "Ploshchad Lenina" was built near the Finland Station in St. Petersburg on the square of the same name is no coincidence: the building of the Finland Station was erected here at the beginning of the 20th century.  From the second half of the 19th century, the Finnish branch of the Oktyabrskaya Railway connected Petersburg with the northern lands - first with Vyborg, and at the beginning of the 20th century it was extended to the Finnish city of Helsinki, establishing links with neighboring Finland. </p><p>  The metro line passing through the Finland Station - Kirovsko-Vyborgskaya is the very first metro line in the Leningrad.  It connects the northern and southern regions of the city, passing through its historical center in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãVosstaniya Square, where another important railway junction is located - the Moscow railway station.  Thus, from the Ploshchad Lenina metro station, you can easily transfer from the Finnish Railways branch to Moscow.  And if you go a few more stops by metro - to "Pushkinskaya", then to Vitebsk.  If you drive a couple more stations and get off at the Baltiyskaya metro station, you can drive along the Baltic and Warsaw branches of Russian Railways.  How to get to the Finland Station in St. Petersburg?  Most conveniently on the subway.  But many land transport routes are also oriented towards this important urban site.  The address of Finland Station is Lenin Square, 6. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.metro.spb.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to get to Finland Station" class="if uuid-2246399" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54338/2246399.jpg"></div><h2>  Station architecture </h2><p>  The metro station "Ploshchad Lenina" near the Finland Station has its name in connection with important city-planning objects located nearby: one exit from the station leads to the building of the Finland Station and Lenin Square, while the other lobby goes to Komsomol Street, Akademika Lebedeva Street and Botkinsky Street . </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.citywalls.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="finnish metro station" class="if uuid-2246401" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54338/2246401.jpg"></div><p>  The station building was erected in 1870 from reinforced concrete structures, the walls of which cut through large glazed areas vertically elongated between the pylons.  The center of the building is marked by a turret with a spire and a clock, located on the roof of the station.  The metro station was built here only in 1958.  Its upper lobby from the side of the first exit is decorated with a mosaic panel depicting V.I. Lenin against a background of red banners and golden rays of the sun. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.peterburg.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Finland Station St. Petersburg" class="if uuid-2246387" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54338/2246387.jpg"></div><p>  The lower lobby of the station belongs to the pylon type and is decorated in red-brown-white tones.  For cladding used marble.  The station belongs to deep underground stations. </p><h2>  History and surroundings </h2><p>  What important historical sites are still located near the metro station "Ploshchad Lenina" at Finland Station?  First of all, I recall the monument to V.I. Lenin in the center of Lenin Square, reminiscent of the fact that a train arrived in Finland‚Äôs station, in a sealed wagon of which the leader of the proletariat Vladimir Ilyich Lenin arrived from Finland to Petrograd shortly before the 1917 revolution.  And it was here that his historic performance with an armored car took place.  That is how he is depicted in the monument.  And on the station wall there is a memorial plaque informing residents and visitors about the memorable events. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cityspb.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Finland Station Address" class="if uuid-2246389" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54338/2246389.jpg"></div><p>  A little to the side along the Arsenalnaya embankment are the red-brick buildings of one of the oldest plants in the northern capital - the New Arsenal, and a little deeper into the building - another oldest factory - Metallic.  A little further along the Neva there were the constructions of one of the sadly memorable places of the city - the Kresty prison, in which a huge number of people, including the famous poet N. Gumilyov, were imprisoned and shot during the years of Stalin's repressions. </p>
