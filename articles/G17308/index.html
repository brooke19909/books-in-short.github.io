    <h2>  Reviews and impressions </h2><p>  Those who celebrated in Ozerki exit registration or any anniversary were very pleased with how the celebration took place.  Many really liked the professional organization of the holiday, the work of the staff, which was at a high level.  There were, of course, minor flaws, but the heroes of the occasion quickly forgot about them, and the guests did not even notice at all.  Services are provided inexpensively, and most importantly - fairly high quality, almost at the European level. </p><p>  Most of those who rested here speak of the park hotel as a wonderful place where you can relax without any noise.  Many impressions of the lake, which is amazingly beautiful. </p><p>  There are, of course, several complaints, and first of all they concern living in a cottage.  According to vacationers, plumbing does not work well there and there are power outages.  But, judging by the responses of the opponents, these shortcomings have already been eliminated by the administration. </p><p>  For the most part, tourists were satisfied with their stay at this park-hotel, and therefore they strongly recommend visiting those who have not been here before. </p>
