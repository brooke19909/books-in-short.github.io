    <h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  Travelers who have left reviews about Linda <span>Resort Hotel 5 * (Side)</span> , were generally satisfied with the apartments they proposed here.  So, the rooms seemed quite spacious, clean, comfortable, pleasantly decorated.  Our compatriots note that it is not at all necessary to pay extra when checking in for a view, since the landscape that opens from the balconies of almost all apartments is very nice.  The only thing that tourists advise those who sleep very sensitively is to ask them not to occupy the rooms whose windows open onto the driveway to the hotel.  Otherwise, cars that constantly ply here may interfere with your vacation. </p><p>  As for the equipment of the rooms, then, according to the guests, they have everything you need.  In this case, the furniture is comfortable, the technology is modern.  Everything is very high quality and in excellent working condition.  As pluses, our compatriots note very roomy safes, which are in all apartments.  So, tourists managed to put in them even laptops and large professional cameras. </p><p>  As for the shortcomings, some vacationers complained about the fact that Internet access is chargeable throughout the hotel.  True, it is inexpensive - about one dollar a day.  At the same time, Wi-Fi can be used both in the rooms and in the rest of the hotel. </p>

    <h2>  Cleaning </h2><p>  For the work of the maids of the Linda Resort Hotel, the reviews of tourists about which we are considering, the guests did not have any complaints.  So, according to travelers, the rooms were cleaned every day.  Moreover, the maids have always focused on the time convenient for hotel guests.  Therefore, when you are in the room, no one will bother you.  As for the towels, they were also changed every day.  Bed linen is updated twice a week.  However, if you want sheets and pillowcases to be changed during the next cleaning, then place a special sign on the bed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="linda resort hotel side turkey description" class="if" height="313" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1109808.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Check in, departure </h2><p>  As for the race, according to our compatriots who had a rest at Linda Resort, they always try to accommodate only arrived guests as early as possible.  However, if your vacation was at the height of the holiday season, then it is likely that in case of an early arrival at the hotel you will have to wait a few hours until the previous tenants have vacated the room and then the maids will prepare it.  However, this does not mean that you have to sit and get bored in the lobby near the reception, waiting for the keys to the apartment.  You can leave your things in the luggage storage room and go for breakfast or lunch, relax by the pool, take a walk around the territory and the surrounding area, or go straight to the sea. </p><p>  On the day of departure, the apartment must be vacated before 12 noon.  If you plan to leave the hotel much later, then you can either renew the room for an additional fee, or hand over the keys, leaving things at the reception, and continue your vacation, since no one will remove your bracelet from the hotel guest until your departure. </p>

So, according to our tourists, the menu here is very diverse, and the cooks prepare very tasty.  Of course, here you will not find such frills that you can count on in the more expensive "fives."

In addition, hotel guests can visit the √† la carte restaurant, have a meal in the afternoon at the poolside snack bar, and dine fully at the beach restaurant. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Since the Linda Resort Hotel 5 * hotel (Side, Turkey) is located on the second coastline, you will have to walk a little to the beach.  According to tourists, a measured step to reach the sea was possible in about seven minutes.  In addition, a bus runs every half hour between the beach and the hotel.  Therefore, if you do not want to walk, you can always use the free shuttle service. </p><p>  Linda Resort Hotel has its own beach.  There is fine sand on the shore, and pebble in the water.  There are no stones at the bottom, according to vacationers.  However, the sea in this place is not very calm, so almost every day there are waves.  In this regard, guests with young children are advised not to leave their babies unattended, even if they play at the very edge of the water. </p><p>  The beach itself, according to our compatriots, is equipped very well.  So, there is a sufficient number of umbrellas and deck chairs, a bar and restaurant, there is a volleyball court. </p>
