Costa Brava: resorts, hotels, traveler reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  We will devote this article to the examination of budget hotels on the Costa Brava and, in particular, to the Savoy Beach Club 3 hotel (Spain).  Warm Mediterranean climate, developed tourist infrastructure, European level of service will provide you with an unforgettable vacation.  Spanish “fours” and even “three rubles” are quite comparable in service with the Egyptian “fives”.  And the prices for the Costa Brava (especially at the beginning and end of the tourist season) are lower than in Sochi.  So, holders of Schengen visas do not have to think about a place to stay: Spain with its many coasts awaits you.  There are hotels for every taste and designed for any thickness of the wallet.  The Spanish "five" look like palaces, and the service is appropriate.  But the cost of living is impressive: nine and a half thousand rubles a day for a double room.  Not ready to lay out that amount?  Then let's consider offers from hotels of lesser stardom. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Savoy beach club 3" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/681849.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What is the Costa Brava: location, climate, beaches </h2><p>  All the shores of the Iberian Peninsula bear sonorous names.  For example, Verde (Green), Dorada (Golden), Azahar (Sugar) and so on.  We now consider only one <span>coast of Spain</span> - the Costa Brava.  It extends from the border with France to the city of Blanes.  The translation of the Costa Brava means "Coast of the Brave."  The name is explicable.  This coast is rocky and dotted with numerous secluded coves.  The beaches are mostly pebble, but there are many sandy.  The climate here is mild, but still not as hot as in the southern <span>regions of Spain.</span>  Therefore, the tourist season here is short - from May to early October.  The largest city nearby is Gerona (Catalonia).  In addition, international flights take the <span>airports of Barcelona</span> and Reus.  But the lion's share of tourists prefer to arrive in Costa Brava through the capital of Catalonia.  From Barcelona, ​​coastal resort towns can be reached by train or bus. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Resorts Costa Brava </h2><p>  The most important town and at the same time the southernmost point of the coast is Blanes.  There is a train from Barcelona and Gerona.  Blanes is considered a family vacation spot.  A tourist mecca on the Costa Brava is Lloret de Mar.  By the way, the Savoy Beach Club 3 hotel we are interested in is also located in this town. Lloret de Mar is famous for its sand and pebble beaches and the fact that there are many Russian tourists here.  This is a party place for young people from different countries.  Within the city are two beaches - Fenals Beach and Lloret.  Among the attractions of the resort, it is worth mentioning the Marineland water park, a copy of the Canaleta Fountain from Barcelona, ​​a sculpture by Donja Mariner (the wife of a sailor) and the so-called “Castle on the Beach” - the private residence of Narsis Plaha.  If we talk about excursions along the coast, then you can not ignore the town of Tossa with its medieval quarter Villa Vella.  You also need to look at least for a day in the splendid Barcelona, ​​the city of Salvador Dali - Gerona, the famous Antonio Gaudi Reus and the Montserrat mountain monastery. </p><h2>  Spain, <span>4 * hotels,</span> Costa Brava </h2><p>  Do not rush to overpay in five-star hotels in Spain, when you can get the same level of relaxation cheaper.  Typically, a double room at the peak of the season in a hotel “four” will cost the economical tourist five and a half or six thousand rubles per day.  These hotels often stand on the front page (as, indeed, Savoy Beach Club 3!).  They have a vast surrounding area with one or more pools.  The buildings or bungalows of these hotels are surrounded by fragrant gardens or shady parks.  The rooms must have air conditioning, satellite TV, minibar and, of course, Wi-Fi.  Some rooms even have a living room with a small kitchenette, and instead of a balcony there is a spacious terrace.  The infrastructure in these hotels is quite comparable to the five-star competitors: animation (day and evening, for adults and children), spa centers, <span>sports grounds</span> and courts. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Costa Brava, Spain: 3 * hotels </h2><p>  Well, what about the "treshki"?  Does it make sense to settle in budget hotels in Spain?  Of course.  There are at least two hundred of them in Costa Brava.  What makes the hotels of this category the most popular?  Probably the ratio of price and quality.  Do not think that a hotel with three stars is located somewhere in the backyards of the resort, a kilometer from the sea, has shabby rooms and thrifty staff.  Not at all!  Many treshki on the Costa Brava, and Savoy Beach Club 3 in particular, are on the first line and at the same time close to all the benefits of urban civilization.  The rooms in hotels of this category can be small-sized, but their filling is no worse than the rooms in the Quartet: there is air conditioning, Wi-Fi, satellite TV, and some have a safe and a minibar.  As an option for families, it is worth considering offers of three-star apartments (for example, Hon's Platja HA).  They have a kitchen fully equipped with dishes and household appliances.  And in some "treshki" (in particular, La Terrassa Spa Center), vacationers have wellness treatments at SPA centers.  Pleasantly surprise hotels of this category with prices.  A double room with breakfast in high season costs about four thousand rubles a day. </p>
