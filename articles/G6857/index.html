    <h2></h2><h2>  Types of plasticine </h2><p>  Before approaching the most important thing - the story of how to mold a machine from plasticine, it must be said that there are several types of this material.  So, for the smallest children it is better to cook homemade plasticine, which is made from salt dough.  This is necessary in the first place so that the baby, even if it eats, does not harm his body.  For children of school and older preschool age, it is better to use ordinary plasticine, which can be purchased at any stationery.  For children whose sculpting is their favorite pastime, and besides, the products turn out beautiful, and there is a desire to preserve them, it is better to purchase a special <span>sculptural clay,</span> which, however, is a little more difficult to work with <span>,</span> since it can from time to time require heating. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2></h2><h2>  Model selection </h2><p>  Before you figure out how to mold a car from plasticine, you need to decide what the child wants to see as a result.  It can be a passenger car, truck, bus, car, etc. And after that you need to start trying to sculpt the desired product from the material. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sculpt a car from plasticine" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/342245.jpg?1393243677159" width="500"></div></h2><h2></h2><h2>  What to do </h2><p>  In order for the machine to turn out beautiful, it is better to take several colors of plasticine.  Now we will figure out how to mold a car-car from plasticine.  To do this, you need to take clay of the main color and roll an oval of the desired size from it (the size of the machine itself will depend on this).  Next, with the help of a knife, it will be necessary to trim the edges of the oval so that a regular rectangle is obtained.  This will be the basis of the machine itself.  It should be noted that the edges can also be rounded so that the car is not so acute-angled.  Modeling a car from plasticine also implies the presence of the following stage: preparing a place for the wheels and creating the wheels themselves.  To do this, you can take a cap, for example from a bottle, and beautifully push plasticine in those places where the wheels will be.  It is not difficult to mold tires.  To do this, make four equal-sized balls and flatten them on the sides a little to make the product look like real.  That's all, the foundation is ready! </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="plasticine molding machine" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/342247.jpg?1393243698910" width="600"></div></h2><h2></h2><h2>  Decoration </h2><p>  Understanding how to <span>sculpt a</span> car-car <span>from plasticine</span> , it is also worth paying attention to such details as its decoration, as well as creating a spoiler.  To create it, you will need to fashion one wide flat part and two small supports so that the wing can hold on to something.  The spoiler is attached to the rear of the car.  Now you can put a strip for decoration on the side or front of the machine.  Or decide which brand this car is, and then fashion a small icon.  You can also decorate the car by cutting out individual drawings on it, but you never know what else you can think of.  And to help you - fantasy and skillful hands. </p>
