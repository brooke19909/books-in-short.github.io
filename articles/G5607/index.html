Argentine Peso: A History of Creation</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Argentine Republic is located in South America and is one of the richest countries in the region.  The shores of its eastern part are washed by the waters of the Atlantic Ocean, which is very attractive for tourists from various countries.  Also popular among travelers are the northwestern regions of the Andes, where you can go skiing and relax.  Tourists often wonder what currency is in Argentina and what <span>currency units are</span> in use.  It must be said that the American dollar is constantly in circulation in the republic, especially when it comes to visiting major cities and tourist centers.  In a remote provincial area, you must have local money.  The currency of Argentina is called the new Argentine peso.  In the international currency market, it is indicated by the three initial letters ARS.  There are smaller coins, which are called centavos. </p><h2>  From the history of the country </h2><p>  The name of the state is translated from Latin as ‚Äúsilver‚Äù.  This is very symbolic, because the Spaniards arrived in Argentina precisely to search for this metal.  For a long time the country was under their oppression and only in 1816 gained independence. </p>

    <p>  The beginning of the 20th century was the heyday of Argentina.  European emigrants greatly enriched her and made her the richest on the continent.  In 1976, power was in the hands of a military junta.  In 1983, a democratic system was established in the country, but the originally Argentine <span>Falkland Islands</span> remained under British rule.  The economy of the state was greatly affected by the <span>economic crisis of the</span> late twentieth century, which Argentina could only get out of by 2006. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Denomination of banknotes and coins </h2><p>  The Argentine peso has a paper expression.

As a result of the denomination, a thousand pesos were exchanged for one australia.  The country experienced strong inflation, so the need for a new exchange arose.  Over ten thousand australians gave one new peso.  A new exchange took place on the last day of 1991.  To this day, the new Argentine peso remains in use. </p><h2>  Currency Rates </h2><p>  Leadership of the state adheres to a policy of managed floating exchange rates.  Among Latin American countries, only Venezuela and Argentina follow such tactics.  The currency, whose exchange rate has long been quite high, has recently declined by half.  In the country in free circulation there are also American dollars.  A large <span>percentage of payments are</span> made by Visa cards and others. </p>

    <p>  The Argentine peso is 1: 9 against the dollar and 1: 9.5 against the euro.  Recently, there has been a fall in all major world currencies.  It also affected the Argentine peso. </p><h2>  Recommendations for tourists <strong></strong></h2><p>  Those who are going to spend an unforgettable vacation in Argentina should not forget that this is a rather expensive country.  Until some time, even the Argentines themselves tried to go on vacation to cheaper countries such as the United States or Brazil. </p><p>  For visitors, a daily meal will have to spend, according to the most conservative estimates, about five dollars; on average, about fifty dollars a day will be spent on food.  Housing prices range from ten to one hundred and fifty dollars a day.  The currency of Argentina is quite expensive, so tourists from the territory of the post-Soviet space do not always choose a country as a place to stay. </p>

    <p>  Argentina has a two-tiered pricing system.  For the local population, everything is cheaper, and for foreigners visiting - at times more expensive.  The currency of Argentina is not in a stable position.  The country is going through many moments of inflation, like many other states in the modern world.  However, the flow of tourists to Argentina remains stably high. </p>
