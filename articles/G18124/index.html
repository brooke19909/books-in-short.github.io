  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make original fabric beads with your own hands</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Original and exclusive handmade items and jewelry are always admirable.  After all, they look very impressive, as they are the result of vivid creative imagination, and in addition, they are able to open before the people around the rich <span>inner world of the</span> person who created them. </p><p>  Handmade fabric beads made of the simplest and most improvised materials are one of their successful ways for creative expression and improvisation.  The most unusual techniques and artistic decisions are appropriate here, because the main function of this accessory, no matter what it is made of, is to emphasize the unique style and charm of the female image. </p><p>  A few simple techniques for making textile jewelry can awaken imagination and creative impulse to create more complex things.  The main thing is to understand how to make beads of fabric with your own hands, to understand the basic techniques and principles of this work.  For an example we will choose some different, but original ways. </p><p>  The first way.  From a thin fabric (preferably natural silk or crepe de chine) of any suitable color, you need to cut a tape about sixty long and five to six centimeters wide.  Now we need artificial filler or foam.  We roll a piece of filler into a ball and wrap it in a cloth, tying small knots on both sides of the resulting ball.  Then insert the next ball of filler, tie a knot, etc.  to the end of the tape.  Each bead (if it turned out too "thin") can be additionally knocked out with a filler.  Then, with a thin thread with a needle, with secret stitches, sew each bead and sew on the ends two ribbon ties.  By the same principle, you can make beads of fabric with your own hands, using transparent nylon.  In this case, each bead is stuffed not with cotton, but with various colored scraps of silk, <span>brocade fabrics</span> and threads, as well as shiny sequins that will shine through the transparent fabric and create flickering effects. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The second way.  Do-it- <span>yourself</span> textile <span>beads</span> are very beautiful if you alternate fabric elements with glass or plastic beads that match well in color.  So, for work you will need several beads of different colors and sizes, a flap of fabric, a thin silk or leather lace, beads, a thin needle and thread for sewing.  We cut the fabric flap into pieces with sides 10 by 15 cm. Each piece, backing one centimeter from the edge, is sewn along the perimeter with small stitches, we tighten the thread, twisting the edges inward.  We sew the resulting textile bead in different directions, collecting it with beautiful puffs and folds, stringing each time on a needle with a bead.  During this process, we attach the bead to the lace in its center.  Then, stepping back a centimeter (no more), <span>tie a</span> knot on the <span>lace</span> , string a glass bead on it, make a knot again (as close as possible to the bead), string another bead, larger, then make the knot again.  After alternating several glass, we again make a bead from textiles, etc.  until on one side of the lace there is 20 cm left until its end.  The same process is repeated from the middle of the lace to the other side.  So you can quickly create fancy beads of fabric with your own hands. </p><p>  In winter, with wool knitted pullovers and sweaters, beads from felt will be a beautiful addition.  Making them is also very simple.  For work, you will need to take colored wool for felting (sold in art salons) and a soap solution, which is made from a detergent dissolved in hot water with little foaming. </p><p>  To make a round bead, a piece of fluffy wool is moistened with soapy water and rolled up in the palms of your hands.  Until the ball has become dense and well-rolled, you can add pieces of wool in the process to give it a more even shape.  When the surface of the beads becomes dense and smooth, the felt elements are ready.  They are dried and collected in beads.  Balls can be of different colors and sizes.  They can be decorated with beads or embroidery. </p>
