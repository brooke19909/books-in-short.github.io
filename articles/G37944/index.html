    <p>  The greatest invention of mankind is money.  They are one of the most valuable tools that every country has.  The world exchange rate determines the economic situation of the state.  The national unit of Ukraine, according to the Constitution of the country, is the hryvnia.  This currency appeared in the everyday life of Ukrainians in 1996.  The second president of Ukraine, Leonid Kuchma, introduced by decree a new <span>currency of Ukraine</span> - and the coupon-carbovans were exchanged for hryvnias.  Of course, if you compare the first currency and the modern one, there are huge differences, even if you consider that only 18 years have passed.  The difference is especially noticeable on the bill of 200 hryvnia. </p><h2>  Hryvnia history </h2><p>  Few people are interested in the meaning of the word "hryvnia", although every Ukrainian uses this word several times a day.  At various times, coins were called this term: first, in denominations of two kopecks, then in three, then in ten kopecks.  The term itself comes from the Polish language and was used as the name of the currency.  In ancient Russia, this word was called the unit of calculation, but the original name came from the name of the female precious neck jewelry.  According to ancient chronicles, one hryvnia was quite expensive, because you could buy a whole planed boat for it.  In the 11th century, coins that had a similar name appeared in Kievan Rus.  They were called "hryvnia", made of silver and were heavy in weight.  Such monetary units existed in Kievan Rus for quite a long time, not one hundred years.  But despite the fact that the ruble has become the monetary unit since the 15th century, the term ‚Äúhryvnia‚Äù was still used to mean a unit of weight. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1918, in the independent state of the UPR, the monetary unit of the hryvnia again appeared, which existed until 1922. </p><h2>  What denominations of hryvnia exist in the country </h2><p>  The modern hryvnia as the national unit of Ukraine appeared as a result of the <span>monetary reform of</span> 1995-1996.  The very first hryvnias in 1996 exchanged at the rate of 100,000 coupon-Carbovans for 1 hryvnia.  The coupon-Carbovan was withdrawn from circulation for several months.  In order for the population to manage to exchange old money, numerous exchange points were opened on the territory of Ukraine.  According to some reports, about 310 trillion coupon-Carbovans were withdrawn from the cash flow during the reform period. </p>

    <p>  Now there are denominations in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 hryvnias, as well as large coins in denominations of 1 hryvnia.  From 1996 to 2007, the National Bank of Ukraine conducted about 18 introductions into circulation of the country's inhabitants of the main denominations of the national currency.  The old examples of hryvnia are those that were issued before 2001 (1992, 1994, 1995, 1997).  This money was not protected enough.  Since 2001, hryvnia began to be produced, which had a high level of protection against counterfeiting, a larger size and a more attractive design.  Over the 18 years of existence, the hryvnia has changed its appearance about three times, retaining only common features.  The sizes of banknotes began to differ depending on the face value, the colors of steel became saturated.  The hryvnia was even named the <span>most beautiful currency in the world</span> in 2011. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How many samples of a bill in 200 hryvnias were in the history of Ukraine </h2><p>  According to European experts, the Ukrainian currency received the status of the most beautiful in the world due to its successful design, because, according to people, I want to consider and study it.  Especially striking is the purple bright bill in nominal value of 200 hryvnia.  For the first time, a banknote of 200 UAH appeared before 2001, but it was completely different.  First of all, the original version was blue and white, small in size, with a portrait of Lesya Ukrainka.  200 hryvnias of the old type gradually left the cash flow, giving place to the new banknote of 2001, which was more attractive.  A new sample was introduced in 2007 by the National Bank of Ukraine. </p>

    <p>  The external signs of 200 hryvnias have changed significantly.  The bill on the front side has a portrait of Lesya Ukrainka, and on the reverse side - part of the tower of the <span>Lutsk castle.</span>  The banknote paper also differs in its features: it contains local watermarks.  The bill contains <span>watermarks of the</span> portrait of Lesya Ukrainka, individual inscriptions and images, there is also a separate sign, which has a different relief of paint.  It is felt to the touch, which is especially useful for people with low vision.  In total, "two hundred" has 12 degrees of protection, which meets European standards. </p><h2>  Ukrainian hryvnia exchange rate </h2><p>  The difficult situation in Ukraine has led to the fact that the Ukrainian hryvnia is increasingly depreciating in the foreign exchange market.  By the regulation on August 12, 2014, foreign exchange rates, especially the dollar and the ruble, increased very much in the country's banks.  According to the Central Bank of Russia, on August 12, one Ukrainian hryvnia can be purchased for 2.8384 rubles.  The National Bank of Ukraine as of this date set the dollar against the hryvnia 1 to 13. </p>
