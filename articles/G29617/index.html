As you know, the architecture of the city of Palma has always been very highly rated by tourists.  This is especially true of the mid-twentieth century, since in those years the island experienced the greatest tourist flow.  According to reviews, Holidays in Mallorca - the best in Europe. </p><p>  Every year, millions of tourists from all over the world come here to see the best attractions, swim in the Mediterranean Sea and enjoy the wonderful atmosphere of one of the best resorts in Europe.  This place will certainly be always popular. </p><p>  Landscapes of the city excite travelers.  For example, there is a huge mountain range, many picturesque hills and plains, beautiful citrus orchards, as well as clean beaches equipped.  In addition, a wide variety of hotels and attractions in Mallorca (great reviews) will definitely not let you get bored.  In this article, we will tell you about the sights, as well as traveler reviews about them. </p><h2>  Paseo de Bourne Street </h2><div class="photo" data-original="suitelife.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Paseo de Bourne Street" class="if uuid-2292694" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2292694.jpg"></div><p>  As you know, Palma is the capital of the island of Mallorca.  It is also considered the most popular tourist destination.  It is no wonder that this street is always full of citizens and travelers, as it is considered the most famous.  Here you can constantly see the performances of street musicians, carnival evenings, as well as other events. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition, on this street you can see many architectural structures, as well as some historical sites and sculptures. </p><p>  About this street in Mallorca, the reviews of tourists are quite pleasant.  Many travelers note that there are a very large number of pleasant restaurants and shops.  In addition, a very interesting and picturesque nature.  Many people call this place "Mini Rambla." </p><h2>  Sierra de Tramontana </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.isoladimaiorca.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sierra de Tramontana" class="if uuid-2292706" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2292706.jpg"></div><p>  The same mountain range that we spoke about above.  Its length is more than ninety kilometers.  It is interesting that this place was inscribed on the UNESCO list some time ago, that is, it is under protection. </p><p>  It is believed that the highest ridges of this chain are Puig Major, as well as Puig de Massanella.  The height of the first ridge is 1445 meters, and the second 1364. In addition, this includes picturesque valleys, as well as trees and hills.  In addition, today there are a large number of attractions made by hand. </p><p>  Many travelers leave reviews of Mallorca (Sierra de Tramontana mountains) on various sites.  Most of them really like the atmosphere of this place, as well as the fact that these mountains are very picturesque.  In addition, the Sierra de Tramontana is considered the best option for outdoor activities. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  By the way, many buses go to the mountains, and the fare from the center of Palma will be no more than half an hour.  Believe me, you will not regret it, this place is breathtaking for every tourist. </p><h2>  Port de Soller </h2><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Famous port in Mallorca" class="if uuid-2292717" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2292717.jpg"></div><p>  This place is considered a resort area, in the summer a lot of travelers from around the world have a rest here, but this does not mean that the beaches are clogged and there is no passage to them.  This is not at all true. </p><p>  The place is considered very picturesque, because it is surrounded by a mountain range, and from this the air is only cleaner.  The beach is located in the small town of Soller.  We want to warn that the distance from the city center to the coast is not quite close.  But they are connected by a tram line.  Most of the hotels are located in the sea zone, which is quite logical.  The bulk of people come here just for a beach holiday. </p><p>  Tourists claim that this place is great for relaxation.  There is no huge crowd of people.  The beaches are not empty, but there is no lack of oxygen at all. </p><h2>  Valldemossa </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.seemallorca.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Valldemossa in Mallorca" class="if uuid-2292719" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2292719.jpg"></div><p>  A very popular town in de Mallorca.  Located next to the Sierra de Tramontana mountain range.  The distance to the capital of Mallorca is about seventeen kilometers.  What is this city famous for?  The fame of this place brought Cartesian monastery, built many years ago.  In the twentieth century, they decided to remake it into a hotel that is currently not functioning.  Now this place is a museum. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Most tourists are attracted to the town because it is very picturesque.  Here you can think about the deep, as well as enjoy the beauties of nature.  In addition, in reviews of Mallorca, many write about Valldemossa as a great place for cycling as well as hiking. </p><h2>  Aquarium in the city of Palma </h2><div class="photo" data-original="palmaaquarium.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Aquarium in Mallorca" class="if uuid-2292727" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2292727.jpg"></div><p>  The capital of Mallorca has a fairly large aquarium.  Many travelers like to visit this place.  The aquarium consists of fifty-five aquariums; a rather impressive number of marine inhabitants live in it.  By the way, it was built in 2007. </p><p>  Many times the aquarium received the title of "Best Aquarium of Europe."  The area is more than forty thousand square meters.  It takes about four hours to get acquainted with the whole variety of fish.  In addition, there are many species of sharks that will definitely not leave you indifferent. </p><p>  Tourists in their reviews of Mallorca claim that the aquarium is definitely worth seeing.  This is especially true for tourists with children.  Believe me, they will be incredibly impressed by the diversity of the underwater world right in front of their eyes. </p><h2>  Kathmandu park </h2><p>  This is an amusement park located on the territory of Calvia Beach.  It is believed that the park is one of the best in Spain.  There are many interesting attractions here, one of the most fascinating is an unusual house upside down.  It is called "Desperate from the Wild West."  In addition, Kathmandu Park has a cinema showing 4D films, a small water park, and a mini-golf course. </p><p>  Even here, they often arrange various entertainment programs for visitors to this wonderful place.  Often here you can see pirates showing acrobatic stunts. </p><p>  According to tourists, it can be concluded that the park is quite interesting, but there are several drawbacks.  Many do not like the quality of the picture in the cinema, the price of tickets, as well as long lines.  But still the house upside down impresses everyone and always.  There are no bad reviews about him at all. </p><h2>  Manor La Granja </h2><p>  A fairly well-known estate in Spain, built in the seventeenth century.  It is located in a very nice picturesque place, among the mountains, lakes, as well as gardens. </p><p>  This building had a lot of owners.  Among them, there are monarchs as well as nobles.  At the moment, the historical building houses the Museum of the History of Mallorca.  As you know, the building is not state property, but is privately owned. </p><p>  The estate has the opportunity to live for a while.  Thus, travelers have the opportunity to get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãlife in this place.  For example, about the economic traditions of the island, the way of being. </p><p>  La Granja Manor offers guided tours.  According to tourist reviews of Mallorca, it can be said that most of the travelers are impressed here by nature, by the density of forests.  In addition, the great advantage of this place is that there is no huge concentration of tourists and no one will rush you. </p><h2>  Almuden Palace </h2><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Almuden Palace" class="if uuid-2292748" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2292748.jpg"></div><p>  While the Moors ruled on this island, this wonderful palace was built, which we can observe in modern times. </p><p>  This place was the residence of the viziers.  In the fourteenth century, the building was rebuilt by order of the ruling king, Jaime II.  As you can see from the building‚Äôs fa√ßade, classical features of Arabian architecture are observed here. </p><p>  Later, for a long time, this building was used as the residence of the Knights of Mallorca.  After this was the residence of the Viceroy of Mallorca. </p><p>  As you know, in our time the palace bears the title of royal.  By the way, inside the castle the walls are completely bare and empty.  There is no furniture, paintings.  Virtually nothing. </p><p>  As for the reviews about it, for the most part, tourists believe that the place to visit is definitely worth it, since it is very historical.  Most of all, travelers are impressed by the courtyard of the palace with the royal chapel, as well as many cacti.  In addition, there is a beautiful view of the Palm Bay. </p><p>  As for the tour, tourists are carefully examined at the entrance, and then give shoe covers, a tablet.  You yourself can choose the type of excursion.  Short or long.  By the way, taking pictures with a flash inside the building is strictly prohibited. </p><p>  Unfortunately, most of the palace is closed to viewing, as it is privately owned by the monarch and, according to recent reports, will soon be transferred to the state. </p><h2>  Belver Castle </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.seemallorca.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Belver Castle" class="if uuid-2292735" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2292735.jpg"></div><p>  The most interesting building in Mallorca.  The construction was built in the fourteenth century for King Jaima the Second, about whom we already spoke in this article. </p><p>  In the sixteenth century, this building, unfortunately, was on fire and was therefore reconstructed.  Of course, as a result of this modernization, a lot of elements were lost that were originally. </p><p>  As for the shape of the structure, it is quite unusual and interesting.  The towers are in the shape of a cylinder.  By the way, medieval Gothic style is considered the architectural style of the building. </p><p>  Most tourists this place is quite impressive.  In addition, there are not many medieval buildings in Majorca. </p><h2>  Capdepera castle </h2><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Capdepera castle" class="if uuid-2292741" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2292741.jpg"></div><p>  Another castle erected during the reign of Jaima II.  Once the king ordered the construction of this fortress in order to protect a small island. </p><p>  By the way, in those days there were quite a lot of residential buildings, but later mass relocations began to take place.  People sailed away in search of a better life. </p><p>  It had military significance for a long time, but in the eighteenth century it lost it.  Then the castle passed into the possession of the governor. </p><p>  During its existence, it was empty for a long time and no one paid particular attention to it.  In 1983, a fairly large-scale reconstruction of the building took place. </p><p>  According to tourist reviews of Mallorca (Spain), we can conclude that this place is one of the most popular to visit.  It is very majestic and historical, therefore it attracts so much attention. </p><h2>  Majorca in June: reviews </h2><p>  Most tourists are interested in Mallorca precisely this month, because in June the heat is not very strong.  We believe that it is worth resting at this time.  So you can see more attractions, while not being burned by the heat.  Reviews of de Mallorca at this time are excellent. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Mallorca is a great place for a beach and mountain vacation.  There are many attractions here.  There will always be something to visit and see.  Reviews of Palma de Mallorca are positive. </p><p>  We hope that the article was interesting for you and you were able to find answers to all the questions. </p>
