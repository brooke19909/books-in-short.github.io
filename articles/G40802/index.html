    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Of course, for tourists, the important question is whether it is possible to rely on food when settling in the Ruby Nha Trang Hotel 3 *.  Vietnam is a country in which most of the hotels operate according to the BB scheme, offering their guests only breakfast.  This resort is no exception - paying for accommodation, guests also receive the right to daily morning meals, which takes place in the form of a buffet from 6 to 10 in the morning.  Breakfast is served in the luxurious restaurant located on the top floor.  Through panoramic windows you can enjoy views of the surroundings. </p><p>  By the way, reviews say that the menu here is not bad - guests are served salads, fresh fruits, pastries, toasts, fried eggs, in a word, traditional breakfast dishes.  The rest of the day, you can also eat at the local restaurant, but already paying the bill.  Visitors are offered traditional Vietnamese cuisine, as well as some European dishes. </p><p>  Near the hotel, and on the beach itself, there are several cafes and restaurants where, for a small fee, you can have a delicious lunch or dinner, so meals are unlikely to be a problem. </p><h2>  Where is the beach located?
