    <h2>  Place of Birth </h2><p>  Disputes about him have been going on for a long time.  The main places of birth are called the village of Svyatitsa in Votlozhemsky volost, the villages of Kurtsevo and Dmitrievo.  The first is considered the most suitable option.  The author of the theory that Khabarov Erofei was born in Dmitrievo was a scientist from Leningrad Belov.  He examined a lot of documents, on the basis of which he put forward a hypothesis.  Considering the village of Dmitrievo (which now exists in the Nyuksensky district) to be the birthplace, the scientist did not take into account the fact that this settlement was not formerly an administrative-territorial division of Votlozhemsky volost. </p><h2>  Erofei Khabarov: a brief biography </h2><p>  The future entrepreneur and traveler was a peasant.  Erofei Khabarov (years of life and death 1603‚Äì1671) left his family and a rather large farm, and after other quite prosperous and free field cultivators of the Vologda Region, hunters and fishermen of Primorye, who were looking for adventure and wealth, Cossacks from the Don and Volga, headed for the Stone Belt.  All these people sought to taiga regions to the rivers in Eastern Siberia.  So, the <span>Russian explorer</span> Erofei Khabarov arrived in Yenisey in 1628.  Here he quickly mastered the territory, began to engage in the usual cultivation, and began trade.  For some time Khabarov Erofei served in Yeniseisk.  Having made a trip to Taimyr and Mangazeya, together with his brother Nicephorus, he wanted to return to his family, under Veliky Ustyug.  However, instead they again headed to Siberia.  They followed the crowd of Ustyug and Vologda immigrants.  People were persecuted by decree of the king along with Dvinsk women.  The latter were intended to be married to Lena and Yenisei archers.  Khabarov Erofei did not begin to develop tillage in Siberia.  But he was very lucky in trade.  He soon became a wealthy entrepreneur.  After the people heard a rumor about wealth on the banks of the Lena River, he gathered a detachment, received the necessary supplies from the treasury and went to a new place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="It is named after Erofei Khabarov" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1048943.jpg" width="600"></div>

Here he was engaged in fur trade.  In 1639, he stopped at the mouth of Kuta.  Small salt springs beat from the bottom of the lake there.  Here the donkey Khabarov Erofei sowed a plot, built wells and varnitsas.  He learned the simple technology of salt production even at home - in Totma, Ustyug and Vychegodskaya Salt.  Soon there was a trade in salt, bread and other goods.  In the spring of 1641, Khabarov Yerofey crossed to the mouth of Kirenga.  Here he also started a farm, which expanded quite quickly.  Once he lent a detachment of Golovin 3 thousand pounds of bread.  However, the governor not only did not return what he had taken, but soon took away all the bread from Erofei, handed over the saltworks to the treasury, and threw Khabarov himself into prison.  The entrepreneur managed to regain freedom only by the year 1645.  However, everything that the Russian researcher Erofei Pavlovich Khabarov did was left in the past. </p><h2>  Campaign in Dauria </h2><p>  In 1648, Franzbekov replaced Golovin.  Around the same time, Poyarkov's expedition to Dauria took place.  However, contact with local residents was not very successful.  Khabarov knew about this.  In addition, he had information from different people about the mores and riches of Dauria.  Erofei Khabarov summarized the available information to Frantsbekov.  He hoped that the new governor would not miss the chance to get rich.  So the expedition of Erofei Khabarov to Dauria took place.  He didn‚Äôt have his own funds, but the traveler already knew quite well the manners of his superiors.  Frantzbekov loaned state-owned weapons (including several cannons) and military equipment, as well as agricultural equipment.  From the personal resources of the governor (at interest), all participants in the campaign received money.  To ensure movement along the river, Frantsbekov took the vessels from the Yakut industrialists.  The governor also took away enough bread from them to supply 70 Cossacks, whom he gathered in the Khabarov detachment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Khabarov Erofei Pavlovich that discovered" class="if" height="346" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1048944.jpg" width="600"></div>

In the autumn of 1649, his detachment was already marching up the Lena and Olekma rivers to the mouth of the Tungir.  During the frost expedition made a stop.  In January 1650, the detachment moved to the sledges and moved up the Tungir to the south.  Having passed the spurs on Olemkinsky Stanovik, in the spring people reached Urka.  After a while, the <span>railway station</span> and settlement will be located here (what is named after Erofei Khabarov). </p><h2>  Territory development </h2><p>  The Daurs, learning about the approach of the detachment, hastened to leave their settlements.  So the Khabarovsk people entered the first well-fortified, but by that time already empty city of Prince Lavkaya.  Here the Cossacks saw large and bright log houses.  There were several hundred of them.  The wide windows of the houses were covered with oiled paper.  In each of them could live 50 or more people.  There were also well-sheltered large pits.  They contained grain stocks.  The next item to which Erofei Khabarov went was Cupid.  On the way, the detachment visited the same empty towns and villages.  As a result, in one of the villages, the Cossacks discovered a woman.  She was brought to Khabarov.  She said that on the other side of the river there was a country, much richer and more than Dauria.  There was an influential ruler in it, possessing an army with guns and other weapons.  The country the woman was talking about was Manchuria. </p><h2>  New trip </h2><p>  In the "Left-handed town" Khabarov left about 50 Cossacks.  In 1650, by the end of May, he returned to Yakutsk.  Being on a campaign, Khabarovsk drew a drawing of Dauria.  This map and the report of his trip were subsequently forwarded to Moscow.  The drawing of the territory became one of the key sources used in the creation of maps of Siberia in the 17th century.  In Yakutsk, Khabarov again announced his recruitment to the detachment, speaking everywhere about the infinite riches of the Daurian land.  As a result, 110 people joined him.  Frantzbekov assigned 27 ‚Äúservice‚Äù people to them and supplied the detachment with three guns.  By the fall of 1650, Khabarov returned to Amur. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Erofei Khabarov short biography" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1048945.jpg" width="304"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Predatory hiking </h2><p>  He found his unit near the walls of the fortress of Albazin.  The Cossacks tried to storm her.  Daurs, seeing a new detachment, rushed to run.  But the Russians caught up with them, captured many prisoners.  Khabarov made Albazin his base camp.  From here he attacked Daurian villages located nearby, took prisoners.  Among the hostages were women.  Their Cossacks distributed among themselves. </p><h2>  Flotilla </h2><p>  In June 1651, sailings on the Amur River began.  At first, the Cossacks saw only small settlements abandoned and burned by the inhabitants.  However, a few days later Khabarov‚Äôs flotilla approached a well-fortified city.  Outside its walls, a whole Daurian garrison prepared for defense.  Thanks to the cannon fire, the Cossacks took the city.  After being captured for several weeks, the detachment stood in the city.  Khabarov sent messengers in all directions to convince Daurian princes to voluntarily go under the authority of the Russian tsar and pay yasak.  But the locals were at that time subjects of Manchuria.  The Daurian princes saw no reason in paying tribute to another ruler.  The Khabarov flotilla, capturing the horses, headed on.  Cossacks again encountered uncompressed arable land and deserted villages.  According to sources, in August, just below the mouth <span>of the Zeya River, a</span> Russian detachment without resistance occupied the fortress, surrounded a neighboring settlement and forced local residents to recognize the king‚Äôs citizenship.  Khabarov expected to receive a large tribute, but the captured could bring several sables, promising that they would pay the yasak in full in the fall.  At first glance, peaceful relations were established between Cossacks and Daurians.  However, a few days later, local residents left their homes with their families and left.  Khabarov in response to this burned down the fortress and continued his hike down the Amur.  From the mouth of the Bureya began the territory inhabited by the Gogul.  It was a Manchu-related nation.  Settlements were scattered and local residents could not resist the Cossacks, who landed on the beach and robbed them.  Plow farmers were also quickly captured, who at one time destroyed part of the detachment that participated in Poyarkov‚Äôs campaign.  Khabarov‚Äôs people were better armed and there were many more. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yerofey Khabarov years of life and death" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1048946.jpg" width="390"></div>

    <h2>  Nanai settlements </h2><p>  By the end of September, the detachment reached new territories and stopped in a larger settlement.  Khabarov sent half of the Cossacks for fish up the river.  The Nanai, along with the duchers, took advantage of this and attacked part of the detachment.  However, the locals were defeated and, having lost more than a hundred people killed, retreated.  Khabarov, in turn, having strengthened the settlement, remained there to winter.  From there, Cossacks raided local settlements and gathered yasak.  In the spring of 1652, they were attacked by a large (about 1000 people) Manchu detachment.  But the attackers were defeated.  Khabarov understood that his small detachment would not be able to capture the whole country.  As soon as the river opened, he left the prison and headed upstream. </p><h2>  Squad split </h2><p>  In June, just above the mouth of the river.  Sungari Khabarov met the Russian auxiliary detachment.  But, despite this, he continued the retreat, as he learned that the Manchus gathered a 6,000-strong army against him.  In early August, Khabarov stopped at the mouth of the river.  Zeya.  There, part of the "hunting people" detachment rebelled and, capturing three ships, fled.  Moving along the Amur River, they robbed and killed Nanai, Daur and Duchers.  So they sailed to Gilyak land and set up a prison to collect yasak.  However, Khabarov did not need rivals.  In September, he got to this prison and fired upon it.  The rebellious people promised to surrender if they survived and their prey was not taken from them.  Khabarov fulfilled this condition only partially.  On his orders, the traitors were brutally beaten (some to death), and he kept his booty. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What did the Russian researcher Erofei Pavlovich Khabarov do?" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1048948.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Second wintering </h2><p>  Her Khabarov spent in Gilyak land.  By the spring of 1653, he returned to the mouth of Zeya, in Dauria.  During the summer, his Cossacks swam down and up the Amur River, collecting yasak.  The left bank of the river, meanwhile, was empty.  The authorities of Manchuria ordered the residents to move to the right side.  The Russian tsar by that time sent an army of 3 thousand people, commanded by Lobanov-Rostovsky.  However, before the warriors, the ambassador of Tsar Zinoviev arrived.  He brought Khabarov and other participants in the campaign awards.  Along with this, Zinoviev removed the chieftain from further leadership.  When Khabarov began to object, the ambassador beat him and took him to Moscow.  On the way, Zinoviev took everything he had from him. </p><h2>  After meeting with the king </h2><p>  Alexei Mikhailovich wished to see Khabarov.  He gave him a good welcome, ordering Zinoviev to return all the property to the ataman.  The tsar granted Khabarov the title of <span>"son of the boyar."</span>  The sovereign appointed him clerk of settlements in the territory from Lena to Ilim.  In addition, Khabarov received several villages in Eastern Siberia.  However, the king, knowing the cruelty of the chieftain to the native population, forbade him to return to the occupied lands.  The sovereign praised the contribution that Yerofei Pavlovich Khabarov made to the expansion of the country's territory - that this person discovered and mastered since that time is part of the state.  Over time, a huge region was formed in the Far East.  Its administrative center is called Khabarovsk.  In addition, it was said above about the railway station, which bears the name of this person.  It should be said that this settlement exists today.  In addition, several small villages and streets in various cities of the country are named after the chieftain. </p><h2>  Burial place </h2><p>  It is not known for certain.  According to sources, Khabarov spent his last years in Ust-Kireng.  Now it is called the city of Kirensky (in the Irkutsk region).  Therefore, it is widely believed that the place of death of the chieftain is there.  But, according to other data, Khabarov‚Äôs grave was in the Bratsk prison (Bratsk city of the same Irkutsk region). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian explorer Erofei Khabarov" class="if" height="341" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1048952.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Monument </h2><p>  It is installed <span>in Khabarovsk</span> (the administrative center of the region) on the forecourt.  The sculpture, taken as the basis of the monument, was created by Milchin.  The monument to Erofei Khabarov was installed on May 29, 1958. The decision to create the monument was made five years before the 100th anniversary of the city.  Work on the sculpture began in the 1950s.  It was small in size and exhibited at the All-Union Art Exhibition.  When the question of the monument to Khabarov was being decided, it was this sculpture that was taken as the basis.  As for the similarities, then it can not be discussed.  In the sources there are neither images, nor even descriptions of Khabarov‚Äôs appearance.  Work on the monument continued until February 1958.  At that time, plaster forms of individual elements of the monument began to be cast.  By mid-March, molding was completed.  Finished items were sent to the Moscow foundry (in Mytishchi) at an art foundry.  The monument shows Khabarov climbing to the rock.  Peering into the Amurian distances, he holds a scroll in his left hand, and with his right hand he supports the floor of a fur coat that has slipped off his shoulder.  On the front of the pedestal there is an inscription "Erofei Pavlovich Khabarov."  The height of the figure is 4.5 m, the total height with the pedestal is 11.5.  The monument was built 2 days before the centenary of the city. </p>
