Few people are familiar with its history, even among residents of the region.  Let's deal with the past and present of this settlement together.  The Russian outback is not necessarily boring. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="51.1442795" data-lng="41.22517970000001" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="7"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/2/4/5/8/2458.png"></div><h2>  Excursion into the past and present </h2><p>  Elan-Kolen, Novokhopersky district, Voronezh region today is a settlement in which more than 5 thousand people live.  But it was not always so. </p><p>  At the beginning of the XVIII century, this place became the concentration of runaway serfs and servants who were resettled from the village of Tishanka and the city of Yelets.  The immigrants formed a strong community, which by the beginning of the 20th century had grown into a small village. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.colourbox.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Voronezh region Elan knee" class="if uuid-2410303" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73489/2410303.jpg"></div><p>  There were three small factories, several public buildings, a large number of shops, several windmills and one steam mill.  A strong but partially natural economy was formed.  Most people were engaged in handicrafts and agriculture. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  With the onset of the Civil War, the Elan-Knee of the Voronezh Region fell into the center of developing events.  The village passed from white to red several times, but in the end, Soviet power was established here. </p><p>  During the offensive of the Nazi invaders during the Great Patriotic War, the Elan-Kolen of the Voronezh region was in close proximity to the front, so a hospital was established in the local school. </p><p>  After the collapse of the USSR, all local enterprises were liquidated, and local business was connected only with agriculture. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.videoblocks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Voronezh region Novohopersky district elan knee" class="if uuid-2410305" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73489/2410305.jpg"></div><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><ul><li>  The name Elan-Kolen of the Voronezh region is associated with the name of the river on which the village stands.  Elan is a river, a knee is a gyrus on which a settlement is located. </li><li>  The village has a centenary Orthodox church. </li><li>  Elan-Kolen confused with his neighbor Elan-Kolenovsky.  These are two different settlements.  The latter was founded only in 1936 for the needs of a sugar factory. </li></ul><p>  Today the village is a sample of the central Russian outback.  Residents here lead a quiet and measured life, classes of local schools do not recruit ten people a year, and young people gradually leave their small homeland.  One can only guess what will happen to the historical settlement in 10-15 years, but I want to believe that this example of a charming province will receive a new round of development. </p>
