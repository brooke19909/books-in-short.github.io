    <p>  The climate in Cuba is tropical and controversial.  Six months a year (from October to April) it is hot and dry, and the rest of the time the island is simply rained.  Temperature changes in winter and summer are insignificant.  On average, over the course of a year, its value ranges from 25-26 degrees.  But Cuba is not alone in the vast expanses of the sea.  On all sides it is surrounded by many small islands of different sizes.  There are about 1600 of them. </p><h2>  Island state </h2>

All the islands of Cuba belong to one state.  Some of them are collected in whole groups (Greater Antilles) and archipelagos (Sabana, Camaguey, Los Canarreos, Jardines de la Reina).  All of them are like beads scattered along the coast.  The largest and most famous islands of Cuba are <span>Cayo Rosario, Cayo Largo, Cayo Guillermo, Cayo Coco, Cayo Santa Maria, Cayo Grande</span> , Cayo Breton and Cayo Anclitas.  It is impossible to describe in simple words the beauty of these fabulous places.  Each of them is unique in its own way.  Take, for example, Cayo Largo.  This secluded spot on the southwest coast is simply amazing with its pristine beauty.  Delicate white sand against the background of the emerald sea and slender palm trees on the shore near the water itself.  The island is surrounded by coral reefs where diving enthusiasts can enjoy the <span>beauty of the underwater world.</span>  Among the treacherous mountain cliffs, many ships found their last refuge in the Middle Ages, and until now, treasure seekers do not lose hope of finding a treasure deep below the thickness of silent water.  The islands of Cuba are famous for their nature reserves.  In one of them on the island of Cayo Coco lives a population of about 30 thousand flamingos.  Even the most beautiful beach is named after them.  The island is very unusual.  It is connected to the central coast of Cuba by an artificial bulk road.  Here, mainly located holiday destinations for those who want to stay alone for a while with pristine nature.  But you can always change your mind and return to your previous life, full of the noise of cars and the buzz of big cities.  Some islands of Cuba are interconnected.  So, with Cayo Coco on an artificial dam it is easy to get to Cayo Guillermo.  Only 20 kilometers - and before the eyes of vacationers a small piece of land appears, 80 percent covered with green palm groves.  A lot of rare birds and animals live here, and from the water travelers flock joyfully greeted by dolphins.  This place is more like a paradise on earth than a regular resort.

Cuba is now a country with a developed economy.  The main source of state revenue, the product that made it famous throughout the world, is tobacco.  <span>Cuban cigars</span> are very popular among wealthy smokers in many countries.  This pleasure is not cheap, but the quality of the product is fully consistent with its price.  The small town of Pinar del Rio can rightfully be considered the capital of tobacco in the country.  Most of its inhabitants are engaged in work on plantations.  This work requires skill, diligence and great patience.  The prepared raw materials are sent to factories, where, through the efforts of specialists, they turn into aromatic thick cigars.  In the Republic of Cuba, the ban on smoking is not at all relevant.  For smokers, there are even special hotels where experienced "snuffers" are able to pick up goods for every taste.

"Caribbean Pearl" attracts with its beauty and versatility.  The most famous resort is Varadero.  This place is famous for its gorgeous beaches.  It offers tourists not only clear sea and white sand.  A lot of fashionable hotels and tourist complexes have been built on the territory of the city.  Rest continues 24 hours a day.  Cafes, bars, restaurants, entertainment centers - all for the long-awaited vacationers.  Indeed, tourism revenues are the main component of the state‚Äôs profit.  If you want a holiday and noisy fun, it is better to go south to the beautiful Santiago de Cuba.  On the way from the airport through the whole country you can enjoy the endless reed fields and the unique beauty of tropical nature.  The town is relatively small, but everyone is welcome here.  Any tourist will be deliciously fed and treated to the famous <span>Cuban rum.</span>  History buffs should definitely visit the famous Trinidad.  This ancient settlement of the Indians several centuries ago turned into a beautiful legendary city.  Even its air is saturated with antiquity.  Here, unlike Varadero, there are no luxury hotels.  But staying in Cuba will be incomplete if you do not visit the town, which is recognized as a world heritage.  Beautiful Cuba always welcomes guests with open arms.  She is ready to give everyone her love and leave a lasting impression in her soul.
