At least once a year, you need to change the situation, forget about problems and life troubles, turn off your mobile phone and enjoy the silence, calm and measured.  Such a vacation can only give the sea.  The sea calms, gives a sense of harmony, becomes a source of energy and vitality.  All roads are open for a modern tourist: he can fly to Asia, enjoy the exotic and color of Asian resorts, be imbued with local philosophy and culture, he can give preference to Europe with stunning beaches, luxurious resorts and lots of attractions, and he can relax quite well without leaving the country. </p><p>  Crimea is what we want to offer you.  It is famous for its unique nature, majestic mountains, cozy bays, immersed in the green of unspoiled nature and wide beaches with clear sea water.  Of course, some time ago, to visit the Crimea, it was necessary to draw up a passport and cross the border, but now that it has become a Russian republic, the situation has changed radically.  Moreover, tourism in Crimea is on the rise: new hotels are being rebuilt, and the infrastructure of resorts is developing.  Of course, in many respects the quality of rest depends on how carefully and responsibly the potential tourist approaches the choice of hotel or hotel.  Even if you plan only to spend the night in the room, the cleanliness in it, the order and availability of the necessary equipment, a separate bathroom with hot water are the minimum that every tourist counts on.  How do you like the villa?  We offer a detailed and objective review of a rather popular option - Villa "Magic" (Crimea).  What living conditions can she offer to modern tourists?  What can they count on? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  So, Villa "Magic" is a 3 * hotel (Crimea, Saki), located in the small Crimean village of Novofedorovka.  The villa is located on the second coastline, that is, it is only 300 meters from the coast.  For Crimea, this is rare, so be sure to pay attention to proximity to the sea.  The village itself is located in the western region of Crimea, which largely determines the specifics of rest in it.  The hot steppes in combination with the sea breeze create excellent conditions for an unforgettable beach holiday. </p>

    <p>  In fact, the location is hardly a strong point of the hotel.  Tourists complain that all the attractions are far enough away.  The only way to get to them is by public transport.  Of course, you can use the hotel shuttle, but in this case, each trip will be quite expensive for you.  That is why more and more tourists come here with personal cars. </p><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  The territory of the villa, although small, but quite beautiful, well-groomed, literally immersed in greenery.  Many gazebos for vacationers, there is a platform for cooking barbecue.  The garden staff take care of the garden every day, put it in order, fight weeds, plant new plants. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

Tourists are offered a choice of rooms of various categories: </p><ul><li>  standard single rooms; </li><li>  comfortable double rooms with a large double bed and a soft sofa (30 sq. m); </li><li>  two-room suites for 4 people - occupy an area of ‚Äã‚Äã40 square meters.  m, represented by a bedroom and living room, some rooms are equipped with a small kitchen. </li></ul><p>  All rooms are comfortable, as described.  Of course, after a long and tiring journey, all hotel guests expect a quick check-in.  But if you get acquainted with the reviews of real tourists, they do not always settle in the rooms promptly - you have to sit on your suitcases and wait.  Moreover, vacationers can be given a room that, in principle, does not correspond to the description and the category for which they contributed money.  In this case, do not agree - stand your ground.  The administration is simply obliged to provide you with a room with the level of comfort that you expected, otherwise it should recalculate. </p>
