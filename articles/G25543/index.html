They increasingly want exclusivity and uniqueness to create their own unique indoor design.  And therefore, original needlework for the home is increasingly being used, the variety of ideas now simply rolls over. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Designers today propose to personally make a bas-relief of gypsum on the walls of their homes, limiting themselves to the usual whitewashing. </p><ol><li>  Having chosen a drawing (plot) of a bas-relief, the master can fashion it from plasticine on a flat horizontal surface.  It can be flying pigeons, swimming swans, flowers.  You can use a particularly liked figurine.  In the latter case, the thing must be "drowned" in clay or clay so that the outside was exactly that part of the little thing that would subsequently be a protruding part of the bas-relief. </li><li>  The template, and this is exactly what it is called, with which the master will make an impression, is lubricated with vegetable oil or glycerin and coated with silicone sealant. </li><li>  After drying, the mold is removed from the template. </li><li>  Diluted gypsum or alabaster is poured into the mold and left until hardened. </li><li>  The finished detail of the bas-relief is glued to the wall.  If the part is voluminous and heavy, it is appropriate to screw it in some places for insurance. </li></ol><h2>  Knitted <span>warmers for teapot</span> and cups </h2><p>  It is very important that needlework for the home is of practical use.  With your own hands, for example, you can tie amazing warmers for brewing tea, both on teapots and on glasses or cups.  You can even make a knitted cup holder if you wish.  These things are extremely useful in everyday life, as they allow you to turn the tea drinking procedure into a kind of ritual that will allow you to get maximum pleasure.  To make such products is easy for those who love needlework. </p><p>  For a home, you can tie a heating pad in the form of a smiling little face of an animal, for example, a cat or a teddy bear, or even the animal itself, for example a funny little calf or a funny cock. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Master class for making a lamp from the ‚Äúears‚Äù of cans with drinks </h2><p>  It is very important to do creative work with your soul, such as do-it-yourself needlework for the home.  Master classes in the manufacture of crafts will help to achieve the highest result. </p><ol><li>  First of all, you need to carefully separate the ‚Äúear‚Äù from the can. </li><li>  The part is bent so that the outside is a larger round hole "ear". </li><li>  Then, successively bent ‚Äúears‚Äù are hung on the prepared wire circle of the lamp shade of the lamp - this forms the first row of the metal openwork lampshade. </li><li>  For the second and subsequent rows, parts cut from the inside are used.  Having slightly spread them in the place of the cut, two adjacent ‚Äúears‚Äù are captured by the holes.  The second row is fixing, so you should grab the details of the first row immediately through both holes. </li><li>  The third and subsequent rows are attached only to the outer hole. </li><li>  Weaving is repeated until the size of the ‚Äúchain mail‚Äù of the lampshade reaches the desired size. </li></ol><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself needlework for home master classes" class="if" height="411" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2638/574247.jpg" width="530"></div></h2><h2>  Lamps from disposable spoons </h2><p>  To make such an original lighting device, the master will need an empty five-liter plastic container, a base for a table lamp with a stand, and a bunch of disposable spoons.  The bottom is cut off at the tank or a round hole is cut out in it.  It should be fixed on the basis of the lamp with the upper part - the neck.  Spoons with cut off handles with a convex part upwards in a checkerboard pattern are glued onto the surface of the ‚Äúeggplant". </p><p>  You can leave the spoons white, or you can paint them in yellow and fix green ‚Äúleaves‚Äù of plastic on top of the neck of the plastic can.

    <h2>  Luxury designer lights </h2><p>  The fantasy of the master and creator constantly throws up a wide variety of ideas for home, decor and needlework.  With their own hands, a craftsman can even create a creative table lamp from an ordinary snag and an old hat.  You can also create a glamorous luxurious product, using a <span>porcelain vase</span> and an old lampshade for these purposes, you can make the top of the lamp yourself from a wire frame and fabric, or you can carve <span>a wooden figure</span> for the base or sculpt it from clay or cast from plaster. </p><p>  It should only be taken into account that inside the base (driftwood, vases or figures) there should be a hole in which the electric wire will be.  A cartridge is attached to its upper part, where a light bulb is subsequently screwed.  The holder of the lampshade frame is also fixed here. </p><h2>  Workshop on manufacturing clothesline clothes </h2><p>  Even the simple rope that housewives use to dry clothes, can be used in such an activity as do-it-yourself needlework for the home.  Master classes will help you learn how to create boxes, baskets, jars, planters by laying and fastening the tourniquet. </p>

    <ol><li>  For work, you will need a rope (harness, soft insulation wire, packing string), scissors, a needle and strong threads. </li><li>  Becheva curls up in a shell and fastens with a thread using a needle.  The contrasting color of the rope-fastening thread makes the product brighter.  Using for fastening rows of threads of different colors will make the thing more elegant. </li><li>  When the bottom of the product is ready, you should start making walls.  Now the rows will need to be laid not with a shell, but around the circumference of the extreme row of the bottom one on top of the other so that the product begins to ‚Äúgrow‚Äù vertically. </li><li>  When the item reaches the required size, the rope or harness is cut off.  The end should be carefully tucked into the product and hidden between the lower rows, firmly securing the last upper row with threads.  Artificial flowers sewn or glued to the side look very nice on such things, compositions from acorns.  You can decorate the little thing with satin ribbons and bows. </li></ol>
