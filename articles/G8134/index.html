At least, this can be argued taking into account how popular her models have become.  In particular, we are talking about Huawei Honor 7. </p><p>  The review, which will be presented in today's article, is entirely devoted to this device.  In it we will present the main technical characteristics of the device, do some analysis of its advantages and disadvantages, and also try to form some own conclusions about the phone, taking into account also the reviews that are presented about it on the Web. </p><h2>  Smartphone Positioning </h2><p>  To begin with, it should be noted that the model is relatively new - it was presented only at the beginning of this year.  Therefore, the requirements for its performance, functionality and capabilities will be an order of magnitude higher than for models manufactured in 2014 and earlier. </p>

    <p>  The developer presents the phone under the Honor brand from a somewhat more distant side, while we generally assume that this is Huawei.  Apparently, for the future, the Chinese want to introduce in parallel the development of this product regardless of the ‚Äúparent‚Äù company. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In terms of segmentation and the price of a smartphone, it is worth noting that you can purchase a device for 23 thousand rubles.  This can be said to be the ‚Äúmiddle‚Äù class.  Does the gadget's specifications match it?  Let's find out. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  We begin the <span>review</span> devoted to <span>Honor 7</span> by examining the appearance of the device and describing its design.  And there is something to talk about here - the phone (as it became customary with Huawei) is made of metal, plastic and glass - the most familiar materials at all times.  Its body has all the same rectangular lines that we can so often see on devices of this brand. </p><p>  The front of the smartphone does not contain anything superfluous: there are no inscriptions, any logos or other signs.  There is only a camera window, flash, as well as a large screen. </p><p>  The back side, on the contrary, has the inscription Honor, made on a metal texture.  Also present here: main camera and flash.  A little lower placed a fingerprint scanner. </p><p>  The texture that the Honor 7 smartphone has, as the reviews indicate, is very pleasant to the touch.  At least the device does not slip out of hands, has a rough surface.  According to the manufacturer, the back cover of the device has a ceramic coating, which is designed to make handling it even more practical from the point of view of wear. </p>

    <p>  Navigation elements here are familiar - buttons are on the side faces.  The front side of the device does not contain any mechanical keys - there are only system buttons on the screen to exit ‚ÄúHome‚Äù, return to the previous menu and <span>call up the</span> options <span>panel</span> . </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If we summarize the data on the appearance of the device, we can note a rather high quality of its assembly.  In this regard, the device looks really attractive, therefore, obviously, the developers have achieved what they wanted. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The diagonal size of the display, frankly, is not quite standard - on Huawei Honor 7 16Gb it is 5.2 inches.  The frames around the glass (on the sides) are very thin, and the bottom and top are somewhat thickened.  Resolution is 1920 x 1080 pixels.  The density of their placement is very high - about 420 dpi. </p><p>  For protection, the display was coated with a special, damage-resistant <span>Gorilla Glass</span> 3. In addition, an effective anti-reflective coating was applied on top, allowing you to work with the device in more comfortable conditions in sunlight. </p>

    <p>  As tests have shown, the viewing angles of the display are very wide - the picture is not ‚Äúlost‚Äù even after the smartphone is tilted to the maximum; the brightness disappears only slightly. </p><p>  We can also note the operation of the screen on the positive side, praising the developer. </p><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  The basis for the functioning of the smartphone is a HiSilicon Kirin 935 chip individually designed for Huawei devices (total - 8 cores, 4 of which have a clock frequency of 2.2 GHz, and another 4 - 1.5 GHz).  When the experts did a review dedicated to the Honor 7 phone, they were convinced that the hardware was working smoothly and without any delays, it launched any game presented on Google Play (including the one with maximum performance).  Regarding heating, in the technical information presented on the official website, it was argued that this problem does not arise due to the aluminum back cover of the device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In practice, working with the model, you can verify the opposite.  Heating really happens in the process of launching another ‚Äúheavy‚Äù game schedule.  Feeling the point at which this happens is also easy.  However, this does not cause much discomfort. </p>

    <h2>  operating system </h2><p>  The 5th generation Android OS is installed on the Honor 7 as the basis of the software platform.  It is possible that if you start the device now, it will automatically upgrade to version 6.  This depends primarily on the developer and on whether the device supports the ability to switch to the next version of the OS. </p><p>  In addition, Huawei uses its own ‚Äúshell‚Äù on its device - <span>the</span> EMUI 3.1 <span>graphical interface</span> .  Visually, it has some differences from ‚Äúpure‚Äù Android, but there is nothing fundamentally different here - the whole architecture has been preserved in the same form that users are used to. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The smartphone manufacturer has taken care to equip the model with a capacious enough battery for long-term functioning.  And we see this from the technical description of the model: its battery has a capacity of 3100 mAh.  With the right approach to optimizing battery consumption, we can see a slightly longer smartphone activity cycle, expressed in the ability to work up to 30 hours in continuous use and up to about 60 hours at rest. </p>

    <p>  As the review describing Honor 7 shows, the smartphone can ‚Äúhold‚Äù for 2 days in the usual mode for most users.  However, you should not have hopes that a gadget with such functionality can work on a single charge for a week.  In the end, it's Android. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  In the process of working with the phone, you can make sure that the camera function installed on the Honor 7 is very well implemented. The characteristics show that there are two cameras here - with a resolution of 20 and 8 megapixels (primary and secondary), respectively.  In addition, there are various software options that allow you to "save" image quality.  Thanks to them, the pictures taken by the phone are accurate, rich and bright.  At the same time, the device maintains a <span>white balance,</span> even if shooting is done under adverse conditions (with a low degree of illumination, for example, at night). </p><p>  In order to make the photo more suitable in a particular situation, the user is given the opportunity to apply special filters.  They are a set of special parameters, working with which, you can achieve even higher quality photos. </p>

    <h2>  Communication </h2><p>  In the matter of communication, the device can really be called universal: the phone supports 2G / 3G / 4G networks, as well as working with Bluetooth / Wi-Fi.  Unfortunately, there is no contactless chip for <span>wireless charging</span> or calculations, but there is an infrared sensor with which you can control the TV, for example. </p><p>  Also, the smartphone has a navigation function using GPS, A-GPS and GLONASS technologies. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Most of the recommendations left about Honor 7 in Russia (more precisely, on domestic sites and catalogs) indicate a positive attitude of buyers to their smartphone.  People praise the phone, note the high build quality of the case, stable operation, wide functionality. </p><p>  Among the complaints there are some, for example, regarding the operation of the sensor for reading fingerprints.  Users claim that in some cases it works too slowly, or even with delays.  The second point is the problem with push notifications.  A considerable number of buyers complain that sometimes (for some unknown reason) they miss incoming messages.  Of course, the whole thing is in the software shell, but the developer has not yet fixed anything. </p><p>  In addition, there are some problems with the branded smartphone case.  Some argue that it is problematic to control the phone through it (the sensor does not ‚Äúsee‚Äù the touch);  others - that it scratches the screen and the case.  Therefore, it is better to take care of finding another accessory. </p>

    <p>  Actually, these are all ‚Äúserious‚Äù problems.  There are also a lot of those that are caused by some of their ideas of customers about the perfect phone, but we will not give them in this article. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  As the review dedicated to Honor 7 showed, this smartphone is really worthwhile and interesting in any respect.  It is new, relatively inexpensive, but has all the makings in order to be called a ‚Äúflagship‚Äù.  Based on the information described here, we can confidently recommend this device to those who are just looking at it. </p>
