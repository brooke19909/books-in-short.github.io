Also, all operations leading to changes in assets and liabilities of municipalities fall under the definition of budget accounting.  The chart of accounts of budgetary entities is a list of them; budgetary institutions perform operations on them.  It is approved by the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation in part of the Instruction for budget accounting (dated 10.02.2006 No. 25n). </p><h2>  Accounting in budget-funded institutions </h2><p>  The organization of accounting in institutions whose activities are financed from the budget has a number of features.  The chart of accounts of budgetary organizations is the main working tool that allows accountants to keep track of liabilities, financial and non-financial assets, etc. The activities of accountants in this area are controlled by several basic documents.  It: </p><ul><li>  instructions to the chart of accounts of budgetary organizations; </li><li>  articles of legislation on budgetary arrangements; </li><li>  regulatory documents on reporting in budgetary institutions; </li><li>  documents revealing the essence of industry specifics. </li></ul><p>  Features of accounting in institutions that are financed from the budget: </p><ul><li>  control over the implementation of the estimates of items of income and expenses; </li><li>  treasury system of budget implementation; </li><li>  there are both cash and actual expenses in the account; </li><li>  in each industry there are also additional nuances of accounting (educational institutions, healthcare, science and others). </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.accountsandlegal.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="budget accounting" class="if uuid-3116218" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/84159/3116218.jpg"></div><h2>  Tasks of budget accounting </h2><p>  These include the following activities: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  formation of reliable information on the financial results of the institution, on the current state of assets; </li><li>  providing relevant data on the sale of funds that were issued by the budget system of the Russian Federation; </li><li>  ensuring proper control over the execution of operations that are carried out during the implementation of plans of the budget system of the Russian Federation; </li><li>  control and timely accounting of the state of assets, as well as the fulfillment of financial obligations of the institution; </li><li>  regular preparation and provision of reliable reporting on the state of the institution‚Äôs assets. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.missionbox.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="chart of accounts of budgetary organizations" class="if uuid-3116216" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/84159/3116216.jpg"></div><h2>  Normative documents and Instruction on budget accounting </h2><p>  Reflection of income and expenses on funds received from the budget is subject to mandatory accounting.  It is also subject to the execution of estimates on funds from extrabudgetary sources.  All operations must be executed according to the samples of regulatory documents.  Forms and postings are required to comply with the Budget Accounting Instructions and the Federal Law on Accounting. </p><p>  Regulatory documents require the provision of information on the following: </p><ul><li>  the method of applying the chart of accounts for budgetary organizations in order to reflect operations on the use of funds received from both budgetary and extrabudgetary sources; </li><li>  accounting forms; </li><li>  methods for assessing liabilities; </li><li>  methods for evaluating financial assets; </li><li>  correspondence of accounts for the most common transactions. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="accounts in the accounting of a budget organization" class="if uuid-3116229" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/84159/3116229.jpg"></div><h2>  Accountancy Responsibilities in a Budget Organization </h2><p>  As a rule, in any large budgetary institution, accounting consists of several departments.  Usually there are at least three of them - financial, settlement, material.  In the departments, in turn, groups can be allocated whose employees are engaged in the implementation of narrowly focused activities.  For example, an operational and financial group for the implementation of settlement transactions, for accounting for fixed assets and others. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You can highlight the main responsibilities of accounting in an organization whose activities are financed from the budget: </p><ul><li>  control over the correct execution of accounting documents, the legality and necessity of carrying out certain operations; </li><li>  execution of accounting in accordance with the Instruction on budget accounting; </li><li>  control over the safety of tangible assets; </li><li>  accrual and timely payment of salaries, bonuses, allowances, cash allowances to employees; </li><li>  conducting, if necessary, an inventory of financial assets, followed by true display and provision of information at the right time; </li><li>  compilation of reliable reports in the prescribed time and in the prescribed manner on the basis of the Instruction on budget accounting; </li><li>  drawing up estimates of income and expenses on the basis of calculations, providing estimates for approval by the head; </li><li>  storage of documentation that meets modern standards. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.moneydonut.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="accounting structure in a budget organization" class="if uuid-3116221" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/84159/3116221.jpg"></div><h2>  Budget Accounting and Reporting </h2><p>  In institutions whose activities are financed from the budget, there are several types of reports.  They must be compiled in a timely manner and must be submitted to higher authorities. </p><p>  Each of the reports should be prepared taking into account the features of the chart of accounts of accounting in budgetary organizations.  The regulatory authorities, in turn, have the right to conduct a detailed analysis of how reliably the information was displayed and from the reports to draw conclusions about the current problems of the institution, build strategies for the development direction, etc. As a rule, an explanatory note is attached to the reports, which can state certain facts about problems with financing or explain some unclear points on accounting. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Also, accounting should provide timely balance sheets and other documents that may be required by higher authorities.  Often there is a need to clarify some figures, features of activity, etc. </p><h2>  Plan of accounts of budgetary organizations </h2><p>  It consists of five sections.  It is a list of accounts, off-balance sheet accounting and their correspondence: </p><ol><li>  Non-financial assets - accounts for fixed assets, inventories, etc. </li><li>  The second section consists of a list of accounts for accounting for cash resources and documents.  Also, this account involves the accounting of receivables. </li><li>  Liabilities.  This section is presented by accounts for accounting of accounts payable of the organization. </li><li>  The financial result - accounts to reflect real indicators of the current and past periods. </li><li>  Validation of budget expenditures.  This section focuses accounts and features associated with their use, which serve to reflect reliable information about the limits of budget funds transferred to the organization. </li></ol><p>  Each of the sections of the chart of accounts of a budget organization unites a group of homogeneous accounts.  They, in turn, are divided into analytical and synthetic.  Thus, the possibility of maximum detailing of accounting objects in a budget institution is achieved. </p><h2>  Classification of accounts in budget accounting </h2><p>  The chart of accounts of a budget organization is established by the Instruction on budget accounting (dated 10.02.2006 No. 25n).  Accountants who work in this area know this information almost by heart, regularly monitoring new editions and changes in the relevant articles of the law.  A feature of the chart of accounts of budgetary organizations is that the latter can only be active or only passive: </p><ol><li>  Active accounts are those on which the funds of the institution, their tangible and intangible assets are kept. </li><li>  Passive accounts are those accounts that reflect the sources of funds. </li></ol><p>  Synthetic accounting data allows you to evaluate and analyze the current state of the institution today.  Analytical accounting is information about the balances and turnover on these synthetic accounting accounts.  The structure of the account number in the Chart of Accounts of budgetary organizations is built on the principle of nested modules (the so-called catalog accounting), consists of 26 categories. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rocketlawyer.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="government chart of accounts" class="if uuid-3116222" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/84159/3116222.jpg"></div><h2>  Accounting for non-financial assets </h2><p>  Accounts are KBK (20 characters) and account codes (6 characters).  The account number in the chart of accounts of budgetary organizations consists of 26 characters. </p><p>  The first section of the Plan focuses on non-financial assets.  These include: </p><ul><li>  fixed assets; </li><li>  materials and finished products; </li><li>  investments in non-financial assets; </li><li>  intangible assets; </li><li>  depreciation; </li><li>  extra charge; </li><li>  non-financial assets in transit; </li><li>  non-produced assets; </li><li>  costs. </li></ul><p>  Separately, it is worth noting such <span>non-produced assets</span> as land and subsoil resources.  They should be taken into account at the initial price from the date of their participation in the economic turnover. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mcdowellaccountants.ie" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="budget payables" class="if uuid-3116226" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/84159/3116226.jpg"></div><h2>  Accounting for financial assets </h2><p>  Institutional financial assets: </p><ul><li>  cash in various storage locations; </li><li>  securities or another method of participation of the institution in the activities of other organizations; </li><li>  accounts receivable of employees, tax authorities. </li></ul><p>  The second section of the working chart of accounts of the budget organization is devoted to the reflection of financial assets in the accounts: </p><ul><li>  "Institutional cash." </li><li>  "Settlements on advances paid." </li><li>  "Settlements with debtors on income." </li><li>  "Calculations for shortages." </li><li>  "Settlements with other debtors." </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.careerbuilder.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="financial assets of a budget organization" class="if uuid-3116223" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/84159/3116223.jpg"></div><h2>  Section Three of the Plan: Organizational Obligations </h2><p>  It contains the usual types of accounts payable familiar to an experienced accountant.  In simple terms, these are the debts that the institution must pay.  Accounts payable may also arise if an advance payment has been received from the buyer and services have not yet been provided, or if goods have been received from the supplier and the payment for them has not yet been transferred.  There are pluses to accounts payable, because these are a kind of funds raised for the benefit of the institution, without paying interest or penalties. </p><p>  The third section of the Plan also includes tax payments and settlements with other organizations whose activities are financed from the budget. </p><h2>  Accounting for financial results in a budget organization </h2><p>  The fourth section of the Plan lists the accounts for recording the financial results, income and expenses of the institution. </p><p>  This section on the principles of accounting is almost no different from that in commercial organizations.  The composition of assets and liabilities almost completely duplicates similar items in commerce.  There are slight differences in the composition of the accounts. </p><h2>  Validation of budget expenditures </h2><p>  The fifth section of the Plan is a set of accounts to reflect the movement: </p><ul><li>  budgetary allocations; </li><li>  limits of obligations provided by budget managers; </li><li>  planned revenues and expenses of the institution. </li></ul><p>  For example, upon receipt of a notice from higher authorities about limits on the purchase of materials, accounting should reflect the size of these limits on the accounts.  Of course, the subsequent development of these limits should also be displayed in the same section. </p>
