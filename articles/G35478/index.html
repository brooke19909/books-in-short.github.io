The most ardent fans learn knitting and are engaged in the manufacture of <span>clothing, home</span> decoration and decor on their own.  However, after a storm of excitement from the first sweaters, dresses, blouses and hats, disappointment and even boredom often come. </p><p>  Favorite patterns are not encouraging, and all models seem ordinary and unoriginal.  It‚Äôs so good that for masters who own a crochet and knitting needles, there are practically no restrictions on creativity! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="unusual knitting" class="if" height="433" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1785325.jpg" width="496"></div>

    <p>  There are several ways to show your personal vision: </p><ul><li>  Apply familiar patterns in a completely different aspect. </li><li>  Combine different types of materials and yarn. </li><li>  Find or come up with unusual knitting techniques. </li><li>  Apply tools or objects that have never been used before to work. </li></ul><h2>  What is creativity, and with what sauce is it served </h2><p>  The word "creative" is translated from English as "creativity".  That is, something created (created) by man should be called that.  By and large, both completely new ideas and a fresh combination of familiar elements are creative. </p><p>  When it comes to knitting, it‚Äôs hard to find anything completely new, because the basic elements remain the same: front and back loops, double crochet and without crochet.  But the original cut of clothes, the use of interesting materials and the game with the scale of canvases are all modern knitting. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Unusual ideas are sometimes so amazing that it becomes interesting how the designer came to his discovery.  For example, who first thought of tying a tree?  And why?  Probably out of love for the beautiful. </p>

    <p>  Beautiful knitwear that completely duplicates other patterns is not creative.  But changing the cut, applying other schemes and adding your own flavor makes the copying process a creative creation. </p><h2>  Minimum scale: knitted toys </h2><p>  Huge little soft toys made by crochet or knitting have gained immense popularity.  Such knitting, unusual and very funny, takes a little time and does not require large stocks of yarn.  The main thing here is the accurate execution of all elements (loops and posts), as well as compliance with geometric accuracy. </p>

    <p>  Such an unusual, <span>creative</span> crochet and knitting was called ‚Äúamigurumi‚Äù.  However, more and more often this term refers only to toys created with a hook. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A distinctive feature of the amigurumi technique was the touching expression on the faces and faces of the finished toys.  They cheer up a lot, so they are often used as gifts. </p><h2>  XXL hinges </h2><p>  In recent years, a rather specific type of knitting has gained popularity - work with very thick, even, twisted yarns.  Initially, <span>merino wool</span> was used <span>,</span> but such a thread is very expensive.  Now many manufacturers of materials for needlework offer a wide range of different yarns.  For example, sheep‚Äôs wool with cotton or acrylic, as well as merino wool with impurities to reduce the cost. </p><p>  Such knitting is unusual, quite fast and extremely motivating for further work. </p><p>  More often than not, thick <span>hats,</span> scarfs, and snoods are knitted from such thick threads.  Craftswomen choose products with a simple cut (usually rectangular), because the reduction of loops of this scale looks messy. </p><p>  Such unusual knitting does not require any complex patterns, it is enough to knit. </p><h2>  Interesting Jacquards </h2><p>  Who would have thought how varied and original <span>jacquard patterns</span> can be <span>!</span>  The history of this technique has several hundred years, but new approaches to its implementation are constantly appearing. </p><p>  Jacquards knitted with melange yarn look extremely interesting.  Even though the ornaments look the most traditional way, this knitting is unusual and original due to the color scheme.  To form a pattern, the craftswomen choose material for section dyeing with very long areas of color transition.  For example, there is such a yarn where the areas dyed with a certain color are several tens of meters.  As a result, the finished product has a very smooth and beautiful transition from one color to another. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  As a background, monophonic yarn of a suitable color or another melange yarn can be used.  Traditionally, the background is knitted with a darker color, and the ornaments are made lighter. </p><h2>  <span>Hats, caps</span> and hats </h2><p>  Wishing to entertain themselves and their loved ones, craftsmen with crochet and knitting needles create creative and unimaginable hats.  A variety of funny hats amazes the most daring imagination: </p><ul><li>  Different types of helmets. </li><li>  Hats with beards. </li><li>  Gas masks. </li><li>  Wigs made of yarn. </li><li>  Caps stylized as food (muffins, hamburger, chicken leg). </li></ul><p>  Such knitting is unusual from the point of view of people who have a traditional and conservative view of knitting skills.  Of course, these hats are not worn for going to work, they are used for photo shoots or as original gifts. </p>

    <p>  Schemes are developed not only by bored masters, but also by designers who want to get fame on social networks.  First of all, they rely on the creativity and unusualness of their models. </p><h2>  Freeform - the ‚Äúmagic‚Äù crochet technique </h2><p>  In search of inspiration and new ideas, masters often invent completely new approaches and techniques.  The top of knitting art can be called a technique such as freeform. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="unusual knitting techniques" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1785319.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  Its peculiarity is that the canvas is composed of individual motifs.  Unlike Irish lace or just a typesetting pattern, freeform motifs have the following features: </p><ul><li>  High density.  Often the canvas is so continuous that it is suitable for making a coat. </li><li>  Custom shape.  There are no rectangular, triangular or hexagonal fragments.  Typically, motifs with round outlines, curls and asymmetrical protrusions are knitted for the freeform. </li><li>  The presence of volumetric elements.  Almost always, lush, postal and twisted columns are used, as well as voluminous scars and stitches laid over the finished canvas. </li></ul><p>  Freeform is suitable for the manufacture of clothing, accessories and interior items. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="unusual creative crochet" class="if" height="484" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1785320.jpg" width="570"></div>

    <p>  Among the craftswomen, models of cardigans and coats made up of color motifs in such a way as to obtain a gradient transition were popular.  Usually darker fragments are placed below, and lighter motifs are placed higher.  In the most contrasting models, one can observe a transition from a rather dark color (lower edge of the back and shelves) to very light (shoulder line, collar). </p><h2>  Variety of materials </h2><p>  Creative masters often combines unusual crochet with knitwear.  Also quite often they are combined with fragments of tissue and skin. </p><p>  As accessories, metal, wooden and plastic buckles, rings, clips, chains, buttons, buttons and other items are used. </p><p>  Many designers combine their passion for knitting with a love of creating jewelry.  This is how knitted beads, necklaces, brooches, hairpins and other jewelry are born. </p><p>  Knitted jewelry can be large and created in the style of "folk" or can be quite elegant accessories that are quite capable of decorating an evening outfit. </p><p>  Knitted elements combine with beads made of wood, plastic, metal, glass, with precious stones and Austrian crystals. </p><h2>  Freedom of thought is the main quality of a creative designer </h2><p>  Many knitters, looking at photos of original items created with a hook or knitting needles, sigh heavily and think that they will not be able to do anything like this.  However, such work does not require compliance with any rules and cannot be subject to stringent requirements. </p><p>  The beauty of creativity lies in creating something that did not exist before.  Therefore, do not be upset because of the inability to knit hats.  Today, individuality is in price, so maybe you need to think about your own unusual bags, mittens or slippers that no one has ever seen before. </p>
