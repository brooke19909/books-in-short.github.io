This model was announced more than a year ago and during this time managed to recruit a fairly large number of fans in its army.  This model was not the flagship at the time of its announcement, but nevertheless it is also difficult to rank it as awkward cheapness.  HTC Desire 500 is a cross between a clear budget model of a touchscreen smartphone and an expensive flagship. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc desire 500 review" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/512254.jpg" width="518"></div>

    <h2>  HTC Desire 500: review </h2><p>  The review must begin with the appearance of the smartphone and its ergonomics.  Taking this device in hand, we can say with confidence that it costs the money that was paid for it.  Weight of 123 grams and small dimensions make it very convenient to use.  By and large, it is phones in 4.3 inches or - in extreme cases - 4.7 inches are the best option for use, and not all of these giants, whose diagonal exceeds 5 inches.  So, in our case, the HTC Desire 500 smartphone has a diagonal of 4.3 inches, which immediately earns a plus in its piggy bank.  What can be said about the appearance of the device?  The entire assembly is made very high quality.  Due to the fact that the smartphone is equipped with an almost monolithic case (with the exception of the removable socket on the back), the user will not hear any creaks and crunches.  However, this same rear panel is quite a brand, which can lead to endless wiping of the phone with a special cloth. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc desire 500 dual" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/512258.jpg" width="540"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Internal components of the phone </h2><p>  With external characteristics, everything seems to be clear, but what does the HTC Desire 500 filling consist of?  An overview of this section will briefly describe this.  HTC Desire 500 has a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 200 processor, whose <span>clock frequency</span> is 1.2 GHz.  The RAM in the phone is 1 GB, which is good news.  The internal memory of the phone is only 4 GB, but HTC Desire 500 has a special slot for a micro SD card, which can reach 64 GB.  <span>The lithium battery</span> has a capacity of 1800 mAh.  The phone is equipped with two cameras: rear and front.  The rear boasts 8 megapixels, a flash and autofocus.  In addition, the phone has software from the Android 4.2 Jelly Bean operating system and a fifth sensor, which will allow elements of your gadget to easily respond to every touch.  The screen resolution, which is only 480x800, may cause some disappointment.  With a fairly large diagonal of 4.3 inches, pixels can be seen, but for this you need, of course, to try hard.  If the company from Taiwan made a higher resolution, then the desire to look at the pixels on the phone would not even arise. </p><h2>  Varieties by color </h2><p>  As a rule, HTC does not try to introduce a large number of different colors into its models, but is limited to only two options.  Most often these are white and black colored phones.  In the case of the HTC Desire 500 smartphone, Taiwanese designers decided to slightly change their views and released three options.  The first is completely black and is called HTC Desire 500 black.  The other two are silver, but with slight differences from each other.  If the panel around the camera, as well as all the inscriptions on the back of one phone, are red, then the other model is turquoise.  Thus, a person can choose for himself the phone whose color impresses him the most. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone htc desire 500" class="if" height="341" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/512264.jpg" width="600"></div>

That is, here, too, a company from Taiwan surprised us.  You can buy a phone that uses only one SIM card, but you have another option - buying a phone using two SIM cards.  True, the latter option will be slightly more expensive than the regular version of the smartphone.  In its filling and functionality, <span>HTC Desire 500 dual Sim is</span> practically no different from its brother.  The use of two SIM cards follows the same principle as on all dual-SIM cards that were released in previous years.  As a rule, only one SIM card can use the Internet and telephone at the same time, while the second can only be used for calls.  Therefore, you can tell the following option: use one SIM card as a connection over the Internet, and the second for calls. </p><h2>  What applications can be installed on the phone </h2><p>  This smartphone has quite strong characteristics, so a similar question may disappear with itself.  By purchasing such a phone, you can install any application and play any games that you can only download on the Play Market portal.  Just remember: the better the game‚Äôs graphics, the more it requires from the phone, the more battery power is consumed.  Therefore, do not install too large applications on your phone.  Or at least use them in a place where there is no way to charge the device.  Otherwise, the risk of quickly discharging the phone is high. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc desire 500 price" class="if" height="279" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/512269.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Opportunities </h2><p>  By turning on the phone, you can immediately be in the know about all the events that happen to your friends.  This became possible after HTC developed the HTC BlinkFeed function, which notifies your friends what your friends are doing, what photos are uploaded to social networks and where they are located on the smartphone‚Äôs main screen.  In addition, you have the opportunity to change the application grid in the main menu of the phone.  If earlier it was always 3x4 by default, then on this model it is possible to make a 4x4 grid, which will increase the number of viewed applications by 8. As for the other functions of the phone, in many ways they are similar to other HTC models. </p><h2>  HTC Desire 500. Reviews </h2><p>  At the moment, there are a fairly large number of people in the post-Soviet space who decided to acquire this model of cell phone.  Many users are very happy about such a purchase and confidently advise the phone to everyone who wants to buy an inexpensive phone of excellent quality.  Among the obvious advantages, many people highlight the build quality and ergonomics, claiming that the device fits perfectly in your hand, and also fits perfectly in the pocket of trousers or jeans.  Also among the advantages of the smartphone stand out the opportunities that it possesses thanks to the company-creator.  Other pluses of the phone are called an excellent camera that shoots in any conditions, loud speakers, as well as the ability to use two SIM cards if you purchased HTC Desire 500 Dual Sim.  Among the minuses, some phone buyers highlight the insufficient battery capacity, which is not enough for a full day with sufficiently busy use.  But this minus is difficult to attribute only to the HTC Desire 500, since it is characteristic of almost all phones that have the Android operating system. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc desire 500 phone" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/512284.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Expert opinion </h2><p>  Regular users praised the HTC Desire 500. The feedback from many of them was more than positive, but what do people who know better in these matters think?  The experts who gave their feedback on this phone agreed that the smartphone has very good qualities and is a solid model in the competing market of smartphones and communicators.  Among the obvious advantages is the price-quality ratio.  Industry experts say the HTC Desire 500 is one of the best phones for its price.  The camera of the phone is also praised, as well as the good quality of the photos that are obtained when using it.  The efficiency of the one-character model was at a very high level, which cannot be said about her two-symbol brother.  There were crashes and freezes due to two SIM cards, which is a little frustrating, especially considering the fact that a phone with two SIM cards is more expensive.  Also, the uncertainty regarding the long service life of the phone is called as a minus, because HTC cannot establish itself as a manufacturer of communicators, whose smartphones can work for a long time. </p><h2>  Smartphone pricing </h2><p>  This model of smartphone from a Taiwanese manufacturer today is cheap enough for the characteristics that HTC Desire 500 has. The price after the announcement was 350-400 US dollars, and today it can be purchased for $ 270.  This price applies only to a model with one SIM card.  As for the dual-SIM option, the prices of such phones range from 300 to 320 US dollars.  When choosing this smartphone, you should remember that more than a year has passed since its announcement.  This suggests that no new software updates will be released.  However, if the updated operating system does not play an important role for you, and you just want a good phone, the quality of which will be comparable to its cost, then the option with HTC Desire 500 looks very promising. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc desire 500 black" class="if" height="355" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/512280.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What comes with the phone </h2><p>  After purchasing a smartphone, you will receive not only the phone itself, but also something that can be useful to use.  The first on this list is a USB cable that can be used to connect the purchased device to your personal computer.  In addition, an adapter for charging is also included.  In addition to the cord and adapter, branded in-ear headphones are also offered.  According to reviews by many users, they are not convenient enough, and therefore, if there is a desire to listen to music through headphones, it is better to purchase a new and more convenient option.  By the way, before HTC in the kit offered a headset from Beats, but in order to reduce the cost of their communicators, they refused this option.  Also in the box HTC Desire 500 you can find a manual on how to use the phone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc desire 500 reviews" class="if" height="322" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/512272.jpg" width="574"></div>

    <h2>  What additional items can be purchased for the phone </h2><p>  In order for your phone to last you as long as possible, you need to buy a case for HTC Desire 500. You can do this in any online store or in a regular store that specializes in selling this type of product.  When choosing a cover, pay attention to the material from which it is made.  It is better to purchase accessories made of thick silicone.  This will simultaneously protect your phone from shock, and easily remove the case if necessary.  If desired, you can also buy film for the screen.  This is done so as not to scratch it, however, many refuse to film due to the fact that after gluing the sensation of touching the screen does not change for the better.  As an additional element, you can also purchase new headphones that will be convenient for you.  You will have the opportunity to choose for yourself those that will meet your own preferences. </p><p>  As can be seen from the review, the phone has a rather impressive army of fans, which can name a very large number of advantages of this unit.  One of the main ones is his camera, which makes amazing photos in completely different situations.  In addition, a very strong processor will allow you to get rid of glitches and freezes that could be traced when using other models.  Choose this phone and be sure that it is exactly what you need, because the price-quality ratio today is the main factor when choosing a really worthwhile device! </p>
