But many tourists underestimate this metropolis.  Lyon ranks third in France in terms of population.  In Lyon, attention is attracted not only by architectural buildings.  Here, the view is mesmerizing and incomparable beauty of natural landscapes.  No other city in France can be compared with Lyon, because here every centimeter of the square is saturated with historical spirit.  A distinctive feature of the metropolis can be called trawls.  These are narrow galleries among several houses.  Well, each of the attractions deserves special attention.  We will tell about the most popular and famous objects. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of lyon" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1312128.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Lyon symbol </h2><p>  One of the symbols of this French city is called the Basilica of Notre Dame de Fourviere.  Many sights of Lyon deserve the honor of being called its symbols, but it was the Basilica that became the most famous among them.  Notre Dame de Fourviere is located on Mount Fourviere.  The snow-white building is surrounded by ancient theaters, the building is decorated with filigree stucco and turrets.  The basilica was erected at the end of the century before last. </p><p>  The sights of Lyon are grandiose structures.  And the Basilica was no exception.  Therefore, some tourists and residents call it too pretentious, festive and rich.  But other people, on the contrary, say that it is tasteless.  This object combines the features of classical, neo-Gothic and non-Byzantine architectural styles.  Today, the building is listed as a <span>UNESCO World Heritage Site.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lyon Attractions" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1312120.jpg" width="600"></div>

This is the most magnificent square in the metropolis.  It is located in front of the house, which houses the Lyon City Hall and the Museum of Fine Arts.  At the very beginning of its existence, Terro was a market square and was in the possession of the monastery.  But in the XVI century the object passed into the possession of the city. </p><p>  For several centuries, the square has experienced numerous events.  Lyon (sights) and Terro, in particular, saw the execution of Pastor Monnier and the Marquis of Saint-Mars.  Countless rebellions were organized in the same square.  And here a unique phenomenon was captured: after the moon rose, the sky shone, a star flew in it, behind which the army of horsemen passed. </p><p>  Today, Terro Square no longer executes people, but at any time of the day or night it is crowded.  There are two famous monuments here - St. Peter's Palace and the City Hall.  The area is always beautiful, many travelers tend to visit it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lyon france sights reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1312123.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The most important museum of the country </h2><p>  The sights of Lyon can "boast" and the presence of various museums on their list.  The most popular among them is the Lyon Museum of Fine Arts, or the Museum of Fine Arts.  It was opened at the beginning of the 19th century and is located in the building in which the Benedictine monastery was once located.  After the opening, the main part of the museum's exhibit was made up of values ‚Äã‚Äãthat were confiscated from the aristocrats after the revolution.  But gradually the museum fund was replenished with other exhibits, which today are located on three floors of the building. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After the <span>Louvre Museum of</span> Fine Arts is the second largest in its collection.

A separate department of the institution is dedicated to ancient Egyptian art.
