    <h2>  Ways of development </h2><p>  Relations with partners and customers will be built proactive, long-term, personalized.  The speed of decision-making will be even higher, the company's products will be customized, a multi-channel approach will appear for sales due to the creation of high-tech offices, innovation of electronic channels and increasing the professionalism of employees.  The desire of Promsvyazbank to maintain a high position in the top 10 is understandable.  Only because of this is it possible to actively develop a transactional business, which significantly increases the amount of commission income. </p><p>  Growth always occurs in competition, and Promsvyazbank will certainly interact with other players in the market, work with an actively growing clientele that needs long-term support for its business.  There is a solution to many non-standard tasks.  That is why new Promsvyazbank partner banks appear in Moscow, St. Petersburg, other cities of the country and abroad.  Thanks to such connections, a more flexible, faster process of interaction with the clientele is provided, one of the best product line for business development in the domestic financial market is provided, and a very high quality of service. </p><h2>  Partner banks </h2><p>  At ATMs of Promsvyazbank's partner banks, cash is withdrawn on the same terms as customers have at the offices and branches of the main financial institution.  Partners are ABB Bank JSC, Vozrozhdenie Bank PJSC, Russian Agricultural Bank JSC, Binbank PJSC (formerly MDM) and Alfa Bank JSC.  This, as already mentioned, more than ten thousand ATMs only in Russia.  There are branches and ATMs of all five Promsvyazbank partner banks in St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, Stavropol and many other cities. </p><p>  Cash is withdrawn without additional restrictions (referring to the amount), as well as without additional fees.  It is also possible to deposit cash at the aforementioned banks using Promsvyazbank cards (Mir, MasterCard and Visa systems are also for individuals-clients of Promsvyazbank without commission). </p><h2>  Clarification </h2><p>  In 2016, Binbank completed the reorganization (with the merger of MDM Bank PJSC), the ATMs were also rebranded, and therefore you can operate with cash on any devices where BINBANK is written.  However, on the site of Promsvyazbank you need to check whether there is a possibility of cash withdrawal at a particular Binbank ATM according to the list. </p><p>  There are still a few of them, where the conditions are the same as for third-party devices belonging to foreign banks.  This means that the client may experience impressive commissions and limit restrictions. </p>

    <h2>  Partnership </h2><p>  Each major bank installs its own ATMs in almost all public places without exception.  Smaller banks cannot afford this, and therefore unite banking networks and create partnerships.  In this case, all participants remain in the positive: the clientele gets the opportunity to operate their deposits on third-party devices without overpayment, and banks expand their user base, attracting customers of the partner bank. </p><p>  Promsvyazbank is a large organization, nevertheless it did not begin to lag behind such a magnificent trend, having concluded several partnership agreements with other financial organizations.  Partnership is a special agreement between different banks, united in order to improve the quality of service for their customers.  Thus, the geography of personal presence is expanded, hidden advertising is carried out, which may be interested in the partner‚Äôs clients.  Such agreements are concluded or broken up, so it is best to look for relevant information on the bank's website.  You can also find out all this by phone. </p>
