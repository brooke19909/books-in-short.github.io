You can‚Äôt do without this gadget now.  And for this reason everyone wants to get the latest, new and functional model.  Yes, and at an attractive price.  <span>Highscreen Pure F</span> reviews in this regard are varied.  Nevertheless, many claim that this model is worthy of attention.  But why?  You can understand this difficult issue by studying the characteristics of the model, as well as relying on numerous opinions about the phone.  Only an analysis of everything studied will help draw the right conclusions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="highscreen pure f reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1005495.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Highscreen Pure F reviews get far from the best because of their screen.  But you should not be afraid of it.  After all, only one characteristic is not in order here.  This is the diagonal.  The thing is that if you take into account the dimensions of modern smartphones, then the proposed 4 inches is very small.  Indeed, on such a phone, it is neither normal to read a book nor play.  And the requests from many buyers are just that. </p><p>  However, the rest of the screen at Highscreen Pure F gets very good reviews.  The resolution here is quite large (for the original display size) - 480 x 800 pixels.  Plus, the phone has support for 16 million colors.  This allows the image to always remain bright, clear and saturated.  There is also a special screen protection.  It does not allow the display to be quickly and severely scratched and damaged. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  We continue to consider the opinions of users about Highscreen Pure F. Reviews of this product are also found in relation to such an indicator as the processor.  Without this component, you cannot imagine a normal smartphone.  The processor is the heart of the gadget, which is responsible for its performance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone highscreen pure f reviews" class="if" height="415" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1005494.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  And in ‚ÄúHighscreen Pure‚Äù in this regard, everything is in order.  After all, the processor here has 4 cores.  And the capacity of each is 1.3 GHz.  In principle, you can call the smartphone Highscreen Pure F, reviews of which are presented to our attention, gaming.  But only with a small screen. </p><p>  Many owners claim that the processor of the smartphone is very powerful.  And if you are not confused by the diagonal of the device‚Äôs screen, then you can safely play modern games.  In any case, the power of the characteristics will allow you to do this.  But, as practice shows, ‚ÄúHighscreen‚Äù is most often used for work, and not for games.  Programs and applications due to the processor run easily and simply.  And they just do not require a large diagonal display for comfortable use, unlike games and other entertaining content. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  Perhaps the controversial Highscreen Pure F reviews are found only in relation to the device system.  It usually plays an important role in choosing a smartphone.  Indeed, depending on which operating system is installed, you will have the opportunity to install certain games and applications. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In our case, it is known to almost all modern buyers "Android".  Only now the version installed is quite new - 5.0.  And because of it, the Highscreen Pure F smartphone does not always receive good reviews.  After all, before this, version 4.4 was the most common.  It is known to have already been fixed.  This means that errors and malfunctions are almost never encountered at work.  Many customers and owners of the Highscreen gadget complain about system crashes.  They are infrequent, insignificant, but nevertheless sometimes capable of delivering a lot of inconvenience.  In principle, this usually does not repel the public.  A little expectation, and all problems will be resolved.  More precisely, fixed.  So even a new version of the operating system is not so scary.  So, "Android 5.0" will only serve you in your favor. </p>

    <h2>  RAM </h2><p>  Highscreen Pure F receives reviews about such an important feature as RAM.  Unfortunately, everything here is not as good as we would like.  After all, the memory of this phone is extremely small.  Only 1 GB.  What does it mean?  And the fact that as a gaming smartphone "Highscreen" is no longer suitable.  After all, to run most applications and games, at least 2 GB of RAM is required. </p><p>  But this does not stop buyers from choosing a Highscreen Pure F smartphone. Reviews about these products are generally more positive than you might imagine.  If we take into account the small diagonal of the device, then we can conclude that we are dealing, rather, with a business, rather than a gaming gadget.  And for study / work, 1 GB of RAM is usually more than enough.  This means that this is not a reason to refuse to purchase.  Moreover, you can still run on your smartphone some not-so-new and powerful games, the processor will allow it.  But RAM is unlikely.  No, you will be able to run the game.  But only it will begin to slow down to such an extent that it will be simply impossible to play.  And this, of course, will affect the operability of the operating system.  It will be possible to fix everything, but with great difficulty.  Thus, Highscreen Pure F (black), the reviews of which are presented to our attention today, is not a smartphone for experiments.  We'll have to somehow adapt to the RAM, while using all the capabilities of the device.  This is not so difficult to do. </p><h2>  Built-in memory </h2><p>  The space for storing information on a mobile phone is another thing to consider.  Modern models should allow recording a lot of data.  So, there should be enough space.  Smartphone Highscreen Pure F 8 GB reviews gets far from the best in this regard, because, as you might guess, we will be offered only 8 gigabytes of space.  It‚Äôs pretty easy for a modern buyer to fill them out.  Typically, such smartphones are not considered by music lovers, as well as gamers or just amateurs to save a lot of information. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="highscreen pure f 4 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1005492.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Thus, if you rely on free space, then you should not choose this model of smartphone.  In principle, this is enough for work or study.  But no more than that.  As you see, this option is not suitable as a gaming smartphone.  Nevertheless, sometimes you can find a way out of a situation with a shortage of space on the phone.  And in this regard, Highscreen Pure F 8 GB reviews received quite good.  But why? </p><h2>  Memory card </h2><p>  For example, an ideal way out of the situation is to install an additional memory card.  In our case, there is a slight restriction in this regard.  Firstly, microSD memory cards are supported.  But this is not such a problem.  This format is the most popular and widespread.  Secondly, there is a restriction on the built-in space.  And the Highscreen Pure F Blue smartphone receives positive reviews in this sense.  After all, the limit is as much as 64 GB. </p><p>  If you wish, you can try to connect a 128 GB memory card.  But this is not recommended, because there will be a variety of system crashes and errors when filling the memory in excess of the optimum allowable space.  Sometimes even damage to recorded documents can be observed.  Thus, if you follow all the rules, then "Highscreen" can become a fully functional gadget.  The main thing is to learn how to rationally use the space offered to us and to timely <span>clean the phone</span> from unnecessary files. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Any modern gadget is distinguished by its versatility.  And the Highscreen Pure F phone receives not very good reviews regarding this parameter.  After all, any smartphone should have a good quality camera. </p>

    <p>  The problem with our phone is that this indicator almost does not please buyers.  Indeed, the ‚ÄúHighscreen‚Äù front camera is only 0.3 megapixels, and the usual (main, rear) - 5 megapixels.  Many of these figures simply repel.  Especially if you plan to shoot videos or take high-quality pictures.  True, it happens that even such a camera is capable of producing excellent results.  It already depends on the individual skills that the owner of the phone possesses.  Nevertheless, you should not abandon the smartphone just because of the camera.  As practice has shown, 5 megapixels on the rear - this is quite a worthy indicator.  And the front camera is necessary for making video calls and selfies.  And there is no need for phenomenal quality. </p><h2>  One + one </h2><p>  Highscreen Pure F Blue receives positive reviews for such a moment as the support of several numbers.  It is important for many customers to combine work and personal contacts.  And therefore, it is necessary that the smartphone has support for several SIM cards. </p><p>  Our model today supports 2 SIM cards.  As many buyers note, there are no failures, even if you use the numbers of different mobile operators at the same time.  Just what most customers need.  Indeed, often for work and family they use profitable tariff plans from different mobile operators. </p><p>  If you are called at the same time, then no problems or malfunctions will arise.  Although this is precisely what affects many smartphones with support for two SIM cards.  Fortunately, Highscreen is excellent in this regard.  So, you can easily and simply combine work, study and personal contacts. </p><h2>  Network </h2><p>  Network support for gadgets is very important.  And here the Highscreen Pure F mobile phone gets good reviews.  Yes, this is not the last generation of smartphones, but the communication support is excellent.  In any case, this is enough for many users.  What is it about? </p>

    <p>  Firstly, Highscreen Pure F supports the good old 2G network.  Perhaps all modern (and even old) models have such an opportunity.  In addition, today's device has GPS and GPRS.  Sometimes these services can be of great help to a person.  If you need high-quality Internet and mobile communications, they will be provided using a 3G connection.  But the vaunted 4G is not here.  This type of connection is only available on the latest generation of mobile phones. </p><p>  Smartphone Highscreen Pure F 4 receives positive reviews for the fact that it has Wi-Fi, as well as the "Bluetooth" of the latest version.  At the moment it is 4.0.  You can transfer data wirelessly, and even with a fairly fast speed.  Just what all modern users need now. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The delivery set in most cases also plays an important role.  Indeed, sometimes the price tag of a gadget is so high that the future owner hopes to purchase a full set of everything necessary, and receives only a box, a charger and a warranty coupon.  In this situation, it is best to know in advance what awaits us. </p><p>  You should not expect that you will receive with Hayscreen all the most necessary.  After all, the equipment is standard here.  This is an instruction manual, headphones, warranty card, charger and USB cable.  The rest needs to be bought.  Fortunately, finding a case and a protective film for a gadget is not a problem now. </p><h2>  Price tag </h2><p>  Price is another factor that affects reviews about a product.  Usually it should be justified by the characteristics.  That is, if the smartphone does not have anything special, then the high price will play a trick on him. </p><p>  In our case, Highscreen Pure F reviews are not as enthusiastic about the cost.  On the one hand, it is budgetary - only 6,000 rubles per working gadget, suitable for study and entertainment.  And on the other hand, you can always find an even cheaper analogue that will please with universal characteristics.  Nevertheless, many claim that ‚ÄúHighscreen‚Äù is worth the money.  So, opinions about the price tag are more likely positive than negative. </p>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  So it's time to take stock of our review.  As you can see, if you believe the numerous reviews, then ‚ÄúHighscreen‚Äù is a decent smartphone.  And pay attention to it.  Anyway, if you need a budget gadget for talking. </p><p>  But everyone makes the final decision for himself.  Whether you're looking for a phone for work or school, Highscreen Pure F is the perfect solution.  And in cases where you also want to play modern mobile games, you will have to choose a more versatile and expensive gadget.  Highscreen is also an ideal solution for students.
