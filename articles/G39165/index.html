Ways to make quick money</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, the question of <span>how to make money fast:</span> whether in St. Petersburg, in Moscow, whether in a small provincial town or village, many people are worried.  And the keyword is fast.  It seems that people no longer have other tasks and goals, everyone wants to get rich literally in a matter of days and immediately afterwards give up on Haiti in order to relax after righteous labors and drown in a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãpleasures. </p><p>  The desire to become rich is justified, especially in the face of today's realities, when money really rules our world.  But to think that this way, literally in a few weeks or months you can become a millionaire, can only foolish people.  No, of course, you can buy lottery tickets at every corner in the hope of breaking a big jackpot.  Or in search of answers to the question of how you can quickly and easily make money in St. Petersburg, sell your own apartment in St. Petersburg, if there is one, of course, and find yourself on the street, without housing, but with a tidy sum in your bank account. </p><p>  Only, firstly, only individuals win the lottery, and only fools sell apartments to eat and skip the proceeds.  And secondly, cited as an example and many similar methods can not be called earnings at all.  Because if you want to get a decent income, you need to work hard.  Sometimes almost day and night.  And be able to wait.  Do not think that you can open, say, the same IP, rent a place in the market, buy once a product, quickly sell it and immediately become a millionaire.  It won‚Äôt work out that way.  The path to financial solvency is thorny and long.  And therefore, being in search of answers to the question of how to quickly earn a lot of money (in St. Petersburg, for example), it is necessary first of all to decide on the scale of the set goal.  Indeed, for some, three thousand is the limit of dreams, and for others, three million will not be enough. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  We will try to the best of our ability to help those who are thirsty and talk about how to quickly earn money in St. Petersburg.  The methods proposed by us will be only legal, in addition, we will touch on all aspects of the issue.  That is, we will try to talk about how you can earn one-time, when you really need money really, and how to find a decent job to get a good salary after the first month.  And at the same time, we will touch upon the question of opening our own business.  Well, we take St. Petersburg as an example because it is really a city of great opportunities.  And not only because of its large size, but also due to its specificity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make money fast in spb" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/1345926.jpg" width="600"></div>

In huge megacities, even despite constant crises, there are always vacancies for those who want to find work.  Of course, it would be unreasonable to expect that you will be offered the choice of a bank or company manager upon arrival, but if you are a graduate of a good provincial university, and even with a red diploma, then it‚Äôs really worth trying to find a decent position.  Those who do not have the appropriate education are encouraged to look for themselves in other areas.  The peculiarity of the Northern capital lies primarily in the fact that a huge number of tourists arrive in this city every day.  And they all need the services of drivers and guides, food and housing.  With this in mind, try to find yourself an occupation in this area.

Situations are different.  Someone needs funds to buy an expensive item or there is not enough finance to pay off the next installment on a loan.  Or urgently need to help someone from relatives.  Or want to make money for a wedding.  In general, money is needed almost here and now.  <span>How to quickly make money</span> in St. Petersburg - without cheating, inventing various scams and other illegal actions?  In principle, quite simple.  If you have your own car, go in for a private cab.  Of course, "bombed" and without you enough, but in St. Petersburg, with its scale and a huge number of tourists, there is work for everyone.  True, you should not do this thing after work, at night.  So no strength is enough.  Take a vacation, for example.  Let's say for two weeks.  And preferably paid.  And do the cab.  Twelve hours a day will be enough.  And do not ditch the car during this time, and health will not be undermined by constant lack of sleep.  During this time, you can earn a pretty decent amount.  Plus, add vacation pay to her.  That's all - the question of how to quickly make money in St. Petersburg is resolved. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to make money in St. Petersburg quickly" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1345845.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  As for nonresident.  They should also pay attention to this option.  It is quite possible to come to St. Petersburg in your own car, rent an inexpensive little room, register at your place of residence and slowly ‚Äúbomb‚Äù.  And it does not matter if you do not know city routes.  Get a good navigator and the problem is solved.  And even if you take your passengers not in the shortest way, then that's okay too.  Most likely, they will be tourists.  And they know the city even less than yours.  So get through.  And after a week or two get comfortable and you will already know how to get along the main routes and without a navigator. </p><p>  As for transport services, in this area there are still plenty of opportunities for earning.  Even in the absence of your own car.  You can get a job officially in a taxi.  For several months it is quite possible to earn a good amount (basic salary + gratuities).  Or go work as a tour bus driver.  In general, if you have rights - be sure that you can earn money quickly. </p><h2>  Hand work </h2><p>  Anyone who is looking for how to make money fast (in St. Petersburg, in another city), as a rule, should understand that this can be done by looking for additional income.  We need money right this very minute - go to a bank or pawnshop.  There is no other way.  Urgently need money for a short period, but earned with your own hands - rely only on yourself.  You have skillful hands - do repairs.  Perhaps neighbors or friends and acquaintances urgently need a craftsman who can lay tiles, paint ceilings, and wallpaper.  It is clear that such specialists and offers in the market are a dime a dozen.  However, it is one thing - a team of guest workers, from whom you do not know what to expect, and quite another - the services of a conscientious person who is not only familiar, but can show what he is capable of, using the example of repairs carried out by himself in his apartment.  Moreover, he will not demand ten dollars for driving a nail, but will sound a reasonable amount.  So in this field it is quite possible to earn. </p><p>  In addition, Peter needs builders of various specialties.  And many provincials with the appropriate skills go for a short time to the Northern capital to earn money.  So if you find a good place, then within a month you can earn a pretty decent amount. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make money quickly in St. Petersburg at home" class="if" height="437" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1345852.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Ways for Creative People </h2><p>  Let's say you are a good photographer!  Excellent!  If you are looking for how to quickly make money in St. Petersburg, you won‚Äôt need to invent a new way.  Remember how Soviet films about resorts necessarily showed a photographer wandering along the beach with a monkey on his shoulder and offering everyone his services in a row?  You won‚Äôt need a monkey, but you can get a good machine.  Engage in professional photography - offer your services to numerous tourists.  And you don‚Äôt need to think that now everyone has smartphones, and therefore no one will be interested in you.  A professional photo shoot is a very popular type of service.  Especially in a city like St. Petersburg. </p><p>  Can you play any musical instrument?  Try to find a job in this area.  Today, the old traditions of the Soviet era are being revived.  In many restaurants, parks and cinemas, live orchestras play.  And musicians very well earn during the day, not to mention such a period as a week or a month. </p><h2>  Own apartment </h2><p>  Very many of those who are looking for how to quickly make money in St. Petersburg without investments are literally on a gold mine, but they don‚Äôt even know about it.  No, everyone knows that they can rent out their living space.  However, most people think that this can only be done if there are two or more apartments.  Not at all.  If you approach the matter wisely, you can perfectly manage the only property owned.  Rent your apartment (and the rental price in St. Petersburg is so high, especially if the housing is also located close to the center), get money, arrange with friends or parents that you will stay with them for several days, and then look for it during this time a modest rental housing.  It can be a little room in a communal apartment, or even a house in the area.  The latter, by the way, is a great option for the summer.  You will earn money, and you will live in nature.  The same can be said, by the way, about the cottage.  If you have such property, you won‚Äôt have to think long about where to earn money in St. Petersburg quickly.  From April to November, you can rent a house in the country in just a few days. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to quickly earn a lot of money in spb" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1345855.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to quickly make money in St. Petersburg at home </h2><p>  Only lazy people haven‚Äôt heard about making money on the Internet.  And many are trying to work on mailers, clicking on the links and doing penny tasks, or trying to understand all the nuances of Forex, hoping to make good money on the exchange.  Others begin to write articles, thinking that this way you can quickly, and most importantly, sitting at home, make good money.  As for the first, it is better to forget about this method right away.  Kopecks that can be obtained, day and night following the links, it‚Äôs good if enough to pay for electricity.  As for the other two methods, in order to earn money with their help, both the corresponding knowledge and time are required.  We need to quickly get a lot of money.  Of course, not millions, but at least a more or less normal amount.  A very good option is the so-called group purchases.  Register at women's forums and offer goods there that are in demand among a female audience at an affordable price.  For example, beautiful sets of curtains.  Or utensils.  Before this, however, you need to find the right products.  But there are online stores for this.  Then you collect orders from those who wish, order at the lower cost in bulk the necessary things (at a much lower price, of course) and send them to the ladies.  The difference between the price at which you purchased the product and the one at which it was sold, put in your pocket. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make money in spb quickly" class="if" height="430" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1345848.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Naturally, if you are engaged in the sale of small things, you will not be able to earn much, but on a large product: the same curtains, high-quality bedding, etc. - easily. </p><h2>  Option for intellectuals </h2><p>  Another option for those who are looking for how to quickly make money in St. Petersburg at home.  If you have excellent knowledge of some knowledge (it can be foreign languages, physics with mathematics, and programming), do tutoring.  And it‚Äôs not usual, in an online form, on Skype.  Throw a cry for relatives and acquaintances, place ads in the newspaper or paste posters on the appropriate boards about what you conduct for those who want trial, and free classes.  If you are confident in your abilities and knowledge, you can be sure that after the first lesson you will be phoned by people who want to work with you on an ongoing basis.  After all, you can take payment in advance, say, for a month.  So imagine how much money you make once, even if at least a dozen people sign up to you.  Today, such services are not only in demand, they are also very well paid.  So, be sure to pay attention to this option if you do not know where you can urgently make good extra money. </p><h2>  How to make money fast in St. Petersburg girl </h2><p>  On the one hand, it would seem that there is not much difference whether you are a girl or a guy.  Everyone equally needs money.  However, the lady is unlikely to begin to engage in private carriage, and she will not risk slipping into a construction site.  However, this does not mean that she will not be able to quickly get money.  And ladies have some specific features that guys completely lack.  Moreover, if someone immediately thinks about the oldest female profession, then it is completely in vain.  There are quite decent ways to make money fast.  And the first thing that comes to mind is to sell your own hair. </p>

    <p>  A girl with a luxurious scythe has a truly expensive asset.  Natural hair is very expensive, so you can immediately get good money for it.  If you feel sorry for parting with hair, you can go the other way.  In St. Petersburg, almost every day there are many different competitions.  Including hairdressers.  And the craftsmen need models.  Believe me, finding them is quite difficult.  There are not so many girls with luxurious hair, as some think.  Moreover, the presence of good long hair is the only condition for participation in such a competition.  The length of the legs and the correct features of the face do not matter.  Beauty of you will do at the expense of makeup in any case.  As for the figure, no one will look at it.  First of all, they will evaluate the work of the master and the beauty of your hairstyle.  So if you have a braid to the waist, but there is not a penny of money, urgently call the appropriate agency or look for information on such events yourself.  For a few days of participation in such a competition, one can earn pretty well. </p><h2>  Children also need money! </h2><p>  But what do the children do?  How to make money fast in St. Petersburg?  At the age of 12, let‚Äôs say, it‚Äôs impossible to find a job at least for the summer holidays.  The law does not allow.  This type of activity is allowed only to teenagers from the age of 14, and even then with the consent of the parents.  It is impossible for the younger children to even go to the postal service, which is always in need of employees, to ask at least to distribute newspapers.  12-year-olds need money no less than their older comrades.  Well, you have to do it yourself.  It‚Äôs impossible by mail - we‚Äôll go to the editorial office of an advertising newspaper, which is distributed <span>free of charge, since</span> there are enough such places in St. Petersburg.  And we agree that we will distribute their products in offices and houses.  This is not prohibited by law, so no problems will arise.  Another option is putting up service announcements.  Such work is not heavy, it is quite worthy of being paid. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make money fast in spb a new way" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1345847.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  However, you can find something for yourself, even within your own home or yard.  For example, negotiate with dog owners and walk their pets.  Or look after the cat during the absence of the owners.  Walk several times a week to a store or pharmacy and deliver food and medicine to older people.  Of course, providing assistance to one pensioner, you won‚Äôt earn much, but if you take patronage over a dozen old and old women, you can simply save them to a good expensive smartphone.  In general, there are options.  And quite good. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p> Everyone wants to live in decent conditions.  Not only the inhabitants of the Northern capital.  And the desire to make good and a lot of money is inherent in almost everyone.  Only here, in order for it to be realized, it is necessary to work hard and hard.  Of course, there are situations when money is urgently needed.  And then you have to quickly look for a way out.  Where to get them in this case, we tried to tell.  Of course, the article provides only some of the possible options.  Other ways can be found.  However, one must keep in mind - all of them, by and large, are disposable.  In general, the best thing you can do is find your place in life, go in for some profitable craft, or start your own business.  That is, to find the way that will bring constant good income.  And then you don‚Äôt have to puzzle over how you can quickly make money.  In St. Petersburg, whether in another city.  You will always have them. </p>
