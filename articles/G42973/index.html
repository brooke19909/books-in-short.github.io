It stretched 700 km from the southwest to the northeast.  The width of the mountain system is more than 200 km.  The western part approaches the shores of Lake Baikal, and on the eastern part the peaks reach the upper reaches of the river.  Olekma.  Sharp high mountain ranges (3,000 m), which alternate with intermontane basins (within 800‚Äì1,000 m above sea level), this is exactly what you can see in the Highlands.  The coordinates of this mountain system: 56 ¬∞ 05‚Ä≤00 ‚Ä≥ north latitude, 114 ¬∞ 30‚Ä≤00 ‚Ä≥ east longitude.  On the map of Russia, it is located on the territory of Buryatia (the center of Asia). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="highlands" class="if" height="457" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1333671.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Ridges </h2><p>  The mountain system is divided into 7 ranges, located from west to east in this direction: </p><ul><li>  The South Mui Range with the highest point of the Muisky Giant (3,067 m). </li><li>  Severo-Muysky ridge - maximum height - 2,537 m. </li><li>  Verkhneangarsky ridge.  The highest peak is 2 641 m. </li><li>  Kodar Range - a continuation of the North Muisky.  Maximum height - BAM peak (3,072 m). </li><li>  Udokan Ridge with a maximum height of 2,561 m. </li><li>  Kalar Range - a continuation of Udokan.  The predominant heights are less than other highland ridges.  The maximum peak is the city of Skalisty Golets, with a height of 2,519 m. </li><li>  The Nizhnekalarsky ridge is a branch of the Kalarsky ridge.  Located south. </li></ul><p>  All 7 ridges of the Highlands are represented by pointed peaks, rocky ridges with charred terraces.  These are the so-called alpine landforms. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the highlands" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1333666.jpg" width="500"></div>

The intermontane depressions are composed of sedimentary strata of the Cenozoic period.  Permanently frozen rocks are also widespread throughout the highlands. </p><p>  The relief-forming process of this mountain system continues to this day.  Factors confirming this: the high seismic activity of the region, the strong dissection of the relief and the widespread permafrost zones. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="highland coordinates" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1333660.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Minerals </h2><p>  Like other formations of this type, the Stanovoye Upland is "strewn" with various kinds <span>of mineral deposits.</span>  Large deposits of coal and copper were discovered within the Kodarsky ridge.  In Kalarsky, <span>copper ores</span> are <span>mined.</span>  Gold and fluorite deposits are also found.  In the valley of the Chara River (Kodar Range), a lilac-colored mineral is mined - charoite, which is used as an ornamental jewelry stone.  The extraction of these minerals is one of the main sectors of the economy of this region. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Climatic features </h2><p>  The climate of this region is affected by the altitude and geographical location of the Highlands.  Within its limits, a sharply continental type is observed.  The climate differs only on the peaks and in the basins.  In general, summers are warm but short (lasts a maximum of 2 months on the ridges, 3 weeks longer in the basins).  But the winter in this area is long and very cold.  The average annual rainfall of 300 mm within the basins, 1000 mm at the peaks.  It is worth noting that most of them fall in mid-July and August.  In the basins in summer, the temperature does not rise above +19 ¬∞ , and at an altitude of 1.5 thousand m - +13 ¬∞ .  In winter, the thermometer shows -30 ... -34 ¬∞ C.  In the valleys it is much colder, here this indicator can drop to -40 ¬∞ C. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="geographical location of the highlands" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1333659.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Region features </h2><p>  On the tops of high mountain ranges there are glaciers and other forms of a similar relief: kars, stained ridges, and trough valleys.  In the intermontane depressions there are many lakes and rivers that feed on meltwater. </p><p>  For the natural zoning of the Stanovoi Range, altitudinal zonation is characteristic.  Deciduous forests are spread on the foothills and slopes of the ranges, which at an altitude of 1200-1600 m are replaced by birch and deciduous woodlands.  Alpine regions are represented by mountain taiga, pre-alpine woodlands and stony char.  The intermontane depressions are filled with floodplain meadows, often swampy, and pine and pine-deciduous forests grow on thick sandy strata. </p><p>  If you look at the map where the Stanovoi Upland is located, then administratively this region belongs to the Republic of Buryatia, the Irkutsk and <span>Chita Regions.</span> </p><h2>  Using </h2><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Stanovoi Range is quite well studied and developed.  To a greater extent, this became possible thanks to the advent of the Baikal-Amur Railway.  The track cuts through all 7 <span>mountain ranges of the</span> highlands.  The most difficult for the construction of the highway was the North Mui Range.  The construction of the road took place intermittently for 26 years.  The longest railway tunnel of the Russian Federation - Severomuisky - is broken inside the ridge.  Its length is more than 15.3 thousand meters. Railway stations and settlements have been built on both sides of the highway. </p>
