  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The importance of information services in tourism development</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Currently, tourism is an information-rich and powerful industry.  It is based on travel companies involved in the selection and provision of information, the sale of permits, travel arrangements.  They also offer accommodation services for tourists in hotels, catering, cultural and recreational activities and excursions.  In this industry, the daily collection, processing and transmission of reliable information to potential consumers are of great importance for effective functioning.  Travel services are not manufactured goods and cannot be put up for sale; their purchase is carried out remotely.  Consequently, the level of sales directly depends on information and advertising tools. </p><p>  The link between tourism service providers and consumers is information on the availability, quality and cost of services.  Informational articles and reviews posted on the Internet allow tourists to pre-select and book <noindex>  <span>hotel room</span> </noindex>  , rent a car, plan excursions.  Every year, the number of information portals and users of the Internet is increasing significantly.  Feature articles, visitor reviews, photos and video reviews posted on websites inform potential customers about the availability and quality of travel services.  Accordingly, the availability and speed of providing fresh reliable information are no less important than the provision of hotel services. </p><p>  For example, information on tourist portals about <noindex>  <span>Rostov-on-Don hotels</span> </noindex>  , makes it possible to solve in advance the problem of choosing a place of residence for those who decide to visit the capital of the Don region. <strong> </strong>  Many hotels, such as Mr. X, Amaks, Mart, Chateau, Star and others, will welcome their guests with comfort and coziness. <strong> </strong>  Depending on the purpose of the trip, you can stay in the business, cultural and historical center of the city.  An unforgettable experience will be left on the left bank of the Don - the most popular place for recreation and entertainment of tourists and locals.  In Rostov there are cozy mini-hotels and large hotel complexes with developed infrastructure and a large number of rooms. <strong> </strong>  Given their financial capabilities and preferences, tourists can familiarize themselves with the living conditions in advance and choose the best option. </p><p>  Today, due to the growth of the information needs of modern society and the development of the sphere of information services, the role of information as a product is significantly increased. </p></div></article>
