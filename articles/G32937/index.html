    <p>  Some guests believe that breakfast at the hotel is standard, as they say, without frills, but, nevertheless, very satisfying, so no one needs additional food. </p><p>  But dinners are very diverse, there is something to choose and something to feast on.  Experienced tourists are especially enthusiastic about desserts and recommend trying them.  As a rule, they are liked even by those who are indifferent to sweets. </p><p>  Some tourists prefer to order only breakfast and dinner at the hotel, and dine somewhere in the tavern, since they do not always have time to return from excursions at the appointed time during the day.

    <p>  Impressions from the rest - this is a kind of picture consisting of small parts, each detail in its own way is important for creating a general atmosphere and mood.  And food plays a significant role in our life, therefore, it is encouraging that the hotel administration takes care of its visitors, thereby creating a good mood and the most positive emotions for them. </p><h2>  Beach complex </h2><p>  Alexandros Palace Hotel Suites (Halkidiki) has a nice beach.  The hotel is located in the first line, which is very convenient.  The beach is sandy, clean and has a gentle entrance to the sea.  According to guest reviews, the coastal zone is always clean, there is absolutely no garbage, apparently the territory is cleaned daily, so you can not worry about children forever scurrying around in the sand. </p><p>  There are a sufficient number of sun loungers on the beach, there is enough space for all vacationers.  Depending on which building you live in, go to the sea from three to seven minutes at a steady pace.  There is even an underpass to the shore.  It is very pleasing that the hotel maintains a clean beach, as it is very important for a seaside resort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="alexandros palace hotel suites 5 greece" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1411505.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The sea in these parts is always clean and calm.  With children, you can safely ride and not worry about the possibility of a storm, there are no waves here.  Water heats quickly in the spring, and at the end of May you can swim.  Of course, the hotel also has swimming pools, but it‚Äôs just a sin to sit near them when such a warm and welcoming sea is nearby. </p><p>  According to tourists, the hotel's beach deserves all praise and is perfect for families with kids. </p><h2>  Children's animation </h2><p>  The hotel administration took care of the youngest guests.  For them, the complex has a playground, an animation club, entertainment programs for Russian-speaking children are held in Russian. </p><p>  I would like to note that not all parents are satisfied with the work of animators, believing that there are very few programs for children.  Others, on the contrary, praise the kids club. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="alexandros palace hotel suites greece" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1411509.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel does not have a specialized children's menu, keep this in mind if adult meals are not suitable for your child.  However, it should be noted that all dishes are suitable for children and, if desired, you can choose what the kids will like. </p><h2>  Tours and activities </h2><p>  Alexandros Palace Hotel Suites is the place where you can forget about the hustle and bustle in a relaxing atmosphere.  If you are looking for noisy and stormy all-night parties and active adult animation, then you should look for a different place.  The hotel clearly positions itself as a complex for families.  It has a beautiful large area covered with vegetation.  But at the same time the hotel is in some privacy.  Five kilometers from it is Uranupoli, and ten minutes is the port of Tripiti, where ferries leave every half an hour, two kilometers is the village of Nea Roda.  If you wish, you can quickly get to any of these settlements, where there are taverns, restaurants, the promenade, shops and supermarkets, as well as their interesting sights.  The guests of the complex will not be bored.  It‚Äôs just to be understood that the entire infrastructure is at least a few kilometers, which makes the hotel a very quiet and relaxing place to relax.  Here you will not be disturbed by music from bars and restaurants, which does not allow you to fall asleep until the morning. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="alexandros palace hotel suites 5 halkidiki afon" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1411511.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  A huge advantage of the complex is the presence of its own diving school.  Now many are keen on diving, so this is a good opportunity not only to relax, but also to enjoy the beauties of the local underwater world.  Nature is as if created to be admired, and underwater beauty is no exception.  Prices in the underwater school are quite affordable. </p><p>  In May and June the hotel is very calm, there is no huge crowd of vacationers.  At this time, as a rule, pilgrims and families with children come here.  Resting in the complex, you can visit a huge number of excursions and get to holy places, that's why many people come here. </p><p>  The hotel organizes numerous trips that allow you to admire the local beauties.  A five-hour excursion under the name ‚ÄúSaint Athos cruise‚Äù is very interesting, there is a good program for visiting local monasteries, you can visit the Belt of the Blessed Virgin Mary, as well as go to the thermal springs in Aridea, where you can swim in fonts with a water temperature of 37 degrees.  At the hotel reception you will be prompted a lot of options for travel.  If you want to devote some time to shopping, then it is better to go to Soloniki, since there are no large shops in Halkidiki.  In general, tourists will not be bored even if the sea is not very warm. </p><h2>  Guest reviews </h2><p>  I would like to note that this hotel is a good place for relaxing couples, honeymooners, the elderly.  All guests will find here entertainment to their liking.  Beautiful nature and local attractions will not leave anyone indifferent. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="alexandros palace hotel suites halkidiki" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1411513.jpg" width="508"></div>

    <p>  If you are tempted by a calm measured vacation at sea surrounded by beautiful nature, then you should definitely visit this complex.  The good news is that in addition to sea vacations, there is the opportunity to visit excursions and get acquainted with the sights.  Sometimes, holidays abroad for some tourists are limited by the fact that they spend all the time only on the territory of the hotel.  Athos is so beautiful that he certainly needs to be seen.  It is also recommended to visit Soloniki, where you will be struck by the abundance of attractions that are found everywhere.  You can still go to the pastry shops, the market, themed cafeterias, of which there are a great many. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  In our article we tried to tell in more detail about one of the best hotels in Greece.
