    <h2>  Converters Features </h2><p>  A distinctive feature of all converters for pumps is their simplicity.  However, they do not need any maintenance and work absolutely automatically.  Additionally, it is possible to control them through a personal computer.  You can also set individual schedules of the device.  Moreover, their efficiency is about 90%.  You should also be aware that an expansion tank is not needed for pumps with converters.  Thus, the pressure is always maintained at an optimal level. </p>

    <h2>  What characteristics do the converters have? </h2><p>  Important characteristics of the converters are considered input voltage, as well as power.  Additionally, the manufacturer always indicates the type of control.  Today, there are scalar and vector control devices.  The rated current parameter depends on the power of the model.  You can also highlight the indicator of the output frequency.  Usually it is indicated in the range from 0.1 to 600 Hz.  Overload capacity is calculated as a percentage.  The degree of protection of the converter housing is indicated by a special marking.  The operating temperature of the device by the manufacturer is also mandatory.  Among other things, it should highlight the parameter of acceleration time, as well as braking. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  FC-051 Converter </h2><p>  The FC-051 frequency converter is actively used for pumps and ventilation systems.  This model is distinguished by a high-quality control unit.  It should be noted and a good device interface.  You can connect this converter to a personal computer.  The mechanical seal is locked automatically. </p><p>  If necessary, the remote control can be easily disconnected.  At the same time, the device can be launched remotely from any distance.  With increased pressure, the protective system instantly trips and blocks the engine.  It also protects the system from various power surges.  Indication in this model is provided by LED.  At the same time, the control panel has only the most necessary indicators.  The noise level of the electric motor is within the normal range.  This was largely achieved due to the high-quality variator, which produces a stable frequency at the level of 8 kHz. </p><p>  To cool the entire converter there is a powerful fan.  It is installed at the base of the frame and securely fixed.  In this case, the device can be used for a long time and not overheat.  Additionally, it should be noted that the tracking system constantly monitors external pressure.  This model can be installed on centrifugal pumps.  The control sensor withstands an output signal of up to 20 mA.  This frequency converter (market price) costs about 16 thousand rubles. </p>
