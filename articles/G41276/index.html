    <h2>  What is an amplifier? </h2><p>  Even the name makes it clear that all devices of this kind are designed to enhance sound.  Any amplifier is a device that transmits electrical oscillations through itself and repeatedly amplifies them in the frequency range most comfortable for human perception. </p><p>  Amplifiers are different.  They differ in hardware, purpose and appearance, and there are also whole classifications of such devices. </p>

    <p>  The first and most understandable classification for everyone is based on the conditions under which the amplifier is used.  Some people prefer to listen to music at home, while someone buys a multi-channel amplifier in the car and enjoys clear sound on the road. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Home or, as they are also called, household stationary amplifiers are used at home.  Not indoors, namely at home.  Most often, such devices are only auxiliary systems of a home theater.  The advanced audio system in the living room is rarely equipped with a separate amplifier.  This is not necessary there.  The built-in is often enough, but sometimes it comes bundled with the audio system as a separate device.  Such home amplifiers are much better than built-in, but also much more expensive. </p><h2>  Three main types </h2><p>  Multichannel amplifiers can be very different from each other.  However, despite all the variety and assortment, there are only three main types of amplifiers: </p><ol><li>  Preliminary.  Amplifiers of this type are most often required for condenser microphones with phantom power.  The device receives a weak and low-quality signal.  The device processes it, supplements and significantly enhances it.  This works especially well with microphones.  Firstly, more than half of the microphones do not work without a pre-amplifier at all.  Secondly, the device minimizes interference, reduces noise and makes the sound much cleaner. </li><li>  Terminal.  Such amplifiers work exclusively with the power of the incoming signal.  This type is rarely used in everyday life, because it is intended for audio systems.  And for the most part professional or studio. </li><li>  Integral.  Almost all multichannel amplifiers in the world market are of this type.  First of all, this is a combined device.  It includes all other types.  There is also a small device control unit, especially for those who need manual adjustment.  Despite the logical versatility, this type is the cheapest.  Combining all types in himself, he cannot surpass each of them individually.  A unified audio system with an integrated amplifier will always be worse than the exact same system, but with separate amplifiers. </li></ol>

Changed not only the views, but also the principle of operation of the devices.  Outdated and irrelevant forever became part of history, but only the highest quality entered the world market: </p><ul><li>  Lamp.  The name and appearance will appeal to many people.  Devices of this type are based on vacuum electron tubes.  Most often, such amplifiers are studio, professional and semi-professional.  Great for high frequency sound.  However, tracks that have undergone multiple dubbing or, even worse, remakes in a modern way, play poorly on such devices.  Such amplifiers are not afraid of significant overloads and even have good protection against short circuits.  For lovers of loud bass, this device is definitely not suitable.  In any case, the tube amplifier gives a soft sound, and also often has an interesting appearance. </li></ul>

    <ul><li>  Transistor  A multi-channel audio amplifier will not necessarily be a tube amplifier.  This type is based on bipolar transistors.  The design of such devices is reliable and simple, and, consequently, the lowest price.  Such devices cannot boast of excellent sounding, because this is already an outdated technology.  Staying on the market only due to low cost.  It is being supplanted by another species. </li><li>  Amplifier based on <span>integrated circuits.</span>  All devices of this type are compact.  The microcircuits are small and allow you to place the device in miniature boxes.  It is these amplifiers that are most often used in cars.  The design is simple, but due to the fact that sound is better than transistor ones, they cost more. </li><li>  Hybrid Amplifiers.  This is the most expensive and demanding view.  Yes, it gives a really good sound, but is not able to boast of reliability.  Such devices combine tube, and transistor, and integrated amplifiers.  To purchase this type for a home system makes no sense.  This is a professional tool for working in the studio. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Mono amplifiers </h2><p>  Multichannel power amplifiers, although they are used most often, are not always suitable.  There are so-called mono amplifiers.  In home systems, this is extremely rare.  What are they needed for? </p><p>  To enhance the power of only one speaker.  Only one channel is used.  The sound obtained as a result of mono amplification will be the cleanest and highest quality.  In audio systems, you can use one amplifier for each speaker.  How is such a high sound quality achieved?  By using only one channel.  There is no noise or interference.  An audio system based on mono amplifiers will be outstanding in every sense. </p><h2>  More channels don't mean better! </h2><p>  Digital multi-channel amplifiers have long been popular in the market.  They are equipped with many home theaters.  Their own people buy separately, in the hope of the highest quality sound.  However, this is a hoax.  Despite the attractive appearance, such devices will meet expectations only if the music lover did not save.  There are a lot of such devices on the world market, and the problem is that they are all very different in price.  The very best devices are really capable of giving incredibly pleasant sound.  However, they are expensive.  They also provide a powerful cooling system for the components of the amplifier and passive protection against power surges. </p><h2>  Multi Channel Mono </h2><p>  The most expensive home systems are equipped with several multi-channels.  They work in single channel mode.  This is a very expensive solution, but worth it.  The fact is that regardless of the room, the sound will be close to sound quality in movie theaters.  Watching movies with such a sound system can make a really good impression. </p>

    <h2>  Amplifier in car </h2><p>  A car amplifier can really significantly improve the sound.  However, he can never compensate for cheap speakers.  Costly car audio systems will sound much nicer. </p><h2>  One of the most successful options </h2><p>  Portable amplifiers are a whole segment of the market, literally packed with Chinese goods.  However, among them stands out one extremely successful model that wins in terms of price and quality.  This is a JBL GTO-3EZ car multichannel amplifier. </p><p>  This device stands out among many.  This is a 3-channel amplifier, but in fact there is only 2 channels. One channel is a D-class amplifier.  Impressive power is concentrated in a small enclosure.  Many use the device not only in the car, but also at home, because the power is more than enough.  Of particular note is the amplifier firmware.  She is able to adjust all the important parameters in the electronic system of the car herself.  You do not have to configure manually. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Reviews on the JBL GTO-3EZ car multichannel amplifier are mostly positive.  Negative feedback is due to the incompatibility of the old columns.  The fact is that connecting such serious equipment to very bad speakers is to throw money away.  They not only will not open the amplifier completely, but they will not be able to work with it correctly.  Basically the bass will suffer.  Many users admit that after installing the amplifier I had to buy a good audio system for it. </p><h2>  For headphone </h2><p>  A multi-channel headphone amplifier is a rather specific thing.  Basically, it is not required either in ordinary life or in work.  The only scope is recording studios and high-quality sound in computer games.  There are almost no special headphone amplifiers.  There are only a couple of models, and they are very expensive.  It is much cheaper to buy a Chinese counterpart, but this will make even less sense. </p>
