A person turns on the TV to watch the long-awaited continuation of the series or his favorite program, but he receives only a blank screen.  And digital television does not work every time for some reason that is not understood by anyone.  Either this is not broadcast, or the signal does not pass, or prevention is on separate channels.  Digital television also does not work in the event of a breakdown of the antenna or even the TV itself, or maybe the cable goes somewhere.  The reasons when there is no television broadcasting are very, very many.  This article will help with some. </p>

    <h2>  Main reasons </h2><p>  If digital television does not work due to a lack of signal, this will be immediately understandable, because no channel will respond.  So something happened to the antenna.  Prevention can not take place at once on all channels, most often on one or in extreme cases - on several.  The rest will work, and why digital television does not work - the question is not for such a situation.  If the cable has gone somewhere, then the question is legitimate, because silence and a dark screen will be everywhere. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first thing you can check it, everyone knows, even people far from technology.  You need to disconnect and reconnect the cable.  If it does not help, then contact specialists and ask them why digital television does not work today.  If the user suspects the cause of the breakdown of the TV, there is no sense in independent actions.  Only a service center or a private master who can accurately repair TVs will help. </p><h2>  Many many if </h2><p>  Cable TV users can immediately contact a company that provides broadcast services as soon as they detect a lack of sound and image.  There are usually masters there, they will always help and in all cases.  If there is no cable TV, then first you need to get to know the neighbors and ask if everything is okay with them. </p><p>  If digital television doesn‚Äôt stop working for them, then all problems must be sought from a specific user.  If you use a conventional indoor antenna, problems usually arise often, so many now buy special amplifiers, then there is no answer why digital television does not work.  An amplifier for antennas is a very effective help, and it is not difficult to purchase it - it is not too expensive and is sold everywhere in every household appliance store. </p>

    <h2>  Common problems </h2><p>  Satellite TV antennas are very powerful, but even they sometimes refuse to transmit a signal, and a frustrated user spends a lot of time with the phone in his hands, asking the broadcasting company why digital television does not work today.  This problem is considered common.  The satellite shifts, namely, the antenna was tuned to it, and it was from him that she caught the signal. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  He is, but not available.  The problem is solved quite simply, but not every user will be able to reconfigure the antenna to another satellite, therefore it is better to contact specialists immediately.  Moreover, it is not a fact that this satellite has shifted.  Maybe the antenna can change its position due to the wind or from the fall of any object, tree branches, for example. </p><h2>  The benefits and harms of curiosity </h2><p>  There are many reasons, and users have even more solutions if, of course, they cannot correctly determine the reason why digital television does not work well.  If the reason is unclear or the user was mistaken in the diagnosis, problems and additional ones may appear during independent actions.  Therefore, it is better to resort to the help of real professionals.  They will determine why 20 channels of digital television do not work, or, for example, out of twenty, only ten work. </p><p>  A user who is not very well versed in modern technology is unlikely to be able to do this.  But there are (and in a fairly large number) people who are inquisitive, and it is their choice: to set up a signal or break something else.  It is possible to eliminate only some minor flaws on your own, and those that are in sight, for example, put the cable correctly in the socket or select an amplifier for the antenna in the store.  The rest must be provided to specialists. </p>

    <h2>  Far and near </h2><p>  In the city it is much easier to get answers to the following questions: why digital television channels do not work, why sound and image reception is poor, why not all channels work efficiently and many questions still concern broadcasting and reception.  But very often there are situations when it is difficult to solve such problems in a megalopolis.  You can‚Äôt even list all the cases in which the master can not immediately cope if digital television does not work. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Kaluga, for example, is a very modern city, but for some reason there are a lot of reviews on the Internet about signal problems.  City dwellers actually have much less problems with calling for technical support, but how much more difficult it is to solve issues of such a plan far from civilization!  In the outback, time does not flow so soon, modern technologies come there very late or never come.  Therefore, digital television lovers need to find out what options exist for them today. </p><h2>  Three options </h2><p>  Firstly, it is cable television, when the signal will be distributed directly through the television cable, and it is connected to a single TV.  This is a very high-quality transmission, but it is far from accessible in every province, mainly in cities.  And the monthly fee is quite high. </p><p>  Secondly, it is satellite television, when the signal comes from near-earth orbit and is received by an individual antenna ("dish").  This can be done everywhere, and the sound and picture will be quality.  The monthly fee is quite high, the equipment is also expensive.  And from time to time, the question is nevertheless posed by the user: why did digital television stop working? </p><p>  Thirdly, <span>this is</span> terrestrial <span>television</span> , when the signal is distributed by ground-based relay stations, and it is received by an individual antenna.  There are few costs, but the signal level is much lower, the reception quality depends on everything in the world - here is the weather, and the distance from the relay tower, and the height of the antenna mast, and much, much more.  And each user from time to time will spoil the mood from the fact that digital terrestrial television does not work. </p><p>  Of course, nowadays everywhere, the Internet always helps everyone, where you can always see everything you want.  However, this article is not about these cases. </p>

    <h2>  Theory </h2><p>  All of these methods are good enough.  But it is necessary, when choosing one of them, to represent, at least in general terms, how they differ.  For example, just terrestrial television and digital are completely different.  The latter is that digital encoding is used to transmit the image and sound - both the audio signal and the video signal.  And for transmission, digital channels are used.  Such encoding ensures minimal loss in signal delivery, since no interference to the encoded information is terrible.  And if the channels of digital television do not work, then they do not work completely, in general.  And if they work, then only in excellent quality.  The boundary state and interference are absent here.  The exception is only that there is a poor quality of communication.  Then the TV, as it were, slows down, turns off and turns on again.  And this is corrected only in one way - you need another antenna or you need to raise the existing one higher and deploy it towards the TV tower. </p><p>  It should also be noted that many users do not know that digital television is always a limitation in the number of available channels.  Depending on the region, there may be ten, twenty, the number varies.  The principle does not work here: raised the antenna above and caught absolutely everything.  No, only what is available is configured.  For good viewing, you need to purchase, first of all, a television antenna, TV or <span>Set Top Box set-top box</span> with support for signal compression standards and a tuner (you need to find out which is not yet outdated).  Many of the most modern TVs do not need a prefix, they only need an antenna.  But not everyone has such, and therefore often users are looking for the reason why the set-top box for digital television does not work, although the problem may also be in the TV itself. </p>

    <h2>  Practice </h2><p>  Suppose, selected for use on-air digital television.  You can use the most ordinary antenna, which catches two or three channels in fairly good quality, a couple more in poor quality, but even those in very good weather.  Such an antenna needs a prefix.  For example, DVB-T2.  Anyone can, they are technically almost identical.  Most often, consoles have two outputs - SCART or ‚Äútulip‚Äù and an HDMI output, as well as a USB connector to view the contents of electronic media.  The boxes for all consoles are different, but they seem to be made at the same factory in China.  Therefore, when buying, you need to carefully examine the control panel as the most frequently used item, is everything all right with it.  Otherwise, there will be problems in switching channels, adjusting the volume and the like.  If all is well, you can connect the antenna to the console, and the console using the "tulip" (usually sold in the same kit with the console) must be connected directly to the TV. </p><p>  Here you need to know that the RCA connectors for stereo audio and video signal - this is the very ‚Äútulip‚Äù.  Yellow for video, little white for left stereo or mono, and red for right stereo.  If the TV picture tube is morally obsolete, the ‚Äútulip‚Äù will help out.  If the TV is plasma or LCD, there is an HDMI output, and the cable you need is appropriate, another will not work.  It must be purchased separately.  Otherwise, the user will not like the image too much.  The TV needs to be switched to AV mode, then the set-top box interface will appear.  Setting up the console is not too complicated.  Even if you just do everything by default, the quality will satisfy even connoisseurs.  The main thing here is to configure the channels themselves.  The menu has a channel search.  You can also select auto search.  In a few minutes everything will be ready.  For almost any settlement, this will be enough. </p>

    <h2>  From electronic media </h2><p>  As already mentioned, a <span>digital set-top box is</span> needed in order to play back recorded on a USB flash drive.  To do this, you need to insert the USB device into the console, go to the menu, select "USB", "Multimedia", respectively, then select the desired format - video, pictures or music.  The contents of the flash drive will open on the screen.  Now you need to select the desired folder and open the file.  Everything is even simpler than doing this with a laptop or computer.  However, still, many people cannot deal with these operations on their own.  Especially the elderly, not keeping pace with the rapid movement of technological progress, need help.  Young people do it best.  And even small children adapt much more easily. </p><p>  But that is not all.  A user who has such an antenna prefix for digital television should know that it is possible to perform the reverse operation.  For example, record your favorite program directly from the TV onto a USB flash drive.  And the actions for this purpose are just as simple.  It is enough to press the "Rec" button on the console of the set-top box, and recording will obediently go to the USB device.  In a word, digital television today, even for a remote settlement, is not a myth or a dream, but a completely feasible thing.  And if it is digital terrestrial, then it is not necessary for a village resident or temporarily settled in a country house to spend about ten thousand rubles to install satellite television, and then pay a considerable monthly fee.  Today you can achieve comfort with small means. </p>

    <h2>  Trust provider </h2><p>  Almost everyone concludes an agreement with a provider in order to receive digital television service.  For long-running and fairly powerful companies, a set of equipment is supplied to the user, as, for example, for Rostelecom.  However, almost all providers do not satisfy the customer on the day of contact.  You need to wait a day or two, and if it is a remote place, then a week, not even one.  In order not to lose time, and digital television worked right away, you can make the initial setup yourself.  Literally everyone may need this knowledge and skill, even if you have to transfer the TV to another room or change it to a new one you just bought.  Therefore, everyone should understand the connection diagrams and tuning technologies. </p><p>  At the same "Rostelecom" this service is offered in two versions - together with the Internet ("Interactive 2.0") and a separate digital television ("Interactive TV").  The latter can only work on a router that belongs to the company, others will not work.  And the routers at Rostelecom are disgusting, that‚Äôs exactly what it says in all the reviews.  Therefore, it is better to choose 2.0, and if there is no other provider nearby, you will have to call technical support almost daily with the question: why does digital television not work during the day?  Version 2.0 cannot be independently connected; you still have to wait for technicians.  Settings with foreign equipment from Rostelecom do not match.  The user is lucky if there is another provider nearby and can connect him to his network. </p>

    <h2>  Situations </h2><p>  1. Care of the console from the normal mode.  This can happen if it is disconnected for a long time.  You just need to connect it to the network and not be scared of the inscription, which indicates that the DRE channel is encoded.  If you wait a couple of hours, the receiver will fully recover and all encoded channels will open. </p><p>  2. It may happen that the prefix (receiver) is not registered.  To eliminate this situation, you need to look at the identification number on the rear panel and enter it on the provider's website. </p><p>  3. Sometimes the antenna settings get lost.  Such cases are described above.  Here you will need the help of a specialist who will reactivate them. </p><p>  4. If the sign of a paid channel suddenly appears on the screen, you just need to pay for a subscription to the provider‚Äôs services, apparently, the user forgot to do it on time. </p><p>  5. Sometimes there are difficulties with software compatibility.  Some dexterity is needed here.  If the receiver is a GS-HD, you need to restore the list of channels in the menu (there is such a key).  And if it doesn‚Äôt work, on the remote control and on the receiver panel at the same time (this is the most important), you need to press two buttons - CHANNEL and TV / RADIO.  It is at the same time - with four fingers.  And then on the remote control press STANDBY.  And everything should be combined in the software. </p><p>  6. When the message ‚ÄúNo signal‚Äù appears on the screen, it‚Äôs worth looking for a solution to the problem with the antenna.  Much has been said about this above. </p><p>  7. Check cable.  If it does not help, call a specialist. </p>
