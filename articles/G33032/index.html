Traditional families and more technologically advanced modern models are segmented.  There are new modifications in which the weaknesses of the basic versions are finalized and various improvements are made. </p><p>  There is another, quite natural approach to upgrading successful devices.  It involves the development of existing models with a focus on today's requirements.  This is how the Canon EOS 600D camera appeared, created on the basis of the 550D family.  I must say that the version is only one of the options for an amateur model and represents the lower-level branch of the EOS line.  For example, the more advanced 7D is also on the market.  However, the technological design and internal content of the ‚Äú600 D‚Äù can impress even an experienced photographer. </p><h2>  Camera description </h2>

    <p>  The positioning of the model is rather ambiguous.  This is an amateur SLR, which has a fairly high option.  However, its place in the manufacturer‚Äôs line is difficult to determine.  On the one hand, the Canon 600D camera fits closely with the base 550D model and is very closely connected with the 60D modification, on the other hand, it can compete in some respects with the highest category that the 7D device represents. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To distinguish a model from the general series of EOS devices, its features help.  The camera has a rotatable display, an updated scenario mode, advanced settings for scene programs, new processing filters, the ability to change the aspect ratio, wireless control of an external flash and other differences.  In general, the Canon 600D SLR camera was designed with a bias towards ergonomic advantages.  This is evidenced by the rating system for rating images and improved on-screen prompts.  If we talk about the minuses, then the absence of a sensor under the viewfinder to turn off the monitor when the eye approaches the eyepiece will come to the fore. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2>

    <p>  In terms of filling and functionality, the device is not far from its predecessor, but there are significant differences in the form of new options.  It should be noted that the technical base has remained the same.  One way or another, if you need an amateur model with a universal range of tasks, then the Canon 600D camera, the characteristics of which are presented below, will adequately fulfill its functions: </p><ul><li>  The number of pixels of the CMOS matrix is ‚Äã‚Äã18.7 million. </li><li>  The size of the matrix module is 22.3 x 14.9 mm. </li><li>  The camera resolution is 5184x3456. </li><li>  Sensitivity ranges from 100 to 3,200 ISO. </li><li>  Flash - built-in type with coverage up to 13 m. </li><li>  The shooting speed is 3.7 frames per second. </li><li>  The number of pictures in a series is 6 in RAW format and 34 in JPEG. </li><li>  Camera viewfinder visibility - 95%. </li><li>  Screen - represented by a three-inch LCD display. </li><li>  Case dimensions - 13.3x10x8 cm. </li><li>  Mass - 515 g. </li></ul><p>  In addition to changes in the set of options, it is worth noting an increase in the dimensions of the device.  The model became heavier compared to the previous version and added in size.  But this is not critical, considering that the Canon 600D camera is positioned as an amateur device. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Controls and Ergonomics </h2>

    <p>  The model is not revolutionary in terms of design and selection of finishing materials.  The case is formed by plastic without any frills in the form of metal inserts.  The controls are not bad - all the levers, buttons and wheels operate precisely and without delay.  In general, in terms of management, it should be noted that this model is similar to the 550D version.  At least, those who used the Canon 600D camera talk about this. </p><p>  How to use this device, the question is not difficult, because the owner comes to the aid of a convenient handle with direct access to all necessary tools.  Traditionally, the top command dial is located above the shutter release button.  That is, you can work with the camera with one finger, transferring it from the wheel to the button and vice versa. </p><p>  The rotation of the disc with the choice of modes occurs with pleasant clicks and a clear fixation.  On the wheel fits 14 positions, but you can make new additions of modes.  The controls on the back are flattened and almost invisible buttons.  The dial itself and the functionality of the key correspond to the 550D configuration.  The top Av button is used to enter exposure compensation, and the control with the Q designation is located at the bottom. Using this button, you can put the monitor in quick selection mode, which also supports the Canon 600D camera.  The photo below shows the back panel of the model with its buttons. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Machine setting </h2><p>  All basic shooting settings are performed through the in-camera menu, which in its execution corresponds to all <span>standard</span> mirror-type <span>models</span> .  The menu is segmented into four columns, each of which has a highlight in its own color.  In particular, the photography menu is indicated in red, yellow - the basic settings, blue - viewing options, green - a special programmable section. </p><p>  The question of how to set up the Canon 600D camera from the point of view of peripheral lighting is solved using a special function that minimizes vignetting.  That is, the corners of the image are darkened, which ensures uniform brightness over the entire area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe frame. </p><p>  Also noteworthy is the item called ‚ÄúImage Style‚Äù, which presents 10 color styles for shooting.  The device provides a lot of different options, most of which may not be required.  For this case, a section of individual settings is provided, where you can display the most relevant functions. </p><h2>  Shooting settings </h2><p>  Switching shooting modes using the aforementioned disk.  There are also special creative PASM modes, as well as automatic exposure with sharpening in the A-DEP system.  In this case, the settings of the Canon 600D camera allow you to automatically select the optimal aperture for coverage of captured objects based on the analysis of information from autofocus sensors. </p><p>  The innovation of this camera is the "Intelligent Scenario Mode", which is indicated on the adjusting dial by the icon "A +".  Using this shooting format, the camera independently performs settings on a wide range, taking into account the external conditions and characteristics of the object. </p>

    <h2>  Photo Quality </h2><p>  By and large, the quality is not bad, even taking into account the brand origin of the model.  Accurate color reproduction and high detail are provided.  But much depends on the optical complement.  As its characteristics increase, the result of photography will also improve. </p><p>  It is worth noting the presence of <span>chromatic aberration.</span>  They are especially pronounced in the pictures that the Canon 600D camera takes in a wide-angle position.  They can be seen in the form of thin contours located on the borders of contrasting objects.  True, the effect of aberrations on the overall quality of the images is not so high that it can be attributed to the obvious disadvantages of the device.  Moreover, RAW format photographs can be edited in the future, eliminating defects. </p><h2>  Positive feedback about the model </h2>

    <p>  The workmanship of the model corresponds to the general level of the EOS line and, as most reviews show, does not disappoint.  Many users were pleasantly surprised by the high-resolution monitor, the precise reactions and the fast focus that the Canon 600D camera is equipped with. </p><p>  Video reviews are especially worth highlighting.  The device shoots with a resolution of 1920x1080, while the frequency is 30 frames.  During the recording process, consumers praised the ability to use digital zoom and connect filters with wind protection. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  In terms of shooting quality, there is almost no criticism, but there are claims to functionality.  For example, many users lack <span>a</span> face <span>proximity sensor</span> and an <span>image stabilizer.</span>  Also, there is no in-camera processing of RAW files with the ability to convert them to JPEG.  That is, there is no talk about the complete absence of editing, but nothing is offered besides applying art filters. </p><p>  According to some users, the contrast autofocus that the Canon 600D is equipped with is very slow.  The reviews note that he is uncertainly showing himself in the ‚Äúlive view‚Äù mode, although in general this option causes a positive impression among the owners of the model. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  The camera appeared against the background of the revision of the model line, but it cannot be said that it is distinguished by confident positioning.  Of course, this is not a budget model, but at least a representative of the middle class of amateur DSLRs.  But here, too, is not all clear.  The fact is that the Canon 600D camera was created with the expectation of increased ergonomics, but with a lack of professional functionality.  Despite this, the device provides decent shooting quality, close to a professional level, but with regard to ergonomic properties, it has some flaws. </p><p>  In any case, for fans of the EOS series, this option may become optimal, because its price is 30-32 thousand rubles.  far from the cost of expensive professional-grade devices. </p>
