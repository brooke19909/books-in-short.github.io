It is distinguished by the fact that one side covers the other, this is its difference with simple cuts. </p><p>  A classic option is the flange on the skirt in the middle seam.  Its main purpose is to create freedom of movement. </p><p>  You can use a ready-made pattern of your size from the fashion magazine Burda.  To do this, take measurements and choose a skirt pattern with the slot of the model that you liked.  Reshoot the finished pattern on the dashed lines of your size should be on the tracing paper.  And cut it out.  After that, you can start work. </p><h2>  Step 1: start </h2><p>  The processing of the slots on the skirt begins step by step.  First you need to lay out the pattern of the back panel, consisting of one part, on the fabric, and on it cut two halves of the same material.  Do not forget to add <span>to the seams, allowances</span> for cuts - 1.5 cm, and to the bottom of the product - 4 cm. A centimeter tape and tailor's chalk will help you with this.  When chalked parts with a single-cut slot, then they can be cut. </p><h2>  Step 2: basic work </h2><p>  How to <span>sew a straight skirt</span> taken from a magazine, and what is needed for this?  To do this, you need to perform tucks on the rear halves, grind them and iron them towards the back.  To maintain shape on the fabric in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe slots, adhesive material is attached with an iron. </p><p>  The allowance for the slots on the lower right part must be tucked on the wrong side, ironed and stitched with a 7 mm or 1 cm wide seam. Then, each half should be sewn on the side where the slot and the middle section are.  Then they need to be combined face to face and sweep between them, and where the slot is located - sweep it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="sewoverit.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sewing skirts with a slot" class="if uuid-2759460" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67695/2759460.jpg"></div><p>  The sheets must be sewn along the middle cut from the mark on top, which serves as a zipper, and to the mark where the path of the stitch is modified and it wraps to the side under the slot.  The seam is drawn obliquely to the middle seam of the skirt and until the end of the part of the left half.  Bars are placed at the beginning and end of the line.  On the right back half of the skirt, it is necessary to make a notch with scissors from the edge of the cut under the slot for 1 or 2 mm to the laid line. </p><h2>  Step 3: The Nuances </h2><p>  The completed middle seam must be ironed to the notch.  The edges of the slots on the wrong side should be ironed.  After this, two stitched panels must be turned on the front side and in the upper area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe slots on the left side, make a finishing stitch obliquely with two stitches at the beginning and at the end. </p><h2>  Step 4: sewing a skirt </h2><p>  On the cut-out front one-piece half of the skirt, it is necessary to overlay the sections, as well as grind the tucks.  It is necessary to sew the side seams and, on the middle seam at the top of the skirt, process the zipper. </p><h2>  Step 5: Finish </h2><p>  Processing the slots on the skirt is completed step by step with bending.  Such a sewing operation is performed in a simple manner.  The stock allowance is again turned away.  The lower part of the allowance skirt is processed on the overlock and is bent to the wrong side, which must be swept and ironed.  And then you need to make a finishing line on the bottom of the product.  When it was made on the bottom of the skirt, the stock allowance should be turned in its place and attached to the bottom of the product in the bending area with manual stitches. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="sewoverit.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a straight skirt" class="if uuid-2759424" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67695/2759424.jpg"></div><h2>  Additional operations </h2><p>  There are several ways to handle the slots on the skirt step by step, the lower turn upside down.
