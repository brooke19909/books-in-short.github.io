They face system crashes, software errors, and virus malware.  To ensure the safety of the device, it is necessary to constantly check and protect it. </p><p>  Many do not understand why advertising is popping up on Android.  How to remove it, they also do not know, because they did not find out the reason for its appearance. </p><h2>  Problem and Causes </h2><p>  So, you are faced with the fact that advertising pops up on the "Android".  You do not know how to remove it, but it becomes so intrusive that it is difficult to work with the device.  But here it is worth considering that advertising is an income for free programs, as well as for scammers. </p><p>  To cope with a problem, you need to find out the causes of its occurrence.  There may be several: </p><ul><li>  earnings programs; </li><li>  virus software; </li><li>  firmware. </li></ul><p>  Having found out why the advertisement on the "Android" pops up, it will not be difficult to remove it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fossbytes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ads on Android" class="if uuid-3009906" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3009906.jpg"></div><h2>  Why remove ads? </h2><p>  It is believed to harm the mobile device.  If the computer copes with it quickly and the system may not even pay attention to it, then the smartphone suffers from banners and other viruses. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Advertising is inconvenient for several reasons: </p><ul><li>  sizes </li><li>  braking; </li><li>  traffic </li><li>  viruses. </li></ul><p>  Of course, in some applications the ad banner is small.  Sometimes it is barely noticeable.  But in order for the advertisement to be clearly visible, the developers use large banners that sometimes cover the entire screen.  Naturally, this interferes with the operation of the device. </p><p>  As a rule, advertising can "steal" RAM and overload the processor.  That is why many programs can not even be launched, because there are not enough resources.  The phone starts to slow down and lag. </p><p>  Traffic is also an important issue.  The fact is that banner ads are often resource intensive.  Therefore, they pump information from the Internet, and accordingly, waste megabytes. </p><p>  Some banner ads have malicious scripts that can read personal data: passwords, credit card information and phone numbers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidauthority.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to remove ads" class="if uuid-3009907" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3009907.jpg"></div><h2>  Earnings programs </h2><p>  So, most often, ads can pop up due to the fact that free programs try to make money on users.  Of course, this does not apply to popular applications such as Google, Twitter, Viber, etc. </p><p>  Typically, ads are embedded in games, vpn services, simulators and more.  Sometimes there are small banners at the bottom of the screen.  They are almost invisible, so they do not interfere with the use of the device. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It also happens that a huge obsessive advertisement pops up on the Android.  You can remove it after the countdown appears on the screen.  It is enough to wait 5-10 seconds and click on the cross to close the banner. </p><p>  It used to be that shareware apps didn't have ads at all.  But now even in such programs there are banners.  Sometimes they allow developers to earn extra money. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sensorstechforum.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Promotional Notices" class="if uuid-3009910" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3009910.jpg"></div><h2>  Virus programs </h2><p>  If the ad constantly pops up on Android, you can remove it by checking the device for viruses. </p><p>  Using these banners, fraudsters earn money from users.  They do everything to ensure that the owner of the smartphone either clicks on advertising notifications or constantly sees them. </p><p>  But even if you‚Äôre used to the fact that ads are constantly appearing, you need to understand that especially dangerous viruses are involved in identity theft.  Therefore, it is urgent to rid the device of worms and trojans. </p><h2>  Firmware </h2><p>  The problem is often found in cheap Chinese smartphones.  Manufacturers, in addition to the operating system itself, often install a shell.  Sometimes it is of high quality and does not carry anything harmful.  But sometimes it contains programs that can run ads. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  At the same time, banners do not appear constantly, but only if certain applications are launched. </p><h2>  How to remove ads? </h2><p>  If the advertisement on ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù pops up in full screen, you can remove it by searching for files that could bring such troubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.washingtonpost.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Full Screen Advertising" class="if uuid-3009916" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3009916.jpg"></div><p>  In general, to get rid of banners, it is enough: </p><ul><li>  remove the corresponding program; </li><li>  install an anti-virus application; </li><li>  check the phone for malicious files; </li><li>  flashing the phone; </li><li>  reset to factory settings; </li><li>  Install the necessary security applications. </li></ul><h2>  Delete the corresponding program </h2><p>  So, if you understand that advertising appears because of a certain application, then simply remove it.  Of course, if this is your favorite game, you have to endure this state of things, because developers also need to eat.  But if there is some kind of program that you rarely use, it is better to erase it from memory. </p><p>  If we are talking about branded applications that were installed by the manufacturer of the smartphone, then most likely this option will not work, since usually they cannot be removed. </p><h2>  Install antivirus software </h2><p>  Many complain that the advertisement on the Android phone pops up.  You can remove it by installing an antivirus program. </p><p>  There are many such applications for smartphones.  And among them there are very popular ones: Dr.Web, ESET, AVG, Kaspersky.  Just choose the right one. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pcmag.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Antivirus software" class="if uuid-3009913" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3009913.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, such programs do not always guarantee a deep analysis of the system and the search for all virus files.  Sometimes they find only those that are on the surface.  Viruses from root directories can be cleaned either manually or by resetting the system to factory settings. </p><h2>  Check your phone for malicious files </h2><p>  First you need to view all the programs that are installed on the phone.  Perhaps the malware was accidentally installed, and it is quite simple to remove. </p><p>  Next, you need to check the "Administration" item in the settings.  If there are third-party programs in the list, you need to uncheck the boxes so as not to allow them to run in the background.  Even if we are talking about viruses, then in this case it will be possible to prevent them from starting automatically. </p><p>  It happens that a user finds a virus, deletes it, and it is automatically installed again.  This is due to the bootloader, which is located in the root directory of the system.  To calculate it, you need to use an antivirus program.  The program will indicate the path along which the bootloader hides.  Also, many recommend looking at the Android / data / app folder.  If you find third-party files, you need to clean it. </p><h2>  Reflash phone </h2><p>  Not everyone wants to use cardinal solutions.  When an advertisement pops up on Android, sometimes you can remove it only by replacing the firmware.  Typically, users want to save the data and configuration of the smartphone, but for some it does not matter.  The main thing is to get rid of banners.  Therefore, they decide to reflash the smartphone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theverge.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Climbs out advertising on a smartphone" class="if uuid-3009914" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3009914.jpg"></div><p>  And here it is worthwhile to understand that such a decision can lead to even more serious consequences than obtrusive advertising.  Firstly, this is due to the fact that the flashing process itself is not easy.  If an inexperienced user does this on his own, he can turn the device into a "brick", and then it will be difficult for him to do anything even for a professional. </p><p>  Secondly, finding firmware is not easy, especially on rare models of smartphones.  Most often, custom systems are posted on the forums, and this is another risk.  Thirdly, some firmware may have even more advertising, so you should carefully study the information and read reviews. </p><h2>  Reset to factory settings </h2><p>  In order not to be smart with the firmware, you can resort to another cardinal decision - reset to factory settings.  Many consider this method a panacea for all problems and not without reason.  Android is a system that is prone to frequent crashes.  It quickly picks up virus files and cannot cope with them on its own. </p><p>  Therefore, for many, the easiest solution is to reset.  If an advertisement comes out on Android, you can remove the notification through the Hard Reset function. </p><p>  This can be done through the settings.  It is also recommended that you create a backup copy that saves the configuration of the device.  You can also turn off your smartphone, and then hold down the volume up or power on button.  Thus it will turn out to go to a special menu. </p><h2>  Install Security Applications </h2><p>  Many do not understand why to struggle with the fact that advertising on Android started popping up.  How to remove it, they are not even interested.  In fact, the question is serious, since it noticeably slows down the system. </p><div class="photo" data-original="astana.gov.kz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Remove Ads" class="if uuid-3009915" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3009915.jpg"></div><p>  If you have never encountered such a problem, but worry that it can happen, you can protect yourself with the appropriate programs. </p><p>  First, when buying a phone in a store, they suggest installing appropriate software that blocks ads in principle.  And even in free applications, it may not appear at all. </p><p>  Secondly, you can install Adguard - ad blocker, or Mobiwol - firewall.  These are simple apps.  It‚Äôs easy enough to turn them on in the background to avoid the appearance of banners.  The only problem is that they do not indicate the path to the advertising files. </p><p>  Thirdly, you can download the same antivirus program.  He will find not only adware, but also malware.  Therefore, it will be even more useful than previous applications. </p>
