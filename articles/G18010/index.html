It is noteworthy that in the Law in the first place is the development of personality. </p><h2>  Learning Process Concept </h2><p>  The Russian Pedagogical Encyclopedia also explains what education is.  Here the concept is somewhat broader.  Education is a process of socialization, pedagogically organized and carried out in personal and public interests. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is education" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/371395.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Types of training </h2><p>  First of all, they share professional and general education.  In the latter case, it is assumed to obtain common knowledge, regardless of the future specialization of a person.  What is vocational education in this case?  By it is understood the learning process, oriented in its content to the needs and conditions of a particular specialization.  Of course, the general educational element is also part of this process.  A student in a specialized institution, along with a professional, receives a basic general education.  Even in the curriculum of the university there are some basic, general disciplines.  For example, they include philosophy, psychology, pedagogy, law, economics and others.  The Law gives the concept of specialized and general training programs.  They, along with educational standards, a system of institutions that implement them, governing bodies constitute the entire educational network in Russia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is secondary education" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/371394.jpg?1397143681876" width="500"></div>

It should be said that the training system has undergone significant changes throughout its entire existence.  Today in Russia, general education is divided into preschool, primary, general basic, and full secondary.  Along with this, specialized <span>forms of training</span> exist in parallel <span>.</span>  You can understand the difference between learning levels by looking at some definitions.  For example, what is pre-school education?  This is an activity, the <span>subject area of</span> which is the development, training, education of young children.  And what is <span>secondary education?</span>  This is the process of obtaining general knowledge aimed at the comprehensive development of children.  This level is between the initial and the highest level of knowledge.  Those who have completed secondary or vocational education have access to the next level.  After graduating from school, college or college, a person enters a university.  Further postgraduate studies (doctoral or postgraduate studies) may follow.  There are also optional forms of gaining knowledge.  What is additional education is not difficult to understand.  Optional forms include various optional subjects, interest groups, and adult courses providing advanced training.  Returning to the question of what secondary education is, it should be noted that it is this level that is considered by many teachers to be the foundation that allows the student to develop his abilities in accordance with his interests, while gaining basic knowledge. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is a municipality" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/371393.jpg?1397143716022"></div>

To ensure the highest quality learning process, there are various institutions.  Young children receive primary education in Kindergarten.  These include nurseries, kindergartens.  However, it should be noted that, due to the fact that they are not able to reach all children today, the main responsibility for ensuring the primary education of the child lies with the family.  The next step is the school.  This institution provides <span>primary general, basic</span> or complete education for children.

    <h2>  Specialized, higher educational institutions </h2><p>  In Russia, there are vocational institutions and schools.  The educational process in institutions is aimed at obtaining a student's basic general knowledge in certain specialties.  Citizens receive <span>secondary vocational</span> education in colleges and other similar institutions.  Universities offer full-time and evening studies.  In these institutions, students receive higher education in accordance with the chosen specialization.  There are also educational institutions for additional education for children and adults. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is vocational education" class="if" height="214" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/371397.jpg?1397143745341" width="300"></div>

    <h2>  Forms of the pedagogical process </h2><p>  Citizens receive education, both higher and secondary, mainly in daytime classes.  Along with this, there is an evening form of training.  A relatively new is considered an extern.  This form of training involves the independent study of certain subjects with the subsequent passing of exams.  Today, unlike in previous years, access to external studies has been significantly expanded.  Extramural education is very popular.  It is noteworthy that every year the number of correspondence students is increasing.  This indicates the interest of citizens in obtaining higher education.  Interest is shown not only by school graduates, but also by the working part of youth.  At the same time, many seek to get a second higher education.  <span>Distance learning is also</span> gaining popularity <span>.</span>  To obtain knowledge, computer technologies, satellite television, and the Internet are used in this way.  The spread of distance learning is mainly due to the computerization of pedagogical institutions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is additional education" class="if" height="312" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/371396.jpg?1397143771595" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Mandatory, varied learning process </h2><p>  The variability of education should be understood as the ability of the learning process to match the capabilities and abilities of different groups of students and the personal characteristics of each.  For the Russian <span>pedagogical system,</span> this trend is considered one of the main.  Another direction, being the opposite, but at the same time inextricably linked with the first, is <span>the standardization of the</span> pedagogical process.  As part of this topic, the educational process in state and non-state educational institutions is considered.  Speaking of this, it is necessary to determine what a municipality is.  This definition should be understood as a free form of education in state educational institutions. </p><h2>  Pedagogy problems </h2><p>  There is a single state standard - the level of necessary knowledge that a student should receive in the process.  Recently, it has often been said that the Russian education system is experiencing serious problems.  This is explained by the influence of demographic reforms carried out in the country.  However, these statements have no ground beneath them.  According to statistics, recently the level of education has not only not decreased, but, on the contrary, has grown.  This suggests that such a municipal entity that exists in Russia is a clearly organized pedagogical system.  Of course, some educational institutions replaced others, and this process continues today.  For example, with the development of industry, more skilled workers are required.  In this regard, secondary and higher specialized education is becoming increasingly popular today. </p>
