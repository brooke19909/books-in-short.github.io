Seliger Lake on the map of Russia stands out for its impressive size and bizarre form, which it owes its glacial origin.  The wide water area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe reaches located among the ridges and spurs of the Valdai Upland is connected by small narrow channels.  There are 160 islands on the lake with different terrain.  110 tributaries flow into Seliger, and only the Selizharovka River flows. <br>  Among the 24 reaches, the largest are Ostashkovsky, Selizharovsky, Polnovsky, Troitsky, Kravotynsky and Sosnitsky.  The largest and most beautiful island on the lake is Khachin.  Inland lakes spread among wooded hills give it special picturesqueness.  Quite impressive sizes also distinguish the islands of Klichen, Gorodomlya, Skrebel, Bolshoi Kolodny.

Known as the Sereger in those days, it was often part of fairly lively Novgorodian routes.  The name Seliger received the lake from the ancient Finns, who were the first inhabitants of the region, and translated from their language was interpreted as ‚Äúa rugged lake‚Äù, ‚Äúa transparent lake‚Äù. </p>

The description also states that the Selizharovka River originates from Lake Selizharova, mentions the source of the Volga, the current ‚Äúbetween Lake Selizharova and Lake Toropa‚Äù.  Maps of those times were notable for significant deviations.  In outlines remotely resembling the current ones, Lake Seliger on the map of Russia appears only in the 18th century.  A more accurate map can already be seen in the Atlas of 1745 <strong>.</strong>

Ya. E. Sivers, Novgorod Governor-General, wanted to start its practical implementation.  The energetic administrator offered Catherine II all kinds of projects for new constructions in the province, which included the connection of the area where Lake Seliger is located, <strong></strong>  with Ilmen and the Baltic.

In 1814, the first Russian geographer N. Ya. Ozeretskovsky visited here.  Later he wrote a book that arouses considerable interest among readers and today - "Journey to Lake Seliger." </p><p>  The first scientific study of the Valdai Upland, where Lake Seliger is located, in 1894-1895.  was carried out by D. N. Anuchin, who is considered the father of Russian lake science (limnology).  He did a tremendous job.  The widths and depths of the local rivers and lakes were measured, and the water temperature and flow velocity were determined.  To compile a bathymetric map of the depths of the lake system, over 8 thousand measurements from the boat were carried out using a lot.  It is worth noting that the scientist‚Äôs research is still considered the most fundamental work on the Seliger region. </p><h2>  "Seligersky round the world" </h2><p>  The territory of the Seliger Territory extends for 80 km from north to south and more than 50 km from west to east.  There are no beautiful places here.  Once you visit the edge of lakes, forests and swamps, you realize that you want to return here more than once.  And each time you will discover places unknown to yourself.  Seliger is very popular among tourists, for whom a lot of interesting <span>water trips</span> have been developed for numerous <span>bright lakes</span> and shady rivers, wide reaches and narrow channels, with relaxation in calm picturesque bays and convenient bays.  No wonder the lake Seliger is called the pearl of central Russia.  On the map with the water routes presented, anyone who wants to go to the ‚ÄúSeliger Circum World‚Äù will be given the opportunity to independently choose the most interesting trekking options with all kinds of branches.  Along the coastline, surrounded by beautiful spruce and pine forests, there are cozy hotels, pensions and tourist centers with well-developed infrastructure. </p>

Here, southwest of the village of Kartun, is <span>Silver Lake.</span>  Seliger in its water system does not have a lake under that name.  Its exact name is Troyan (you can often hear the Shaking).  It got the name Silver because of the white sand at the bottom and the high content of silver ions in the water, due to which healing properties are attributed to it.  There is a tradition that the lake was so called because of the chests of silver that the rebel Martha Posadnitsa preferred to drown than giving Ivan III after depriving him of the privileges of self-government in Novgorod land in 1478.

    <h2>  The source of the Volga river </h2><p>  The cradle of the great river has long been considered a holy place.  Here, by decree of Alexei Mikhailovich, the Transfiguration of the Desert was opened in 1649.  St. Nicholas and Transfiguration Churches, located at the source, are the basis of the revived Olginsky monastery. </p><h2>  Museums in the Seliger Region </h2><p>  In the village of Rogozh, there is the Museum of Nature of the Seliger Region, housed in the former Transfiguration Church.  Here you can get acquainted with colorful dioramas of natural landscapes, animal bio-groups, the incredibly rich underwater world of the lake and rare, endangered species of animals. </p><p>  Noteworthy is one of the rather distinctive cities of Russia - Ostashkov.

This architectural building by Alexander Golod, according to the author himself, is a source of ionizing radiation that can affect the thickness of the ozone layer of the atmosphere and activate the processes of biocenosis in the environment. </p><h2>  Holidays on the lakes </h2><p>  Holidays in the bosom of the pristine nature of central Russia, where Lake Seliger is located, has always been popular.  The modern infrastructure of tourist complexes, along with unusual landscapes consisting of a smooth surface and fancy coastlines, picturesque bays and reaches, attract tourists from all over the world.  The nature of the region is the greatest miracle created by the best architect, who is the Earth itself. </p>
