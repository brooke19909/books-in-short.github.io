    <p>  The city of Heraklion is the capital of the island.  According to historians, about 2.5 thousand years ago there were already settlements here.  In confirmation of this, it is worth visiting the ancient palace of Knossos, which is one of the most ancient buildings indicating that there was a civilization.  In the old part of Heraklion you can visit the church of St. Mark, visit the Venetian fortress, Loggia and admire the Morozini fountain.  Also in the modern capital are open restaurants, bars and discos.  If you want to relax, be sure to use this information.  Only 6 km from the city center is the modest but very cozy Minos Village Karteros Hotel 3. It is often chosen by those tourists who do not want to spend too much on expensive accommodation: it is important for them to get acquainted with the history of Crete, to visit the sights. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Short hotel description </h2><p>  Hotel <strong> </strong>  located a few kilometers from the central airport, on the seafront, in the picturesque town of Karteros.  Sometimes you can find the old name of the hotel - Minos Bay Karteros. <strong> </strong>  The innkeeper named Minos called the "brainchild" in his honor.  But more recently, the hotel began to be called in a new way.  Now it is called Minos Village Karteros Hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="karteros hotel 3 reviews" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21922/525929.jpg" width="572"></div>

    <p>  Breakfast is a bit monotonous, so the dishes quickly get boring.  However, for many tourists the assortment is not satisfactory: ham and cheese, Greek salad and pizza, tea, coffee, juice, milk and delicious homemade cakes.  Yogurt, fruit and eggs are rarely served for breakfast.  For dinner, the menu is more extensive.  They offer meat and fish, vegetables and fruits, everything is delicious.  You can order eggplant with feta, kebabs, potato and meat casseroles, side dishes, original salads.  There are several Cretan dishes.  Dessert is not provided. </p><p>  On the territory of Karteros Hotel 3 <strong> </strong>  There is a bar and a restaurant.  The menu here is extensive, dominated by European and Greek cuisine.  If one of the visitors follows a special diet, they will certainly be offered dishes suitable for his nutrition system.  The restaurant has 2 rooms: open (near the pool) and indoor. </p><h2>  Entertainment for adults and children </h2><p>  At Karteros Hotel <strong> </strong>  There is a multi-level pool, divided into several sections with different depths. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="minos village karteros hotel" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21922/525526.jpg" width="550"></div>  Adults and children can swim here.  Sun loungers are installed near the pool (free), you can ask for an umbrella (they do not require additional payment).  As for entertainment on site, you can advise to visit the billiard room or play ping pong.  Children spend time in the playground.  The hotel is convenient in that it is located near the capital, where you can take a bus (stop nearby) or a rented car.

    <p>  Be sure to walk towards Heraklion.  On the way there are taverns, shops, and a pastry shop where they offer delicious pastries.  But the most interesting thing is that nearby there is a stable where you can ride horses. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  The distance to the beach does not exceed 150 m. The coastal territory borders on other resort areas.  The closest "neighbor" of Karteros Hotel is Amnisos, a popular destination for beach holidays for many tourists.  <span>The seashore is</span> covered mainly with fine golden sand with pebble inclusions.  Umbrellas and sunbeds are available at an additional cost. </p><p>  The road leading to the beach is located to the left of the hotel.  In the season until 17.30 on the coast there is always a lifeguard on duty.  The entrance to the sea is sand and pebble, but sometimes stones come across.  Depth increases gradually, you can swim wherever you like.  It will not be very comfortable for parents with children.  The sea is often hectic, with high waves, which is why swimming with kids is problematic. </p><p>  Depending on the height of the waves, duty officers hang out a green, orange or red flag.  So vacationers can independently assess the degree of danger to themselves. </p><h2>  Sightseeing vacation </h2><p>  Sightseeing tickets are best purchased on Heraklion's seafront.  For example, a trip to Santorini will cost 100 euros (for tour operators it is much more expensive).  You can independently go by car towards the southern coast, visit the Gulf of Elounda and Lake Kournas.  If you choose a walk in Heraklion, then you are lucky enough to see a beautiful church in the rock.  An interesting excursion should be added to a visit to the Cretan evening and the Butari winery. </p><p>  If you rent a car, then in a couple of days you can visit Knossos and the fortress in Rethymnon on your own, see the cave of Zeus (which, according to legend, was born on Crete) and visit the oceanarium. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="karteros crete" class="if" height="441" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21922/525939.jpg" width="546"></div>

    <p>  Tired of endless walks along the coast, drop by a cozy <span>Greek cafe</span> where you will be treated to amazing coffee.  There are many traditional taverns on the waterfront.  Be sure to order a lunch or dinner in the Greek style, feel the hospitality and kindness of the locals. </p><h2>  Hotel Benefits </h2><p>  The most important thing to pay attention to is the opinion of tourists who have already visited Karteros Hotel 3. Reviews, of course, are the subjective opinion of different people, but if there are a lot of them, you can make up a certain idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe rest.  You need to pay attention to the advantages of the hotel and its disadvantages.  True, always try on a situation for yourself, because someone may be too critical, while others, on the contrary, do not present any special requirements. </p><p>  So, the advantages of the Karteros Hotel 3. Tourists highlight the following: </p><ul><li>  Spacious and comfortable rooms.  There is everything you need for a comfortable stay.  Always clean, regularly cleaned. </li><li>  Well maintained and comfortable area.  Neat houses, decorated with modern materials, there are quality double-glazed windows. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="karteros hotel 3" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21922/525904.jpg" width="568"></div></li><li>  Normal nutrition  Quite varied and tasty, there is a lot of food. </li><li>  Polite and helpful staff.  They speak Greek and English.  Tourists note that even basic knowledge of a foreign language will easily explain to the maid, waitress or girl at the reception what you need.  There is a hotel guide that will always help you find an interesting tour and tell you a lot about your country. </li><li>  Nearby are bus stops, from where transport to different parts of Crete diverges.  A convenient bus timetable has been drawn up, the fare is from EUR 1.5. </li><li>  Comfortable and clean beach.  There is a fresh water shower, a small shop and toilets.  There is a cafe and bar where you can always order refreshing, tonic drinks and listen to pleasant music. </li><li>  Nearby are open taverns where the cost of food is quite adequate, the staff is friendly, always deliciously fed.  Note to parents with children: there is a cafe very close to the bus stop where a children's menu is provided and the atmosphere inside is thought out especially for young visitors. </li></ul><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  If you are looking for a budget hotel like Karteros 3, <strong> </strong>  Be prepared for what unpleasant surprises can expect.  Whether or not to pay attention to them is your own business.  But it is better to immediately know what awaits you, so as not to be upset upon arrival.  So, what our tourists do not like: </p><ul><li>  Lack of entertainment.  Frankly, barbecue evenings are extremely rare.  You have to figure out where to go and what to do yourself.  Even the pool closes at 18.00, so you can‚Äôt even dream of any evening swimming with light. </li><li>  The range of dishes is not rich. </li><li>  The furniture in the rooms is not always new.  Plumbing also requires replacement with a more modern and new one.  In general, you can adapt, but to someone it may seem a significant drawback. </li><li>  Lack of entertainment nearby.  I have to go to Heraklion.  Nothing to be surprised at, since Karteros Hotel 3 <strong> </strong>  - An ordinary hotel located in the suburbs of the capital.  If you like a calm and relaxing holiday, then this place is quite suitable. </li></ul><p>  So, we tried to tell as much as possible about the hotel, highlight its advantages and disadvantages, describe the rules of accommodation and more.  We hope that our article will help you make the right decision! </p>
