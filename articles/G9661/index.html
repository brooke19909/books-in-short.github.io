    <p>  Today there are thousands of options for making interesting and useful gifts for this holiday.  Consider a few ideas that can be easily and simply implemented.  It is curious that in the manufacture of these presents completely ordinary, improvised items are used. </p><h2>  Casket </h2><p>  A souvenir for March 8 with your own hands can be made in the form of a box using various techniques.  Such a gift will always find application.  Indeed, sometimes a cute box is not enough to put jewelry, jewelry or other little things into it.  In this case, an example of a box made using the crochet technique will be given.  Instead of the usual thread, material used by the very beloved needlewomen is used.  Namely - plastic strips.  This material is not afraid of moisture and easily takes the set shape.  Such a box will not break or stick.  So, it will last for many years, recalling your care and love. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Preparatory stage </h2><p>  Taking a plastic bag, we cut it so that in the end we get a ribbon 5 cm wide. For knitting, you need two such strips folded separately.  We combine a circular tape with another using a connecting node.  If you tie a thin wire into the ribbons, the product will firmly hold its shape.  Without its use, the box will be softer. </p><h2>  Making a box </h2><p>  So, we make a <span>gift for March 8 with our own hands</span> for mothers and grandmothers.  With a thick hook, you need to dial 8 air loops, then perform one in the form of a lift and return back along the chain with an ordinary column.  So dial 7 rows.  You should get a square that you need to tie with a single crochet.  In order for the walls of the box to have a smooth transition, it is better to slightly expand the canvas at the junction. </p><p>  To do this, in one loop of the base, you need to knit two columns.  After that, the walls are made of 4 rows in the same way.  If the product seems shallow, the quantity can be increased.  Here is a souvenir for March 8 with my own hands half ready, it remains to decorate it and make a lid.  Although this option can already be safely used as a basket for storing little things. </p><h2>  We make a cover for the box and decorate the product </h2><p>  The last row is performed by arches from air loops according to scheme 4 through 1 half-column.  Thus, the edge is formed on 3 sides.  If the option with a lid seems too complicated, you can not do it, but leave it as it is.  But if there is enough enthusiasm and strength, then we continue.  We knit the lid in two ways to choose from.  The easiest option is to make it flat.  Then remember how to knit the bottom and do the same.  There is a more complicated option, but also more interesting.  In one loop, we knit 6 columns.  Further according to the scheme: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  2 row - 2 loops in 1 base; </li><li>  3 - two double crochet, 1 tbsp.  with nak., two air p., 1 tbsp.  with nak.  Repeat 4 times. </li><li>  4 - three tbsp.  with nak., 1 tbsp.  with nak., 2 air.  item, 1 tbsp.  with nak., 1 tbsp.  with nak.  Repeat 4 times. </li><li>  5 - for a loop of the back wall we knit a crochet column. </li><li>  6 - arches from 4 air.  p. and 1 half-column.  Thus, we draw up all 4 sides. </li></ul><p>  Now, a souvenir by March 8 you need to connect with your own hands.  To do this, combine the base of the box with the lid and fix it with air loops to each other.  From the upper part of the side wall, where there are no arches, we knit 4 air.p.  So we go along the entire length of the side of the box.  We fix the last loop in the base sheet.  We knit the thread and cut it off. </p><p>  A souvenir by March 8 with your own hands can be additionally decorated with beads, pebbles, ribbons and other elements.  This gift will look very nice on the <span>dressing table</span> in front of the mirror. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="March 8 do it yourself" class="if" height="258" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/799017.jpg" width="496"></div></h2><h2>  Casket of bottles: what is needed? </h2><p>  How else can I make a <span>gift for mom</span> on March 8 with my own hands?  For example, you can make a box of plastic bottles.  It can be similar to the previous design box or casket.  You will need: 6 bottles of plastic, corrugated or any decorative paper, hole punch, hook, thread, scissors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself gifts for March 8" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/797857.jpg" width="333"></div></h2><h2>  Manufacture </h2><p>  We make a gift for March 8 with our own hands as follows.  First you need to cut off all the tops and bottoms of the bottles.  Having received cylinders of the same size, we fold them in half and cut them.  We make the same size paper blanks.  We take two plates and fold inward inward.  Between them we put paper, and fix on the edges with the help of paper clips. </p>

    <p>  Next, a hole punch is taken for work.  On the perimeter of each workpiece, you need to make holes with the same interval.  For simplicity, a hole punch is best used on one side only.  So you need to pierce all the elements necessary in order to make a casket or box by March 8.  With your own hands, it is necessary to thread the thread into the outer hole and tie it with a loop.  Then, using a hook, we drive yarn into each hole and knit a crochet column.  By analogy, all workpieces intended for the product should be processed. </p>

    <p>  We have already made a practical souvenir by March 8 with our own hands.  Now you should combine all the details into a single whole.  In each loop of the bottom and walls we knit a regular column.  In the same way, you need to connect all the elements of the box.  We attach the lid at the last moment.  As in the previous embodiment, the product can be simplified.  That is, without a cover. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY gift for March 8 for mothers and grandmothers" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/797858.jpg" width="553"></div></h2><h2>  If you want more complicated .. </h2><p>  We also consider how to make a lockable structure.  Taking another workpiece, along its perimeter, several rows should be made with an ordinary column.  Then first skip a couple of loops, make a connecting seam with a knitting thread.  At the end of the row, also leave several air loops free.  In order for the box to close firmly, you need to consider a lock or clasp.  In our case, these will be ties from the used thread.  In the center of the bottom from the outside, we knit the base.  From its middle we make so many air loops so that the segment reaches the lid with a hike.  We also perform a tie at the top.  At the ends, you can attach beads or tassels from the same thread.  The ties will help keep the box closed so that small objects do not fall out of it.  So, a souvenir made by March 8 is ready.  Now you can give it. </p><h2>  Trinket </h2>

    <p>  There are many ways to surprise your loved ones for a holiday.  Consider a few more useful gizmos that will please their owners.  How to make a gift for March 8 with your own hands?  Now we will tell on an example of a keychain.  For this purpose, an old leather bag, gloves or any haberdashery, as well as a piece of natural fur, are suitable.  A strong thread and a thick needle are useful for joining.  A key ring will be used for fastening.  It is also necessary to prepare scissors. </p><p>  How to make a gift for March 8 with your own hands?  Now consider.  A small piece of fur must be sewn along the edges with the fleecy side inward, be sure to leave holes so that it can be turned on the face.  We sew a piece of leather in the form of a rectangle in a similar way.  We twist and get a fur element and a small strap.  We immediately put the last one on the key ring, which now you don‚Äôt have to look for in the bag for a long time, thanks to the attached gift on March 8th.  With your own hands, you need to cut out an additional rectangle from a larger skin, sew it in the same way, only immediately embedding the prepared strap.  You get a bag with a loop on the ring.  Its edges are tucked inward.  The base of the fur blank should be tightly bandaged with a thread and put into a leather bag.  From above it is necessary to fix these two elements with a line, which can be hidden with the help of decorative elements.  Rhinestones, beads, beads, etc. are suitable. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  We examined how to make interesting gifts on March 8 with our own hands.  The master classes that are presented in the article will help to create beautiful products. </p><p>  March 8 is a great occasion to give such things to friends, mothers, grandmothers and sisters.  After all, when a gift is made with your own hands, its value for loved ones immediately increases.  In its manufacture, man puts his soul. </p>
