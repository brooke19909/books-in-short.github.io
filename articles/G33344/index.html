Often enough just desire.  With simple patches of fabric, you can create stylish accessories for your home interior.  After all, things created with their own hands, firstly, save the family budget, and secondly, they look much nicer, because a piece of the master‚Äôs love is enclosed in them. </p><p>  Pillows have long been used not only for sleep, but as an interior decor.  They can be scattered on the couch, near the fireplace, laid out on chairs.  Many people use the word ‚Äúpillow‚Äù to draw a picture of an ordinary square or rectangular thing stuffed with filler and a pillowcase on top.  But this has long been wrong.  In the same article, we will talk about completely different pillows, beautiful and stylish decor elements. </p><p>  It can be knitted, knitted from wool, and also sew with your own hands.  A felt pillow made in the form of some kind of animal, toy car or cartoon character is able to revive a nursery. </p><div class="photo" data-original="madeit.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dog pillow" class="if uuid-3172838" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/126645/3172838.jpg"></div><h2>  Materials for the manufacture </h2><p>  To create a pillow made of felt with your own hands you will need: </p><ul><li>  Felt in various colors and thicknesses. </li><li>  Needles. </li><li>  Threads in tone felt. </li><li>  Scissors. </li><li>  Pillow pattern. </li><li>  Self-disappearing marker. </li><li>  Filler (synthetic winterizer, synthetic winterizer). </li></ul><p>  You will also need a couple of hours of free time and inspiration. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About felt </h2><p>  This is a fairly versatile material.  From it sew Christmas toys, dolls, cases for phones and tablets.  A huge plus of felt, in comparison with ordinary fabrics, is that its edges do not crumble when cut.  It is great for sewing pillows.  As a rule, felt is sold in sheets of 20x30 cm in size (it can vary in size both up and down).  Its thickness is from 0.5 mm to 4 mm.  The structure is hard or soft.  May have different compositions.  It is better to sew a pillow from felt with your own hands from soft material, and make all applications from hard. </p><p>  On the shelves of shops you can find felt from different manufacturing countries - these are China, Korea, Spain, America and others.  The choice of material for the manufacture of pillows must be approached with complete seriousness, since not only the appearance of the product, but also the health of the child will depend on this. </p><h2>  Manufacturing countries of felt </h2><p>  Chinese felt among needlewomen is not in great demand due to poor quality: spools quickly appear, and it is rather loose, often pulling the segment in different directions, it can break.  Of all the above, Chinese is the cheapest.  It is he who can most often be seen on the shelves of small needlework stores.  When sewing, if you place the thread close to the edge, it can break through the felt fibers.  Its only advantage is the price. </p><p>  South Korean felt is slightly more expensive than Chinese, but much better than it.  He does not fluff at work, more dense, unlike the Chinese.  In Russia it is considered the most bought among needlewomen.  At a cost more expensive than Chinese.  Korean felt is 100% eco-polyester, therefore it is hypoallergenic.  It is made from recycled plastic bottles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Spanish felt is more expensive than the previous two.  Available in several variations - woolen, half-woolen, polyester.  Pleasant to the touch.  Here it is necessary to approach the choice very carefully, since felt containing wool can cause allergies in children and adults. </p><p>  American is available in the following variations: half-woolen and polyester.  It is very soft, pleasant to work with.  The heart of many needlewomen belongs to him.  The cost is very expensive.  But those craftswomen who at least once tried American felt in business, no longer work with any other kind. </p><h2>  Pillow Design Ideas </h2><p>  The product can be decorated with flowers, inscriptions.  For a children's room, the pillow design in the form of cute pets - dogs, cats, pigs - will be quite relevant.  With a child, you can even do extra while playing with a pillow.  For example, if there is an application of a pig on it, then you can ask the child what sounds he makes.  Then you can ask the baby to show the nose, mouth, eyes and ears of the animal. </p><p>  So, for example, you wanted to sew a pill from a felt pig.  This can be done in two ways - it will be round, in the shape of a head, with ears sewn on top.  Eyes and a patch will be sewn in the form of applications or you can embroider them with thread.  Another option - on a pillow of a square or rectangular shape, just an applique in the form of a cute pig will flaunt.  By the complexity of manufacturing, they are approximately equal. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pillow Pig" class="if uuid-3172754" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/126645/3172754.jpg"></div><h2>  Pillow sewing steps </h2><p>  For example, take the easiest to manufacture - with an application.  Let's say this is a cat pillow made of felt, or, for example, an owl.  First you need a pattern.  It can be found on various sites devoted to needlework, you can also do it yourself. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="felt cat pillow" class="if uuid-3172767" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/126645/3172767.jpg"></div><p>  For the basics, it is better to take a thick felt.  From such material, the pillow will last longer.  Application can be done with thinner felt.  On it with a self-disappearing marker, you need to circle the pattern, then cut it along the contour.  First, details of the future pig are sewn onto one side of the pillow, and only then two parts are sewn together.  Then it needs to be filled through an un sewn edge.  And only then flash it to the end.  It is possible to process edges both manually, and on the sewing machine.  If necessary, small parts that are uncomfortable to sew on are glued. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="owl pillow pattern" class="if uuid-3178500" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/126645/3178500.jpg"></div><h2>  Educational felt pillows </h2><p>  They are sewn by analogy with children's books.  Now these pillows are gaining immense popularity.  After all, every mother wants her child to develop correctly. </p><p>  It is a seemingly ordinary pillow, but with various developing or removable elements.  It is possible to sew on it lightnings, buttons, lacing and other details with which it will be interesting to play a small child.  The kid will be interested in bright elements, and mom will have an extra five minutes of free time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="seniorcareshop.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Developing pillow" class="if uuid-3172841" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/126645/3172841.jpg"></div><h2>  DIY felt pillow letters </h2><p>  They became popular not so long ago, but have already gained worldwide popularity.  They are used not only as an interior decor, but also at photo shoots.  Also, such a pillow can be a great birthday present for a baby.  She will fit well into any interior. </p><p>  The question of how to sew a decorative pillow is solved quite simply.  First you need to draw a pattern on paper.  Then circle her on felt.  There should be two details.  Sew them together with a buttonhole (or with a sewing machine).  When the letter is almost all sewn up, it must be filled with filler and finished to the end.  By the way, before stitching two parts together, one of the sides can be pre-decorated with any application. </p><p>  As a rule, only the first letter of the name is sewn.  You can, of course, sew a whole word - it all depends on the imagination of the master, on the amount of materials available and free time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="letter A from felt" class="if uuid-3172805" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/126645/3172805.jpg"></div><h2>  Pillow care </h2><p>  First of all, you need to periodically clean them with a sticky roller for clothes and dust off.  After hand-made felt pillows were placed in the interior, after a while they can get dirty. </p><div class="photo" data-original="silviomessina.pw" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Felt pillow with applique" class="if uuid-3172747" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/126645/3172747.jpg"></div><p>  If the pollution is quite strong, then you need to rub the stain with a damp cloth (without alcohol).  If this method does not help, then, in extreme cases, you can wash the pillow with baby soap.  To do this, gently soap the place of contamination and rub it with your hands.  You can also use a dishwashing detergent.  Rinse thoroughly with running water.  Dry in a horizontal position. </p>
