All the talk about annoying interviewers, annoyed by the paparazzi and the burdens of popularity, although they are based on, are largely caused by the desire to flirt.  The loss of recognition is perceived by artists, musicians, artists and even politicians as a personal tragedy.  Even the most famous person in the world can be forgotten by everyone if he does not make efforts to maintain his fame. </p>

    <h2>  Different countries - different celebrities </h2><p>  To determine the degree of recognition of the image of a particular person, you can conduct a simple experiment.  It is enough to take a few photos and walk with them along the streets of the largest years of the world, asking random passers-by about whether they know who is depicted on them.  In this case, it will certainly become clear that not in all countries the top of the most famous people in the world will be the same.  For example, in most European countries they love A.P. Chekhov and P.I. Tchaikovsky, but they are unlikely to recognize the kings of the Spanish bullfighting or famous baseball players.  The reaction of the Americans in the photo of <span>Judy Garland,</span> who played the main role in the cult film ‚ÄúThe Wizard of Oz‚Äù, will most likely be an attempt to sing at least a couplet from the song ‚ÄúSomewhere Over the Rainbow‚Äù, but in sunny Kyrgyzstan they may be asked who it is . </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Glory and Information </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="top most famous people in the world" class="if" height="434" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10920/366054.jpg?1396539880256" width="533"></div></h2><p>  The number of celebrities has become truly huge in connection with the emergence and improvement over the past century of the media and technical means designed to replicate and distribute images - both static (photo) and moving (video).  In parallel with the increase in the informational saturation of society, the development of other scientific and technical areas that were directly related to technologies for raising the level of fame took place.  Today, the most famous person in the world is the one (or one) whose image most often appears on TVs and computer monitors. </p><h2>  How to determine popularity? </h2><p>  The heroes of decades were film actors, musicians, astronauts, politicians, revolutionaries, writers and scientists.  On a globe full of information communications, today there are few who do not remember Gagarin‚Äôs smiles, Stalin's mustache and pipe, Churchill‚Äôs cigar, Hitler‚Äôs fringe or Lenin‚Äôs squint.  After seeing the image of JF Kennedy, Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, John Lennon, Salvador Dali or Albert Einstein, almost every representative of any civilized country will easily name their name.  It is difficult to determine which of them is the most famous person in the world, and by what criteria it can be calculated.  There is only one thing left - to compile a list of celebrities in various nominations, and already within the framework of some direction, determine the degree of their popularity by objective indicators.  The principle of systematization can be different, for example, chronological or taking into account the nature of the activities of famous people. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  The most famous writer ... </h2><p>  <span>Ernest Hemingway</span> is the most famous man among writers who ever lived.  His appearance became an example of what a modern writer should look like, and spawned a huge number of imitators who grew a beard and lit a pipe.  Images of the famous novelist and novelist have become part of the interior of most of the apartments of Soviet intellectuals since the 60s, symbolizing the progressive views and a certain degree of free-thinking.  Hemingway is really a wonderful writer, although there were others who wrote no worse, but were much less famous. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="who is the most famous person in the world" class="if" height="312" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10920/366081.jpg?1396540053110" width="421"></div></h2><h2>  ... and the artist </h2><p>  Who today would recognize Repin, Surikov or Aivazovsky, or, for example, Rubens?  Art historians and just lovers of painting know their appearance mainly by self-portraits, while those who are not dedicated to the details of their biography, that is, the majority, would hardly have named them.  But Salvador Dali is the most famous person in the world among artists.  His image is recognizable, and the facts associated with his name continue to cause interest among the general public after so many years after the death of the painter.  It was not easy to achieve this, in addition to talent, it was necessary to perform a number of inexplicable acts, participate in many scandals and grow an outstanding mustache. </p>

    <h2>  Famous politicians </h2><p>  The image of a politician is important for his career.  The military tunic of Fidel Castro, the jacket of Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, the antennae and fringe of Adolf Hitler, the eyebrows of Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev, the speckled tie of Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov-Lenin and even Franklin Delano Roosevelt‚Äôs wheelchair immortalized the images of these figures.  At the same time, not every modern inhabitant of the planet will be able to remember the correct name of their posts, but, looking at the image, he will almost immediately give the name, approximate time of government and the country in which they reached power.  The same applies to Ernesto Che Guevara, whose beret has long become familiar with numerous posters and T-shirts.  Not inferior to him, and Chairman Mao.  We recognize their opponent, John Fitzgerald Kennedy.  It is difficult to determine who is the most famous person in the world among politicians, but it is clear that they were all ahead of <span>George Washington</span> and the inventor of the lightning rod, President Franklin, looking at us from the most commonly used dollar bills. </p><p>  Every year, popularity ratings are compiled among previously living and now living celebrities.  The list of "100 most famous people in the world" includes different people who were in full view or by ear for various reasons. </p>
