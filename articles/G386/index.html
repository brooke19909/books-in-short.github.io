    <h2>  About tablecloths </h2><p>  Before you understand the process of creating a tablecloth, it is worth noting that these products come in different types.  The tablecloth can be everyday, marching and festive.  What is the difference between these options?  The first type is an everyday tablecloth.  Its main purpose is to protect the table from various mechanical damage.  Sewing it is better from inexpensive, but very durable material.  Recently, Teflon coating on such a product, which is perfectly cleaned from contamination, has been very much appreciated.  Camping tablecloths are taken with them to nature or to the country.  Their purpose is to protect products from insects, as well as from pollution.  Therefore, sewing them is better than their dense materials, which are perfectly erased.  As for the holiday tablecloths, they can be made of any material that you like.  After all, their main purpose is to decorate the table, so they can be made of thin expensive fabric.  They are decorated with various ruffles, ribbons, etc. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew an oval tablecloth" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/349246.jpg?1394196866733" width="500"></div></h2><h2>  Festive tablecloth </h2><p>  If a woman wants to create tablecloths with her own hands, why not sew a festive version of such a product.  To do this, you will need fabric, ruffles for decoration, a sewing machine, as well as threads, scissors and other trifles needed by a seamstress.  First, prepare the foundation.  To do this, on the selected piece of fabric, it is necessary to note its dimensions, making allowances for seams on each side of about one and a half to two centimeters.  Everything is cut out, the edges are wrapped (if there is no overlock, you can process the edges using the ‚Äúzigzag‚Äù line on the sewing machine).  This is necessary so that the threads do not come out. </p><p>  Now you need to prepare the ruffles.  You can choose any width for them, for example 15 cm. The length must be calculated independently.  To do this, the dimensions of all four sides of the tablecloth are added up, and the result is multiplied by two.  This is necessary so that the ruffles do not just surround the tablecloth, but are slightly folded.  Having cut the desired strip, it must first be wrapped and tucked to the length of all sides of the tablecloth.  To do this, you can sew a stitch with long and weak stitches, departing from the top edge of the ruffle 5 mm, and pull it to the desired length, trying not to break the thread.  Beautifully distribute the assembly along the entire length of the product.  Now you can stitch the product.  To do this, two pieces (tablecloth and ruffles) can be swept away with each other (this should be done exclusively with white threads, despite the color of the tablecloth).  An experienced seamstress can immediately attach ruffles to the base on a sewing machine.  It remains to smooth the seam, iron the tablecloth, and you're done! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sew a tablecloth on a round table" class="if" height="408" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/351021.jpg?1394514926894" width="511"></div></h2><h2>  Round table </h2><p>  I also want to talk about how to sew a tablecloth on a round table.  Here, again, there may be several options.  It can be just a round tablecloth, the edges of which will fall beautifully, independently forming folds.  To do this, you need to measure the diameter of the countertop for which the tablecloth is being prepared, and determine how much you want to leave on the overhang.  The last digit, multiplied by two, is added with the first calculation.  It is important to remember that it is also necessary to leave about 2-3 cm on the folding of the tablecloth. </p><p>  Here, at first it is better to make a product pattern.  To do this, draw a quarter circle with the desired radius on paper (for this you can use a home-made compass from a pencil, button and cord).  Now, according to the pattern, you need to cut the tablecloth.  To do this, it is surrounded by chalk on the wrong side of the fabric, folded four times, and cut out.  The edges need to be wrapped, folded and stitched.  That's all, the product is ready. </p><p>  Another option is how to make round tablecloths with your own hands: it can be a base cut to the size of the tabletop and sewn to it with folds.  You need to prepare the base in the same way as in the previous version, but it does not hem, but only the edges are processed.  Next, you need to cut a strip for folds.  Its length will be at least two times greater <span>than the circumference of the</span> base, and a width of at least 30 cm. The bottom must be wrapped, tucked and stitched, from above the edges are only processed on the overlock.  Now on top you need to sew a line with long and weak stitches and make an assembly, or you can just make small folds that are fixed with a basting.  Next, the two parts of the tablecloth are sewn together, the seam is smoothed out, and the product is ironed (if you iron the tablecloth with an iron and steam, the chalk marks disappear, the product does not have to be washed). </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sew a tablecloth with your own hands" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/349240.jpg?1394196909571" width="340"></div></h2><h2>  On the oval table </h2><p>  I also want to tell you how to sew an oval tablecloth.  The principle of operation will be very similar to the previous one.  To do this, you need to prepare a pattern exactly to the <span>size of the countertop.</span>  To do this, the top of the table is redrawn on paper, while you need to add about 30-40 cm in an oval to the hanging product.  The pattern and fabric are folded four times and a tablecloth is cut out.  It is also important to consider allowances for bending the product.  After that, you need to process the edges of the tablecloth on the overlock and hem the product on a typewriter.  So that the tablecloth hangs well and drapes well, you can sew a thin cord into the hem, it will make the product heavier, which will give the corresponding effect. </p><h2>  Shreds </h2>

    <p>  You can create original and at the same time beautiful tablecloths with your own hands and in other ways.  So, we will talk about a product from shreds.  To do this, you need to determine the size of the desired thing and make patterns of shreds.  Pieces of about 20x20 cm look good. After calculating the required number of pieces, the shreds need to be cut, leaving 1.5 cm for allowances on each side.  It is important to overcast all the edges of the cut parts so that they do not crumble.  Now everything can be collected in a finished tablecloth.  Previously, it is better to sweep all the pieces together with white threads and look at the result.  If you like everything, you need to sew the product along the basting lines on a typewriter, smooth the seams.  But this is not all, if a woman wants to figure out how to sew durable tablecloths with her own hands.  In this option, you need a lining.  It can be one and a half to two centimeters smaller than the upper part.  In this case, at the end of sewing, you need to fold the tablecloth and lining with the wrong sides and fold the edge of the tablecloth so that the edge of the lining is under the hem.  But you can cut the lining to fit the top of the product.  Then the edges of the tablecloth along with the lining are sewn and processed with an <span>oblique inlay.</span>  The rag-cloth is ready! </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a tablecloth with your own hands" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/349243.jpg?1394196947760" width="362"></div></h2><h2>  For kitchen </h2><p>  I would also like to tell you how to sew a tablecloth with your own hands for the kitchen.  To do this, you need a printed fabric that is well washed.  Everything is done very simply and according to an already familiar pattern.  The product is cut out according to the size of the table, it is added about 30-40 cm for the overhang and a couple of centimeters for the hem.  After cutting, the edges are necessarily processed and hemmed on a sewing machine.  That's all, a simple and comfortable kitchen tablecloth is ready for use! </p><h2>  For the dining room </h2><p>  If you are going to create various tablecloths with your own hands, the seamstress must know how to make a tablecloth for the dining room with contrasting borders.  It looks very beautiful!  The base of the product is cut out in the same way as in the previous versions - the size of the countertop.  Now borders are being prepared.  It is necessary to carve four strips, the width of which will be approximately 30 cm. Now the product is sewn together: borders are sewn along the edges diagonally to make the tablecloth get the correct shape, and sew to the base.  Be sure to overlay and smooth the edges with an iron.  The bottom of the tablecloth can be tucked up and stitched or hemmed with a slanting inlay in tone or in a contrasting color. </p>
