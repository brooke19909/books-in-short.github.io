If you are looking for the perfect place to stay, be sure to come to the Sharm Cliff Resort.  Everyone will like it here! </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  In the center of the resort of Sharm El Sheikh, twenty kilometers from the airport (which has international status) and not far from the vibrant Naama Bay area, which has long been chosen by tourists, there is a <span>4 * Sharm Cliff Resort.</span>  This place abounds not only with hotels, but also with various shops and small shops where you can buy souvenirs for memory of yourself and loved ones, as well as taste local exotic dishes and fruits. </p>

    <p>  You can get to Naama Bay on foot (10-15 minutes of a leisurely walk along the busy avenue full of all sorts of tourist interests) and by bus, which runs from the hotel completely free of charge.  However, if you don‚Äôt feel like walking at all or waiting for the bus, you can order a taxi and get to the right place with comfort. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Sea and places for swimming </h2><p>  Most often, vacationers who come to the resort of Sharm El Sheikh are interested in local beaches near the Sharm Cliff Resort (4 stars).  <span>The charm of the hotel</span> lies in the presence of two beaches nearby at once. </p><p>  The first is the cozy little Wind beach ("Wind"), just a five-minute walk from the hotel.  The sea is shallow, and there are not too many corals at the bottom.  It is suitable for lovers of a quiet relaxing holiday.  There is both pleasant music and water activities. </p><p>  Hadaba (‚ÄúHadaba"), another more popular among swimming and outdoor activities, is located a little further - five kilometers away.  You can walk to the hotel from the hotel by going down the stairs to the shore, or take a special bus directly from the hotel.  The sea here is deeper, and the abundance of different marine life and corals is such that other <span>resorts in Egypt</span> can envy <span>.</span> </p>

The only thing worth remembering is that on this beach (this applies to any other beach in the Sharm El Sheikh resort), you need to wear special shoes because of the risk of cutting your feet on numerous corals.  This warning applies to all who came to rest in <span>Egypt, the Sharm</span> Cliff Resort 4 * <span>hotel</span> is no exception.  Believe me, everyone will like it here!

    <p>  If you decide to visit Sharm Cliff Resort 4 *, reviews from 2015-2016 will help in choosing the best place for this lesson.  For example, you can go on an excursion to a national park called Abu Galum. </p><p>  After traveling for about two hours in jeeps, tourists find themselves on an amazing golden beach, where clear water gives you the opportunity to admire the diversity of marine life.  There are colorful corals and vibrant tropical fish.  You can have lunch after swimming with fish.  Fresh and melting in the mouth, it is cooked directly with tourists.  And then, after riding about a month and a half on horseback, you can immerse yourself in one of the most popular Egyptian places for diving - the Blue Hole (aka Black Hole). </p><p>  If the tourist does not crave long trips and diving, but wants to enjoy fish and coral reefs, then he can safely go to the island called Tiran, which is so close to Sharm El Sheikh that it is even visible from the coast.  Although it will not be possible to land directly on it, a comfortable yacht brings tourists quite close.  If you rent snorkeling equipment, you can take a look at the world of the local coral reefs.  This place attracts tourists with its beauty and variety of underwater life. </p><p>  Guests of the 4 * Sharm Cliff Resort, who wish to visit world-famous sights in addition to the surroundings of Sharm El Sheikh during their holidays, have the opportunity to go on 1- and 2-day sightseeing tours to Cairo (where, among other things, you can see the legendary pyramids Giza), Israel or Jordan. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  If you are going to relax in a place like Sharm Cliff Resort 4 * hotel, reviews from tourists who have been there before can be very helpful.  For example, many people advise swimming at Hadaba beach, which is a little further from the hotel than Wind, but it is cleaner and ideal for observing the diversity of underwater life. </p>
