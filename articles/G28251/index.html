Design Ideas for Kids Photo Albums</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A photo album for a newborn, inscriptions in it, album design - all these are important points for perpetuating significant moments in a child‚Äôs life.  Of course, it is better to independently come up with a special album that will emphasize the personality of the baby, but not everyone can compose on the go.  Therefore, ideas for creating a photo album of a newborn can be gleaned in this article, which contains many interesting ideas.  To realize them is not difficult. </p><h2>  Album for a newborn: a necessity or a whim? </h2><p>  Probably every person, whether male or female, sooner or later think about the birth of their own child.  Preparations for becoming parents, thinking through their actions, redevelopment in the apartment to make room for the crib and other things of the baby ... All this takes a lot of energy, but at the same time it is something sacred and joyful.  After the birth of a child, it is not at all until an idle pastime.  It is necessary not only to always monitor the baby, protect him and take care, but also to continue to do household chores. </p><p>  And the child grows, learns something new, learns the world around him.  Of course, I don‚Äôt want to miss anything, capture the first smile, sweet dream, how I first turned upside down, feeding, games ... Over time, there are more and more photos, I don‚Äôt even remember which photo shows the first smile and which one says ‚Äúhe / she just cutie, I want to take a picture of that smile. "  That is why an album for a newborn is more a necessity than a privilege.  Especially in our time, when the storage of photographs in electronic format is so popular, it is difficult not to accidentally delete an important shot of the baby‚Äôs life.  Yes, no doubt, you can live peacefully without a children's photo album.  Only here there is no guarantee that the flash drive will not break, your account on social networks will not be hacked or deleted, the computer or laptop will work properly, and the phone will not fall from the cabinet and will not break.  Therefore, it is worth seriously approaching not only the creation of a photo album, but also its design. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="integra-gm.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The design of the pages of the photo album" class="if uuid-2291926" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72077/2291926.jpg"></div><h2>  Time interval selection </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsystudio.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Making a children's photo album" class="if uuid-2291974" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72077/2291974.jpg"></div><p>  An important period of time that I would like to cover in a children's photo album.  It is necessary to decide whether you will have an album in which pictures are from the first days to, for example, five years.  Or the name of your album is "Album for the newborn, the first year."  This will primarily affect the selection of photos that are planned to be placed on the album.  Secondly, the concept of the photo album as a whole may depend on this: cute photos, the series of which breaks off by blowing out candles on the first cake in your life, or a grimy kid on a tricycle will complete your children's album.  The main thing to remember is that for the first time the baby does a lot of things right up to a year: he opened his eyes, grabbed his hair, first smile, turned over on his tummy, got out the first tooth.  Very, very much happens for the first time.  And, accordingly, a lot of photos.  So that it doesn‚Äôt happen that you decide to make an album up to three years old, as a result, more than half of the album is ‚Äúup to a year old‚Äù, and then all the events are somehow crumpled (so that everything fits).  It‚Äôs better to make several albums than one, anyhow. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Photo album depending on the gender of the child </h2><p>  Of course, it is no secret to anyone that the design of an album for a newborn depends on the gender of the child.  Firstly, the color scheme is different.  Or you can pick up something in the style of "unisex".  Especially if you buy the basis for the album in advance.  It is not necessary to do in blue for boys and in pink for girls. </p><p>  Secondly, the decoration of the album for the newborn.  This refers to the separation of "girlish" and "boyish" attributes: soldiers or dolls, flowers or cars.  And in this case, you can choose the neutral option: everyone loves to play dice, balloons or bouncing balls. </p><h2>  Photo album for a girl </h2><p>  If you still decide that the design should match the gender of the child, then the album for the newborn girl will be significantly different from the album for the boy. </p><p>  Of course, for a greater emphasis on the child's field, it is necessary to choose more feminine colors: all shades of pink, purple, red, turquoise and green.  For decoration, you can buy special stickers with all kinds of dolls, ponies, <span>unicorns, rainbows,</span> animals.  Also, the acquisition of beads, rhinestones, sequins, pearls will not be superfluous. </p><p>  Each page can be decorated in the style of different fairy tales: birds, animals and gnomes are suitable for Snow White;  cooking utensils - for Belle from Beauty and the Beast. </p><h2>  Photo album for a boy </h2><div class="photo" data-original="muschi-moesen-fotzen.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Photo album for a boy" class="if uuid-2291948" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72077/2291948.jpg"></div><p>  Photo album for the boy can be done in white, blue, brown, orange colors.  It is also possible to use saturated shades of red. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Jewelry is best to choose the appropriate gender: cars, motorcycles, pistols, fishing rods, soldiers.  They can be found both in the form of stickers, and metal or wooden (in shops for hobbies it is full of such crafts). </p><p>  The design of the pages can be done, like for girls, based on fairy tales ("Boy with a Finger", "Pinocchio", "Jack and the Bean Tree"), and associating with a "man's" occupation - car repair, going fishing, hunting. </p><h2>  The first page of the photo album for the newborn </h2><div class="photo" data-original="cengizgoren.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="First page" class="if uuid-2291963" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72077/2291963.jpg"></div><p>  The pages of the album for the newborn should be special.  The very first page can be done in different ways.  For example, you can put a photo of a pregnant mother, where the tummy is clearly visible.  Or to build something like an envelope in which children are discharged from the hospital.  You can depict (stick) a stork that carries a bundle with a baby in its beak.  Or a head of cabbage in which you found your baby.  These are all standard explanations for the question: "Where do the children come from?"  You can show imagination and come up with your own version.  The main thing is to be interesting and colorful. </p><h2>  Lettering in a children's photo album </h2><p>  One of the most important points in creating a photo album is writing signatures.  It is better to come up with labels for the album for the newborn.  Not in the sense that under the signatures to make staged photos, but in making signatures in a timely manner.  For example, you took a picture, of course, it has not yet been printed (unless you have a camera with instant photos), but this is the baby‚Äôs first step or smile.  You surely put this photo in the album.  So come up with an inscription now, while you are overwhelmed with emotions.  Banal phrases such as ‚Äúfirst smile‚Äù, ‚Äúfirst tooth got out‚Äù, ‚Äúour first steps‚Äù are in all children's photo albums.  And believe me, a week later, you will not come up with anything original.  And while this moment has not yet ended, you have a chance to make a special inscription for a special photo.  For example, a photo with the first steps can be signed with words from a famous song: "Top-top, the baby is stomping."  Or so: "The first step, the second step! Our / our &lt;name&gt; hero!". </p><div class="photo" data-original="sarahmeyers.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Captions under the photo" class="if uuid-2291965" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72077/2291965.jpg"></div><h2>  Last page of the photo album </h2><p>  The last page, as well as the first, must be decorated unusually.  Of course, depending on what age the album ends.  If this is your first birthday, you can attach a photo of a child blowing out a single candle on the cake, glue a <span>festive cap</span> on top (it‚Äôs unlikely that a baby will let you put a cap on yourself for a year, and take pictures of it in it), real confetti, a balloon (deflated) .  If the baby does not blow out the candles in the photo or if you don‚Äôt have a cake, then you can also stick the cake with candles by finding the appropriate stickers.  If you continue to keep the album for up to three years, then on the last page you can draw / sew / glue pebbles, twigs, stickers with birds, a ball around a child‚Äôs photo on a bicycle.  It all depends on the age of the children, your creativity and your desire to make the photo album special. </p><h2>  Photo album pages for baby </h2><p>  When you design the main pages, several options are possible: the entire photo album in the style of "a la girl / boy".  This option was considered above. </p><p>  The second option: all pages of the album contain elements of a certain fairy tale / cartoon.  This option is more suitable for albums for children who already have favorite fairy-tale characters, but for newborns you can find the best option.  For example, many children like cartoons ‚ÄúWell, wait a minute!‚Äù, ‚ÄúTom and Jerry‚Äù, ‚ÄúMasha and the bear‚Äù, ‚ÄúFixies‚Äù, etc. That is, you can assume that your baby will watch these cartoons, so he will like your idea.  And then you can either break it down into series: each page is a new series.  Or simply there should be elements of the selected fairy tale next to each photo. </p><p>  Thirdly, you can just come up with interesting situations: on the seabed, surrounded by mermaids and shells (for example, the first wash in the bathtub or bathing in the river), in the starry sky, the baby rushes on a bicycle / typewriter / daddy‚Äôs back / rocking-horse.  In this option, it is necessary to additionally purchase the necessary details (shells, pebbles, twigs, flowers, metal and wooden elements - all this can be purchased in special stores for hobbies, in some bookstores this is now found). </p><div class="photo" data-original="integra-gm.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Visual use of various elements" class="if uuid-2291933" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72077/2291933.jpg"></div><p>  Or just to colorfully decorate the pages, pasting them with stickers and depicting something interesting.  It is not necessary to do something pompous or fanciful.  Everything is limited only by your imagination. </p><h2>  Children's album title </h2><p>  You can name your album for the newborn as you like.  You can come up with something original, or you can use the templates.  The choice is simply huge, from the banal "Our baby, an album for a newborn" to "This is our baby annealed."  No one will blame you for the unusual name that other parents would never have chosen.  This is your child, your photos, your album.  You do it first of all for yourself.  Therefore, you can call him anything you like.  ‚ÄúCute little album, our son is in it‚Äù, ‚ÄúMom and Dad‚Äôs sweetness‚Äù, ‚ÄúWonder Girl‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow it all began‚Äù, ‚Äú&lt;Name&gt;. The beginning.‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe first important moments of our baby‚Äù, etc. etc. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Title for photo album" class="if uuid-2291956" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72077/2291956.jpg"></div><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Whether or not to make an album for a newborn is a private matter for everyone.  But if you still decided to collect all the pictures in one piece, then feel free to get down to business.  There are no rules and requirements, you can invent anything you want, or you can just insert all the photos into a regular album.  So feel free to get down to business, print photos, buy a foundation, fantasize, create! </p>
