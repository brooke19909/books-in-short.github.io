The ringing history of the state</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Collecting ... For many, this hobby is rooted in childhood.  Most professional collectors started by picking up coins from asphalt at the age of five and carefully storing them in their children's hiding places.  Years passed, someone outgrew this hobby, but those who remained dedicated to their cause achieved stunning results.  Why?  Because it is in private collections that are the most <span>expensive things of</span> our time, including rare coins. <br><br>  For the first time in Europe, people began to collect coins during the Renaissance.  This interesting tradition has been preserved to this day.  Everyone in this business pursues its own goal.  This brings pleasure to some, while others consider collecting to be a pretty profitable business, and a coin to be a profitable investment.  Whatever the case, choosing this path, a person, as a rule, is carried away by one direction.  Today, for many lovers of numismatics, coins of Poland are of great interest. </p><h2>  History of Polish money </h2><p>  A certain period of time on the territory of the country went foreign currency, but after a while, coins of own state production came into everyday use.  Yes, coins.  Early history shows that <span>paper money,</span> like currency, appeared relatively recently, but people paid with metal coins at the dawn of human history.  With the development of production in Poland, many <span>mints</span> appeared <span>.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="coins of poland" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40532/1180891.jpg" width="200"></div>  For a while, a wide variety of money was minted there.  After a while, a law was adopted on a single state coin, and only the government row had the right to "make money".  After this reform, the country's internal and external economies went uphill, but after some time it turned out that there was not enough money in the state.  This served as an impetus for the development and introduction of a new monetary system.  It was then that banknotes appeared - the national paper currency.

It is these instances that are of great value today.  Like other developing countries, Poland is rich in rare metal money, which at the moment is of great interest to collectors and investors.  Zloty is the modern <span>currency of Poland.</span>  Its first silver copy was minted in the XVI century. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="coins zloty poland" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40532/1180890.jpg" width="410"></div>  A century later, when the country was ruled by Jan II Casimir, gold coins - ‚Äúzloty‚Äù began to be actively issued.  After some time, Poland experienced a rapid collapse of the economy due to ‚Äúcredit‚Äù money not backed by precious metals.  Initially, ‚Äúzloty‚Äù was called not only state money, but also gold ducats that came from abroad.  The name has taken root.  To this day, the coins of Poland are called zloty, although they no longer have any precious metals in their composition.

    <h2>  Commemorative and Commemorative Coins </h2><p>  For the country, the sixteenth century was significant not only this.  It was in this century that the foundation was laid on depicting kings and other representatives of power on metal money.  Sigismund I was the first king to appear on the back of the coin of Poland.  Thanks to such a reform and the meticulous work of medieval masters, today almost all the inhabitants of Poland can familiarize themselves with the history of their state. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="coins of poland 2 zl" class="if" height="237" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40532/1180889.jpg" width="400"></div>  In the second half of the twentieth century, the zloty began to rapidly depreciate. <br>  This happened as a result of several unsuccessful <span>monetary reforms.</span>  After that, metallic money began to be produced primarily from aluminum.  The only exceptions are some commemorative and jubilee coins of Poland.  More recently, metal money dedicated to a plane crash over the city of Smolensk first saw the light of day.  They are collectible and expensive, because its value is primarily affected by its rarity.

Their meaning and everyday life </h2><p>  Commemorative coins of Poland are really very expensive.  Some of them, preserved in only one copy, can cost millions of US dollars.  This led to the fact that not only collectors, but also professional investors began to engage in numismatics.  Such rare coins today have become a profitable deposit and a good investment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="commemorative coins of poland" class="if" height="329" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40532/1180888.jpg" width="539"></div>  The most famous commemorative coins of Poland - 2 z≈Ç.  Since 1995 and almost to this day they have been issued by the National Bank of Poland.  Each of them today has a status of appeal.  Such specimens have a rather pleasant golden color, probably due to the high copper content in their alloy.  2 zloty are issued on the occasion of special events, as well as with the image of architectural and other monuments.  One of them was dedicated to the centenary of the Olympic Games, the other was called "Jan III Sobieski" and thus immortalized the name of this ruler for posterity.

    <h2>  The advent of a new denomination </h2><p>  Indeed, the life of the country is reflected precisely in such banknotes.  The Polish main financial department issued commemorative coins with a face value of 2 zlotys, and only in 2014 did they receive a copy of a face value of 5. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="commemorative coins of poland" class="if" height="294" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40532/1180887.jpg" width="580"></div>  This coin, although commemorative, is officially recognized as a means of payment in the country.
