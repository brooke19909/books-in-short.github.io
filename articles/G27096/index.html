The central regions are still not fully restored after the destruction.  This is the city of Kaliningrad. </p><p>  "Fish Village" - a famous shopping center, is located in this historical and architectural large settlement. </p><h2>  History of Kaliningrad </h2><p>  Since 1945, since Königsberg became a Soviet city, much has changed in it.  Central European Gothic, which once represented the city, was replaced by Soviet constructivism. </p><p>  The names of the streets changed, most of the monuments ceased to exist as an “alien” element in their time.  The historic Royal Castle was blown up, and the Cathedral was nearly lost.  Until the 90s, German Konigsberg gradually turned into Soviet Kaliningrad. </p>
