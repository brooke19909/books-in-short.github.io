It is called the assembly of ship models from wood.  What is needed to make such a beautiful thing.  Creating a <span>sailing ship</span> model from wood is not so simple.  From this article you will learn how to create a <span>model of a ship</span> from a tree with your own hands.  And also we will make a short excursion into history. </p><h2>  Francis Drake </h2><p>  Many history buffs know the name of <span>Francis Drake's</span> Iron Pirate, England was his homeland.  He became the captain of a sailing ship at the age of 16.  At first he was a ship priest, and then a simple sailor.  But his fame really thundered when he became a brave and very formidable pirate.  In the 16th century, he made quite a few voyages and took part in a considerable number of fights. </p><h2>  Golden Doe </h2><p>  At the dawn of the fate of <span>Francis Drake</span> , several sailing ships arrived at his property.  Its main flagship was the ship "Pelican".  This ship was a five-deck three-mast.  On board were 20 artillery weapons.  All kinds of sea stories rarely tell us that a ship that already has a name can be renamed, but it was with the Pelican that, by the will of fate, such a story happened.  In 1578, Francis Drake changed the name of this ship to "Golden Hind" (in Russian this name sounds like "Golden Hind").  It was under this second <span>name that the ship</span> was inscribed in sparkling gold letters in the world history of sailors.  Francis Drake committed quite a few dizzying acts on him, which were later told in history and adventure books. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is such wonderful ships that force many to assemble models of ships from wood with their own hands.  Drawings of many such structures can often be found on the Internet.  So, inspired by the ancient history of navigation, we will learn from this article information on how to do something like this. </p>

    <h2>  DIY ship model from wood: from the beginning to the rainbow horizons </h2><p>  In fact, the history of modelism consists of several stages.  In addition, each of these stages is associated with several features.  A lover of miniature shipbuilding may need to be able to change the available materials.  It is also important to expand the selection of modeling objects.  After he has developed enough, then he may have mass production of models.  The next step will be the development of poster exhibition modeling from the sets that he already has.  Later, you can develop before the formation of individual segments.  It can be anything - from ship models and to the flesh to copies of individual motorcycles, trucks, as well as all kinds of other cars. </p>

    <h2>  DIY wooden ship models: drawings, instructions, tools </h2><p>  So, well, let's get down to creating such a ship.  Cutting prefabricated ship models from wood is not an easy task.  You will need a lot of tools for this.  Among them are: a knife, a chisel, a hammer, a bar (and, if necessary, a saw), thin fabric, superglue, a long wooden spire, a rope, a drill.  In addition to this, you will need two more very important parameters.  Firstly, it is time, and secondly, the important quality of those people who are engaged in creating prefabricated models of ships from wood is patience. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Wood craft </h2><p>  First you have to work with a chisel.  You must file everything plus the old bolts that have a flat head.  It will not take you so much time - just two minutes.  In these two minutes, the pre-processed bar will later become a ship.  Now you need to strip the bar.  You should carefully scrape off the bark.  Hold the bar directly in the direction of the tool.  Take the standard design as an example for our small ship models, which we will build on the principle below.  Take a pencil and sketch on a bar a preliminary sketch.  Next, treat the bar with a sharp knife.  The inclination of the blade itself should be at an angle of about 10 degrees.  When you plan, keep in mind that this is not the easiest job, and therefore be patient.  You should not forget that if for any reason you are mistaken, then it will be difficult to correct everything.  Remove shavings layer by layer, while you should try and process the original bar as smoothly as possible.  It is important that the top and bottom should be parallel. </p>

    <p>  Note that you don‚Äôt have to throw chips at all.  The fact is that, in principle, it can be used as additional material as mulch. </p><h2>  Thread of the front and sides of the ship </h2><p>  Well, now we need to draw the front, bottom, as well as the back.  We will cut them in exactly the same way as it was mentioned above.  It is necessary to make these parts even.  In order to get the bow of the ship, you will have to saw off a piece in front.  In the wake of this, you should round off the saw with a knife.  When you make the nose, try to tilt the knife blade back.  It should be directed towards the stern. </p>

    <h2>  Drilling holes and subsequent installation of equipment </h2><p>  You should have several spiers.  Therefore, drill a certain number of holes, they should be slightly larger in size than the beams themselves.  It is important at the same time that there are not too many holes.  Otherwise, a crack may form.  And because of the crack, as you know, a severe disaster can happen - to flow.  Do not use glue!  If you do this, further work will be much more difficult. </p><h2>  Setting sails on the model </h2><p>  Decide, for starters, exactly how many panels you want to get on your final ship.  We take for the condition that we will have four panels for the first mast and the second, and three for the last.  Next, take a few wooden spiers and trim.  Cut the trapezoid fabric.  Then start gluing them.  Make notches on the branches of the sails, fasten each branch with the corresponding notch.  Then glue the middle of the edges to the sails.  Repeat the same for all masts.  It‚Äôs best if you build the back mast first, then the middle mast, and then the bow. </p>

    <p>  Now let's install the top flying sail.  Cut the figure out of the fabric in the form of a kite.  Take the thread and attach it to the opposite corner of the cloth.  Leave the ends on both sides for all angles.  Glue a small piece of thread on the top of the boat.  It should be slightly higher than the bow of the boat itself.  Measure the part from the opposite angle up to the middle of the lower branch of the sail on the front mast.  Then cut the thread itself, cut and glue the tip to the appropriate place. </p>

    <p>  On each side you should leave some strings.  Pull them back and glue them straight into the boat.  Then you can cut off the excess rope.  In the same way, create and attach the back panel.  It should be attached to the back of the rear sail.  Measure, trim, and make sure it fits into the two protrusions.  Then glue them in the corners. </p>

    <p>  Well, now you have learned how to make simple ship models from wood.  And although in this article everything is described only in general terms, we hope that it will help you in your future career as a "shipbuilder".  Unless, of course, you are interested in this.  Believe me, this is a worthwhile lesson! </p>
