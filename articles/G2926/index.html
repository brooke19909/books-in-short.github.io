    <h2>  Insurance policy </h2><p>  <span>Car insurance</span> is a must in our country.  An insurance policy must be obtained for all types of vehicles.  The exception is only vehicles that, due to technical features, cannot travel at speeds above 20 km / h, belong to the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation or are not allowed to operate at all. </p><p>  If necessary, you can insure the car in another region, that is, not at the place of registration.  In this case, it is advisable to simply choose a company or representative office available in the region where you will constantly use the car in the coming year (or another policy period). </p>

    <p>  The lack of insurance in the first 10 days after the conclusion of the contract of sale does not threaten, in principle, with anything other than a warning from the traffic police officer, since these 10 days are the deadline for obtaining all the necessary documents.  But since car insurance is mandatory, you can get a fine for failure to comply with requirements when a law enforcement officer stops.  He will make 800 rubles.  And this will continue until an insurance policy is issued. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where to insure a car? </h2>

    <p>  Auto insurance is issued at the branch of any specialized company that is engaged in this type of activity.  There are a huge number of such organizations now, but it‚Äôs better to choose well-known and verified organizations so that when an insured event occurs, you will not be left without anything.  The most famous among them are: Rosgosstrakh, Ingosstrakh, Intach, Renaissance and others. </p><h2>  What documents are needed </h2><p>  Auto insurance is issued according to any program.  The following documents are required at the selected insurance company: </p><ol><li>  Passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation. </li><li>  Driver's license. </li><li>  Title </li><li>  Diagnostic card with valid inspection data. </li><li>  The contract of sale (donation, etc.). </li><li>  Power of attorney (if you insure a car that is not registered for you). </li></ol><h2>  Insurance options </h2><p>  Auto insurance exists in 2 options: CTP and CASCO.  Insurance when buying a car (new) from a car dealer is issued in the form of CASCO without fail.  On a used machine, you can issue a <span>CTP or CASCO</span> to choose from. </p>

    <p>  At the same time, the CASCO policy has several varieties that are called differently by different companies.  For example, mini-CASCO - protection only against accident, payment of a part of the amount, and the rest is paid in case of an insured event. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  CTP insurance </h2><p>  The easiest and cheapest insurance option.  OSAGO protects the car only in the event of an accident (from OS theft, damage and the like, OSAGO does not protect, contrary to various opinions, and the insurer will not pay you anything). </p><p>  Now on every corner you can see the inscription "CTP insurance."  Rosgosstrakh and other well-known and long-established companies on the market, like a large number of lawyers, are not advised to contact small offices.  It is better to get an insurance policy more expensive, but in which case you can definitely get your money. </p><h2>  CASCO insurance </h2><p>  CASCO is a <span>type of insurance that</span> protects against theft or damage, providing for the liability of the insurance company in case of theft or damage to the car and payment of losses. </p><p>  Insured events in which hull insurance is valid: </p><ul><li>  Collision with another vehicle. </li><li>  Run over objects and animals. </li><li>  Turning over the car as a result of an accident. </li><li>  Damage to the vehicle by objects falling on it, including trees, branches, snow or ice in the winter, and cargo during loading and unloading. </li><li>  The ejection of objects from under the wheels of another vehicle moving next to yours, which led to damage to parts of the vehicle or to an accident. </li><li>  Immersion in water due to flooding, failure of the road, accidental exit into the water or failure under ice. </li><li>  Ignition, explosion. </li><li>  Intentional or unintentional harm or destruction of a vehicle, theft by third parties. </li></ul>

    <p>  CASCO insurance does not apply to the following situations: </p><ul><li>  Damage to the vehicle when driving a third party (without a military unit not included in the policy, intoxicated). </li><li>  Management in a state of intoxication. </li><li>  Damage to discs, paintwork, etc. (if this does not affect the operation of other car parts). </li><li>  Theft of wheels or license plates (if their theft occurred without damaging the car). </li><li>  Theft of the car radio (provided that the radio panel was left in the car). </li></ul><h2>  Insurance policy cost </h2><p>  The cost of insurance depends on several elements: </p><ul><li>  Vehicle power in l / s. </li><li>  Age and driving experience of the car owner (for people over 21 years old and with an experience of more than 3 years, insurance is cheaper than for 20-year-olds with an experience of 1 year). </li><li>  The number of possible drivers (it is worth considering that making <span>insurance without restrictions</span> will be cheaper than adding 3 people to the policy). </li><li>  Insurance region (in central regions it often costs more than in more distant regions). </li><li>  Accident-free riding (if you don‚Äôt have an accident at all, then your insurance policy will cost less than those who constantly, through their own or through no fault of their own, become a participant in an accident). </li><li>  Seasonality (issue for one or 2 seasons, and then renew will be more expensive than clearance for the whole year at once). </li></ul><p>  You can calculate the cost of insurance using calculators on the Internet. </p><h2>  How is compensation made? </h2><p>  In order to receive monetary compensation, you need to contact the insurance company that issued the policy no later than 14 days after the insured event. </p><p>  At the same time, there are 2 possible scenarios: repairs in the service station with insurance from the insurer ( <span>an</span> agreement on the provision of auto repair services was <span>concluded</span> at the service station and the <span>company</span> ).  There are both positive and negative sides.  The plus is that the owner does not have to look for a repair shop himself.  But the repair may be delayed, the car may not be given away for a long time, and make it worse than it was.  Therefore, it is better to get cash payments from the insurance company. </p>
