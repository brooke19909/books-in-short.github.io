Unfortunately, the cost of the finished animal in the cabin is very high, but do not despair!  Such a composition can very easily be made with one‚Äôs own hand, having acquired the necessary components. </p><h2>  For whom is such a gift suitable? </h2><p>  It has always been customary to give flowers; this is a universal gift for all celebrations, when going on a visit.  They can be presented to your beloved girl, sister, mother, etc. </p><p>  But bouquets are gradually fading into the background, and figures from flower heads are becoming more and more in demand.  Such sculptures of flowers are much more original, they are interior decoration, and the joy that cute animals carry in themselves is huge! </p><div class="photo" data-original="hiveminer.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="yellow chrysanthemum hedgehog" class="if uuid-2817852" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2817852.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, it‚Äôs very a pity to part with the toy.  Few people know that with proper care and care, such a composition can stand without fading for a long time. </p><h2>  Tools for work </h2><p>  To make a wonderful hedgehog from flowers, you need to stock up: </p><ul><li>  Shallow basket with a wide bottom. </li><li>  Scissors with sharp blades. </li><li>  With a knife. </li><li>  Glue gun. </li><li>  Floristic wire. </li><li>  Sponge - an oasis. </li><li>  Wrapping paper. </li><li>  Two beads. </li><li>  Satin ribbons. </li></ul><h2>  Materials: the right choice </h2><p>  To create a beautiful figure that can stand for a long time, bringing joy, you must choose the freshest flowers.  Usually, chrysanthemums are chosen for such purposes - they tend to retain their appearance for a long time without fading. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can use inflorescences of various textures and shapes for different areas of the body and muzzle of your animal.  For example, the muzzle of the animal can be made from not fully opened buds, and use large flowers to fill the back, legs. </p><p>  The color is unimportant here - take those flowers that you like or the one for whom the gift is intended. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.liveinternet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bright hedgehog" class="if uuid-2817868" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2817868.jpg"></div><p>  Remove all dried flowers or with defects - they will fade very quickly, thereby ruining the look of the toy! </p><p>  Start cutting flowers just before work.  Do this with a very sharp knife or special scissors, leaving at least a couple of centimeters of stems. </p><h2>  How to make a hedgehog of flowers with your own hands </h2><p>  So, the toolkit is prepared, the flowers are selected - let's get started! </p><ol><li>  First, draw a future toy full size on a piece of paper.  This is necessary in order to estimate the amount of material and, if necessary, stock up on additional. </li><li>  From the oasis sponge, you need to cut out all the details of our hedgehog, as well as a piece in the shape of the bottom of the container in which the toy will be located, and soak them in water.  Take your time, the sponge should be completely saturated with moisture! </li><li>  While the oasis is saturating, take a basket and lay the film on the bottom, fixing it with silicone glue. </li><li>  Now we put the base from the sponge in a basket and insert green leaves into it, the branches are a meadow for a hedgehog from flowers! <div class="photo" data-original="2gis.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wonderful hedgehog" class="if uuid-2817876" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2817876.jpg"></div></li><li>  The next stage of our work - we take out a sponge from the water - the body of a hedgehog, set them on a green base. </li><li>  It remains to fill the sides and back with inflorescences, make eyes and nose from beads. </li><li>  Decorate the basket with satin ribbons, and attach artificial apples, berries, mushrooms to the back of the hedgehog using toothpicks. </li></ol><p>  So the wonderful hedgehog of flowers is ready!  Please them with your loved ones! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Proper care of a toy from fresh flowers </h2><p>  Toys made of flowers bring great joy to their owners, but they are created from very short-lived material.  Flowers, unfortunately, fade very quickly and the figure has to be thrown away. </p><p>  But you can extend her life by providing the animal with proper care. </p><p>  Do not leave it in a draft - the petals will dry very quickly and will have an unpresentable appearance.  Such figures do not like and are afraid of direct sunlight, which is very harmful for them.  Find a place in a bright room with no drafts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.liveinternet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hedgehog with apple" class="if uuid-2818705" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2818705.jpg"></div><p>  And yet, the main thing in this matter is watering.  Do not forget to occasionally saturate the sponge with water.  This can be done with a syringe.  Take out one flower and pump water into this place with a syringe.  So you need to water all the parts of the toy - then it will be fresh for about four weeks. </p><h2>  How to make a hedgehog from artificial flowers and sweets </h2><p>  For this craft, you do not need special skills, and it will delight no less than the one described above!  For this work it is necessary: </p><ul><li>  A piece of foam. </li><li>  Foil. </li><li>  Brown and pink corrugated paper. </li><li>  46-50 chocolates round shape. </li><li>  Toothpicks packaging. </li><li>  Glue gun. </li><li>  3 beads. </li><li>  A few artificial apples, mushrooms. </li></ul><p>  We start by cutting an oval shape with a size of about 20 * 15 cm from a piece of polystyrene foam. Trim the bottom, to give stability to the hedgehog from flowers.  Make one end of the oval in the form of a muzzle.  Stick light brown paper on your face and body.  Make beads and eyes out of beads. </p><p>  To make flowers with sweets, you need to wrap each candy in rose paper petals and stick a toothpick from the bottom, into the flat part. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nn.blizko.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="gypsophila hedgehog" class="if uuid-2817872" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2817872.jpg"></div><p>  Thus we prepare all the sweets.  At the end of this process, start sticking toothpicks into the foam, stepping back about two centimeters from the eye.  Do not allow voids between the flowers, sweets, for this they need to be slightly shifted in relation to the previous row. </p><p>  Use a glue gun to attach artificial fruit to the hedgehog on the back.  The finished hedgehog can be planted in a flat basket and decorated with fir branches. </p><p>  The second craft is also ready! </p><p>  Making a hedgehog out of flowers is easy!  Just turn on your imagination at full capacity, be patient and wonderful gifts will be made to friends and relatives! </p>
