History of Russian drink</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Vodka is an original Russian drink, which is part of the culture and traditions of Russia.  Over the history of its existence, many recipes have been created.  Songs and poems were written about vodka, it was consumed in varying quantities by everyone: from a serf to a royal person.  It is not surprising that it was in Russia that the first and only museum of vodka in the world was opened. </p><h2>  Unusual museum </h2><p>  On May 27, 2001, in the very center of the Northern capital, a small museum opened its doors for visitors, in which the entire exposition is dedicated to one single product - vodka.  Actually, this is a commercial project, but it also has historical authenticity. </p>

    <h2>  Where to find </h2><p>  Finding such an unusual museum is easy.  It is located in the historic city center, on Konnogvardeisky Boulevard, not far from St. Isaac's Cathedral.  The premises for the exposition were allocated by the restaurant ‚ÄúWineglass No. 1‚Äù.  In the museum you can not only learn the history of the drink, interesting facts related to it, and see historical artifacts, but also taste several varieties of vodka with traditional Russian snacks. </p>

By the way, persons under 18 years of age, the entrance to this institution is closed.  This is not a place for family leisure. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Exposition </h2><p>  The Museum of Russian Vodka has two rooms.

    <p>  The guide will tell those who came to the museum of Russian <span>vodka (St. Petersburg) that</span> it was originally used for medicinal purposes.  Its production was done by monks.  And the brothers in faith from Constantinople shared the technology for the manufacture of alcohol.  Only their product was obtained as a result of distillation of grapes, but in Russia it was not cultivated then.  I had to adjust the recipe to the realities of the northern country and learn how to isolate alcohol from what is - from grain.  The product turned out to be no worse than the overseas one, and even surpassed it in some respects, for which it became known as the ‚ÄúWater of Life‚Äù. </p><p>  The new invention was widely used in the manufacture of medicinal tinctures, and even for perfumes.  During the plague epidemic, doctors came up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtreating patients with alcohol.  And although he did not become a panacea for the disease, the disinfecting properties of the liquid were discovered. </p><p>  Under Ivan III, the first ‚Äútaverns‚Äù were opened, where <span>alcoholic drinks</span> obtained in distilleries were sold. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Peter I generally legalized the use of alcohol by introducing a tax on him.  The treasury received crazy amounts.  Thanks to them, the ambitious king built the state, carried out reforms and built a new capital, which now has a museum of vodka. </p><p>  But Catherine II allowed the nobles to produce clandestine products on their estates, for which they had to pay "farmers" to the treasury.  Thanks to this step, the collection of recipes was enriched, because everyone brought changes to the recipe in accordance with their taste and capabilities. </p><p>  By the nineteenth century, this sector of the economy had become the most profitable.  Russian vodka was even exported abroad.  Prominent scientists have contributed to the development of this product.  So, Mendeleev found a ‚Äúgolden‚Äù ratio of alcohol and water, so that the taste of the product turned out to be special.  40 degrees vodka was patented in 1894 under the name Moscow Special. </p><p>  The eyes of visitors who have looked at the vodka museum (Petersburg) are presented with various original documents, one way or another relating to the legendary drink.  The collection contains original bottles, decanters, shtofs and other measuring containers, as well as drinking utensils.  The creators of the museum did not forget about corks and labels, which are also interesting. </p><h2>  Revived story </h2><p>  Two compositions from wax figures, which are the pride of the museum organizers, enliven the exposition.  Each of them clearly illustrates important milestones in the history of the development and distribution of vodka products in Russia. </p>

    <p>  The guide will tell you about which alcoholic beverages were preferred by the first people of the state, because it is known that vodka stood on tables and at royal feasts, and in peasant huts.  It turns out that the appetizer for cognac "Guards wad" - a slice of lemon laid between pieces of cheese - was invented by Emperor Nicholas II. </p><p>  But the museum is not only dedicated to the culture of drinking.  The fight against vodka has been going on since it began to be mass-produced.  A number of exhibits are dedicated to this particular problem. </p><h2>  Hall Two </h2><p>  After an interesting story about vodka, the guide invites everyone to go to the second hall, which is decorated in the style of a glass of the beginning of the last century.  There are exhibits on the Soviet period of ‚Äúlife‚Äù of vodka, on Gorbachev‚Äôs dry law, on the <span>people</span> 's <span>commissar 100 grams</span> and much more.  Here you can try a drink, which is dedicated to the museum of vodka. </p><h2>  What else will the guide tell </h2><p>  During the tour, the guide will not only tell the story of the creation and development of the drink, which has become a symbol of Russia, but will also tell you how to choose the right bottle in the store so as not to buy ‚Äúfake‚Äù products.  So the museum of vodka intertwines history and modernity, myths and reality, narration and tasting. </p>
