We offer a detailed look at Chatkaew Hill Hotel Residence 3 * and once again prove that even in a budget holiday there are advantages and delights. </p><h2>  Climatic conditions and surroundings of the hotel </h2><p>  A trip to Thailand should be planned so as not to fall into the rainy season.  The local tropical climate has a clear division into three periods: the rainy season, cool and hot seasons.  And the largest influx of tourists occurs not in the hot, but in the cool season, which lasts from November to March. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Temperature </h2><p>  At night, the temperature in this period is about 20 degrees, and the daytime does not exceed 30 degrees Celsius.

Indeed, due to the range of its location, you can explore the city in detail, visit local attractions.  At the reception, whose staff speaks English, you can ask for a map of the city and a business card in order not to get lost in Pattaya. </p><p>  Friendly, polite and attentive staff, cleanliness, beautiful territory - this is not all the opinions of tourists about Chatkaew Hill Hotel Residence 3 * (Pattaya).  Reviews about it, despite the economy class category, are mostly positive. </p><p>  Tourists noted good conditions for accommodation with small children, as the hotel is far from entertainment facilities, and the noise does not reach the walls of the hotel. </p><p>  About the quality of food, tourists agreed that thanks to such a plentiful and tasty food, the hotel will easily give odds to any five-star establishment.  Soups and several types of meat that are served for breakfast are more like a hearty lunch. </p><p>  Air conditioners are working properly and quietly.  But the noise from the elevator was noted by a guest who lived in a room next to the elevator shaft. </p><p>  Many guests complain of interruptions in hot water: sometimes water flows in its own way, irregularly. </p><p>  There is one indisputable trump card that Chatkaew Hill Hotel Residence boasts - a rooftop pool.  A very strong impression on tourists makes night swimming, when you can observe the many colorful lights of the never-sleeping city. </p><p>  Pleasantly surprised many tourists by the fact that during the stay there was not a single insect found - the hotel staff strictly observed sanitary standards. </p><p>  The hotel has Wi-Fi.  It is available on a free basis only in the lobby bar, but the connection speed is high and at the same time up to 15 people can use the Internet network. </p><p>  Summing up, we can say that a budget vacation can be very convenient, because in Thailand usually come not for hotel delights, but for the local flavor.  The hotel fully justifies its value, being a place where you can happily come to spend the night after a busy day and evening entertainment program. </p>
