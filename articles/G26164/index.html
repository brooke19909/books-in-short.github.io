Games come in different categories, and therefore comparing them with each other will be an illogical and controversial matter - each game has its own audience.  Some games can gather an army of fans around them, while others can unite strangers from around the world with a single idea.  However, there are games that have become popular among generations, regardless of age, status and preference.  The following is an overview of the games for Android, which have won universal love, and their advantages and disadvantages are described. </p><h2>  Pubg mobile </h2><p>  This game in the Royal Battle genre deserves first place not only in its own way, but also in the general list of games for Android.

She has a huge number of followers, a low-budget film from fans, dozens of books, games on different platforms and much more. </p><p>  40 levels of the game are built around the history of the Imperial Knight, whose brothers were killed and the house destroyed.  Now, being in the service of the Dark Angels, he takes revenge on his wrongdoers.  The unusualness of the game lies in the fact that the sequence of actions is more important here - the game itself moves the character, you only need to set priorities on time and attack them in time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.windowscentral.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="list of games for android" class="if uuid-3087051" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111754/3087051.jpg"></div><p>  Gameplay Features: </p><ol><li>  Obtaining weapons and armor for donat, through the passage of missions and levels. </li><li>  The ability to increase the quality of armor and weapons by improving it, or by merging from several other things. </li><li>  Daily awarded assignments.

The computer is responsible for the movements. </li><li>  PvP battles do not occur in the present tense. </li><li>  After completing the story, motivation is lost. </li></ul><h2>  Minecraft </h2><p>  Minecraft on Android was created after it was widely recognized on the PC.  Three-dimensional game in the genre of "sandbox" is an open world, which allows the player to fully use his creative thinking. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gunook.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Minecraft game process" class="if uuid-3086953" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111754/3086953.jpg"></div><p>  Interface Features: </p><ol><li>  The game has 2 modes: creative mode and survival. </li><li>  The player can collect their own buildings and weapons from found blocks and materials. </li><li>  The change of night and day. </li><li>  Experience in mining and crafting things. </li></ol><p>  Advantages: </p><ul><li>  Great scope for imagination. </li><li>  Gameplay in 3D. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  Pixel graphics. </li><li>  Lack of plot. </li></ul><h2>  Mortal combat x </h2><p>  This game began its journey with arcade slot machines, but after a while it gained a large number of fans and received not only universal recognition, but also an honorable place in the ranking of games on Android. </p><p>  The campaign mode map is divided into towers, in each of which the player expects 6-8 enemies.  You can take 3 of the available fighters to the tower with you. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.justpushstart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mortal Combat X game" class="if uuid-3086968" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111754/3086968.jpg"></div><p>  Gameplay Features: </p><ol><li>  Over 50 characters in the form of cards. </li><li>  All familiar combo attacks, special hits and the accumulation of rage. </li><li>  The ability to change the fighter during the battle. </li><li>  The ability to pump each fighter, his equipment. </li><li>  Bonus missions with breaking items are given. </li><li>  Network mode. </li><li>  X-ray is given after lvl 20. </li></ol><p>  Advantages: </p><ul><li>  Large selection of characters and their variations in their appearance. </li><li>  Network mode. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  Boring swipe based gameplay. </li><li>  Monotonous and short storyline. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  As you can see, most games are based on open world, team play and rivalry.  Perhaps, along with graphics, these are the main reasons for their popularity.  Many of these games made it possible to unlock the potential of users and realize their fantasies. </p>
