A wide network of branches and ATMs, popular online banking allow Russians to make payments at a convenient time and with a minimum commission.  At the initiative of the client, you can cancel the payment within a day: Sberbank offers several options for refunding funds. </p><h2>  Payment online and at the bank office: what are the differences? </h2><p>  Before canceling a payment at Sberbank, the client must be aware of the differences in transaction options.  Transfer of funds is carried out in several ways: </p><ol><li>  Using a Sberbank plastic card (or cash) at terminals and ATMs. </li><li>  In the personal account of Sberbank Online. </li><li>  By cashless transfer (using the Mobile Bank service). </li><li>  At the organization’s office, through a bank operator. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="thecoolgadgets.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to cancel a payment through sberbank" class="if uuid-2645639" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2645639.jpg"></div><p>  The payer chooses which method is most convenient for him.  Among themselves, the options differ in the size of the commission and the speed of receipt of funds to the account. </p><ul><li>  When paying in Internet banking, the commission is from 0% to 1%, funds are received within 15 minutes. </li><li>  The commission in the terminal when using cash is from 0% to 2%, money is received within a day.  When paying by card at an ATM, from 0% to 1.5% is charged, crediting - no more than 24 hours. </li><li>  Payment through a bank operator is possible both by card and in cash.  The commission is from 0% to 3%.  Funds are credited up to three business days. </li><li>  Using the SMS informing service, customers can transfer funds instantly, paying from 0% to 1% of the commission. </li></ul><h2>  When can I cancel a payment? </h2><p>  Payment for services is considered completed when the client receives a check in the hands of the operator or sees the status of "Completed" in Internet banking, terminals.  When SMS transfers, a notification is sent from the number "900" about the successful transaction. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="chemtrailsplanet.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to cancel a sberbank payment" class="if uuid-2645646" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2645646.jpg"></div><p>  The operation is canceled in the following cases: </p><ol><li>  If the error is related to the work of a bank employee.  For example, when the name of the payer or the details of the recipient are incorrectly indicated in the check. </li><li>  When a technical malfunction occurred.  Sometimes banking programs "freeze", which increases the time of receipt of funds by 48 hours or more.  If the money has not yet been credited to the account, the payer must file a claim with the office of the company. </li><li>  When changing the details of the recipient.  Payment to the legal entity involves the transfer of funds according to the data from the receipt.  If the company changed the TIN or account number after sending the payment, the money will be returned to the client. </li><li>  In case of refusal to complete the transaction.  The reason may be a high percentage of the commission, an incorrectly indicated amount, a change in the conditions for sending funds.  If the payer assumes that a refund is required, it is recommended to clarify whether it is possible to cancel the payment at Sberbank for the indicated reason before the transaction is completed. </li><li>  If the money was stolen as a result of fraud.  Clicking on a malicious link with payment to an unknown mobile phone number or involuntary transfer to Sberbank Online is the most common way to steal funds. </li></ol><h2>  Cancellation of payment at Sberbank Online </h2><p>  Even regular users of the Internet application are not always aware of how to cancel a payment at Sberbank. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.sberbank.ba" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to cancel a payment from a sberbank card" class="if uuid-2645641" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2645641.jpg"></div><p>  Unlike transactions in the office of a financial institution, only the cardholder is responsible for making a payment in remote service channels.  Refund is possible if the funds have not been received to the recipient's account.  This is evidenced by the status of the operation "Accepted for execution."  It means that funds have been debited from the customer’s account, but the payment is being processed. </p><p>  How to cancel a payment from a Sberbank card in your account in the event of such a status: </p><ol><li>  Find in the upper right corner "Personal menu", click on the line "Operation history". </li><li>  From the list of operations, select a payment with the status "Accepted for execution." </li><li>  Transaction information will appear on the screen.  Under electronic printing, click on the active "Cancel" button. </li><li>  Make sure the status "Operation canceled" appears. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="themoscowtimes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to cancel a payment through sberbank" class="if uuid-2645648" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2645648.jpg"></div><p>  Refusing an incomplete transaction is the only way to cancel a payment through a Sberbank card.  If the funds were successfully transferred (status "Completed"), you must contact the recipient with a check and card details for a refund. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Sberbank Business Online: is it possible to cancel the operation? </h2><p>  The solution to the problem of how to cancel a payment at Sberbank Business Online resembles the return algorithm through a personal account for individuals.  The difference lies in the name of the operations. </p><p>  In Sberbank Online, the client pays for services or transfers, and in the business version, a payment order for transferring funds is created.  Cancellation is possible in the process of processing the operation: you need to cancel the transaction until the status "Completed" appears. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sott.net" data-author=": Evgeny Biyatov, "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to cancel a sberbank payment" class="if uuid-2645636" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2645636.jpg"></div><p>  Refund is possible at the following stages of payment: “Created”, “Imported”, “Signed”, “Delivered”, “Accepted”.  It is not possible to withdraw an order if the notification “Accepted ABS” or “Unloaded” appears.  When the client cancels the transfer, the status of the payment order will change to "Suspended". </p><h2>  Transaction cancellation in terminals </h2><p>  Most often, ATM users turn to Sberbank with the problem of how to cancel a payment.  Transactions in the area of ​​round-the-clock payment acceptance account for more than 37% of all transactions in the largest bank in the country. </p><p>  When paying, customers do not always carefully check the details of the recipient.  Often, problems with returning are caused by incorrect operation of the system: an ATM accepts money, but instead of a receipt for a successful operation, the client receives a document indicating a technical failure. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.plusworld.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="You can cancel the payment of Sberbank" class="if uuid-2645637" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2645637.jpg"></div><p>  How to cancel a payment at Sberbank made through a self-service device: </p><ol><li>  Save the check issued by the terminal.  In case of his absence, write down the ATM number, date, transaction time and the exact amount. </li><li>  Contact your nearest bank office.  <span>A technical malfunction</span> is the most common cause of claims by payers at Sberbank ATMs. </li><li>  Write a request for a refund or crediting to the recipient's account.  The administrator will register the client’s request.  The term for resolving the issue may take from several hours to 30 days. </li></ol><h2>  Refusal of payment at the bank office </h2><p>  If the client incorrectly entered the details or made a mistake in the amount, the company's operators will tell you how to cancel the payment through Sberbank.  For all transactions, the period of reversal (or cancellation) of the operation is set - from 15 minutes to 24 hours. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.shippingherald.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to cancel a payment through a sberbank card" class="if uuid-2645644" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2645644.jpg"></div><p>  Utility payments, payment of state duties and <span>mandatory contributions</span> (taxes) may be reversed within 15 minutes.  Transfers to the account of a legal entity can be returned within 24 hours. </p><p>  To refuse a transaction made in a bank office, a client must: </p><ul><li>  Inform the operator of the cancellation policy. </li><li>  Verify that the cancellation dates are met. </li><li>  Write a statement in the name of the branch manager with a request to return the funds.  If the operation was carried out on a bank card, you should provide it to the bank employee: funds will be returned to it within 1 hour. </li></ul><p>  After 24 hours from the date of the transaction or upon successful completion of the transfer, reversal of the transaction is prohibited.  If the client did not meet the deadlines for the refund, he must present the bank check to the recipient and write a statement on the cancellation of payment at the company’s office. </p><h2>  Is it possible to return a transfer through the Mobile Bank? </h2><p>  Using the SMS informing service implies an online transaction.  The payer fully controls the transaction process. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ibtimes.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to cancel a payment to a sberbank business" class="if uuid-2645642" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2645642.jpg"></div><p>  If the client made a mistake in the personal account number, for example, when paying for the services of an Internet provider, the refund is carried out only through the provider.  As confirmation, you should provide SMS from the number "900", which indicates that the transfer was successful.  Additional documents upon return may be a bank statement certified by an employee (branch seal and signature of an authorized person), which reflects a plastic card transaction for a certain date. </p><h2>  Refunds charged as a result of fraud </h2><p>  If a client of Sberbank has become a victim of scams, you need to contact an additional office of the company to write a claim. </p><p>  Fraud actions are different: </p><ol><li>  Write-off from the card account via Sberbank Online or Mobile Bank. </li><li>  Transfer in favor of third parties. </li><li>  Payment for services without the consent of the client.  In 98% of cases, it is a transfer to the account of a mobile operator. </li></ol><p>  The bank refunds only when fraud is committed.  If the owner voluntarily transferred the savings to swindlers, for example, by reporting passwords and SMS codes to Sberbank Online, the refund is carried out only after an investigation by the executive bodies. </p><p>  When deducting funds for fraud, the cardholder must write a statement to the bank, detailing the terms of the operation.  After considering the claim (term - no more than 30 days), Sberbank makes a decision on the return of funds.  In the event of a refusal, for example, when the transaction is completed by the client himself, it is required to write a statement to the prosecutor about the fact of fraud, enclosing documents confirming the debit </p>
