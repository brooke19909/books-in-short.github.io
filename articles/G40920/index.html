But the result is a real man-made masterpiece that needs a decent frame.  Making embroidery in a baguette is done in specialized workshops, but this is a rather expensive procedure.  You can make a frame for a picture with your own hands.  There are several options that are available, and you can do them yourself. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a baguette for embroidery" class="if uuid-2860785" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2860785.jpg"></div><h2>  Stretching embroidery on a stretcher </h2><p>  Stretching embroidery in a baguette is a very important stage of work!  From thick cardboard, you need to cut a workpiece, which in size should correspond to the finished embroidery plus the width of the fillets or frame.  Carefully iron the picture from the wrong side.  On the cardboard, draw the center lines horizontally and vertically with a pencil, mark the center.  Do the same with embroidery, noting the center and outlining the midpoints on the sides of the work.  Apply a thin layer of glue along the edge of the subframe and allow it to dry slightly.  Attach the canvas, aligning the labels.  After making sure that the work is level, you need to put it under the press until it dries.  If necessary, trim the excess canvas protruding beyond the edges of the cardboard base. </p><div class="photo" data-original="howdidyoumakethis.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a baguette for embroidery" class="if uuid-2860757" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2860757.jpg"></div><p>  Instead of glue, you can use double-sided tape.  And similarly fix the work, but without drying. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can bend the edges of the canvas to the base and fix with threads, capturing fabric from opposite ends of the work.  First, the length of the picture, and then the width.  gently grab the corners with thread. </p><div class="photo" data-original="howdidyoumakethis.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="baguette embroidery stretch" class="if uuid-2860747" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2860747.jpg"></div><h2>  Finished frame </h2><p>  If the work has standard sizes, you can make embroidery in a baguette with your own hands by buying a frame suitable for the size and color scheme in the store. </p><p>  Take out the subframe, pull the canvas over it, straighten all the folds.  Reassemble the frame, cut off excess fabric. </p><p>  Similarly, you can make a mat.  Fix the embroidery in the center of the base.  From cardboard or thick paper suitable in color and subject to the main work, cut a rectangle.  Cut a window in the center corresponding to the size of the picture.  In order for the work to gain volume, you need to make the internal borders 0.5 cm smaller, and after cutting them, bend them inward.  So the mat will have depth.  In order for the craft to be neat, the edges need to be pressed with the tip of the scissors before bending.  In this case, the bend will turn out smooth and without creases.  After that, place the embroidery in a baguette.  This is the easiest option. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fulwoodgallery.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="baguette for pictures" class="if uuid-2860707" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2860707.jpg"></div><h2>  Fillet frame </h2><p>  Making embroideries in a baguette of fillet is one of the most common ways.  In shops, the choice of this finishing material is huge.  You can find a suitable option - from a modest frame to a massive design.  In addition, the prepared blank can be painted with any paints, varnished, gilded or silver-plated, depending on the author‚Äôs ideas. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For work, you will need the following materials: ceiling plinth, acetone, thick cardboard, stationery knife.  If there is a miter box - a tool for cutting corners - this will greatly facilitate the work. </p><p>  Measure the length of the fillets, noting the inside and outside borders of the corner.  Cut with a knife or hacksaw.  Glue the blanks.  You can use building transparent glue or pieces of a plinth dissolved in acetone.  Apply the product with a brush or flat stick. </p><p>  Glue the prepared frame onto a cardboard base with embroidery.  Attach a loop for hanging on a nail.  This baguette for paintings is quite light, and it can be attached to the wall on a double-sided tape. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.craftsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="baguette embroidery design" class="if uuid-2860765" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2860765.jpg"></div><h2>  Hoop instead of frame </h2><p>  If the embroidery is small, it can be embroidered.  This method has been used before, but now that vintage is at the height of fashion, this design of embroideries in a baguette has become fashionable.  Various hoops are sold in stores that differ in size, color and shape.  It‚Äôs easy to choose the right option.  This method of decorating embroidery in a baguette, with all its simplicity, has its own subtleties. </p><p>  Ready embroidery needs to be embroidered in a hoop, straightened and well fixed.  Trim excess fabric at a distance slightly less than the hoop radius.  So, with a diameter of 12 cm, the width of the edge can be 5 cm. At 1 cm from the edge, stitch with a thread to the color of the canvas with a ‚Äúforward needle‚Äù seam.  Having captured both ends of the thread, you need to pull them as close to the center as possible and tie a knot.  This option can be removed if desired. </p><p>  You cannot trim the excess along the contour.  The fact is that over time, work may lose shape or will need to be washed.  After that, it will not be possible to pull the embroidery into the baguette well. </p><p>  You can arrange the back of the picture carefully.  To do this, cut out a fabric that matches the color, a shape that repeats the shape and dimensions of the hoop.  To process edges with a sewing seam.  Sew to the canvas.  Such work will look completed on all sides. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.designsponge.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="making embroidery in a baguette with your own hands" class="if uuid-2860712" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2860712.jpg"></div><h2>  Cardboard baguette </h2><p>  You can make embroidery in a baguette using cardboard boxes.  To do this, cut out two rectangles, the dimensions of which will correspond to the dimensions of the embroidery, and add the width of the frame from each edge.  One is the foundation upon which the work is pulled.  From the second cut the frame.  On the subframe, fix the canvas using tape, glue or a stapler. </p><p>  Decorate the frame.  To do this, it can be pasted over with fabric, leather, kraft paper.  Or arrange in another way.  Stick the frame on the subframe and, after drying, hang the picture on the wall. </p><h2>  Baguette with lace edge </h2><p>  After the baguette for embroidery is made, it can be additionally decorated.  Beads or other decorative elements that are glued to glue are suitable for decoration.  Can be decorated with lace.  The frames tied with an openwork pattern look very nice, especially the hoop.  For such work, before embroideries are framed in a baguette, the outer ring must be tied tightly with one row of single crochet posts.  And also to make a favorite openwork pattern of repeating fans or triangles.  Such a frame will give a vintage style to the picture. </p><p>  Baguette is a worthy embroidery design.  The final touch, which will allow the man-made miracle to sparkle with all the colors, and not gather dust in a pile of finished works in the nightstand. </p>
