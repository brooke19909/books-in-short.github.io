This issue is especially relevant in relation to resorts.  Many Russians prefer to relax in domestic resorts, choosing at the same time precisely the budget accommodation options.  In our article we want to talk about one of Sochi hotels - Green Club (3 * hotel). </p><h2>  A bit about the hotel ... </h2><p>  Convenient location makes Green Club very popular (3 * hotel, Sochi).  The central area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city‚Äôs resort line is a great place to relax and walk, as everything that a tourist may need is nearby.  The hotel was built at an altitude of 90 meters above the Black Sea - on the slope of the famous <span>Grace Mountain,</span> in the central region of the subtropical coniferous-deciduous arboretum, whose area is about seven hectares.  More than two hundred species of plants grow in the park.  This location can be called unique. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="green club hotel 3" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1574867.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Green Club (3 * hotel) has been hosting tourists in its walls since the summer of 2005, and therefore it can be called a relatively young establishment.  The complex is a three-story building made in the Empire style.  The hotel will be a great vacation destination not only for couples with children, but also for the stay of people who have arrived in Sochi on business.  Adler Airport is 22 kilometers from the hotel, and the train station is 7 kilometers away. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get to the hotel? </h2><p>  As we already mentioned, Green Club (3 * hotel) has a rather convenient location, and therefore it is not difficult to get to it, and it is not necessary to use taxi services at all.

In addition, the complex has a bar where guests can enjoy alcoholic, non-alcoholic drinks and cocktails that can be enjoyed on the outdoor terrace. </p><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  Not every establishment can boast of wonderful rooms and friendly staff like the Green Club Hotel.

    <p>  A number of services are provided for guests, including: repair of clothes and shoes, laundry and dry cleaning services, ironing. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Since the hotel is located in the central area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSochi, the beach is within easy reach.  From the hotel to the coast no more than 150 meters.  The beach has pebbly cover and a comfortable gentle entry.  In general, the coastline in Sochi is the same everywhere. </p><h2>  Green Club (hotel 3 *, Sochi): reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, I definitely want to discuss the feedback of those tourists who managed to visit it and decided to share their impressions.  It is worth noting that this rarely happens, but the complex has only positive reviews.  And not the last role in this is played by a pleasant and good service staff who quickly and efficiently relocates guests and is always ready to help in any matter. </p><p>  The rooms of the hotel, according to tourists, are very spacious and bright, and they are all completely different.  There is not a single repetitive interior that gives the hotel a special twist.  There is completely no bored standard design. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="green club hotel 3 sochi reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1574872.jpg"></div>

    <p>  All apartments are beautifully equipped, they have everything that you might need.  Especially guests are pleased with the large balconies where you can not just dry things, but have a good time with a cup of coffee.  Housekeeping and towels are changed daily by maids.  All apartments are new (the last repair was carried out in 2013) and are kept clean, which is very nice. </p><p>  As for food in the Green Club (3 * hotel), reviews about it are also very positive.  When booking rooms, you can also order breakfast buffet.  In the morning, guests are offered the following set of products: milk, granola, toast, salad, tea, compote, coffee.  The waitress brings pancakes, casserole, side dishes, meatballs, pasta and sausages directly to the tables of vacationers.  And at lunch and in the evening in the restaurant you can order any dish menu.  In general, all guests are satisfied with the quality of food.  Other restaurants work near the hotel, and therefore, for a change, tourists can also try other resort establishments. </p><p>  The hotel area itself is small, but very well maintained and clean.  At the same time, they managed to build a small pool on it and arrange a beautiful recreation area, so that everyone can visit this place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="green club hotel green club hotel 3" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1574873.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The beach is not far from the hotel, but to get on it, you should cross the road and railways along the coast.  On the shore there is a rather large pebble, as well as on the entire Sochi coast.  Some tourists prefer to ride on the central beaches of the city.  Moreover, the stop is located very close to the hotel, and from it you can go anywhere in the resort. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Excellent reviews of tourists about Green Club 3 * give reason to recommend this institution for a budget holiday in the famous city of Sochi.  Of course, the resort is full of all kinds of hotels of various levels, but as one of the options the complex is worthy of close consideration. </p>
