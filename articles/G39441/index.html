  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mogilev - Orsha: features of a trip along the route</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There are not many large cities in the east of Belarus, including Mogilev and Orsha.  The first is the regional center, and the second is the transport hub (road and rail).  The distance from Orsha to Mogilev is about 80 kilometers, it can be overcome in several ways. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Mogilev Orsha" class="if uuid-3219728" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57442/3219728.jpg"></div><h2>  By rail </h2><p>  Train Mogilev - Orsha travels the distance between cities in less than two hours.  Tickets are cheap, 50 rubles one way, the tariffs for commuter trains in Belarus are noticeably lower than Russian ones. </p><p>  The schedule of departure of suburban trains from Mogilev to Orsha is as follows: </p><ul><li>  06:30 a.m. </li><li>  08:50. </li><li>  13:07. </li><li>  15:12. </li><li>  17:41. </li><li>  20:50. </li></ul><p>  They depart from the railway station "Mogilev-1".  It is located at the end of Grishin Street, opposite the Railway Station Square, next to the House of Culture of Railway Workers.  From the station, the center can be reached on foot, by bus and by trolley.  You need to move south along Pervomaiskaya Street to Lenin Square.  Mira Avenue passes by, from this place the most interesting part of the city begins, where there are cafes, restaurants, architectural monuments, museums, monuments. </p><p>  On the way from Mogilev to Orsha, the electric train makes about 15 stops.  Among them are the district center of Shklov and the village of Kopys.  These settlements are associated with the young years of the current Belarusian president.  He was born in Kopysi, and studied in Shklov and began his career not far from him on the collective farm. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The city of Shklov is worth a visit.  A trip from Mogilev to Orsha can be planned in such a way as to leave the first city early in the morning, make a stop in Shklov and come to Orsha in the evening. </p><p>  In the city center there is a modern bus station building and a fun monument to an anthropomorphic cucumber.  Shklov, like Lukhovitsy in Russia and Nizhyn in Ukraine, is famous for its cucumbers.  In addition, it is worth paying attention to such objects: </p><ul><li>  City Park.  It dates back to the 18th century. </li><li>  Beautiful town hall building with a turret. </li><li>  Excursion object "Bald Mountain". </li><li>  Orthodox Transfiguration Church and the Catholic Church. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Local train in Belarus" class="if uuid-3218541" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117615/3218541.jpg"></div><h2>  By bus </h2><p>  From Mogilev to Orsha, you can leave by bus from the bus station on Leninsky Street.  It is located near Lenin Square and zero kilometer of the Mogilev region. </p><p>  Buses depart according to the following schedule: </p><ul><li>  08:10. </li><li>  13:05. </li><li>  19:05. </li><li>  19:50. </li><li>  20:51. </li><li>  20:55. </li></ul><p>  On the way, they are from 60 to 90 minutes.  Even a little faster than the train.  There is an important difference from electric trains: Orsha is not the final destination for buses, they follow to Vitebsk, Novopolotsk and St. Petersburg. </p><p>  In the opposite direction, from Orsha to Mogilev, there are also many buses that run from 03:00 to 22:00.  Some of them are international, that is, they come from Moscow. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The price of a bus ticket is about 200 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mogilev Center" class="if uuid-3218543" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117615/3218543.jpg"></div><h2>  By car </h2><p>  From Mogilev to Orsha, the E-95 highway leads.  You need to leave for it from the eastern part of the city.  Entrance to Orsha is also from the east side, from the Pilots Alley and Mogilevskaya Street. </p><p>  There is another option - to get on the highway R-76, which runs from the western side of the Dnieper through Shklov.  You need to go to it along Pervomaiskaya Street through the northwestern quarters of the city.  She leads to Orsha through Shklov and Kopys.  Moving along it, you can visit these settlements. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Street in the center of Mogilev" class="if uuid-3218540" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117615/3218540.jpg"></div><h2>  By train </h2><p>  Some trains that run international between Mogilev and Orsha are unlikely to be used because of high fares for a short distance, so it‚Äôs best to go in a seated or common carriage of one of the inexpensive local Belarusian trains with the following departure schedule: </p><ul><li>  03:55 a.m. </li><li>  09:42. </li><li>  10:17 a.m. </li><li>  12:20. </li><li>  18:31. </li><li>  21:28. </li><li>  23:49. </li></ul><p>  The trip will take from 1.5 to 2 hours.  A ticket costs about 100 rubles. </p><h2>  Why go to Orsha? </h2><p>  Not the most interesting city in Belarus, but a large railway junction, suitable for transfers to Moscow, Minsk, European cities and for transfers to international trains that travel to Russia to Novosibirsk.  However, it must be remembered that international tariffs even apply between Russia and Belarus. </p><p>  Of the attractions in Orsha, several museums and a small historical center on the territory between the Dnieper and Orshitsa rivers, where the collegium building and a beautiful children's park are located, deserve attention. </p>
