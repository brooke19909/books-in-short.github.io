They were created at a time when Russia was fighting for access to the sea, and therefore the country especially needed regular regiments, organized according to a new, European model.  The first emperor considered this task to be one of his main goals in reformative politics, all the more so since it was precisely in those years that the war with Sweden began, which continued almost throughout his reign. </p><h2>  General characteristics of the era </h2><p>  The amusing troops of Peter 1 should be seen as part of the military reform of the new king, although they arose at a time when the future emperor was still very young.  At the end of the 17th century, a tendency toward the reform of the Russian army was clearly marked.  Even the previous rulers sought to reorganize it on the basis of new achievements, in accordance with Western European models.  This was all the more necessary because the inevitability of the struggle of our country for access to the sea became apparent.  For this, new regiments and well-trained soldiers were needed. </p>

    <p>  The old local system of manning the army, when every nobleman, landowner brought servants and military servants with him to the service, gradually became obsolete.  That is why the amusing troops of <span>Peter 1,</span> created with the participation of European experts, became the basis of the new army. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Creature </h2><p>  <span>It is a well-known fact</span> that the first emperor made extensive use of the experience of foreign engineers, military specialists and builders.  While still very young, he began to visit the German settlement, where he met and made friends with people who were later destined to become his chief assistants in the implementation of reforms and the conduct of hostilities.  From childhood, the king showed interest in war games, activities and exercises.  He took up the device of improvised regiments, structures and battles. </p>

    <p>  The military games of the amusing troops of Peter 1 had serious consequences: it was precisely in this way that the ruler became seriously interested in military organization and the art of fighting.  He himself in practice learned to take improvised fortresses and other objects.  Subsequently, this largely determined the victory of Russian weapons during the war with Sweden.  Then the emperor himself led the operations, guided by the experience gained during his children's games. </p><h2>  The role of foreigners </h2><p>  The amusing troops of Peter 1 were created with the personal participation of the king, who, when they were organized, relied on the experience of his new acquaintances from a well-known settlement.  First of all, it should be mentioned the name of <span>F. Lefort,</span> who became a personal friend of the king and instilled in him a love of the fleet and the army.  He was an educated and intelligent man who had an undeniable influence on the young ruler.  The latter, in turn, used his advice when he seriously thought about the professional organization of his regiments. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="amusing troops of Peter 1 short story" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/1272545.jpg" width="310"></div>

A large role in their organization was played by P. Gordon, an associate of the king and a supporter of his reforms.  He possessed great military experience and contributed to the transformation of regiments into permanent regular military and very combat-ready units.  Gordon was not only a practitioner, but also a theorist.  Having extensive knowledge in military affairs, he was an excellent organizer, and the soldiers he trained were considered the best fighters. </p><h2>  Menshikov </h2><p>  The amusing troops of Peter 1, the story of which is the subject of this review, arose with the direct participation of Alexander Danilovich, the closest assistant and ally of the king in all his affairs and undertakings.  He took an active part in the formation of troops, he himself served there with the rank of scorer.  Subsequently, this experience helped him become the largest military leader of the Petrine reign. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="information about the amusing troops of Peter 1" class="if" height="408" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1272445.jpg" width="330"></div></h2><h2>  Training </h2><p>  The amusing troops of Peter 1 played a large role in creating the regular army. A brief account of them includes some basic, most significant facts in their organization and training.  Even in childhood, the young king, physically advanced by age, began to arrange improvised war games.  When he was only eleven years old, he began to organize these classes in the field, as a result of which the usual children's fun grew into a real practical study.  In Preobrazhensky village, a town was erected, which served as the object of maneuvers and, finally, an assault.  It is known that the king himself took an active part in its construction. </p><h2>  Design and training </h2><p>  In 1691, the amusing troops received the correct organization and were divided into two <span>regiments: Preobrazhensky</span> and Semenovsky.  The very next year they were included in the Moscow regiment and thus became a full part of the Russian army.  Two years later, well-known training maneuvers were carried out south of the capital.  There was built a wooden fortress, which was defended by archers and nobles.  The new troops were supposed to force the river and take this building by storm.  At first it was assumed that the event would be educational in nature, but both sides were so carried away that the amusing actions turned into a real battle, in which there were many wounded and even one killed. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="war games of the amusing troops of Peter 1" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1272443.jpg" width="317"></div></h2><h2>  Features of maneuvers </h2><p>  During this exercise, the Tsar‚Äôs soldiers stormed according to all the rules of military art: they dug digs and trenches, took earthen ramparts, forced the river, blew up fortifications.  The soldiers so quickly coped with the task that Peter 1 took them back and ordered to take the fortress again.  It should be noted that she was very well fortified and protected, and therefore her capture was considered an important success of the new regiments.  The ruler was preparing for war, therefore, maneuvers were conducted under the leadership of Gordon, the military teacher of the future emperor. </p><h2>  Value </h2><p>  Information about the amusing troops of Peter 1 preserved the manuscripts of the first half of the 18th century by P. Krekshin.  The organization and training of soldiers in a new way made a great impression on contemporaries.  Never before had anything like this happened at the royal court.  The success of the impromptu <span>military exercises</span> was so obvious that both regiments began to take part in all the main military campaigns of Pyotr Alekseevich. </p>
