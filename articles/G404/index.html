    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  It is worth noting that Borj Sedria is a picturesque resort, but it is better not to be here at the end of summer, namely in August.  Due to the specific Mediterranean climate, it is very hot at this time: the temperature can reach 50 degrees!  It is best to relax here from September to November or from May to July.  What about the <span>Sun Beach Resort</span> 4 * (Tunisia) should be said first thing?  The fact that it is located on the shores of the Gulf of Tunisia, and it is about 40 minutes by car from the popular city of Hammamet.  By the way, Tunisia's international airport is located nearby - this is also a plus.  Even closer, 23 kilometers from the hotel, there is another airport - Carthage.  Near the hotel there are two more hotels, so the area near it is well-groomed and quite extensive. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Booking and accommodation </h2><p>  <span>Sun Beach Resort 4 *</span> (Tunisia) offers several accommodation options for guests.  Each tourist will be able to choose a room to his taste.  The hotel has 370 rooms, but the complex is never empty.  Among them are double, triple and quadruple.  The modern apartment has everything you might need.  It has central heating and air conditioning, satellite channels, free internet access.  By the way, all apartments have access to a terrace or balcony, which offers excellent views of the garden, sea or pool.  The rooms are cozy, decorated at home - in such rooms it is really comfortable to relax and have a good time. </p>

    <h2>  Bars and Restaurants </h2><p>  At <span>Sun Beach</span> Resort 4 * (Tunisia), guests are served on an all-inclusive system, which is valid from 10 am to 11 pm.  I want to say that the choice of restaurants here is huge, and the guests of the resort completely lose their desire to have a snack somewhere outside the hotel.  Take, for example, the main restaurant.  It offers guests a wide variety of European dishes, and once a week they organize evening tastings of national treats.  This will appeal to lovers of exotic. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You can have breakfast from 7:00 to 10:00, lunch should be received after 12:30 and until 14:30, but for dinner guests are invited from 18:30 to 21:00.  Also, guests are offered restaurants of Tunisian, Indian, Mexican, Chinese and Italian cuisine.  The only caveat is that you can enter there only once.  There are also four bars in the hotel complex where you can enjoy quality drinks and light snacks.  By the way, in one of them (in the central one) they arrange daily tasting of cakes and cakes, which also serve coffee and tea. </p>
