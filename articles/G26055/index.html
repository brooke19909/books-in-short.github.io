In this city in northeast Italy, an ancient amphitheater has also been preserved.  Verona is famous for Juliet's balcony and the ancient bridge over the Adige.  This city turns into a gateway to the ski resorts of the <span>Dolomites</span> in winter <span>.</span>  Therefore, it is not surprising that there are always many tourists in Verona. </p><p>  Many arrive in the city by train.  But if we talk about international traffic, then the lion's share of foreign tourists takes Verona Airport.  This is the main air harbor of the entire region.  After all, the airport serves not only Verona, but also neighboring cities: Trento, Vicenza, Bolzano, Brescia.  He bears the proud name of the poet of antiquity "Valerio Catullo Villafranca".  But colloquially it is simply called - ‚ÄúVerona Villafranca‚Äù. </p><p>  In this article we will talk about this international airport: how far it is from the city, how to get there, how many terminals it has and so on.  What do passengers say about the air harbor?  We have analyzed them and are ready to give you valuable information. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1376588" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/1376588.jpg?1538577928"></div><h2>  Airport History </h2><p>  Like many hubs in Italy and Germany, Verona was also created during World War II.  He served as an air base.  The only runway and a small building, which served travelers, already in the sixties of the last century stopped cope with the growing passenger flow.  The local authorities had two decisions: to build a new hub or to reconstruct the old one on a large scale. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So that passengers do not puzzle over how many airports in Verona exist, the last option was preferred.  Before the reconstruction, the air harbor took only a daily flight from Rome.  And in the winter several charters from Northern Europe were added to it.  But after the reconstruction, which occurred in the late seventies, the airport began to build up its power.  The air harbor was also modernized in 1990, in connection with <span>the World</span> Cup, which was held in Italy.  Now the airport serves more than four million passengers a year. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1376497" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/1376497.jpg?1538577928"></div><h2>  Russia - Verona: how to get there? </h2><p>  S7 and Windjet airlines depart for Valerio Catullo Villafranco Airport on Saturdays, Wednesdays and Sundays.  The last carrier brings passengers from St. Petersburg to Verona.  There is a regular flight from Kiev that departs from the capital of Ukraine on Saturdays and Tuesdays.  Scoreboard of airport (Verona), according to reviews, is available online.  The harbor serves twenty-six airlines.  In addition, during the summer and winter seasons, numerous charters land here.  Verona Airport is also known for serving low-cost: Jeman Wings, WizzAir, Rienair and others.  You can get to Verona from Russian cities with a change in Rome, Munich, Paris, Madrid, Berlin. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1376586" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/1376586.jpg?1538577928"></div><h2>  Where is the air harbor located and what is it like </h2><p>  The hub is located eleven kilometers from the center of Verona.  The airport (how to get to it - we will discuss later) consists of two terminals.  They are located in the same building, as the reviews claim, so there is no need to go far. </p><p>  If you turn left from the main entrance, where the shuttle buses stop, you will find yourself in Terminale Partenze.  This is the departure terminal (T1).  In this room, report reviews, there are ticket offices for the sale of tickets, reception, cafes and shops. </p><p>  If you turn from the entrance to the right, you will get to Terminale Arrivi.  There is a cafe in the departure hall (T2).  Naturally, the baggage claim point works here.  At the exit you can find car rental services, a tourist information center, a post office. </p><p>  There are ATMs in both terminals.  As for the left-luggage offices, they are not here.  Airborne management has refused this service for security reasons. </p><p>  Verona Airport still has one runway.  True, in the last reconstruction (2011) it was continued for four hundred meters.  Now its length is more than three kilometers.  And she is able to take heavy liners. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1376409" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1376409.jpg?1538577928"></div><h2>  Verona Airport Services </h2><p>  Both terminals have also been expanded and modernized during the latest reconstruction.  Now, according to reviews, there you can safely wait for your flight - there are enough places.  Terminal buildings are air-conditioned.  There is absolutely free Wi-Fi throughout the airport, so the flight waiting time flies just unnoticed. </p><p>  Passengers arriving from countries that are not members of the European Union undergo passport and <span>customs control.</span>  Reviews complain that there are only three windows of border guards.  And one of them is intended only for EU citizens.  When several charter flights arrive at once, queues may arise.  There are several duty free shops in the international harbor area.  It has a Verona airport and a VAT refund point.  Car parking in front of the hub building is free for only ten minutes - then the tariff is included.  The hotel nearest to the airport - Airporthotel Verona Congress &amp; Relax 4 * - is located eight hundred meters from the terminals. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1376482" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/1376482.jpg?1538577928"></div><h2>  "Valerio Catullo Villafranco" (Verona): from the airport to the city by taxi </h2><p>  Eleven kilometers - a short distance.  But Italy is too expensive a country, so a fifteen-minute taxi ride will cost you twenty-five euros in the afternoon and more than thirty at night.  Bargaining with drivers, assure reviews, is pointless.  They work on the counter.  This year, municipal taxis have an official competitor - KiwiTaxi.  This carrier has slightly lower tariffs.  In addition, you can order a car online (the site has a Russian version).  All cars are waiting for their riders at the exit of the arrival terminal, on the ground floor.  Unfortunately, this type of transport is the only one possible for passengers arriving at night in a city called Verona (airport). </p><h2>  How to get to the station? </h2><p>  As noted above, the air harbor serves several cities in the northeastern Italian provinces.  And many passengers from Verona Airport immediately leave for the Porto Nuovo train station to continue.  This popular route is served by two bus companies at once.  The Aerobus shuttle follows non-stop.  <span>The first bus</span> leaves the airport at half past six.  Until 20:30 cars run at intervals of twenty minutes. </p><p>  In the evening, buses start walking less frequently.  The last leaves at twenty-three hours.  White and blue buses with the ATV sign follow the same route, but make stops around the city.  The first flight starts at 6:35, the last - at half past eleven.  The interval between buses is twenty minutes.  A ticket (six euros) is purchased from the driver.  It is valid for an hour and fifteen minutes, which is very convenient for those who want to transfer to another bus route in Verona. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1376399" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1376399.jpg?1538577928"></div><h2>  From Valerio Catullo Villafranco Airport to other cities </h2><p>  If the purpose of your trip is Mantova, Vicenza and other settlements in the north-eastern part of Italy, do not rush to go to the train station.  Verona Airport is connected to some neighboring cities by direct shuttle express trains.  For example, it will be even cheaper to get to Mantua than to the station - only five euros.  Yes, and travel time you will significantly save, reviews say.  Only forty-five minutes - and you are already in Mantua.  The express bus leaves at half past seven, noon, half past three and twenty thirty. </p><h2>  Registration of VAT refund </h2><p>  Verona Airport has two tax-free points.  These are Maccorp Forexchange and Ticket Office.  Both points are located in the departure terminal.  Reviews warn that they work from half past eight to twenty one hours. </p>
