The main activities</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  So, today we will meet you with Helix Capital.  Reviews about her are increasingly found on the World Wide Web.  But understanding how it works is difficult.  In the same way as to draw conclusions about the integrity of the company.  Maybe this is another fraud that is so common on the Internet?  Or does Helix really exist, and you can trust it, as well as make money?  All this will be discussed now.  True, it will be necessary to study all the nuances of today's topic very carefully.  But there are reasons for that. </p><h2>  Truth or lie? </h2><p>  The first step is to understand what is at stake.  Often, when it comes to investing, many tend to believe that they are definitely deceived.  Indeed, there are a lot of various financial pyramids and other companies that "suck" money out of gullible citizens. </p>

    <p>  <span>Helix Capital</span> receives mixed <span>reviews</span> in this sense.  It‚Äôs hard to say so quickly and simply whether we are really dealing with a conscientious company or another fraud.  Therefore, citizens are trying to study all kinds of answers, and then draw a conclusion for themselves.  So far, only one thing is certain for sure - Helix has a real place.  And this is not a lie.  If you saw any corporation with this name, you should not immediately say that these are scammers.  First, pay attention to the activities thereof. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About Activities </h2><p>  Why should you think about the activities of the company?  Because it plays an important role for any corporation.  Helix Capital has existed in Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Russia and other countries for a long time.  But here comes the first suspicious moment, which makes many think about the integrity of the company.  It is about the activities thereof. </p><p>  The thing is that even here you can‚Äôt say exactly what the company is doing.  Its main areas are tourism, medical services, finance, investment, cryptocurrency, SPA and the production of certain food products.  It can be said, just the same universal company.  This makes us wonder once again whether it is a lie before us. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="registration in helix capital" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1227537.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As practice shows, each corporation should have a main focus.  Moreover, usually everyone specializes in one thing, and not in so different and completely unrelated spheres of activity.  For this, Helix Capital is making mixed reviews from customers and users.  Many, after reading information about the activities of the company, simply refuse to invest.  This is too suspicious. </p><h2>  Two sites </h2><p>  What else is worth paying attention to?  For example, the fact that Helix Capital in Kazakhstan and other countries has several official pages on the Internet.  This is also far from the best solution that scares off many customers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The first page of the corporation is called informational.  It serves solely to familiarize yourself with HELIX Capital Investments Ltd, and also to read numerous reviews about its activities.  You can say this is a kind of bait, advertising for the gullible. </p>

    <p>  But the second page is suitable for investment.  It is intended exclusively for work and joining the project.  Small and quick registration at Helix Capital - and you will immediately begin to receive your profit from investments!  It is with these words that the creators of the project lure users.  Many believe in the truth of what has been said.  And someone, on the contrary, does not trust such promises.  In any case, the presence of two official pages at once is alarming for the company.  Nevertheless, this is not such proof of deception. </p><h2>  Always make money </h2><p>  How exactly does the corporation system work?  Here it is worth paying attention to the fact that everything is extremely simple for investors.  HELIX Capital Investments Ltd offers to invest in a company, and then make a profit (passive) from work and its activities.  That is, you are not doing anything - just waiting.  For completed transactions (by the company) you will be charged certain percentages of funds.  A kind of passive income that so interests many. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Only just such a technique does not always inspire confidence.  Free cheese happens only in a mousetrap.  This should be remembered.  So the investment may be unjustified.  Nevertheless, Helix Capital (Ukraine and other countries around the world) is trying to attract customers with promises.  You kind of support the work of the corporation, and it gives you a certain percentage of the products of its vital functions.  In principle, everything is logical, albeit a little suspicious.  It is advisable now to think about whether you are really ready to trust such promises or not. </p><h2>  The more you invest </h2><p>  As it has already become clear, Helix Capital's business is built on investments made by citizens, as well as on the result of the performance of certain works on behalf of the company.  So far, everything is quite logical.  Invested - the company provided services - received a percentage of the profits.  But is it really so? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="helix capital investments ltd" class="if" height="284" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1227536.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  If you take a closer look, you can see that the organization is kept afloat only thanks to numerous investments from investors.  The more you invest in the project, the greater the return on you are guaranteed.  Many have heard such promises on the Internet is not the first time. </p><p>  From this we can conclude that Helix Capital is a pyramid.  The most common, financial, which lives due to the fact that someone invests in it.  But at the same time, she, like most analogues, promises to constantly pay you some money for supporting the activities of the corporation.  This is a dubious success, which rarely turns into reality.  So what is before us in the end? </p><h2>  Live chat </h2><p>  In truth, it is difficult to make a final conclusion.  Anyway, at this stage.  After all, there are some moments with the company that are absent in most pyramids-scam.  And they awaken the trust of customers and investors.  What are you talking about?  For example, that this organization has one creator.  And he with great pleasure communicates with his investors, not afraid to give interviews.  Moreover, all such dialogues can be found on the World Wide Web.  They are really given to real reporters.  Typically, companies that try to breed their customers avoid such openness. </p>

    <p>  In addition, pay attention to another factor.  Registration at Helix Capital is free.  While many financial pyramids often require at this stage some kind of cash investment.  This kind of phenomenon only awakens the trust of users.  Some with great pleasure become participants and transfer large amounts to Helix Capital account.  Reviews about this corporation are varied.  But if you take into account the factor of "live communication", then the credibility of the organization only increases each time. </p><h2>  Pays or not? </h2><p>  Suppose Helix is ‚Äã‚Äãreally a financial pyramid.  One important and essential question then remains is whether the project pays or not.  In practice, it often turns out that all the displayed amounts on your account are the most common fake.  What about Helix?  Here we can emphasize only that many users when trying to make money transfers begin to suffer.  From what?  From the fact that the money earned simply does not come.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter how exactly you made the transfer - to an electronic wallet or using a real banking transaction.  The fact remains that no money will be obtained, although no one will inform you of this. </p><p>  It turns out that all the earnings counters on the site are the most common fraud.  The one that many users face in search of easy money on the Internet.  So, the <span>financial pyramid,</span> which is represented by Helix, is an ordinary divorce.  And you definitely shouldn‚Äôt trust him. </p><h2>  Eternal praise </h2><p>  But where, then, does Helix Capital get positive reviews?  Is a dubious project really popular, and people don‚Äôt understand that they are being deceived?  In fact, not really.  The fact is that each fraudster has his own proven scheme of action.  And without fail there will be an item called "buying reviews."  That is, all flattery and praise to the project is a complete lie.  Someone gets paid for publishing enticing advertising posts on the Internet, writing good opinions about the project. </p>

    <p>  But very often you can see evidence with cash withdrawals!  For example, a screenshot or a video.  What does it mean?  Are they also deceiving us here too?  Yes, that‚Äôs exactly it.  It‚Äôs easier to fake such ‚Äúevidence‚Äù - even a schoolchild will cope with the task before him.  So keep this fact in mind.  Helix Capital is really a hoax, but only this financial pyramid is very well composed and disguised. </p><h2>  There is a reality </h2><p>  However, as already mentioned, you should not immediately talk about cheating if you heard about Helix.  The thing is that in Russia there is such a corporation.  Moreover, it is widespread and has no connection with Capital.  This is a medical center.  More specifically, about a laboratory that conducts independent research.  Here everyone can pass all the tests he needs, as well as undergo a medical examination or a physical examination.  Independent examinations also take place. </p>

    <p>  Only here you will not receive any investments and earnings with the help of Helix.  Unless officially get a job as a cashier, operator or medical worker.  It is possible to believe laboratories, but not directly to the financial pyramid.  The medical center has only one site from which you can make an appointment with a doctor in your city.  Keep this in mind. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  So what kind of picture do we end up with?  Helix Capital (in Kazakhstan and not only) reviews of a positive nature earn far not the most truthful.  They are bought.  There are very few real opinions - they usually indicate that we have before us the most common fraud.  And investing in a project is not worth it.  Unless you have extra money that you can give to charity.  Our advice - learn to distinguish lies from truth! </p>
