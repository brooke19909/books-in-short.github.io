They combine a beautiful design, small size and a full keyboard.  There are few phone manufacturers at the moment who would not have 1 or 2 slider in their assortment.  However, with the advent of the smartphone market, the popularity of such devices began to decline, and they are gradually being squeezed out of store windows. </p>

    <p>  Already, the model lines of companies involved in the creation and <span>development of mobile</span> devices are trying not to include a phone slider in the assortment.  The last manufacturer to release this type of technology was Nokia.  This brand is the only one in the range of which the C2 line is available, which has a slider appearance.  If someone is a fan of this kind of phone, then you can safely pay attention to the options from Nokia.  For example, the low-cost model C2-06 ‚Äã‚Äãhas a <span>resistive screen,</span> a 2 megapixel camera, a radio and a player.  It also has support for 2 SIM cards.  It is quite popular nowadays.  Slider phones with two SIM cards from Nokia cost no more than 3 thousand rubles. </p><p>  You can buy such a device both in stores with personal contact (although it‚Äôs quite difficult to find such equipment now), and on the Internet.  The latter can offer even those phones that have long been discontinued, but remained in stock.  In order to choose the option you need, you need to listen to the expert opinion.  The best models, according to professionals, are described below. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Samsung C3752 Duos </h2><p>  This slider phone has a beautiful case, which is made of a material such as plastic.  Its surface is matte, non-slip, making it pleasant to hold in your hand. </p><p>  Weight - 92 g, dimensions - 9.7x4.9x1.6 cm (in the closed position).  It is difficult to say that this device is too thick, but you cannot call it thin either.  It can be clarified that gravity will not be felt in a hand or pocket.  The device brand C3752 Duos is available in only one color scheme - black and gray.  The model is ideal for busy people who have chosen for themselves a simple, versatile and very practical 2-SIM card. </p>

    <p>  The Samsung S3752 slider phone, like all other devices from the Duos line, is equipped with utility functions that can easily be placed on the desktop.  Settings allow you to change the position of the clock, view the calendar, time, missed calls and events, as well as the phone book.  On the screen of the device is placed 18 such labels.  The logo (or picture) for them is set by default or at the request of the consumer. </p><h2>  Samsung S5050 </h2><p>  The Korean company did not take much care of the appearance of its new Samsung S5050 device.  This slider phone can remind in its design many models from completely different lines, since there is a mixture of many design options.  The ‚Äúface‚Äù of the device was a case made of glossy plastic in a black hue, on which a small pink stripe can be seen.  It is these colors that dominate: they can be found at the ends and at the bottom of the keyboard itself.  The phone received a ‚Äúshortcut" - female, although it only looks like that in its entirety;  when closed, it is no different from universal models. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  There are 3x4 icons in the phone menu.  It can be called a positive point that the device remembers the last section in which there was a person before stopping work, and after another opening of the menu it shows it.  Between sections or subsections, movement is carried out using the joystick or numeric keypad.  There are themes that radically change the internal design. </p><h2>  Samsung E390 </h2><p>  The next slider phone from the well-known Samsung manufacturer is the E390.  Its weight does not exceed 80 g with dimensions of 9.4x4.7x1.6 cm. The design of the device is made with such details that it looks strict and quite stylish.  Accessories, drawings, decorating elements - all this is not enough, therefore, for conservative and calm people, just such a slider is suitable.  On the market, the E390 is presented in only one color scheme - black.  Build quality.  Squeaks, poorly twisted screws are not observed even with strong compression. </p><p>  The phone menu has 9 sections.  You can navigate between them using a special button and block. </p><h2>  Samsung J700 </h2><p>  The Samsung J700 cell phone slider is unlikely to be remembered by the buyer for its appearance - it is the most typical among other models of the Korean seller.  This device can be distinguished from the background of others only with the help of a shape and color scheme (a pink model is on sale). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  With a weight of 92 g, the telephone dimensions are 9.9x4.8x1.4 cm. The front side has decorative elements, in particular a grid, behind which there is a speaker, round buttons of different colors.  In addition, it is worth clarifying such a nuance that catches your eye: this model in the pink version favorably emphasizes the proximity to black.  The average size of the device allows it to sit perfectly in the palm of your hand and not slip out. </p><p>  The menu has the form of a matrix with 9 icons.  Each of them is responsible for a separate section of the phone.  For example, the call log includes information about all calls (received, completed, missed).  And in the number book there can be about a thousand contacts. </p><h2>  Nokia 6700 Slide </h2><p>  First of all, it must be said that the Nokia 6700 Slide is a mobile slider phone that has a metal case, and this is a huge plus.  We can already conclude that when falling from a height he will suffer little.  The device replenishes the line of <span>budget phones</span> by Nokia.  The manufacturer delivers several color options to the market at once: from blue to silver.  The latter is a universal solution for both women and men, and is also ideally suited for different age categories - from a student to an adult busy person.  The metal taken as the basis of the body is aluminum.  The device weighs 110 grams.  And its dimensions are 9.5x4.6x1.5 cm. </p>

    <p>  The assembly of the slider is impressive.  The only negative can be called the fact that the USB cable connector is located next to the latch on the back of the case. </p><h2>  LG KE500 </h2><p>  It's hard to call the LG KE500 push-button slider phone as glamorous as its predecessor.  However, his competitiveness is several times higher.  It should be noted right away that the device is universal, it will suit both women and men.  In Russia, the phone is sold only in a single version, and more precisely in black and gray.  In the home country, there are slightly more color variations.  The design of the device is stylish and at the same time simple.  Metal inserts are present on the outside of the case.  The second material used in the assembly is plastic.  But it is qualitative: when touched and squeezed, it does not shrink and does not bend.  Surface coverage is not the same as with most sliders.  The manufacturer used technology that combines gloss and soft-touch. </p><h2>  Sony Ericsson W20i Zylo </h2><p>  The W20i Zylo phone is a slider, only by the appearance of which you can understand who the manufacturer is.  Round sides, matte plastic, an inscription on the outside of Walkwan - all this reminds Sony Ericsson.  There are three colors on the market: black, pink and gray.  It is logical that the second option is designed more for the female half of buyers than for men.  The rest are universal. </p>

    <p>  The plastic, which is taken as the basis in the case, has a soft surface, high strength, and is resistant to mechanical damage.  The assembly is performed at the best level.  The device weighs 110 grams, but this is more of a plus than a minus.  This is what adds to his solidity. </p><h2>  Samsung E880 </h2><p>  According to experts, Samsung turned out to be the best manufacturer (in terms of assembly, functionality, design), so a brief overview of another of its models will be useful. </p><p>  The technical specifications indicate the dimensions of the E800 - 8.7x4.3x2.3 cm. Although in life it looks even smaller.  This effect was achieved due to rounding of the edges.  There is little resemblance to the model of the South Korean manufacturer - E850.  The device weighs only 80 grams.  This allows you to carry the device in the pocket of a jacket, pants, shirt, without even feeling its presence.  A distinctive moment of the phone can be called the location of the camera.  Its ‚Äúwindow‚Äù is located above the screen on the upper edge of the housing.  The advantage of this camera is that it has one interesting function - image rotation using a small slider.  That is, she can ‚Äúlook‚Äù both at the owner and in the opposite direction. </p><p>  It is on these phones that experts give a 100% guarantee that the buyer will not be disappointed in their choice.  Among the positive aspects, they emit good sound, ease of operation, low weight, ease of holding, long battery life. </p>
