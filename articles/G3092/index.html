Now we will understand this issue.  Plasticine molding is one of the most favorite activities of kids.  What little hands do not create!  These are flowers, animals, fairy-tale characters and even cartoon characters.  They occupy an honorable place among the crafts of the child, which are carefully kept by parents.  But not all figures can be made by a small sculptor independently, for example, a dinosaur.  Therefore, parents come to the aid of the child.  There are many variations of such figures.  All of them are molded quite simply.  The child can be offered to make a good dinosaur with flowers, a stegosaurus, a brachiosaurus or a predatory dimetrodon.  Such a beast from a cone will originally look. </p><h2>  How to mold a dinosaur from plasticine? </h2><p>  An excellent gift for a grandmother or mother will be a figure of a cute dinosaur with a bouquet of flowers.  It can be any color - yellow, blue, green or red.  Having chosen a plasticine bar, you need to divide it into three equal parts, from which the head, trunk and legs with tail will be made.  The first piece must be divided with a knife as follows: first, also in three equal parts, and then one of the resulting pieces - in another three parts.  Of the two smallest pieces, the front paws are obtained, and of the two larger ones, the hind legs.  The two remaining largest pieces must be molded together, rolled up with a sausage and extended so that the dinosaur forms a head with a neck, a trunk and a tail. </p>

    <p>  Then you need to do the hind legs.  To do this, take two smaller pieces, give them a cylindrical shape, stretch them a little from below, and flatten them from above.  The front legs are made even easier - just roll the small pieces into sausages and slightly press them down.  Now you can collect a dinosaur, in the course of work, smoothing out all the roughness and roughness on the surface of his body.  Only a small piece of plasticine remains unused.  It is needed for the crest on the back and for the eyes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Having plucked two tiny pieces from this part, from the remaining plasticine we form a lot of balls that need to be placed on the back of the dinosaur and flattened a little.  The comb is ready.  With a knife on plasticine or sticks, holes for nostrils are made, fingers and jaws are cut out.  Teeth, eyes and claws are made of white plasticine.  And of the two remaining pieces - the eyelids.  Now it remains only to mold a bouquet and put it in the clutches of a dinosaur. </p><h2>  Another variant </h2><p>  How to mold a plasticine dinosaur with a trunk from a cone?  Very simple.  You need a spruce or pine cone and plasticine.  A dinosaur can be monochrome or, conversely, bright.  Having decided on the color scheme, you can begin to sculpt the components of the body.  Everything is simple here.  It is necessary to roll a ball for the head, make the neck from a cylindrical workpiece.  For the tail, a small sausage with one pointed end is suitable.  Four ovals for the paws and many small balls for the crest on the neck and tail are needed.  Now it remains only to collect all the details together.  The craft is ready. </p><h2>  Stegosaurus </h2><p>  This is the most popular dinosaur among children.  To sculpt it, you will need green plasticine, a knife, toothpicks and a stack - a tool for working with plasticine.  First, you should prepare the individual parts of the body in the form of balls - the body, head, tail and four legs.  The head must be oval, the body teardrop-shaped.  Then connect them and lengthen the neck a little.  Then attach the tail to the body of the dinosaur and carefully stretch it, observing the proportions.  Roll the four remaining small balls into sausages.  Attach the hind legs to the body with an overlap to create the appearance of the hips, and the front legs under the body.  All fasteners need to be smoothed out. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Now you can begin to look like a dinosaur.  Outgrowths are made on his back with tweaks, which then need to be given a pointed shape.  On the head, you need to make an incision for the mouth with a knife, and on the paws - fingers.  The nostrils are made with a toothpick, and the eye holes with a stack.  After that, it remains to insert small balls into the recesses and draw a needle with a scale on the body of the dinosaur.  In the mouth, you can insert the tongue, molded from red plasticine.  The result was a very attractive dinosaur.  If you attach wings to him, he will turn into a dragon. </p><h2>  Brachiosaurus </h2><p>  How to mold a dinosaur from plasticine?  Not particularly difficult.  We suggest you make brachiosaurus.  The technique of its implementation is slightly different.  This <span>long-necked dinosaur is</span> often seen in pictures.  The kid can easily make his figure on his own under the supervision of his father or mother.  As usual, you need to divide the bar of plasticine into six pieces - large (torso), slightly smaller (head with neck) and four small (paws), then roll them into balls.  A large ball for the body needs to be shaped like an oval, and the ball for the head should be rolled into a long sausage and a toothpick inserted into it, otherwise the neck will not hold.  From the four remaining small balls, make cylinders pointed at one end.  Insert toothpicks into them too.  Cut a mouth on the head and put a tongue made of red plasticine into it.  Then attach two white balls - eyes.  On the legs make fingers.  Now you can collect the figure and smooth out all the joints of the parts.  If you stick wings to such a dinosaur and make a comb on its back, it will become like a dragon. </p>

    <p>  How to mold a dimetrodon dinosaur from plasticine?  His figure fits perfectly into the collection of the baby.  First you need to make the details, from which the dinosaur will then be fashioned.  For the head you need an oval ball, for the tail - an elongated sausage, pointed on one side, four small cylinders for the legs and a large sail comb for the back.

Having formed the head and paws, you need to insert toothpicks in them, so that then you can connect all the parts together.  Insert teeth and tongue into the incision on the head, and make eyes and nostrils on top.  Stick a sail-comb on the back, apply small strips of plasticine - claws on the paws.  When everything is ready, connect all parts of the body and smooth the joints. </p><p>  Here are such wonderful dinosaurs from clay.
