  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to reflash the phone and is it possible to do it yourself?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Modern mobile phones have enormous capabilities, thanks to which a person can use a large number of the most various services.  However, as <span>scientific and technological progress</span> goes forward in huge steps, sometimes there is a need for a flashing of the phone in order to increase its capabilities.  In addition, the need for a flashing also arises if the old mobile phone software started to fail, or if it is just outdated and does not meet modern requirements. </p><p>  That is why many are interested in <span>how to reflash the phone</span> and is it possible to carry out this operation on their own?  It should be noted right away that this is quite within the power of an ordinary person who is familiar with <span>computer technology</span> and has sufficient knowledge in the field of information technology.  Even if you do not have the relevant information, you can always draw the necessary knowledge using the Internet and specialized forums and sites dedicated to this topic. </p><p>  So, in order to reflash the phone, first of all, you should familiarize yourself with the terminology, knowing which you can understand what is at stake: </p><ul><li>  Flex is a file system that is used on a mobile phone and which stores the address book, phones, sounds, games, ringtones and various applications. </li><li>  LangPack is a language utility that includes fonts, languages, and translators.  If you need to Russify your phone or fix translation flaws, this software package will provide an invaluable service </li><li>  Reflash (Reflash) - used to update the software, and all the settings of the mobile phone are saved. </li><li>  Fullflash (full flash) - includes all the above packages, as well as add-ons in the form of various programs, games and multimedia applications that are not included in the standard phone package. </li></ul><p>  Now, knowing the basic terms and concepts, you can already navigate how to reflash the phone for those parameters that you need. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On special sites you can find all the necessary programs and applications that may be useful for a mobile phone. </p><p>  To implement the flashing process, we need the following: </p><ul><li>  mobile phone; </li><li>  laptop or computer; </li><li>  data cable; </li><li>  necessary drivers for mobile phone and data cable; </li><li>  current firmware version of the mobile phone. </li></ul><p>  When <span>flashing the phone</span> , the software is completely replaced in it, after which it can already be used as a new phone.  For a better understanding of the process, a mobile phone can be compared to a computer or laptop.  Like a computer, a mobile phone contains a <span>central processor,</span> random access memory (ROM), a keyboard and a screen.  If the computer has a BIOS (a basic input / output system for information that launches, tests and controls technical devices), then SW acts as its counterpart in a mobile phone. </p><p>  Today, many companies know how to reflash the phone of almost all models, so if you want to change the configuration of your mobile phone, this is quite feasible.  You can perform this process yourself, but you need to know one important rule: before flashing your phone, you must make a backup copy of existing software.  Technically, this operation is called Back up.  Thanks to it, you can always return old software with all existing settings without the risk of losing important data. </p><p>  It is enough to simply reflash the Chinese phone, since it, in comparison with European manufacturers, contains much less difficulties in the work of the software.  Due to the mass production of Chinese mobile phones, as well as their low price, manufacturers are trying not to complicate the software applications in them very much. </p><p>  Summing up all of the above, it can be noted that there is nothing complicated in the flashing of a mobile phone itself, however, for its correct implementation it is necessary to have certain knowledge.  If you comply with all safety requirements for the safety of information on your mobile phone, you can not worry.  Thus, now we know <span>how to reflash the phone</span> and what is needed for this. </p>
