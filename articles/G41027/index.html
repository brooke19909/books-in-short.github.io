    <p>  In the winter of 2006, the first batch of money with the image on the reverse of St. George the Victorious entered the free market.  The coin came out in a circulation of one hundred and fifty thousand pieces.  After that, a decision was made to temporarily suspend production and resume it if necessary.  With this amount, the government hoped to replenish the gold reserves that the famous Chervonets had provided to it so far.  Such a marketing move was quite successful and a little later, Russian citizens were able to see already silver George the Victorious.  The coin appeared for the first time in 2009 and quickly went hand in hand. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Successful investment </h2><p>  Oddly enough, but immediately there were a lot of people who wanted to buy gold coins ‚ÄúGeorge the Victorious‚Äù.  The price in 2006 was relatively small.  In the branch of any bank, it could be purchased for 10-15 thousand rubles.  If we talk about the income of the average Russian, then such an amount in those years could seem quite significant.  But this is not about everyday purchases, but about long-term investment.  And gold has always been the most successful way to preserve the available capital.  Over time, the situation in the country has changed.  Of course, the international situation also had its effect, which slightly shook the domestic economy.  To normalize the situation, the government decided to again mint gold coins "George the Victorious."  The price of them has risen slightly, and now one copy will cost about 25 thousand rubles. </p>

    <p>  This is a reasonable price.  In addition, it should be borne in mind that in such a coin, with a total weight of 7.89 grams, 7.78 grams of pure precious metal are contained.  And at a market value of over 22 thousand.  It is clear that such an investment can be considered quite successful. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Execution options </h2><p>  Over the past ten years, the golden "George the Victorious" was minted in two different versions.  These were coins in denominations of 50 and 100 rubles.  In the second case, the weight of each specimen was accordingly doubled.  Each hundred-ruble coin contained 15.55 grams of pure gold.  Naturally, its price amounted to 50.5 thousand rubles. </p>

    <p>  Externally, coins are practically no different from each other.  On the reverse is an image of a sculpture by the artist Baklanov, where St. George, sitting astride a horse, strikes with an spear an evil serpent.  On the obverse, the coke is usually in the center depicts a double-headed eagle with the inscription under the wings of "BANK OF RUSSIA", enclosed in a ring of dots.  At the top is the value of the face value, at the bottom is the year of manufacture, on the left is the name of the valuable metal indicating its exact test, and on the right is the amount of this metal in grams.  This money in different amounts was issued by both the Moscow and St. Petersburg mints.  Moreover, the trademark of each of them was indicated on the right side of the obverse. </p><h2>  Sales volumes </h2><p>  For all this time, a lot of such coins have been issued.  Moreover, over the years, their number has constantly changed.  At first in 2006 there were only 150,000 of them.  Then in 2007 it became 500,000, in 2008 - 630,000, and in 2009 - 1,500,000.  Since 2010, the volume of output amounted to only 640,000, in 2013 - 500,000, in 2014 - 300,000, and in 2015 - only 30,000 pieces.  But not all of the coins on sale can boast of decent quality.  Fifty-ruble specimens are known in which over time traces of partial oxidation appear during storage.  This production defect was allowed when minting at the St. Petersburg <span>Mint.</span>  Basically, quality specimens were on sale.  Those who wish to make a reliable purchase, it is better to purchase Sberbank coins.  "George the Victorious" is available there in all versions.  A decent quality is supported by a reasonable price. </p>
