Through WesternUnion, Contact, MoneyGram, you can receive and send a transfer to any country in the world.  More than 20 years ago, another major player appeared on the market - the Golden Crown.  Online translation is available to residents in <span>the CIS countries</span> and beyond.  Minimum commissions, fast transactions, an extensive network of branches in which you can make a payment - these are not all the advantages of the system.  Read more about how and where to get the Golden Crown translation in this article. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The payment system was founded in 1993 in Novosibirsk.  Initially, it set up a brand of Russian plastic cards.  After 10 years, the eponymous money transfer system was developed.  So today there are two services "Golden Crown": </p><ul><li>  translation through the Internet; </li><li>  bank cards. </li></ul>

    <p>  Two years ago, the system received <span>socially</span> significant <span>status</span> : the number of payments for three consecutive months exceeded 100 billion rubles.  The developed network includes 500 partner banks and 40 thousand customer service points operating <span>in Ukraine, Russia,</span> other CIS countries, as well as Greece, China, Israel, etc. Through them, you can send payments to more than 200 countries of the world. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Transactions </h2><p>  The transfer through the Golden Crown system is carried out instantly, without opening an account, in three currencies: rubles, dollars and euros.  Tariffs are low (0.5-1.5%) and depend on the amount and the recipient country.  In many regions there are restrictions on the maximum allowable commission, that is, it is more profitable to send large transfers. </p><p>  Transfer limits are set depending on the currency legislation and the <span>requirements of the payment</span> system.  Today they amount to 600 thousand rubles, 20 000 dollars, 15 thousand euros.  In Russia, such internal restrictions apply: for a day a resident can send to another country an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $ 5,000. </p><h2>  How to transfer? </h2><p>  It is necessary to contact any service point with a passport and the required amount on hand, give the operator the name, country, city, pay for the transaction.  The transfer number indicated on the check must be reported to the recipient.  The fee is paid by the sender. </p>

    <p>  When making a transaction, branch employees may offer to issue a card to expedite the process.  It can be used to send payments through self-service cash kiosks.  They work the same way as any other terminals: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Insert the card into the machine. </li><li>  Enter the PIN code. </li><li>  Select a recipient from the list of available regions, which is determined when the card is issued. </li><li>  Indicate the currency of the transfer. </li><li>  Enter cash (cash only accepts rubles). </li><li>  Confirm transfer. </li></ol><p>  Based on the results of the transaction, a check will be printed with the transaction number, amount and recipient. </p><p>  The card significantly speeds up the process, since it stores all the data of the sender.  They do not have to be re-entered on the application forms. </p><h2>  Alert </h2><p>  A big advantage of the system is the free SMS-notification service about the transfer.  To use it, you need to record two phone numbers in the application form: the sender and the recipient.  The service is also convenient in that the message immediately indicates the transfer number, that is, it is not required to re-record or memorize it. </p>

    <p>  The card can be used abroad.  You do not need to enter a PIN code to confirm the payment.  It is enough to sign on the check.  However, it is not worth storing large funds in the account.  Since the card is not registered, fraudsters can use the money if it is lost.  Having this payment instrument, you can transfer funds in cash and from the account.  If the sender and the recipient have a card, then to fill out an application, it is enough to indicate its number and name of the holder. </p><h2>  Benefits of a Payment System </h2><ol><li>  Speed.  The transfer is available immediately after the number is assigned.  Only the mode of operation of local points of issue should be taken into account. </li><li>  Convenience.  Transactions are addressless.  Mandatory details for sending only the country and city.  The recipient selects the pick-up point himself.  Data can be changed if the payment is sent but not paid.  But for this you have to contact the branch. </li><li>  Alert.  You can track the status of the application through the website of the payment system or via SMS-informing.  After processing the payment, the parties to the transaction receive messages about the completion of the process.  For comparison: UNIStream users must send a message about the transfer on their own, Western Union charges an additional fee for this service. </li><li>  Simplicity.  Although the amount of the transfer without opening a <span>bank account</span> is limited by the currency legislation of the country, they are generally quite high. </li><li>  Reliability.  <span>The</span> payment is <span>stored</span> in the system for 60 days. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transfer gold crown privatbank" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/722014.jpg" width="550"></div></li></ol><h2>  Golden Crown in Ukraine </h2><p>  The system has been operating since 2006, only WesternUnion is second in popularity.  The limit on the transaction amount per transaction is 15 thousand UAH or the equivalent in foreign currency.  The legislation sets a limit of 50 thousand UAH.  In Ukraine, you can also apply for a card for frequent transfers.  You can only get it at a partner bank, and use it at self-service terminals with a cash-in function.  The commission for payment to the CIS countries is 0.5-1%, to other states - 1.5%. </p><p>  Which institution is better to issue the translation of the "Golden Crown"?  PrivatBank.  It is not only a well-developed network of organization branches.  You can receive and send a transfer through the Privat24 system without leaving your home.  A transaction is completed in 2-3 minutes, and money is credited to the card instantly. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>
