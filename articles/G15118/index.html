This ratio allows the driver of the vehicle to get a discount for non-collision driving.  At the same time, annually for a trouble-free driving, the discount for the driver increases and the cost of OSAGO decreases. </p><p>  There are special ways to verify insurance history data, thanks to which you can verify the correctness of the calculation of this indicator.  Such verification can be carried out in specially developed unified databases, which are created for information, control over the quality of the provided insurance services and receive some discounts and bonuses. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.advantageinsagents.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out KBM driver" class="if uuid-2955099" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/2955099.jpg"></div><p>  How to find out a driver‚Äôs KBM is interesting to many. </p><h2>  What is the ‚Äúbonus malus" for? </h2><p>  The indicator coefficient "bonus malus" is needed in order to correctly calculate the price of the insurance policy.  At the same time, the concept of ‚Äúdriver class‚Äù is used simultaneously with the KBM.  Each class has a specific bonus-malus coefficient.  The driver, who first acquires OSAGO insurance, gets 3rd grade and KBM, which is equal to 1. In the future, this coefficient is calculated according to a special table that is available for use by employees of insurance companies and on Internet sites.  Not everyone knows how to find out <span>the</span> driver‚Äôs <span>MSC class.</span> If the driver did not become the culprit of the accident during the current year, his class is increased by 1, and the MSC coefficient is reduced.  If this driver caused one or several accidents on the road due to which the insurance company paid other participants of the incident, the driver‚Äôs class decreases and the cost of mandatory motor insurance increases next year. The total cost of mandatory motor insurance does not only depend on this ratio and find out You can use the OSAGO calculator. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.kommersant.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="KBM driver" class="if uuid-2956689" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/2956689.jpg"></div><h2>  How to find out the KBM driver? </h2><p>  You can find out the KBM indicator for each driver through a special table that can be found on the Internet: </p><p>  The calculation starts with a line of class 3. For each trouble-free year, you must go down to the line below.  Each accident year should go to the line that corresponds to the number of insurance payments.  If the driver has not been included in the CTP for a year, then his class is 3. During the application of an open policy (with an unlimited number of drivers), the KBM changes only directly for the owner of the vehicle.  The remaining drivers cannot be considered inscribed in the insurance. </p><p>  Here's how to find out your KBM and driver class for CTP. </p><h2>  Theoretical values </h2><p>  It should be noted that this table only helps to obtain the theoretical values ‚Äã‚Äãof the MSC.  In practice, this value is often much higher than in theoretical calculations.  This is due to the fact that cunning insurers sometimes deliberately do not add MSCs to the PCA database, and they do this in order to get more money for the same insurance.  At the same time, drivers who are poorly versed in this topic and who have not previously calculated the OSAGO price easily fall for the hook of an unscrupulous manager. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Invalid calculation </h2><p>  Practice shows that when buying OSAGO insurance, the cost of the policy is incorrectly calculated in almost every second case.  If we consider each of these cases separately, it turns out that managers only make random errors.  And yet, in practice, such a deception seems to be systematic. </p><p>  How to find out which KBM the driver has, we told. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kodainsurancegroup.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out which kbm the driver" class="if uuid-2955095" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/2955095.jpg"></div><h2>  Ways to check your insurance history </h2><p>  It‚Äôs not a secret for drivers that the cost of compulsory motor third-party liability insurance is substantially dependent on ‚Äúbonus-malus‚Äù coefficients, and it, in turn, consists of indicators of driving experience, age and accident rate, and is stored in the RSA database. However, besides this database there is one system called the Bureau of Insurance Stories.  This is an automated information database that stores data on transport insurance contracts.  BSI is not a commercial organization and its main purpose is to obtain reliable data on motor insurance contracts.  The creator of the PCA bureau, which finances and supports this project. The main goal of the BSI is to identify fraudsters who deceive insurers.  This is due to the fact that until the creation of a single database, many customers could hide the presence of insured events when concluding an insurance contract and thus receive a discount for accident-free driving. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="lawecon.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out the kbm driver class" class="if uuid-2956687" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/2956687.jpg"></div><h2>  Is it free? </h2><p>  PCA, which is the main operator of BSI, does not charge for the placement and storage of information.  As part of its functionality, insurance companies, individual clients and the Central Bank can receive information from BSI absolutely free.  Thus, insurance institutions can independently check for the presence and absence of an insured event, and apply the appropriate coefficient when calculating the size of the insurance premium.  According to MTPL agreements, a client can count on a 5% discount for each accident-free year.  Under CASCO terms, such a discount is established individually and varies from 5 to 20%. </p><p>  Drivers with the introduction of a unified database got a good opportunity to follow their own insurance history without fear that the data will disappear when changing the insurance organization.  Thus, in 2016, many such organizations left the services market, however, their customers were not significantly affected, due to the storage of their individual data in a single information database. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.iii.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out the driver‚Äôs KBM at the Rosgosstrakh base" class="if uuid-2955101" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/2955101.jpg"></div><p>  How to check the driver‚Äôs KBM on the basis of "Rosgosstrakh", we will describe below. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  The undeniable advantage of its creation is the ability to obtain reliable information about each client, regardless of which insurance company he purchased the policy from.  According to the current legislation, the policyholder can only issue one insurance policy for one car, and in the event of an insured event compensation payments are made once.  Earlier, before the creation of AIS BSI, many scammers could acquire several insurance contracts from different companies for one car and received insurance payments immediately from all these companies. </p><p>  In most cases, accidents were intentionally adjusted in order to receive cash payments.  However, since the development of a single base, the history of car insurance has become publicly available.  Before applying for an insurance policy, an independent agent or employee of an insurance company checks for the presence of existing contracts for this motor vehicle subject to compulsory insurance.  If the insurance contract has already been drawn up, then the registration of a new document is denied, preventing fraudulent activities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.unitedautoinsurance.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="find out the driver‚Äôs cbm" class="if uuid-2955094" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/2955094.jpg"></div><p>  It is not difficult to recognize a driver‚Äôs KBM for compulsory motor liability insurance. </p><h2>  KBM verification form </h2><p>  To do this, you must enter the full name  driver‚Äôs date of birth, number and series of driver‚Äôs license.  In the case where the series of certificates contains letters, it is entered in English.  Next, enter the date from which the driver plans to conclude an insurance contract.  After that, the verification code is to be entered and the "Search" button is pressed.  As a result, a page opens showing the real indicators of the MSC contained in the SAR database. </p><p>  If the obtained value coincides with that which was theoretically calculated using the table, then this means that everything is in order.  If the check gave the wrong result, then the policyholder will have to restore the MSC. </p><p>  How to find a driver‚Äôs KBM based on the Rosgosstrakh base?  Make it easy.  On the official website of the company you need to find the appropriate section.  The system will offer to check the bonus malus and automatically redirect to the PCA database. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.asibrokers.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to check the driver‚Äôs KBM on the basis of Rosgosstrakh" class="if uuid-2955098" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/2955098.jpg"></div><h2>  Tips: how to restore KBM? </h2><p>  First of all, it is necessary to find out at what stage this or that error was made in the calculation of the KBM.  To do this, take all available insurance policies or start a search.  It should be noted that insurance ratios change periodically.  You need to start from the last year and check the cost of the policy annually with the results of calculations on the calculator.  If the client conducts such checks once a year, then the error will be found in the last valid policy.  If a person has not previously checked the cost, then the error may appear in any of the policies, and there may even be several. </p><p>  We looked at how to recognize the driver of the KBM. </p>
