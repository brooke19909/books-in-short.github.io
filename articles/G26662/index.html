That is why tourists traveling to Thailand ask tour operators the question: is there a water park in Phuket?  The island has an excellent water amusement park, which is worth a visit to all vacationers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water park in phuket" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1174950.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the island of Phuket is famous for its marvelous nature, luxurious well-groomed beaches, locals and guests have long been waiting for the appearance of a park here, in which you could slide off a dizzying water slide or swim in the pool.  Their dream came true in 2010, when a new water park in Phuket - Splash Jungle was opened.  Its name can be translated as "spray of the jungle" or "splash of the jungle." </p><p>  A water park was built in Thailand (Phuket) by a company that was famous at the time for the construction of the famous Disneyland, so it is not surprising that the attractions there are of the highest level.  The creators of this amazing building used the latest technologies in the field of construction, computer animation, the latest materials. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Phuket hotel with water park" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1174945.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Today, any resident, as well as guests of the island of Phuket can visit this wonderful water amusement park, receiving vivid impressions that will long remain in their memory.  Splash Jungle can accommodate more than two thousand people at a time.  Water in the water park comes from an artesian well.  Previously, it goes through several stages of purification.  This avoids various skin irritations that can be caused by too much chlorine in the water. </p><h2>  Description of the complex </h2><p>  The water park in Phuket covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãtwenty-two thousand square meters.  Undoubtedly, this complex is not as large as its analogues in Turkey, Cyprus or Spain.  The water park in Phuket is distinguished by its magnificent and diverse attractions, original designer finds and the unusual atmosphere that reigns here from the moment of opening. </p><p>  This was appreciated by tourists from Europe, Russia and other countries.  The entire space of the park is divided into several thematic sections.  Each of them is dedicated to one country or part of the world.  Continents reflect the culture of different countries at a certain point in their development. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thailand water park phuket" class="if" height="416" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1174949.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Surely it will be interesting for vacationers to travel to the jungles of Africa, find themselves on the cold ice of Antarctica or try to unravel the mysterious world of the ancient Mayan civilization.  Continents can be visited on a rubber ring on the Lazy River.  Its length is three hundred thirty-five meters, and it carries its waters along a route that will show you the full beauty of each country. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, do not hope that you will just calmly swim along the river.  Behind each turn you can expect something new and unusual - a rumbling waterfall or picturesque grottoes and mysterious caves. </p><h2>  Rides </h2><p>  The rides at Splash Jungle are for park visitors of all ages.  There are about fifteen of them.  For adults, there are five large slides.  Let's take a closer look at the two most popular attractions. </p><p>  At Superbowl you will be offered to ride on a rubber ring on a tube.  From it you will fall into a huge rotating bowl.  You ride a little in it, and then a large funnel in the middle of the bowl will suck you in.  A few seconds of flight, then fall - and you find yourself in the pool, which is located under the bowl. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="is there a water park in phuket" class="if" height="221" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1174948.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Boomerango is a huge slide, shaped like the letter U. Guests come down from it on a cylinder (there are double cylinders).  At first you will fall vertically down, and then rapidly soar up.  And so in a row several times.  Sometimes it seems that you can leave the limits of the attraction.  But do not worry: everything is designed perfectly here.  Children below 122 cm tall will not be allowed into such an attraction. </p><p>  The water park in Phuket also has other slides, pipes (closed and open).  In closed structures, absolutely nothing is visible, you can only guess where the top is and where the bottom is.  In open pipes, the descent is calmer. </p><p>  Today, many tourists come with children to Thailand.  Waterpark (Phuket) has provided entertainment for younger guests.  A special territory is equipped for them here.  Here, children of any age will find suitable entertainment for themselves.  On this territory there are three slides in a fabulous town with waterfalls, ladders, fountains and a huge barrel.  As soon as it is filled with water, it turns over and the children find themselves under a grand shower.  Parents can be calm: experienced instructors and lifeguards watch the children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="new water park in phuket" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1174944.jpg" width="600"></div>
