In one dish, 4 tastes were incomprehensibly combined: salty and sweet, sour and spicy - thus creating a real culinary masterpiece. </p><p>  Be sure to try the "Som Tam" (Som Tam) - the most famous Thai salad, which combines sweetness, salinity and indescribable spicy aroma.  It is served with crab meat or with fermented fish sauce. </p><p>  For lunch, the best choice is Pad Si Eyyu - this is rice noodles fried in a wok with pork, garlic and broccoli, seasoned with soy sauce.

The main thing is not to forget to remind the chefs that they cook the dish not spicy, because the European habits of moderation of spices are unlikely to let you taste the dish itself with an abundance of chili peppers.

    <h2>  Kata - The Pearl of Phuket </h2><p>  Hotel Alpina Phuket Nalina Resort &amp; Spa 4 * is located 700 meters from the magnificent <span>Kata Beach.</span>  Of course, the path from the hotel to the beach can be overcome on foot, admiring the green streets.  But the hotel takes care of its guests, so it is better to use a comfortable free hotel bus, which takes you to the beach in 3 minutes.  It runs every hour during the day. </p><p>  Kata Beach is one of the best in Phuket.  It is clean and beautiful.  Thickets of casuarine trees protect from sun and heat.  The sand is small and silky, and the descent into the water is gentle and pleasant.  Stones rarely come across in the water, mostly the bottom is strewn with the same gentle sand as the beach itself. </p><p>  Here everyone will find entertainment to their liking: there are points for renting equipment for yachting and windsurfing, surfing, you can rent <span>water skis</span> and ride a banana.  And in the northern part of the beach there is a coral reef with bright inhabitants, which will not leave indifferent fans of diving and snorkeling. </p><p>  It is so convenient to sit on a deck chair, contemplate the azure expanse of the sea and relax from swimming or surfing.  The waiters will bring drinks and snacks directly to the deck chair. </p>
