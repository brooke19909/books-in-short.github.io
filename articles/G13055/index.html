    <p>  All of us, as a rule, like to listen to our favorite music while driving.  But what if the car was purchased without a radio?  <span>How to connect a radio</span> at home?  This article will explain to you how and what to do so that you do not have to go to a car service. </p><p>  As a rule, cars with minimal equipment are bought in order to save money, since not everyone has money for additional devices for their own entertainment.  And then one day, you still bought yourself the desired device in the car.  A reasonable question arises: "How to install the radio?".  All we need in this situation is some tools, free time and the desire to follow our instructions below. </p><p>  Action one </p><p>  Naturally, the manufacturer can equip a car even of the cheapest assembly with at least a groove for this radio itself.  Some even install a standard list of devices from 2 or 4 speakers and an antenna.  Therefore, the first thing we need to know is whether this same kit is available.  Otherwise, you have to buy it separately. </p><p>  Action two </p><p>  Having learned the vehicle equipment, we understand what we have and what we lack.  We go to choose the radio.  You can buy it at any electronics and car goods store.  There you can get an initial consultation on how to connect the radio to a car.  Our recommendations regarding the selection of the brand of the device are reduced to the following list of the most popular manufacturing companies: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Pioneer; </li><li>  Alpine </li><li>  Kenwood; </li><li>  JVC; </li><li>  Blaupunkt; </li><li>  Nakamichi. </li></ul><p>  As a rule, the devices of these companies are not cheap, but this is fully compensated by sound quality and reliability in operation.  In case you need a budget version, then the products of the following companies will suit you: Sony, Prology, Mystery.  It is worth noting that the products of these companies do not differ in special quality and sound, but they successfully compensate for their shortcomings by the presence of USB, outputs for speakers and an amplifier, etc.  As for the speakers, it can be devices of the brand Pioneer, JBL, Hertz, Kicx or something cheaper. </p><p>  Action Three </p><p>  So we are ready for the main action - the installation of stereo equipment in the car.  Before starting the process, it is necessary to check the presence of connectors for connecting acoustics, power, etc., as well as metal skids.  It is worth noting that the last of the list is intended for mounting the <span>radio into the car.</span>  The most difficult thing is how to <span>connect the radio,</span> will find the appropriate wires.  If there is a marking, then the problem is almost solved.  As a rule, it remains only to connect everything correctly.  Fortunately, in this situation, you can rely on a single system for <span>marking wires</span> and their purpose. </p><p>  Next in our article on how to connect a radio, we will describe this very marking.  The red wire gives a positive voltage of 12 V, the ignition is fed from this wire.  The yellow wire also supplies 12 V ‚Äúplus‚Äù phase, the power comes from the battery.  The black wire is the ‚Äúminus‚Äù of the whole car, it is connected to the ‚Äúminus‚Äù phase of the battery.  The blue wire supplies 12 V of power to the antenna, it works when the radio is turned on.  White, gray, green and purple wires with black shading feed the speakers. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that in some cases, this markup may not coincide with the above information.  By the way, they can come in handy when there is no wiring output to the groove for the radio.  In this situation, you will have to dismantle the interior trim yourself and look for this wiring.  As a rule, there are no difficulties with this.  Wires are most often found on doors, ceilings, and floors.  It is worth noting that in this situation you will have to lay wiring for the antenna and speakers yourself.  In general, this is all that can be told on the topic "how to connect the radio." </p>
