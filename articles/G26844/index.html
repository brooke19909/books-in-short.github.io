Despite the joke known in the USSR that Bulgaria is not abroad, it was previously considered a great success to relax in the resorts of this East European country.  Today in Bulgarian hotels you can meet not only Russians, tourists from Western Europe also managed to appreciate the clean beaches, the gentle climate and low prices of the Black Sea cities of this country. </p><p>  There are not so many inexpensive hotels operating on the all inclusive system in the Bulgarian resorts, as in the usual Russians of Egypt or Turkey.  Tourists planning to relax in the all-inclusive hotel should pay attention to the Perla Golden Sands 3 * hotel, located in the resort town of Golden Sands.  What is a three-star <span>all inclusive</span> in Bulgarian?  Do tourists staying at Perla Golden Sands often recommend this hotel (for reviews and prices for 2016, see the article below)? </p>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Relaxation on a good sandy beach is what the guests of the 3 * Perla Hotel (Bulgaria) come first of all.  Golden Sands is a city that is actually one long beach, along which a tourist area with hotels, shops, restaurants and entertainment facilities is built.  The hotel is 300-400 m from the coastal strip. The road to the beach is a busy street with shops and cafes, so the path to the sea becomes a rather fascinating walk.  Despite this, some hotel guests believe that a 10-15 minute walk to the sea is far, and therefore prefer to go this way on a local tram. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Golden Sands resort beach is marked with the Blue Flag.  Sea water and coastal territory even in the "hot" tourist season remain relatively clean.  On the beach there are diving instructors and rental equipment for water sports, sea attractions and pleasure boats. </p>

    <h2>  Animation and leisure </h2><p>  Animation at the hotel, that is, the organization of entertainment events and active leisure, is declared on the websites of tour operators in the hotel information.  However, the former guests of Perla Golden Sands 3 *, whose reviews can be found on the corresponding resources, do not tell anything about the work of animators.  Moreover, several tourists directly declare that no one in the hotel organizes entertainment.  In separate reviews there are references to performances with “live” music in the hotel bar, with a good performer and high-quality sound. </p><p>  There are no particular indignations about the lack of animators in the reviews - there are so many entertainment venues, attractions and places for walking in the Golden Sands resort and in Varna that there is no time to sit in the hotel. </p><h2>  Sport, beauty, health </h2><p>  One of the visiting cards of Golden Sands resort is natural thermal springs with sulphurous water.  Thanks to this gift of nature, the town is known for its balneotherapy centers.  You can visit such an institution on your own or with a guided tour from the hotel. </p><p>  In addition, in the hotel you can get procedures in the beauty salon, visit the massage room or gym.  In Perla Golden Sands 3 * there is a billiard room, a sauna, a jacuzzi bath.  But it is worth considering that most of the services offered at the hotel are paid, therefore it is better to familiarize yourself with the additional price list in advance. </p><h2>  Vacation with children </h2><p>  Does it make sense to come with children to Golden Sands?  Golden Sands Perla 3 * is first of all declared as a family hotel, therefore additional conditions are offered for a comfortable stay of tourists with children: </p><ul><li>  Babysitting service. </li><li>  Crib in the room. </li><li>  Baby seat in a hotel restaurant. </li><li>  Playground on site. </li><li>  Children's pool section with water slides. </li></ul><p>  In addition, on the sites of some tour operators there is information about a children's mini-club.  There is no information or feedback on his work. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews of tourists about living conditions </h2><p>  Most of the former guests of Perla Golden Sands 3 * admit that the hotel is quite consistent with the cost of rooms.  It is also ideal for tourists who need a hotel room to spend the night, have breakfast quickly and spend the whole day on the beach or in the city.  What did the hotel guests like about Perla ("Perla") 3 *, <span>(Golden Sands, Bulgaria)?</span>  <span>Reviews of</span> satisfied tourists recommending a hotel most often mention the following facts: </p><ul><li>  Many enjoyed eating at the hotel and cafe in the resort town.  It is often said about the hotel kitchen that with not the most varied choice of dishes, no one is left hungry.  All products are served in sufficient quantities, tables are replenished. </li><li>  Remoteness of the hotel from night clubs and noisy discos.  All entertainment venues in the city center or Varna can be easily reached by taxi, and then return to your room and relax without extraneous noise. </li><li>  The absence of the main problem of tourists is the “language barrier”.  Most of the staff can speak Russian or understand Russian.  As, however, hotel guests from Russia understand Bulgarian.  Not bad at the hotel and with knowledge of the German language. </li></ul>

    <p>  What are the disadvantages of staying at Perla Golden Sands 3 * that former guests most often recall in their reviews? </p><ul><li>  The first place in the number of complaints is taken by the condition of the rooms and the quality of cleaning.  Repeatedly left reviews about not too thorough cleaning, stains on towels, lack of toiletries.  In fairness, it should be noted that there are a lot of positive reviews about the condition of the rooms. </li><li>  The lack of a hairdryer in the room. </li><li>  Shutdowns and slow Wi-Fi. </li><li>  It is difficult to find a hotel employee who knows English. </li><li>  The most controversial point: restrained staff behavior.  Someone really lacks a friendly smile at the reception or at the bar. </li><li>  Someone from the tourists noticed that in the hotel restaurant on the "buffet" there may be processed foods that were not eaten at the previous meal.  For example, a dinner casserole of pasta left over from dinner. </li><li>  Complaints about noisy neighbors.  Some guests are not lucky to live next to noisy teenage or youth companies from Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Romania.  The hotel administration does not always calm down such guests, but you can ask to change the room. </li></ul>
