    <h2>  Petsamo-Kirkenes operation (briefly) </h2><p>  In accordance with the plan, it was supposed during the first week, using a deep roundabout maneuver, to clamp down the troops of the Germans from the north and south, who were defending in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãB. Zapadnaya Litsa.  In other words, Soviet forces were supposed to form a classic "cauldron".  According to historians, the Petsamo-Kirkenes operation (the start date is October 7) was planned under the influence of the Leningrad and Stalingrad battles.  During the movement of the Soviet troops, the Wehrmacht forces evacuated units from Finland and Norway.  This operation was called Nordlicht.  It, like the previous one (Birke), was conducted by Rendulich.  Subsequently, for success in them, he received the <span>Knight's Cross</span> with <span>oak leaves</span> (the highest award of the Reich).  The Petsamo-Kirkenes operation of 1944 took place in three stages.  At the first stage, the Soviet troops faced the task of breaking through the German defenses.  Then the army was to pursue the retreating invaders to Kirkenes and conduct the final battle in it.  During the movement of the Soviet units, several sea ejections were made by infantry forces and army units.  One of the landings was undertaken in Malaya Volokova Bay. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Petsamo Kirkenes operation 1944" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1228118.jpg" width="350"></div>

At the final stage of the battles of 181, a special reconnaissance detachment advanced towards the village of Liinahamari.  The port was fortified by fascist invaders and covered the capes of Romanov and Krestovy.  In the granite base of the latter, the Germans erected various fortifications, equipped firing points, dugouts, trenches, etc. On Cape Romanov, bunkers have been preserved to this day, in which there were German torpedo mounts.  From these fortifications opened a good overview of the entrance to the port.  This made it possible to torpedo any submarines or ships.  On October 12, a sabotage detachment commanded by Major Barchenko-Emelyanov and Leonov attacked German batteries located on metro Krestovoi.  The battle was short.  With minimal losses, Soviet troops captured the batteries.

The German army put up stubborn resistance.  Despite this, the forces of the Soviet forces reached the Yarfjord and captured Nickel (Kolosjoki).  Active actions of the Russian army forced the German command to speed up first, and after the air raid on Kirkenes on October 21 - to complete the evacuation.  The city ran out of fresh water, which was used primarily for steamer boilers.  On October 22, the 131st Corps launched the battle of Ha Tarnet.  Along with this, the marines, supported by artillery, carried out a sweep of the coast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Petsamo Kirkenes operation results" class="if" height="279" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1228120.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Help from local patriots </h2><p>  During the liberation of many settlements outside the USSR, the support of the Soviet army was provided by their inhabitants.  The Petsamo-Kirkenes operation was no exception.  The results of the battle of moths would be less successful if it were not for the help of local patriots.  So, forcing the Yarfjord was carried out on fishing boats and amphibians.  Norwegian patriots entered the sea on two motobots, which greatly helped the Soviet soldiers.  The locals rescued the crews of the boats, and under fire they sent soldiers to the other side.  When crossing the territory of the Elvenes Fjord, Soviet troops had to start the offensive again.  The 14th division was engaged in guidance of rafting.  Norwegian patriots helped again.  Also, local residents entered the Beck Fjord.
