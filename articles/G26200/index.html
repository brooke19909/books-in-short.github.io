For example, tourists in Nha Trang often stay at Golden Holiday Hotel Nha Trang 3 *.  Where is this hotel located?  What numbers does he offer?  What can you do while relaxing at the hotel?  Did other travelers like it here?  We will try to answer these questions in detail below. </p><h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  The modern Golden Holiday 3 * complex (Vietnam) is located in the heart of the lively Nha Trang resort.

It houses only a twelve-story residential building, an outdoor pool and a small garden.  Inside the complex, tourists can use the paid laundry, where you can hand over dirty clothes.  On the ground floor there is a 24-hour reception desk, where guests can exchange currency, buy a ticket for excursions or entertainment, rent a bicycle.  Free Wi-Fi throughout the hotel, but its speed is not too high.  There is an elevator in the hotel building, which quickly delivers guests to the desired floor. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.archdaily.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reception desk" class="if uuid-2956049" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102891/2956049.jpg"></div><p>  On the territory there is a small parking lot where tourists can leave their car for free without booking a seat in advance.  The hotel is non-smoking, but there are special smoking rooms for guests. </p><h2>  Supply system </h2><p>  The Golden Holiday 3 * hotel does not offer a large selection of concepts for its guests.  The cost of accommodation, as a rule, includes only breakfasts, which are covered in the main restaurant of the hotel.  It is located on the 12th floor of the building and also has a terrace with panoramic views of the coast and the surrounding area.  Buffet breakfast.  The menu includes international dishes: sandwiches, omelets, scrambled eggs, hot drinks, fruits, vegetables, sliced ‚Äã‚Äãsausages and cheese. </p><div class="photo" data-original="atktravel.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Restaurant" class="if uuid-2956050" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102891/2956050.jpg"></div><p>  For a fee, you can visit the restaurant during the day and evening, where all visitors are already served exclusively by the menu.  For lunch and dinner, Asian and Vietnamese dishes are served, as well as seafood and fish.  Near the pool there is a small bar where guests can enjoy refreshing drinks, cocktails and ice cream. </p><h2>  Beach and Pool </h2><p>  Golden Holiday Hotel 3 * is located on the second line of the coast, so it does not have its own beach.  But the city is only 150 meters from the complex.  To get to it, tourists will need to cross a busy road.  The beach itself is completely sandy.  Entrance to it is free, but you will have to pay separately for the rental of sun loungers and sunshades for each visit.  But the hotel staff give guests beach towels.  The entrance to the sea is gentle, so you can swim safely even with young children. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ar.hoteles.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Territory" class="if uuid-2956036" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102891/2956036.jpg"></div><p>  The hotel also has an outdoor pool filled with fresh water.  It is located directly on the roof of the building, so it offers an excellent view of the sea.  There is a sunbathing area near the pool, where tourists can use sun loungers for free. </p><h2>  Entertainment at the hotel </h2><p>  Nha Trang is a busy resort, so tourists rarely spend their free time in hotels, preferring to stroll around local attractions, markets and restaurants.  Therefore, the Golden Holiday 3 * complex does not provide its guests with a large selection of entertainment.  On the ground floor there is a common relaxation room, which is equipped with comfortable sofas, armchairs and large TVs.  Also, guests at the reception can buy a ticket for an excursion or rent equipment for snorkeling or sea fishing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="atktravel.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Open pool" class="if uuid-2956051" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102891/2956051.jpg"></div><h2>  Vacation with children </h2><p>  And although the Golden Holiday Nha Trang 3 * complex is often chosen by tourists with small children for relaxation, there are not a lot of amenities for them.  Upon request, a cradle is provided for guests to rent for free.  In the restaurant you can take high chairs for feeding.  But there are no entertainments for kids in the complex.  Therefore, parents will have to plan their leisure time on their own. </p><h2>  Positive feedback about Golden Holiday Hotel 3 * </h2><p>  It is worth noting that this hotel belongs to the budget category, so it can not boast of a first-class level of service.  But tourists who have been vacationing here earlier note in the reviews that the cost of living is consistent with the quality of service.  The hotel, of course, has disadvantages, but it also has plenty of advantages.  They recommend coming here to picky tourists who want a cheap vacation in Nha Trang.  At the same time, the main advantage of the complex is called by its guests its advantageous location, since it is located in the center of the European quarter.  After all, next to it is not only the beach, but also restaurants, a night market and shops. </p><p>  What else did tourists like in Golden Holiday 3 *?  In their reviews, they indicate the following advantages of this hotel: </p><ol><li>  A small but well-groomed and always tidy area.  The complex itself looks new and modern. </li><li>  Varied and delicious breakfasts, which serve a lot of fresh seasonal fruits and vegetables. </li><li>  Some rooms have beautiful views of the promenade and the sea. </li><li>  Towels and toiletries are always changed and replenished by the hotel staff. </li></ol><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Like other budget hotels, this complex has many disadvantages.  Picky tourists often call them insignificant and note that they liked the complex.  At the same time, other guests write that service deficiencies ruined their long-awaited vacation.  Therefore, they recommend choosing another hotel for themselves. </p><p>  In negative reviews about Golden Holiday 3 *, tourists point to the following hotel disadvantages: </p><ol><li>  Both day and night it is quite noisy, because the building is being built nearby, and in the evenings there are bars and nightclubs.  Therefore, you can not sleep with the windows open. </li><li>  Poor housekeeping.  Guests often complain about other people's hair that can be found on the floor. </li><li>  The restaurant does not have enough tables for all visitors. </li><li>  The water in the bathroom runs almost always a little warm, it is extremely rare when it is hot. </li><li>  Unscrupulous hotel employees who are trying to beg for a tip for any service.  If they are not given, then they will fulfill the request of tourists poorly. </li></ol><p>  Of course, this hotel cannot be called an ideal place to relax, as it has quite a few shortcomings.  But if you are looking for an inexpensive option for accommodation in Nha Trang near the sea, then the complex will suit you.  It can be recommended to any tourists: youth companies and families with small children. </p>
