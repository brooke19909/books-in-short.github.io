    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Design </h2><p>  The original assembly exceeded all expectations.  The case is made of aluminum, it is cast.  Due to this, the design is quite durable and light.  The speaker has a diameter of 6 mm.  Due to this, the headphones are located as close to the eardrum. </p><p>  Yamaha Eph 100, according to the manufacturer, has a fairly good sound, and the levels of distortion and reflection at the lowest possible level.  Due to some technologies, the device copes with the reproduction of high-frequency tracks. </p><p>  The wire has a length of 1 meter.  It is durable, made of elastomeric material.  Thanks to the latter, the headphones do not form loops and do not twist.  At the end of the wire is a mini-jack.  It has an L-shaped shape and its size is 3.5 mm. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The manufacturer packs the Yamaha Eph 100 headphones in a blue box.  It has a very presentable appearance that does not upset buyers.  Opening it, you can see the extension cable for 2 m, 5 nozzles, an adapter (6.3 mm), as well as a soft case for carrying headphones.  In addition to the above, the kit also included instructions. </p><p>  A two meter extension cord is a big plus, especially for those who often listen to music at home.  Sometimes the cord is categorically not enough to easily reach any thing or furniture, in which case such a device would be a good solution. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="yamaha eph 100 review" class="if" height="346" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1521629.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is natural and believable.  If you also adjust the phone for them, using the equalizer, then the sound will be very dynamic. </p><p>  Even with the fact that the frequency range that the device ‚Äúperceives‚Äù leaves much to be desired, all the tracks play perfectly.  This effect is achieved using some technologies.  The device works best with genres such as rock, jazz, and classical. </p><p>  In general, headphones are really worth the money.  However, before buying, it is better to test them so that you don‚Äôt regret for any reason. </p><h2>  Ergonomics </h2><p>  At first, headphone planting may not be right for you, but out of five tips you can really choose the one that is ideal for anyone. </p><p>  The device has a non-standard sound guide.  This, on the one hand, allows the headphones to easily sit in your ears and not fall out, as well as isolate yourself as much as possible from ambient noise.  On the other hand, it is difficult to install non-native nozzles on such a sound guide. </p><p>  The wire is quite flexible.  It does not get tangled and knotted.  The holder, which is included in the kit, also acts as a separator.  He does not mix up with clothes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="yamaha eph 100 reviews" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1521616.jpg" width="600"></div>
