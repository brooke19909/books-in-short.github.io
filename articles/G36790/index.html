    <h2>  What does the operator offer? </h2><p>  In order to attract new customers and offer more interesting conditions for using services to existing subscribers, the operator updated the range of tariffs available for connection. </p><p>  Now you can choose how the tariff without the Internet and the included volume of services - its name says "for itself" (" <em>Classic</em> ") with payment for actually used minutes, megabytes, messages, and a tariff that provides unlimited Internet "Tele2" without traffic restrictions.  Moreover, for subscribers using this operator’s SIM card in a tablet or modem, there is a separate offer - “ <em>Internet for devices</em> ”.  This TP does not involve the connection of voice services. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Separately, it is worth mentioning that traffic that is used by social networks and instant messengers such as WhatsApp and Viber is not paid.  Thus, the subscriber of the alternative operator gets really unlimited access to the Internet. </p><h2>  Tariffs "Tele2" with unlimited Internet </h2><p>  Let us consider in more detail the tariff plans that are available for use and connection and provide access to unlimited Internet.  On what conditions is Tele2 unlimited internet available without traffic restrictions and what additional service packages are available to the subscriber? </p><p>  In the Tele2 lineup there are several TPs that are considered unlimited: </p><ol><li>  With daily payment: for this tariff, voice and text message packages are not provided.  It is ideal for those subscribers who often use the Internet and other services they are not interested in or interested in, but to a lesser extent, and they are not ready to pay for them additionally.  The daily fee is charged in the amount of 7 rubles.  Thus, for 210 rubles per month, 5 gigabytes of Internet is provided, plus unlimited access to the currently popular social networks and instant messengers, as well as to the applications of the Tele2 TV and Sound operator itself.  The connection speed is provided in the “Tele2” 4G mode.  Tariffs (unlimited Internet + voice and short message packages), which will be discussed below, also imply a similar bonus from the operator. </li><li>  With a monthly payment and a full range of services: Internet + voice communication + message package.  For subscribers who equally use all the services of a cellular company, TP for 199 rubles will be interesting.  Payment is written off once a month - at the time of connection to it, and then exactly one month later.  Tariffs "Tele2" with unlimited Internet, in addition to those discussed in paragraph 1, have a similar system of payments.  For TP " <em>My Talk</em> " is available: traffic - 2 gigabytes, communication - 200 minutes, messages - 50 pcs.  Thanks to the “Additional Settings” service, the tariff can be modified: increasing traffic by 50%, activating unlimited in terms of sending SMS messages or adding 100 minutes.  The subscription fee in the case of using modifiers will be increased in accordance with the selected addition. </li><li>  For more demanding subscribers a greater range of services is available: calls, SMS and unlimited Internet "Tele2".  The price of such a tariff is 399 rubles per month.  Packages contain: 12 gigabytes of Internet, five hundred minutes for calls to any numbers in the home region and fifty messages. </li><li>  The maximum in terms of the volume of included services is TP “My Online”: 30 gigabytes of Internet, 1500 minutes and 50 messages.  The tariff fee is deducted from the balance in the amount of 799 rubles. </li></ol><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="unlimited internet tele2 without traffic restrictions" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45312/2057730.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Internet from the operator for modems </h2><p>  If you want to connect “Tele2” unlimited Internet to the modem, then you should select “ <em>Internet for devices</em> ”.  What distinguishes it from other tariff plans? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Firstly, the ability to connect options for the tablet, and secondly, the high cost of voice communication services.  At the same time, for 299 rubles a subscriber receives 7 gigabytes of Internet traffic.  Unlike previous TPs discussed above, the traffic of social networks and instant messengers is taken into account, i.e., no limit on the use of them is not provided here. </p>

    <h2>  Options for connecting to the Internet </h2><p>  If you do not want to connect Tele2 tariffs with unlimited Internet, you can use one of the offered options: </p><ul><li>  299 rub  - 7 gigabytes of traffic will be available to the subscriber per month. </li><li>  699 rub  - 20 gigabytes will be available when the option is connected; </li><li>  999 rub  - a package of 50 gigabytes - is the maximum in terms of traffic. </li></ul><p>  If you need unlimited Internet for a laptop from Tele2, it makes sense to choose the second or third options. </p><p>  For the tablet, an option for 499 rubles can be used, providing 15 gigabytes of traffic. </p><h2>  Connection options </h2><p>  Activation of the selected options or tariff change can be carried out in any way convenient for the operator’s client: </p><ol><li>  The application in the device (smartphone, tablet) - managing the list of services and editing the conditions of the tariff plan is carried out in a few clicks. </li><li>  Web version of your personal account - offers more tools for managing your account, compared to a mobile application. </li><li>  A call to technical support - a client manager will help to change the terms of service in the "online mode". </li><li>  Short team service.  For each option or tariff, there is a certain combination of symbols with which you can quickly manage them. </li></ol><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tele2 unlimited internet price" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45312/2057734.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Internet Terms </h2><ul><li>  The service packages included in the tariff plan (relevant for TP with a monthly fee) are saved for the next billing period if they were not used up to the end.  At the same time, the main requirement for maintaining balances is the timely replenishment of the balance to write off the next payment at the tariff.  Otherwise, the balances from the end of the billing period will be “burned out", and new ones will become available only after receiving money and debiting the monthly payment. </li><li>  At the end of paid traffic, an additional volume of megabytes can be purchased within the billing period (such packages can be valid until the end of the day or purchased for 30 days, the packages will expire upon the disconnection date or the end of the service volume). </li><li>  For options at 699 rubles.  and 999 rubles.  the opportunity is available to use the Internet unlimited at night, that is, the packet traffic will not be consumed. </li><li>  Options cannot be used together with tariff plans with the included amount of traffic.  Thus, not all options and tariffs are compatible.  Unlimited 4G Tele2 Internet, provided as part of the options, is available only with a positive balance. </li></ul><h2>  Roaming: using unlimited Internet when traveling around the country and the world </h2><p>  For subscribers of an alternative operator, the prices of tariff plans and services of which attract more and more customers every year, the great news is the fact that, going to other cities of the country, you no longer need to think about how you can save money by using the Internet.  After all, by connecting one tariff plan, you can access the Global Network on uniform terms, both in roaming and in the home region.  Thus, Tele2 provides unlimited Internet throughout Russia at no additional cost.  It is enough to choose the most suitable service packages and switch to new favorable conditions. </p>

    <h2>  Which option for unlimited internet to choose? </h2><p>  In order to choose the most suitable tariff / option, you should answer a few simple questions: </p><ul><li>  Are additional services required: voice communications, messages - or will unlimited Internet be enough? </li><li>  How much services are you planning to use? </li></ul><p>  A frequently asked question for Tele2 subscribers is: "How to connect unlimited Internet for a month and is it possible?"  Of course, the period of use of the service is determined by the subscriber.  He can connect both the tariff, changing it after a month or another period of time, and an additional option for the Internet, which, after the expiration of the required period, can be simply disabled without changing the conditions of his TP. </p><p>  It is also worth remembering that the tariff plans offered by the operator can be modified by adding the necessary amount of traffic, minutes and message packages.  When choosing the TP on the operator’s official website, one can independently determine the terms of service by adding the necessary packages to the “default” capabilities. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Regardless of which device the subscriber uses to access the Internet - a smartphone, tablet or modem - unlimited Internet "Tele2" will be equally beneficial in each case.  A wide selection of tariff plans and additional options will allow you to determine a truly interesting offer for each subscriber.  And the lack of a fee for changing the tariff (provided that more than a month has passed since the last change in the terms of service) will be a pleasant surprise for those subscribers who often like to experiment. </p><p>  The favorable cost of communication services and a large selection of options and tariffs for the Internet are the main competitive advantages of the Tele2 operator. </p>
