Badge "Guard"</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The history of the first guard units in the Russian army dates back to the existence of the imperial system.  It is known for certain that the first such units were two <span>regiments: Semenovsky</span> and Preobrazhensky, which were founded during the reign of Peter I. Even then, these regiments showed considerable restraint and heroism in battle.  There were such units until the coming to power in Russia of Bolshevism.  Then there was an active struggle against the remnants of the tsarist regime, and the guards were disbanded, and the concept itself was forgotten.  However, during the Great Patriotic War, the question arose of encouraging distinguished soldiers, since many soldiers or entire units fought bravely even against superior enemy forces.  It was during this difficult time that the ‚ÄúGuard of the USSR‚Äù sign was established. </p><h2>  Establishment of a guard rank in the <span>Soviet army</span> </h2><p>  In 1941, the Red Army suffered a series of defeats from the Wehrmacht and retreated.  The decision to revive the former tradition of the Soviet government arose during one of the most difficult defense battles - the Smolensk battle.  Four divisions were especially distinguished in this battle: 100th, 127th, 153rd and 161st.  And already in September 1941, by order of the Supreme High Command, they were renamed the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Guards Divisions with the appropriate rank.  At the same time, the Guards badge was awarded to all personnel, and special salaries were also given: for privates - double, for officers - one and a half.  Later, the sign also began to adorn the banners of distinguished units (since 1943). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  During the war years, the title of guard was awarded many parts, which showed courage and heroism in battles with the invaders.  But the story of elite formations in the Red Army does not end there.  Guards were also awarded during other armed conflicts.  They continued until the collapse of the USSR.  The ‚ÄúGuard‚Äù badge was handed over to any recruit who was in the unit, but only after he was baptized, and in such <span>branches of the armed forces</span> as the air force or navy, these requirements were even more stringent.  Moreover, in this regard there was no difference between officers and ordinary soldiers. </p><h2>  Breastplate "Guard": description </h2>

    <p>  There are several varieties of this award: WWII, post-war, as well as modern signs.  Each of them has its own differences, as the design and <span>production method</span> have changed over time <span>.</span>  And they were produced at different factories.  Below will be described a sample of 1942 release. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  So, this honorary award is a sign made in the shape of a laurel wreath covered with gold enamel.  The upper part is covered with a flying <span>flag of red</span> color, on which ‚ÄúGuard‚Äù is written in gold letters.  The entire space inside the wreath is covered with white enamel.  In the center stands a <span>five-pointed star of the</span> Soviet army in red with a gold edging.  The left shaft of the star is crossed by the flagpole, which is intertwined with a ribbon.  Two cords extend from it, which hang on the left branch of the wreath.  Below is a cartouche on which the inscription "USSR" is engraved. </p><p>  When assigning any part of the guard rank, the emblem depicting the award was also applied to military equipment - tanks or aircraft. </p>

    <p>  The dimensions of the mark are 46 x 34 mm.  It was made from tompac - an alloy of brass, copper and zinc.  Its properties did not allow the award to rust.  For attaching to clothing a special pin and nut were attached.  The award was worn on the right side of the clothing at chest level. </p><p>  The project was developed by S.I. Dmitriev.  One of the options was almost a similar sign, but the profile of Lenin was placed on the banner.  However, Stalin did not like the idea, and he ordered the profile to be replaced with the inscription "Guard".  So the award received its final form. </p><h2>  Privileges and Features </h2><p>  For those who had the sign "Guard of the USSR", special privileges were granted.  The award remained with the person who received it, even if he left the guard service.  The same thing applied to the transfer of a soldier to another unit.  The award was also worn in the postwar period.  In 1951, the government of the USSR issued a law deciding to temporarily stop giving the sign "Guard", doing this only in exceptional cases.  This order was maintained until 1961, when Minister of Defense R. Ya. Malinovsky approved an order according to which the right to wear a badge entered into force when serving in the guard unit.  He did not apply to participants in the Second World War. </p>

    <p>  Separately, it is worth mentioning the delivery.  It was held solemnly, with the general construction of the entire unit, with banners deployed.  In addition to the award itself, the fighter was also presented with a document containing relevant information about the award and confirming it.  But over time, the delivery itself turned into a routine and lost its ‚Äúritual‚Äù meaning. </p><h2>  Modernity </h2><p>  Now that the glory of past events is fading, you can buy <span>military awards</span> from various private merchants <span>.</span>  Since one of the most popular awards is just the ‚ÄúGuard‚Äù sign, its price is usually low.  It depends on several features: the time and method of manufacture, the history of the award, as well as who sells it.  Cost starts on average from 2000 rubles. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  The ‚ÄúGuard‚Äù sign testified to the heroism, military training and valor of the person wearing it.  During the existence of the USSR, units awarded the title of guards were considered elite, and the soldiers who served in such units were treated with great respect. </p>
