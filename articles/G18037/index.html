    <h2>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãadvantages </h2><p>  According to representatives of the bank, the VTB-24 Privilege package is intended for those users who appreciate every minute.  As a rule, these are businessmen, politicians, representatives of the elite and large entrepreneurs who have every minute painted. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So that all these clients could feel comfortable, VTB came up with special conditions for cooperation for them.  For example, to carry out any operations with accounts, cards or securities, project participants do not need to personally come to the bank and fill out a standard package of documents.  All options are performed remotely.  And most importantly, all money transfers are carried out very quickly and work from anywhere in the world. </p>

    <h2>  What is the reason for quickly resolving customer issues? </h2><p>  The Privilege service package VTB-24 is equally fast for all privileged customers.  This is achieved through the introduction and use of a number of services and tools.  One of them is a telephone bank.  It is he who helps to perform operations anywhere.  The main thing is that there should be a free telephone line nearby. </p><p>  The second important point is the creation of a special service area where VIP-clients are received without queue and crush.  An important role in the high speed of the service is played by Internet banking and the ability to renew your credit line with it.  And, of course, VIPs cannot do without a concierge service that performs all types of organizational services on behalf of the user.  For example, it can be used to book tickets, book a hotel room and pay for dry cleaning services, etc. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Moreover, everyone can either use the services of a personal investment adviser, or engage in investment on their own.  In the latter case, a short course of training on a professional training portal called "School of Trading" is assumed. </p><p>  In addition, customers of a financial institution get access to bonus cards with 5% cash back (cash back), can withdraw and replenish their accounts without any restrictions.  They are also waiting for discounts (up to 40%) when purchasing goods and services of bank partners.  They have the opportunity to open a credit card with an 18% annual interest rate and buy collectible gold, silver coins in order of priority. </p><h2>  VTB Privilege (package): reviews </h2><p>  Since its inception, the Privilege package has caused a lot of discussion.  Someone liked the service, but someone did not have time to appreciate it.  So, some users talk about a successful investment that the School of Trading helped them to do and a personal assistant.  According to them, over 2 years they managed to increase their capital and even acquire new housing. </p><p>  Others say that with the help of a package of services they managed to repay the loan on time and earn on the capitalization of the deposit.  Still others say that there are no queues and fast service.  Fourth, on the contrary, are dissatisfied with the quality of service and the principle of the telebank.  According to them, they had to wait a very long time until all payments got to their destination.  Fifth do not like the delay in connecting some privileged services.  They offer to return money for the package, because the services promised by the bank did not work. </p><h2>  What are the benefits of the service? </h2><p>  As you can see, there are many diverse reviews.  But despite this, the VTB program has a number of significant advantages: </p><ul><li>  speed of service without queues and excess paperwork; </li><li>  the ability to perform any financial transactions remotely; </li><li>  processing loans and deposits on acceptable terms; </li><li>  using a personal assistant to solve financial problems and accumulate investment assets; </li><li>  premium credit and debit cards (up to 5 pieces); </li><li>  participation in bonus programs and promotions, etc. </li></ul><p>  Whatever they say, the Privilege package fully lives up to its name.  It is he who makes VIP customers feel even more special than they are. </p>
