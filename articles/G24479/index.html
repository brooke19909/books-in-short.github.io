    <h2>  Hotel Azimut </h2><p>  This is a three-star resort hotel, which opened only in 2013.  It is not part of the city-hotel "Velvet Seasons", but is located in the same territory of the Imereti Valley.  Regarding room service, there are not so many reviews, they note cleanliness and order, delicious breakfasts, etc., everyday things for these places.  But many tourists emphasize the magnificent territory of the hotel, created specifically so that you can fully enjoy the walks.  Hotel "Azimut" (Imereti Lowland) offers accommodation in any of eight residential buildings, each of which has its own focus (youth, family).  A group of hotel buildings surrounds a stunning territory with numerous pools, walking alleys and cozy gazebos.  You can spend days here, but do not forget that Sochi has prepared a lot of interesting excursions that you can not miss.  The cost of rest with breakfast included here starts from 2500 rubles per day, improved suites reach a price of up to 7000 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel azimuth imeretinskaya lowland" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1018731.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel "Imeretinskaya" </h2><p>  Impressive at a glance, this luxurious hotel is a 20-minute walk from Sochi Olympic Park.  About 10 minutes walk is the beloved aquarium.  The hotel has 196 comfortable rooms with sea views.  Each of them is equipped with impeccable furniture and modern appliances.  In the mornings a luxurious buffet is formed in the restaurant, and during the day you can enjoy dishes of Russian and European cuisines.
