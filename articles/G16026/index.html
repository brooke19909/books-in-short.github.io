Everyone agreed to go to Bobruisk even now.  Bobruisk was considered a wonderful, highly cultured place. </p></blockquote><p>  There are cities that attract people with architectural monuments, unusual nature and rich history.  Bobruisk certainly has it all, but they come here to feel the color of the surrounding space.  Over the years, the city has built up a reputation for ‚ÄúBelarusian Odessa,‚Äù and now, even though the Jewish people have left here, its special flavor is reflected throughout Bobruisk. </p><h2>  A little history of the city on the Berezina </h2><p>  The first annalistic information about the city dates back to 1387.  One of the most famous versions of the origin of the name of the city says that the wide Bobruisk river flowed nearby, and the name of the river eventually transformed into the word "Bobruisk". </p><p>  In the territory where the city is located, there were a lot of fierce wars, due to which Bobruisk was destroyed.  Probably, therefore, almost nothing is known about the unique architectural monuments or the brilliant people who lived here until the 19th century. </p><p>  But history since the 19th century has already caused, if not delight, then interest.  By imperial order, the construction of a defensive structure began here.  A colossal responsibility was entrusted to the future fortress: to restrain Napoleon's troops. </p><p>  During the First World War, the city was occupied for a long time.  Residents arranged sabotage, but they were not enough to expel the enemy. </p><p>  The history of World War II near the city of Bobruisk is grandiose.  More than 10 heroes of the Soviet Union, large-scale ghetto, several-year occupation, hundreds of partisans. </p><p>  Since 1991, Bobruisk is the seventh largest city in Belarus.  It is actively developing, living a special life, permeated by the color of the Jewish people that inhabited it not so long ago. </p><h2>  Brick walls at the Bobruisk Arena </h2><p>  Once at the Bobruisk Arena, you will immediately see the ruins of red brick - the remains of the Bobruisk fortress.  The fate of the construction begins in the very center of the Russian Empire: Alexander I issues a decree according to which Bobruisk becomes one of the points on the defense line from Napoleon‚Äôs army. </p><p>  After some time, Karl Opperman presents a plan for the construction of the fortress.  Opperman was one of the most sought-after fortification engineers in the Russian Empire, so there was no doubt that the fortress would be grandiose. </p><p>  And so it happened, the fortress was one of the most equipped in all of Europe.  In some places, the walls reach a thickness of ten bricks.  A network of bastions pervades a vast territory. </p><p>  What about now?  Bobruisk fortress became ruins, a favorite place of youth.  Here you can take beautiful photos, walk around the bastions.  Probably, the fortress needs reconstruction.  Although, perhaps, the charm of this place is precisely in maintaining the state "after the battle." </p><h2>  Beautiful places of "Belarusian Odessa" </h2><p>  Bobruisk is, of course, a small city, but even here you can find classes for a few days.  Here you can meet with beautiful churches, churches, unusual houses, interesting monuments.  Well, the time has come to show the obligatory program for the tourist in Bobruisk. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Beaver" class="if uuid-2670453" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100256/2670453.jpg?1531745759"></div><p>  It is no accident that the word "beaver" stands out in the name of the city.  Everyone who has ever been to Bobruisk has most likely taken a photograph with the symbol of this place, a beaver at the Central Market.  There is a legend that one who rubs his nose and makes a wish will fall into his grace, which means that the desire will be fulfilled. </p><p>  Further on our route - the house of the merchant woman Katznelson.  A truly amazing building: the unusual shape of the windows, the bright green color of the walls.  Now there is a library in the house, but this does not stop the tourists and residents of the city from admiring the architecture of the building. </p><p>  After that, we will visit the monument to <span>Shura Balaganov.</span>  He is here in memory of the fact that the city was featured in the work of Ilf and Petrov, "The Golden Calf."  And, by the way, this is another place where you can make a wish, just rub the golden calf. </p><p>  In the center of the city is a cemetery.  Someone will say that this is not the best place for tourist walks, but we dare to disagree with this.  The cemetery has monuments dating back to the 19th century.  Bobruisk was also a multinational city, so it is interesting to look at what monuments were made by Jews, Russians, Gypsies, Belarusians and many other nations.  Also near the cemetery there is an interesting monument - George the Victorious on a horse.  It is located very high, symbolizing the triumph of good over evil. </p><p>  Next, we will take a short tour of the Orthodox churches and Catholic churches.  Let's start with the White Church.  If you go to the Bobruisk fortress, then along the way you will definitely meet with this building.  Inside, it looks solemn, rich.  He has a Sunday school.  The next place is the temple of the prophet Elijah.  At the moment, the relics of the holy righteous John of Kormyansky and particles of the relics of the venerable elders of Optina are stored in the church.  Also, the temple is located in a picturesque place - a hill, which offers a wonderful view of the forest and the Berezina river. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="White church" class="if uuid-2670452" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100256/2670452.jpg?1531745759"></div><p>  But if you get tired of walking, then there are many cafes and restaurants in the city.  In the center of Bobruisk are the cinema and theater named after Dunin-Martsinkevich. </p><p>  Bobruisk, like any other city, deserves attention.  There are pros and cons here.  No matter where you are, the main thing is that you can appreciate everything around you. </p></div></article>
