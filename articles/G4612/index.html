    <h2>  What materials can be used to make a tank? </h2><p>  As materials for the design of the tank, anything will do.  It can be plasticine, matchboxes, wood, cardboard or plain office paper.  Everyone can choose what is interesting and convenient for him.  Sometimes the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmaking a tank with one's own hands comes unexpectedly, and then a wide variety of materials are used that came under a friend. </p><h2>  The first option is a paper tank </h2><p>  It is not necessary to make a large and strong tank.  You can collect several small items and arrange a battlefield.  In order to make one such tank with your own hands, you only need a landscape sheet, a 9x9 cm square made of paper and an adhesive tape to hold the parts together.  First you need to fold a sheet of paper in half lengthwise.  It must be turned vertically to its side and bent the left long corner to the side that is longer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself tank" class="if" height="288" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13608/390375.jpg?1399372173779" width="461"></div>  After this, the sheet needs to be expanded and the same thing repeated for the other 3 corners.  It should get X bottom and top.  After this, you need to take the left and right side of X and fold it into a triangle.  You need to do the same from the other side.  Small triangles, which turned out above and below, need to be turned to the left.  Then you should bend to the center the figure that formed on the right, and bend it back.  On the opposite side, the same thing needs to be done.  The result is a tank track.  Two small triangles need to be bent to the top of a large one.  The workpiece should be turned over and the upper edge pulled back.  The triangles from below must be folded together and the workpieces bent back from them.  All bends should be ironed.  The resulting triangles at the bottom must be tucked under those that remain at the top.  A tank tower forms.  The folds on the sides need to be straightened.  It will be caterpillars.  The square must be twisted into a tube and sealed with tape.  It turns out the barrel, which is inserted into the lower part.  Such self-made tank models are perfect for the game.  For those who are fond of origami, collecting such a craft will not be difficult at all.

In this case </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY tank" class="if" height="214" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13608/390371.jpg?1399372231322" width="320"></div>  used tubes of toilet paper in the amount of 4 pieces, 2-3 matchboxes, A4 paper, juice tube, glue and scissors.  First of all, you need to glue together 3 tubes.  Matchboxes should be glued on top of them.  The result is a pyramid shape.  On top, you need to glue a small tower from the trim from the toilet paper tube.  In this form, it turns out not a very beautiful craft.  Do-it-yourself tank should be completely coated with PVA and pasted over with plain paper.  From the tube from the juice you need to make a barrel.  To do this, it should be wrapped in paper and glued to the tank.  The finished product can be painted.  Using paints, the product will look like a real tank.

    <h2>  The third option is a corrugated cardboard tank </h2><p>  A corrugated cardboard tank will turn out prettier if you immediately use colored </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself cardboard tank" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13608/390373.jpg?1399372287524" width="571"></div>  blanks.  It is enough to take two contrasting shades.  First you need to make long strips 1 cm wide. They can be blue and green.  From the first, it is necessary to twist two small and two large wheels for one track and the same for the second.  Next, you need to take a cardboard of a different color, cut a wide strip from it and make a caterpillar with wheels inside.  After that, you can prepare the platform.  You need to make a rectangle with folds on both sides.  Caterpillars stick to it.  To make the tank glued with your own hands more beautiful, you can glue two blue strips on top.  In the middle, a tower of twisted cardboard and a cannon are made.  Such a tank will be very durable.

    <h2>  The fourth option - a tank of ordinary cardboard </h2><p>  Making a tank out of cardboard with your own hands is not at all difficult.  First you need to cut two long strips 2 cm wide. They should be glued into a ring.  As a basis for crafts, you need a dense sheet of cardboard of rectangular shape.  It is necessary to glue two rings on it in parallel.  It will be caterpillars.  On the basis you need to glue and the platform.  It should be located in the middle and fit in size.  From above it is necessary to glue a small tower of the same cardboard.  You need to make a gun.  For this, a piece of cardboard must be rolled up into a tube.  On the one hand, it should be cut, bent on all sides and glued to the tank tower.  It remains only to color the resulting craft.  Such a tank will be installed on the platform, it can be put on a shelf or presented to someone. </p>
