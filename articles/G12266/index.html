Of course, this issue today has priority for middle-aged people.  And a certain part of them does not at all have illusions that the state will provide all possible assistance in solving this problem.  Yes, in difficult, from an economic point of view, conditions, power structures declare social guarantees, but people still need to prepare the ground in advance so as not to feel a need, going on a well-deserved rest.  But how to do that? </p><h2>  One way to solve the problem </h2><p>  In order to increase the welfare of elderly citizens, <span>private pension funds (NPFs)</span> were created <span>.</span>  Of course, they did not appear yesterday, and many of us are aware of the existence of such. </p>

    <p>  At one time, a large-scale advertising campaign even began, the purpose of which was to attract as much investment as possible in the above structures.  People began to knock on pensioners at the door and offer them to become a member of the new program.  And then the question arose: ‚ÄúShould I transfer to a <span>non-state pension fund?</span>  "To understand, we first decide on what this legal entity is. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The concept </h2><p>  As you know, an accumulative pension account is set up for each person.  We work, we get remuneration for this, part of which goes to the PF, which distributes the tangible asset, again, partially accumulating it for the funded part of the pension.  So a man on his own provides old age. </p><p>  An NPF is a legal structure that is monitored most carefully by the state.  Moreover, all deposits that fall into it are insured.  Therefore, if it suddenly happens that NPFs disappear from the market, their monetary assets will automatically be transferred to deposits of the State Pension Fund.  However, the following should be taken into account: NPF correctly invests funds of depositors in securities, state corporations, bank deposits, accounts with credit institutions, etc. </p>

    <p>  Naturally, a citizen becomes richer as a result of such investments. </p><h2>  To be or not to be? </h2><p>  When considering whether to switch to a <span>non-state pension fund,</span> it is important to understand the following: the amount of social benefits for people who will go on a well-deserved rest in the future consists of three parts.  Basic (6%) - generates benefits for elderly citizens (men after 60 years and women after 55 years).  Insurance (14%) - accumulated on the personal account of the employee, but over time it is "eaten up" by inflation.  Cumulative (2%) - is aimed at providing a quality material basis for a future pensioner.  It is the last of the above parts of social benefits that is of primary importance.  Naturally, a 2% rate is clearly not enough for a person to feel financially confident when he goes on a well-deserved rest.  As for NPFs, the base part rate in it is not 2%, but 6%.  Of course, this detail clarifies the question of whether to switch to a non-state pension fund.  And yet, when solving it, there are both pros and cons.  We list the main ones. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  pros </h2><p>  Some experts, when asked: ‚ÄúIs it worth it to go to the NPF?‚Äù, Confidently say: ‚ÄúYes!‚Äù  Why? </p>

    <p>  Firstly, the monthly amount of payments will be not only the contributions of individuals, but also the revenue part, which is formed by the assets received through investment of money supply.  However, when deciding whether to switch to NPFs and what benefits can be obtained from this, it is important to consider the following: in the contract, the amount of profit is rarely recorded, since it is predicted which scenario the economy will develop in the world market, and what will be The outcome of the game on the exchange is very difficult. </p><p>  An important advantage of the considered program for ensuring old age is the fact that it provides for the preservation of invested assets: if some projects turn out to be unprofitable, then the money on customers' accounts will not decrease from this, since the structure compensates for the damage from its own reserve. </p><p>  You doubt whether it is worth moving to the NFP?  Perhaps the fact that if there is any change in the financial market will give you confidence, the structure will not leave this unattended and will adjust the investment plan for the year, taking into account emerging trends. </p><h2>  Minuses </h2><p>  However, there is also a proportion of experts who answer the question ‚ÄúDo I need to transfer to a non-state pension fund?‚Äù Without hesitation, negatively.  Why? </p>

    <p>  Firstly, if the fiscal year turns out to be unfavorable, then there can be no talk of any stability of income. </p><p>  Secondly, if the above structure for some reason loses its license, the prerogative of transferring funds to another private pension fund and financing of this procedure rests with the investor.  Yes, these disadvantages can not be called significant, and yet they cause some discomfort, but there are still more pluses.  Of course, the problem of whether to transfer to a non-state pension fund should be decided individually by everyone. </p><h2>  Features of the procedure </h2><p>  For many, the question remains unclear: ‚ÄúIs the transition from the FIU to the NPF a right or a duty?‚Äù  Naturally, no one can force anyone to take this procedure, since it is voluntary.  Moreover, you can write the corresponding statement on the transition to a non-state structure at any time of the year, this is done once every 12 months.  The document should indicate the legal entity where the funded part of the pension will be accumulated. </p>

    <h2>  Procedure </h2><p>  Not sure how to go to a private <span>pension fund?</span>  You need to do the following: </p><p>  1. Identify the structure that you most trust.  Analyze the reviews of people who have invested in a particular non-state pension fund, check how many years it has existed in the market, and check out the legal documents of the company. </p><p>  2. Enter into an agreement providing for compulsory pension insurance and study its text in detail.  The document should clearly state in what amount and at what frequency it is necessary to make contributions.  Before you put a signature on the document, it will not be superfluous to develop an individual pension plan with employees, in which approximate figures will be marked with the option of their adjustment, depending on the material possibilities of the future pensioner.  Flexible replenishment of savings is one of the favorable conditions for the client. </p><p>  3. By December 31, address the territorial authority of the PFR with an application for transfer to NPF. </p>

    <p>  The envelope will need to be sealed with a statement filled out on a special form, photocopies of SNILS and passports. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Many are interested in: will it be troublesome and difficult to apply for a pension at an NPF?  Is the game worth the candle?  Here's what else worries future retirees.  Regarding the first one, we can say with confidence that the transition process will not take away a lot of strength and nerves from the client.  As for the second, it should be decided by each for himself, having previously analyzed all the pros and cons. </p><p>  The opinions of experts on this issue were divided: some argue that NPFs are an excellent option to lay a good material basis for old age.  The only difficulty is to find a reliable company that competently manages your finances.  Otherwise, the pension will not be secured.  Others recommend not to rush and consider other options for investing funds, of which there are many today.  For example, you can invest monetary assets in securities, real estate, use a pamm account and more.  Transfer or not transfer pension to NPF?  Decide for yourself! </p>
