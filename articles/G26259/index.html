So, let's start from the first one.  An exonym is a neutral nickname, and ethnopolism is a nickname with a negative connotation.  So what is katsap? </p><h2>  Katsap - "robber" or "DAC"? </h2><p>  A joking nickname for the Russians was given by "Ukrainians" - Ukrainians.  Until now, scientists can not figure out the true reason for the appearance of the expression “katsap”.  The meaning of the word is different for everyone: some say “katsap”, that is, like a dag-goat. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is katsap" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19761/390071.jpg" width="517"></div>  Shaved Ukrainian man Russian with a beard resembles a goat.  Others argue that the nickname has Turkic roots and means "robber" or "carver".  There are various derivatives of the word “katsap”: Russia is called Katsapetovka, Katsapstan or Katsapia.  The mocking nickname is often found in literary works and proverbs.  For example, here is one, Ukrainian: “God has opened the tsap, and damn katsap”.  But it should be noted that the word "goat" has recently received a negative meaning, initially its meaning was completely different.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thanks to the following signs, katsaps were compared with goats: </p><p>  - goats, as you know, are very stubborn animals; </p><p>  - a wedge-shaped beard, just like a dagger; </p><p>  - the animal has a very specific smell. </p><h2>  Moskal - Russian soldier </h2><p>  At a time when Moscow was not the capital, it still had a huge impact on Russian lands and on the state affairs of neighboring lands.  Russian or Muscovite - a native of Moscow.  Initially, the nickname did not have a negative connotation.  Being on a campaign, Russian troops did not live in camps or barracks, but in the house of the <span>indigenous inhabitants.</span>  They were always full, and the soldier would remain hungry or feed him, depended on his ability to agree with the owners.  Russian soldiers liked the local girls, but their relationship did not last very long.  The time came when the soldier needed to go to other lands, all relations were forgotten.  As a result of this, the verb “moskalit” appeared, which means cheating or cheating.  Ukrainians called Muscovites people who were in the service of the Russian Empire, regardless of nationality.  After some time, representatives of other nations adopted this definition. </p><h2>  Moskal - a citizen of Russia, katsap - ethnic Russian </h2><p>  In the Middle Ages, Europe considered Russian barbarians, because they soared in the bath 1-2 times a month, while Europeans practically did not wash themselves.  Tatars called Russian katsaps, because they hunted animals for meat. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="who are katsapy and Muscovites" class="if" height="409" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19761/390073.jpg?1399328320881" width="387"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Who are Katsap and Muscovites in the modern world?  Ukrainians call Muscovites the citizens of Russia, and Katsaps - ethnic Russians.  In the South Russian regions, the word "katsap" is more common than "Moskal".  The fact is that in these regions (Voronezh, Kursk region and others) both Russians and Ukrainians live.  This serves to designate the “transitional" ethno-dialectical type from "Khokhl" to "Muscovite". </p><h2>  Katsap or Muscovite?  The main thing is Russian </h2><p>  We will examine in more detail what katsap is, more precisely, what kind of person it is.  Katsap is a person who speaks Russian, but there is a southern dialect in his speech.  For example, reinforced Geckan.  Such people use Ukrainian phraseological units in their speech.  Instead of the word “no,” they say “neem,” not “theirs,” but “theirs.” </p><p>  In some cases, the entire Russian population of the southern regions of the country is called katsap.  Muscovites are residents of Moscow, the <span>European part of Russia,</span> north of the zone of distribution of the southern dialect. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why Ukrainians call Russian katsaps" class="if" height="255" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19761/390070.jpg?1399328378889" width="600"></div>

    <p>  From this information it becomes clear why Ukrainians call Russian Katsap and Muscovites.  The following conclusion can be made: not all Katsaps are Muscovites, and not all Muscovites are Katsaps.  Moreover, not all residents of Russia can be called Muscovites or katsaps.  For some it does not matter, the main thing for them is that they are Russian. </p><h2>  How to recognize katsap and moskal </h2><p>  Now it’s clear what katsap is, it remains only to distinguish it from the rest, but it is very easy to do.  In the modern world, katsap are rude, greedy, unclean and uneducated people.  In addition, they are very stubborn and often not too smart.  Here is an example: a person who is constantly rude, swears, and if he does not agree with his point of view, he begins to speak insulting words, a fact on his face - he is a hundred-percent katsap. </p><p>  Moskal is constantly striving to help the Kremlin, he is in the service of <span>Moscow.</span>  <span>It</span> does not depend on the place of residence or citizenship. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="katsap meaning" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19761/390072.jpg?1399328443641" width="320"></div>  But among Muscovites there are many educated, intelligent, and even well-mannered people.

    <p>  Some cheer patriots, footcloths and Internet trolls make it clear what katsap is.  Russians are called people who do not have the above traits and do not have imperial ambitions, but rather struggle with such people.  Moreover, they consider them unworthy to wear these titles.  They are pure Russians, despite their nationality. </p>
