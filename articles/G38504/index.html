According to the biography, Natalya Petrovna Bekhtereva, her brother and sister were left orphans.  The elders, Natalya and Andrey, went to the orphanage, where everyone knew that they were children of the enemy of the people, because there they had a hard time.

The first time after studying (1950-1954) she worked at the Institute of Experimental Medicine.  At the same time, she graduated from the graduate school of the Institute of Physiology of the Central nervous system of the Academy of Medical Sciences of the Soviet Union.  In 1954, Natalia Petrovna came to the Institute of Neurosurgery.  A.L. Polenova, began work as a senior researcher, and in 1962 she was already on the post of deputy director.  In the same year, she was the first to propose an effective, as practice later showed, treatment method, which consists in implanting electrodes into <span>the human brain,</span> and also developed a comprehensive brain research system.  These were her first, but far from recent achievements, with which her biography is so rich. </p><p>  Natalya Petrovna Bekhtereva since 1975, academician of the Academy of Medical Sciences of the USSR, and since 1981 - academician of the USSR Academy of Sciences, since 1992 - head of the group at the Institute of the Human Brain. </p><p>  In the period from 1974 to 1980, she was vice president of the International Union of Physiological Sciences, from 1982 to 1994 - in the International Organization of Psychophysiology. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ankylosing spondylitis Natalia Petrovna brain magic" class="if" height="362" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12967/247411.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Her biography is also rich in numerous scientific works and monographs.  Natalya Petrovna Bekhtereva during her entire career has written about 400 works on the physiology of the brain and even became the founder of a scientific school. </p><p>  The new direction in neurosurgery and neurology - stereotactic neurology - is also the merit of Bekhtereva.  The discovery recognized her ability of neurons to respond to the meaning of speech and to participate in systems for providing thought formation. </p><p>  <strong>Ankylosing spondylitis Natalya Petrovna: ‚ÄúBrain magic and the labyrinths of life‚Äù</strong> </p><p>  In parallel with articles and scientific publications, Natalya Petrovna also wrote more popular books.  One of them is her ‚ÄúBrain Magic and the Labyrinths of Life‚Äù.  Here, a scientist, professor, tried to state in simple words things quite difficult for a person who is far from science to perceive.  And she succeeded, so everyone can read this book.  It tells about the history of the formation of one of the most fascinating sciences, about the laws of deciphering the activity of a sick and healthy brain, reveals questions about the possibilities of the mind that have long worried humanity. </p>
