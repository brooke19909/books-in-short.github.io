Then we offer an overview of the best models, features of the device and a rating of manufacturers.  This will help make the right choice. </p><h2>  LED Flashlight Features </h2><p>  An LED light source may be needed for those who travel frequently, work or are looking for something in a dark room.  It is important that it is lightweight, but functional.  It is also worth paying attention to such indicators as management and device quality.  It should be bright, energy efficient and not need frequent battery changes.  Consider the advantages and main characteristics of LED lights on the battery in more detail. </p><h2>  Lighting Benefits </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.walmart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LED lights on battery" class="if uuid-2851421" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2851421.jpg"></div><p>  <span>Powerful LED flashlights</span> on batteries have advantages such as saving electricity and up to 100 hours uptime.  The LED is equipped with crystals, so the quality of the device does not fall, even if the device is often turned off and on. </p><p>  In addition, the lighting devices are quite compact, so they can easily be held in one hand.  There are also special devices that allow you to put the flashlight on your head, then your hands will be free. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Headlamp LED lights on batteries do not respond to temperature changes, so they easily work both in heat and in severe frost.  Using modern technology, models have different angles of light.  Devices are capable of emitting light from 90 to 140 degrees.  Models differ from each other: with a uniform stream of light and narrowly targeted. </p><p>  In general, such a lighting device is an indispensable source of light in hard-to-reach places.  In addition, it greatly simplifies the search process and does not require additional care.  It features reliability, compactness and long trouble-free operation. </p><h2>  Types of lamps and scope of use </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LED headlamps" class="if uuid-2851412" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2851412.jpg"></div><p>  In order to decide on the choice of LED flashlight on the battery, it is worth knowing where and how it will be used.  Depending on this, all lighting devices can be divided into several groups. </p><p>  Types of LED lights, depending on the scope: </p><ul><li>  Home use.  To use the lighting device every day at home, compact and ergonomic lights are most often chosen.  They are stored by users during frequent power outages at home, as well as for repairs or walks, for example, with a dog in the dark.  The light range of such a device reaches 700 m. The device operates on batteries, the case is most often plastic or metal. </li></ul><ul><li>  Conducting searches.  These are more powerful flashlights with a large battery charge, but the range of light is 250 m. The angle of illumination may vary depending on the availability of functions in the device.  The housing is additionally protected from water so that you can use the flashlight, regardless of weather conditions. </li></ul><ul><li>  Tourism.  For such a field of activity, models equipped with several modes (near and high beam) are most often selected.  LED camping lights on batteries have high power and can be worn not only in the hands, but also on the forehead for ease of use. </li></ul><ul><li>  Hunting.  LED hunting lights are often attached to the barrel of a weapon.  They are used in poor lighting, compact enough, comfortable and high quality. </li></ul><ul><li>  Spearfishing or tourism.  The main characteristic of such a lighting device is water resistance.  Flashlights can operate at a depth of up to 50 meters.  They are used in work not only for scuba diving, but also for firefighters, geologists and miners. </li></ul><h2>  Key Features of Battery LED Flashlight </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.alibaba.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Types of LED Lights" class="if uuid-2851423" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2851423.jpg"></div><p>  In order to make the right choice, it is worth familiarizing yourself with the basic properties of lighting devices. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The main characteristics of the lights: </p><ul><li>  The size.  This indicator is the most important when choosing a LED flashlight on the battery.  It depends on how a person will wear this device: in his hand or on his head.  There are such devices that have a keychain size, which is very convenient. </li></ul><ul><li>  Strength.  A flashlight that is used every day must be durable and work well.  There are no budget options in this category.  The lens must be scratch-resistant, as bumping or dropping the device cannot be avoided daily. </li></ul><ul><li>  Material.  Most often, the lights are made of anodized to 3 degrees aluminum.  This metal in its properties is ideal for portable lighting devices.  Titanium or stainless steel can also be used, but such lights are significantly heavier.  Regardless of the manufacturer‚Äôs company model, size or manufacturing material, the battery LED circuitry is divided into two parts.  One serves as a charger, the other provides light. </li></ul><ul><li>  Moisture protection.  Conventional flashlights for hunting, hiking or home use have the least moisture protection.  It can only be used in the rain or rinse the appliance under water.  There are also models that can be immersed in water up to one meter, but only for half an hour.  The greatest percentage of water resistance is provided by diving lighting equipment. </li></ul><ul><li>  Impact resistance.  It is important that, in the event of a possible fall, the lantern does not crumble and does not lose its basic functions.  It depends on the material of manufacture, as well as the type of lens.  Headlamp LED lights on batteries with a lens, which are made in 95% of aluminum, have high impact resistance. </li></ul><ul><li>  Brightness.  One of the important characteristics of the lighting device.  The light should be bright, clear, and its power depends on the scope.  For home use, a light power of 120 lumens is suitable, for tourism or hunting - 250 lumens, for snorkeling - 500 lumens. </li></ul><h2>  How to choose a LED flashlight? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.alltopbargains.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LED lights for every day" class="if uuid-2851415" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2851415.jpg"></div><p>  Having decided on the purpose of use, as well as the parameters of the lighting device, you can proceed to the selection of a suitable model. </p><p>  What to consider when choosing a lighting fixture? </p><ul><li>  lighting quality - measured in lumens (the higher this indicator, the brighter the lamp will shine); </li><li>  the term of operation (it is especially important to consider during a long trip when you need an uninterrupted and long-running device); </li><li>  light wavelength, that is, how many meters the device will illuminate the road (powerful LED lights on batteries can illuminate a distance of more than 750 m); </li><li>  water resistance - the indicator depends on the scope of the device; </li><li>  resistance to scratches and damage (depends on the material of manufacture and the quality of the lens); </li><li>  color of light - the spectrum of light radiation can be light yellow (warm) or blue (cold), which depends on personal preferences; </li><li>  battery life without recharging. </li></ul><h2>  Manufacturers of LED lights </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.campingthings.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="top led lights" class="if uuid-2851402" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2851402.jpg"></div><p>  Knowing the main characteristics and selection criteria for lighting devices, we offer you to get acquainted with the most famous manufacturers of flashlights. </p><p>  World brands that produce the best LED lights: </p><ul><li>  Fenix ‚Äã‚Äã(China) is a relatively young company that manufactures headlamp LED lights on a battery and conventional devices for daily use for only 14 years.
