You should understand the features and design conditions of this product, based on the practical experience of people.  The card is pretty standard, its main difference from the others is the elongated grace period. </p><div class="photo" data-original="starbank.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="100 days without interest" class="if uuid-2960317" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/2960317.jpg"></div><h2>  Product Description </h2><p>  The person who designed this product gets the opportunity to use the bank‚Äôs credit for free, that is, without interest.  At the same time, there is one basic condition, which implies full repayment of the debt before the end of the grace period, which expires a maximum of 100 days after the formation of this debt.  For other parameters, this is a standard credit card, which has a renewable limit set by the bank. </p><p>  Reviews on the Alfa-Bank card ‚Äú100 days without interest‚Äù will be presented at the end of the article. </p><h2>  Conditions </h2><p>  100 days - this is exactly how much the <span>grace period</span> on the card is <span>.</span>  That is, funds can not be returned for three months, and during this period no interest on the remaining debt will be charged.  The term starts from the moment of purchase.  In the future, the percentage on the card will be from 24% per annum.  The minimum monthly replenishment should be 5% of the total debt.  The payment period is 20 days, for the violation of which a penalty is charged - 1%. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thus, if in the current month a person spent 30,000 rubles, then after 20 days he will have to report 1,500 rubles to the card.  This is an indisputable claim of the given credit institution, and a penalty is imposed for violation. </p><h2>  Limits and commissions </h2><p>  Three financial limits are available on the card, depending on the status of the card itself - 500 thousand rubles, 300 thousand rubles.  or 1 million rubles.  What are the conditions for withdrawing cash from an Alfa-Bank card ‚Äú100 days without interest‚Äù? </p><p>  The commission for withdrawing funds ranges from 50,000 rubles.  per month - 0%. </p><div class="photo" data-original="upgradedpoints.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="alpha bank card 100 days reviews" class="if uuid-2960314" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/2960314.jpg"></div><h2>  Activation </h2><p>  How to activate Alfa-Bank card for 100 days without interest? </p><p>  It is issued and activated completely free of charge, however, for its annual service the client will have to pay 1,190 rubles.  Commission for replenishment of the account using other bank cards is not charged. </p><h2>  Myths and Reality </h2><p>  Many people claim that this card has a record grace period, but this is not the case at all, and this is the most basic misconception.  For example, credit cards provided by Post Bank have a grace period of 120 days. </p><p>  Indeed, this product from Alfa-Bank is quite interesting today for many users.  After reviewing the conditions, many people immediately want to open such a card, especially since it has some interesting features that clearly distinguish it from other similar products.  For example, three months of the grace period (this is by far one of the best indicators, the rest of the cards have such a time up to a maximum of sixty days), cash withdrawals without interest, recharge from other bank cards for free.  That is, the product is very convenient, according to reviews.  Alfa-Bank ordered the card ‚Äú100 days without interest‚Äù for more than one person. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Monthly payment </h2><p>  In accordance with the agreement, the client is required to pay a monthly payment of at least 5% of the debt to his account.  If he did not pay the amount for the grace period, this means that an additional percentage for using borrowed funds (from 24% per annum) is added here.  If the client has not made purchases and there is no debt on the card, then he pays only 99 rubles for servicing a plastic card. </p><p>  Alfa-Bank credit card reviews ‚Äú100 days without interest‚Äù are mostly positive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nbcnews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ordered an alpha bank card 100 days reviews" class="if uuid-2960312" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/2960312.jpg"></div><h2>  Lack of cache back </h2><p>  Those who like to accumulate bonuses from purchases that are subsequently returned to the account in the form of cash should be disappointed.  On a credit card "100 days without interest" this possibility is not provided.  Many customers consider this to be the main disadvantage of such lending, as cash back services are quite popular today, and are provided in almost all products.  At the same time, banks compete who will offer a higher percentage, etc.  Nevertheless, there is no such service on this credit card, which makes many people refuse such loans and use the services of other institutions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The reviews on the Alfa-Bank card ‚Äú100 days without interest‚Äù confirm this. </p><h2>  Documents and Requirements </h2><p>  In order to start product registration, you need to find out what requirements are presented by the bank to the client.  You also need to find out what documents for the Alfa-Bank card ‚Äú100 days without interest‚Äù should be provided. </p><p>  People in their reviews indicate that such requirements are fairly standard for any such product.  Moreover, the client‚Äôs income is less important than age, registration, registration and the fact of employment. </p><p>  The situation with the documents is also not unique - the client will only need a passport, TIN, driver‚Äôs license, compulsory medical insurance, and SNILS.  A statement of income received from the employer is not required, it can be easily filled in according to the main form of the bank, and the certificate of car registration will be the best guarantee of solvency of the card holder. </p><p>  According to reviews, the conditions on the Alfa-Bank card ‚Äú100 days without interest‚Äù are quite acceptable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cnbc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="alpha bank card 100 days without interest conditions user reviews" class="if uuid-2960313" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/2960313.jpg"></div><h2>  How to draw up a card </h2><p>  Below is a step-by-step instruction, thanks to which you can learn about all the stages of opening and using a ‚Äú100 days without interest‚Äù credit card. </p><p>  Step 1. Application for a card.  The first thing you need to do to receive is to correctly form and send the application.  This can be done through an online request.  Using this method, a preliminary application form for this financial instrument is easily drawn up on the portal of a financial organization.  The applicant needs to enter the basic information in a special form.  It: </p><ul><li>  surname, initials; </li><li>  address; </li><li>  passport data; </li><li>  income information; </li><li>  information about the work; </li><li>  list of documents provided, etc. </li></ul><p>  It takes about 12 minutes to fill out the questionnaire. </p><p>  There are two more ways to apply: </p><ul><li>  in the contact center by phone; </li><li>  in person when visiting a financial institution. </li></ul><p>  Some people prefer to get a credit card at the bank‚Äôs office with personal contact with an employee.  At the same time, the consultant can immediately check all the documentation that is necessary for final approval, which means that, waiting for the results of the preliminary review, the client manages to correct all identified violations. </p><p>  Step 2. Waiting for a decision.  It should be understood that the application form is preliminary, which means that the solution for the client will also be preliminary.  It takes about 5 days.  If the application is approved in the end, they should call the client, report the result and advise on the algorithm for further actions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bankinrussia.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="alpha bank card" class="if uuid-2960319" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/2960319.jpg"></div><p>  If a request is refused, the citizen should receive the appropriate SMS notification.  The bank, as a rule, does not explain the reasons for the refusal.  Re-registration of the preliminary application is allowed after 1 month. </p><p>  Step 3. The conclusion of the contract and obtaining a credit card.  Alfa-Bank concludes a loan agreement with the client, which differs in an offer-accept form.  When signing the application form, the client agrees to join the General Conditions with the issuance of a card.  This document is available on the bank‚Äôs website in the public domain.  All recommendations that clients usually hear regarding important documents fully apply to this document. </p><p>  Making such a card product, you must first carefully study all the conditions of lending and only then start processing the application for a card. </p><p>  After the release of the plastic card and its delivery to the department, which was indicated in the application, the client only needs to receive it and activate it. </p><p>  Detailed user reviews on the conditions on the Alfa-Bank card ‚Äú100 days without interest‚Äù will be considered at the end of the article. </p><h2>  Possible reasons for failure </h2><p>  There is an opinion that credit cards are issued to everyone, but this is not entirely true.  There are some reasons why a financial institution may refuse to issue a card to an applicant.  These reasons include: </p><ol><li>  The borrower is under 18 years old.  The first thing the lender pays attention to is the age of the card recipient.  Only Russian citizens who have reached 18 years of age are entitled to issue an Alfa-Bank card ‚Äú100 days without interest‚Äù. </li><li>  Customer income less than 5000 rubles.  The lender is also important income of the potential borrower.  The minimum at which a financial institution is ready to consider a loan application for regional clients is 5 thousand rubles.  For metropolitan applicants this level of earnings is slightly higher - from 9,000 rubles.  The bank does not require official confirmation of income, but the provision of salary certificates can significantly increase the credit limit, which is set individually.  If the client‚Äôs income does not meet these requirements, he can wait for the refusal. </li><li>  The client works in one place for less than 3 months.  The work experience of a potential credit card user is the next factor affecting the decision to issue it.  The list of required documents does not contain papers confirming it.  Nevertheless, if the applicant‚Äôs working time is less than 3 months, then ordering a plastic card ‚Äú100 days without interest‚Äù in this financial institution will fail. <div class="photo" data-original="www.bankrate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="alfa bank card 100 days without interest conditions reviews" class="if uuid-2960310" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/2960310.jpg"></div></li></ol><h2>  How to use Alfa-Bank card ‚Äú100 days without interest‚Äù </h2><p>  You can get all the benefits of this credit card and avoid unpleasant situations only if you know how to use it correctly. </p><p>  With this card, the borrower will be able to: </p><ul><li>  exclude unauthorized access to funds; </li><li>  receive reminders of the amount of money and the date of the required payment; </li><li>  control the balance; </li><li>  send different requests using special codes (for example, about blocking a card); </li><li>  learn about the amount of bonuses and cashback accrued for a month; </li><li>  Receive important newsletters from the bank. </li></ul><p>  There are 3 ways to connect this service: </p><ul><li>  directly at the office of the institution; </li><li>  through an ATM; </li><li>  through the operator by phone. </li></ul><p>  In the reviews of the Alfa-Bank card ‚Äú100 days without interest‚Äù it is reported that it is important to monitor grace periods.  Most of the problems when using this credit card arise due to a lack of understanding of the rules for using the grace period.  Be sure to control the end date of the new grace period and forget about the minimum payments.  If you neglect such recommendations, all the advantages of an interest-free period will become inaccessible to the client. </p><p>  In addition, users are advised to refuse unnecessary paid services.  Employees of banks that serve customers must conduct additional sales, which is always an integral part of their job responsibilities.  Employees often offer insurance, connect a mobile bank, etc.  Before you agree, you need to understand whether it is necessary and categorically refuse all that is not interesting.  This significantly saves the client‚Äôs money, and he will not need to spend a lot of time studying these services, and subsequently - to pay additional penalties and fines. </p><div class="photo" data-original="arstechnica.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="alpha bank card 100 days without interest what documents" class="if uuid-2960311" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/2960311.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews on Alfa-Bank card ‚Äú100 days without interest‚Äù </h2><p>  On the map there are many diverse reviews on Internet portals.  Moreover, the negative and positive are equally many.  Having analyzed more than 60 real customer responses on the most popular resources, we conclude: </p><ul><li>  positive feedback is left mainly by those customers who have carefully studied the conditions of use; </li><li>  negative - those citizens who have no idea about the main nuances of these loan conditions. </li></ul><p>  The second category of card recipients is often dissatisfied with fines and penalties that the bank accrues for them for violating certain points and lending rules. </p><p>  It is better to familiarize yourself with the reviews on the Alfa-Bank installment card ‚Äú100 days without interest‚Äù in advance. </p>
