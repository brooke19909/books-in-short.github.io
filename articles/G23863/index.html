It is these paintings that pop up at the layman at the mention of the Middle Ages.  Many people know about Germanic tribes, Saxon, but who are the Lombards?  Probably not everyone knows the name of this tribe, although at one time his warriors instilled fear and horror in most of Central Europe. </p><h2>  Where did the tribe come from? </h2><p>  In the 7th century AD, an anonymous essay appeared, in which it was first mentioned about the Lombard tribe.  This is the work ‚ÄúThe Origin of the Lombards‚Äù, which was later used by Pavel Deacon to write his own work.  Whether it is worth perceiving it as a scientific work based on historical facts is not known, since there are enough controversial issues. </p>

    <p>  According to Paul Deacon, the word "Lombards" is translated as "long bearded people."  The name was given by Odin (Godan), the tribe as a whole was small, but so that the army seemed larger, to intimidate opponents, all women combed their hair so that they were on their faces.  From the outside it seemed that this was a man with a beard - the enemies took them for brave warriors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Tribe name </h2><p>  In the work of Pavel Deacon it is mentioned that the original name of the tribe is ‚Äúblamed‚Äù, and their homeland is the island of Skadan.  In the XI century, the historian John Deacon, who lives in Venice, is the author of the "Venetian Chronicles" - the earliest work on the city, calls the tribe "vinulas."  He also mentions in his essay that the Lombards still call themselves "Venetics."  But it is in the Latin dialect, if in Greek, it sounds like "genetics."  Thus, the name of the Lombard tribe has constantly changed in history - they were both genes and venets.  But in general, the origin of these words is the same. </p>

    <h2>  Where did they start to settle? </h2><p>  Modern researchers have come to the conclusion that the tribe originally lived in Bardengau - this is the left bank of the lower Elbe.  And by the beginning of the 5th century, migration to the southern lands took place.  They settle in Norik - in the middle of the Danube River.  Here, the tribe accepts the Christian faith in the Arian form. </p><p>  Formally, the tribe recognized itself as allies of the Byzantine Empire and the federals.  But representatives of this people did not lose time in vain; they completely copied the military structure of the empire.  Most likely, it was due to this that they gained their numerous victories.  The name of the Lombard tribe terrified the enemy, and all thanks to the already mentioned tradition, according to which women tried to impersonate men, creating the appearance of a large army.  And this means that the army as a whole was small. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Conquests </h2><p>  According to historical documents, in 508 the Lombards invaded Moravia.  This is the second war with the tribe of the Heruls, during which the state was completely wiped off the face of the earth.  In 526, a long war begins with the Gepid tribe.  The Lombards occupy the western part of Pannonia, but they win the final victory only in 567, uniting with the Avars. </p><p>  After a short "rest", namely in 568, there is an invasion of Italy.  The leader of the tribe at that time was Alboin.  The entire northern part was conquered.  The state of the Lombards was on the territory of modern Lombardy, the capital is Pavia.  Perhaps this is the most remarkable event in the history of this people.  At that time, not every military leader could conquer such a powerful power as Italy. </p>

    <h2>  State laws </h2><p>  After creating their own state, a code of laws was issued.  Edict is the Lombard law written in Latin and published in 644. Subsequently, this document underwent several changes.  When the dynasty of Autari and Theodelinda (daughter of the prince of Bavaria) broke off, the state of the Lombards again regained its former power. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  But the popes inserted them into the wheels throughout the whole history - they did not allow the unification of the Lombards, they used the Franks tribe for this.  So, Rome did not fall before Aistulf, since the Frankish king Pepin intervened in the course of the war.  And the successor of Aistulf Desiderius completely laid down his arms in front of Charlemagne, who besieged Pavia for seven months.  The Lombard state became part of the Frankish state.  All the legends that existed among the Lombards are described in the writings of Paul the Deacon and in the Golden Legend. </p>

    <h2>  The first attempts to conquer Italy </h2><p>  As already mentioned, in 568 the invasion of Alboin in the north-eastern part of Italy begins.  It was here that the first principality was founded, dubbed the Duchy of Friul.  It served as an intermediary between the Slavs in the Alps and Italy for a long time.  Despite the fact that the place of the original settlement of the Lombards was located on the other side of Europe, in the south this tribe settled firmly and subjugated smaller nations. </p><p>  The successor of Alboin Klefe in 572 conquered the city of Pavia, which later became the capital of the state.  The siege lasted about three years.  But the tribe did not stop at the conquest of Northern Italy, it continued to move south.  All possessions of the Byzantine Empire were split into separate regions, since the Lombards settled throughout the Apennine Peninsula. </p>

    <p>  The conquest of Italy happened very quickly - this is the "merit" of Byzantium itself.  The empire fought with the Ostrogoths for a long time, and after defeating them they did not manage to establish administrative control on the peninsula.  A weak state is much easier to subjugate.  And the population in the territories did not resist, since people were exhausted - excessive taxes did not cause optimism.  Only the church resisted. </p><h2>  Features of the conquest of Italy </h2><p>  But one feature should be noted - all Germanic tribes that conquered the territory of the former Roman Empire mixed with the local population, assimilated.  This is not the case with the Lombards - the policy regarding the local population of conquered lands was very strict, sometimes even physical destruction was used.  Roman Emperor Justinian I tried to recreate the empire and restore its former greatness.  But after the conquest of the Lombards, these attempts were suppressed literally in the bud. </p>

    <p>  Already Justin II, using for his own purposes the murder of Clef, tried to return the lands conquered by the Lombards.  The dukes of the tribe were busy electing a new king, military force was significantly weakened.  The troops were scattered, chaos reigned.  Therefore, Justin sent his army, which, despite the deplorable state of the Lombard forces, was utterly defeated.  It was not possible to return the land, so in 580 Tiberius II reorganized several fragments of Italian possessions and formed five provinces. </p><h2>  Conquests in the VI century </h2><p>  In the VI century, the rule of the kings of Agilulf, Rotary, Grimoalde.  At this time, the subordination of Liguria, lands along the middle course of Po, Tarentum, Puglia.  By the eighth century, the annexation of Romagna and Emilia, Corsica, as well as other, smaller territories was taking place.  The initial resettlement of the Lombards took place in northern Europe, and in just a few centuries they occupied impressive territories. </p><p>  This period of time is notable for the fact that the Slavs attacked Byzantium - the Russian princes make numerous campaigns, which end with good luck for them.  The Byzantine empire is weakened and cannot control all its possessions.  At the same time, she is at war with the Sassanids.  King of the Lombards Bertari concludes a peace treaty with Byzantium, but does not stop trying to conquer Europe.  At the same time, Constantinople actually abandons all lands that previously passed to the Lombards. </p><h2>  Conflict with the pope </h2><p>  In 727, Liutprand took possession of cities in Emilia.  The most important strategic point is Klassis, a port in the Ravenna exarchate.  Ravenna was conquered ten years later - in 737. Two years later, the kingdom of the Lombards was replenished with several cities that belonged to Rome.  Papa seeks help from the ruler of the Franks, <span>Karl Martella.</span>  For help in countering Liutprand, he is ready to give up a considerable part of the lands in Italy that belonged to Byzantium.  But dad did not receive support. </p>

    <p>  Liutprand had two nephews who continued to conquer the Ravenna Exarchate.  These are Aistulf and Rathies.  The first finally subjugates the city of Ravenna, expelling from it Eutyches - this is the last exarch.  Aistulf begins to pose a threat to Rome itself, but the Franks come to the aid of the pope, who save the kingdom. </p><h2>  Lombard Christian Faith </h2><p>  Angles, Ostrogoths, Lombards - these are the tribes that inhabited the territory of Europe in the Middle Ages.  Along with the resettlement of tribes, the introduction of Christianity.  Initially, the Lombards adopted Arianism, but Agilulf was the first ruler to convert to the Orthodox faith.  In many ways, his wife Theodelind, the daughter of the Bavarian prince, contributed to this.  But the majority of the state‚Äôs population did not want to give up their faith, since they saw it as a support.  They were ethnically isolated from all other tribes inhabiting the territory of Europe. </p>

    <p>  Even when Agilulf died, the people with great resistance recognized the power of the regent - Theodelinda, and subsequently her son Adeloald.  This ruler, not without the help of his mother, divides his state into three zones on religious grounds: </p><ol><li>  Catholic (orthodox). </li><li>  Pagan. </li><li>  Arians. </li></ol><p>  But all efforts to make people accept the Orthodox faith en masse were in vain.  The Lombards in Italy settled almost throughout the territory, but could not accept someone else's faith - they were true to their own. </p><h2>  Arian faith and popes </h2><p>  Several of the following rulers professed Arianism, for this reason it was not possible to get along side by side with the popes - various frictions constantly appeared.  At first, just a tense situation grew into open hostilities.  Franks were also involved in them - they fought on the side of the pope.  Sometimes peace treaties were concluded, but they were constantly violated by both parties. </p><p>  King Aripert I bequeathed to give the throne to one of two sons - Bertari or Godepert.  The nobleman should have chosen a worthy ruler.  This was done, only two brothers did not get along: Bertari is a Catholic, and Godepert is an Arian.  The feud between them intensified until a civil war broke out.  During this confrontation, Benevento Grimoald comes to power, who expels Bertari from the country, and kills Godepert.  The Duke of Grimoald was married to a Catholic, always supported the pope, but did not accept an alien faith - he professed Arianism until his death. </p>

    <p>  By 671, the exiled Bertari regains the throne, proclaims Catholicism the official religion of his state.  He actively imposed this religion on the population, but still did not recognize the authority of the pope.  King Aripert II in ten years of his reign (702-712) managed to give a lot of land in the possession of the Roman Church in exchange for a good attitude from the pope.  Under Liutprand, Catholicism becomes the newest element around which the unification of the entire state takes place.  The church was defended by the king, it was forbidden to conduct pagan rituals, marry in any rites, except Catholic.  In the history of the Lombards, there are many points that can be found among other peoples.  The Catholic faith was imposed by force on most of the tribes of Europe. </p><h2>  Conquest by the Franks </h2><p>  In the eighth century, relations between the popes and the kings of the Lombards deteriorate.  This happened after the final capture of the Ravenna exarchate by Aistulf.  And this exarchate was under the auspices of the papal throne.  Rome was well aware that it was his turn, clouds were gathering over him.  The Franks have always treated the Lombards well, moreover, in wars with the Arabs, they acted as allies.  But here Pope Zachariah had no other ideas - he asked for support from the Franks. </p><p>  It was under the influence of the pope that the Merovingian dynasty was overthrown.  Pipin the Short was proclaimed king.  The papacy had great hopes for him.  But Pepin did not immediately agree to help Rome - he doubted for a long time.  Pope Stephen II personally goes to the state of the Franks and sanctifies the power of King Pepin, recognizes it as hereditary.  Having received such privileges, Pepin Korotky could not continue to ignore the appeals of the Great See.  But who are the Lombards?  These are warriors who could not give up without a fight. </p>

    <p>  Therefore, in 755, the first war begins.  Pepin Korotky invites Aistulf to resolve the conflict peacefully - simply liberate the conquered territories of exarchate.  But the Lombard king did not want to answer this message, and who would have agreed to give up lands that were conquered at the cost of hundreds and thousands of killed soldiers?  Papal forces, with the support of the Franks, conquered exarchate.  After all, who are the Lombards in comparison with the advanced army of the Catholic throne? </p><p>  In 773, the confrontation between Charles and Desiderius begins.  Karl makes a proposal to free all the conquered territories.  But Desiderius, of course, does not agree to such a step.  Karl, acting on the side of Pope Adrian, organizes the offensive.  The army crosses the Alps and collides with the Lombard army.  Desiderius personally commands this army.  But under pressure from Karl, the Lombards have to retreat to Verona.  But this city also captures Karl in the winter. </p><p>  Pavia, the capital of the Lombard state, was besieged for about seven months.  Carl in June 774 triumphantly enters the city, where he is crowned and given the title of Rex Francorum et Langobardorum.  Desiderius is captured, but they are treated relatively humanely - they are sent to a monastery.  In southern Italy, there were still scattered tribes that had previously been part of a huge Lombard state. </p><p>  That is how the Lombards settled throughout Europe.  Who are the kings of this state?  These are experienced military leaders who tried to expand the borders, developed cities, equipped the army with modern weapons at that time.  But everything comes to an end - and the vast kingdom fell apart, but the descendants of the Lombards still live in Italy and Central Europe. </p>
