Why?  At least because of the climate.  Visually, Tayu corresponds to the picture of the Bounty advertisement that is familiar to everyone: white sand, the emerald sea and palm trees. Three times a year, the crop matures here.  What about sunrise and sunset?  They occur here, year-round at 6-30 and at 18-30.  Daily, predictably, year after year.  Naturally, having arrived here, a tourist will stop at one of a great many hotels.  About one of them - and our story. </p><h2>  Hotel on map of Thailand </h2><p>  The hotel of the first line Chanalai Garden Resort 4 * (Phuket) in 1999 and completely renovated (we are talking about major repairs) two years ago, in 2014.  If you describe its location as accurately as possible, it will be Thailand, its province is the island of Phuket and, finally, the resort of Patong. </p>

    <p>  On a map of Thailand, the country of the vacation described in this article, the hotel complex in question should be searched for in the southeast, on the coast of Kata Bay, the <span>Gulf of Thailand, the</span> Adaman Sea.  The mountains surrounding it protect this picturesque bay from excessive rain and winds.  The air here is pristine.  In Pattaya, Thais deliberately do not build factories.  There are none here!  (Although the country has modern industrial enclaves. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  New arrivals are accommodated in rooms daily no earlier than 14-00.  Therefore, it is best to leave things in the locker and take a walk through the vast territory of the hotel. </p><h2>  About tour purchase and transfer </h2><p>  As you know, modern tourism begins with the choice of a hotel, an important point of which is to familiarize tourists with the prices for the tour.  For guests of Chanalai Garden Resort Kata 4 * the cost of a week's rest depends on the type of hotel room.  By the way, currently the hotel offers only one-meal tours.  But it doesn‚Äôt matter!  Indeed Patong is not for nothing that tourists call the gastronomic paradise.  The bills for meals in local restaurants (macaques) are not higher than in a hotel restaurant. </p><p>  For staying in a Deluxe room type (2 + 1) and <span>one-time meals</span> (breakfast only) in November 2016, a tourist will pay from 89 577 rubles to 92 846 rubles.  By the end of the month there is a tendency towards an increase in the cost of hotel services.  Living in a Superior room type (2 + 1) under the same conditions is somewhat more expensive - 94,417 rubles. </p><p>  The road from the airport takes about 35 minutes in time. Taxi - a Toyota sedan car is quite spacious.  Suitcases are normally placed in the trunk.  The price of such a transfer is 1000 baht. </p><p>  When moving in Chanalai Garden Resort Kata 4 *, you must present documents paid for by check for booking a room, passport, and also (required!) The credit card with which payment was made. </p><h2>  About Patong Resort Climate </h2><p>  Always an important issue for the tourist is the desired time to plan a vacation.  If in a nutshell to talk about the climate of the resort of Patong, then it is tropical garbage.  In autumn and spring there is a "rainy season". </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Its peculiarity is that it is very conditional in Thailand.  Mostly precipitation is extremely short-term (40-60 minutes), although it is plentiful.  It rains mostly at night.  In the "coldest time" the air remains warm: 20 - 27 degrees, the sea retains warmth, there is no boiled milk, but not fresh milk.  So, perhaps, a resident of temperate latitudes to come here is best in the rainy season. </p><h2>  It is important!  Recommendations for relaxation </h2><p>  Here, in spite of our advertisements that have gotten sick of it, you can‚Äôt "bask in the sun."  Thailand's solar radiation is an order of magnitude more active than in the subtropics familiar to us.  Leave the ‚Äúclassic beach front desk‚Äù for the Black Sea - facing the sun and arms to the sides!  You can often see how the neophytes who arrived shamefully and rushing defile the resort in an obviously indecent way, with reddened skin from an excess tan, the color of boiled crayfish. </p><p>  However, following simple recommendations, it is possible and necessary to sunbathe correctly and in pleasure. </p><p>  First: you should not stay for long in direct sunlight from 12-00 to 17-00. </p><p>  Second: it is advisable to use beach loungers equipped with umbrellas.  If possible, it is preferable to be in the shade of trees.  To minimize the factor of solar radiation, it is better to fly to Thailand during the period of least solar activity, which falls on the period from September to February. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Third: the tourist who came to rest in the Chanalai Garden Resort 4 * (Phuket Kata) is strongly recommended to get a good sunblock.  And it is better to buy it not at home before departure, namely here in Thailand and immediately upon arrival, otherwise the sun's rays will turn into a problem.  The thing is the significant difference in the assortment of trade: Thai shops offer anti-tanning drugs with SFF from 50 to 70, Russian ones only 20 - 35, but this is not enough!  Do not save on purchased cream.  They should be used on average three times a day.  Buy Aloe Vera gel in one of the chanalai Garden Resort Kata 4 * stores <strong>.</strong>  It is effective for softening and moisturizing the skin before bedtime, and is also a "first aid" for those who still managed to "burn out". </p><p>  Fourth: waves.  Oddly enough, the height of the waves in Thailand is an important factor in the quality of rest.  Take it into account!  The waves are maximum in June - August.  This is good for gliding over them on a board, but not for bathing children and older people. </p><h2>  More about the hotel complex </h2><p>  Many tourists, according to their own reviews, were improved by the climate of Patong, and the hotel complex Chanalai Garden Resort 4 * - really became a good option for their solid economy vacation.  The hotel was completely renovated in 2014.  It consists of four residential hotel buildings with a total capacity of 206 rooms.  They are picturesquely located on the mountain one by one, like steps.  The contingent of holidaymakers is Americans, Europeans, Chinese, Russians and Ukrainians.  The atmosphere of relaxation is calm, tolerant. </p>

    <p>  Within walking distance for guests of the hotel complex Chanalai Garden Resort 4 * there are three comfortable beaches: Kata, Kata Noi and Karon.  All of them have a gentle slope, fine white sand, cultivated casuarine trees that can shelter beach people in their shade.  And 15 kilometers from the hotel is the heart of the resort - Patong Beach, near which the main entertainment and trade infrastructure is located. </p><h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  The territory of the hotel complex is decorated in a traditional Thai style.  A solid landscape design of the hill on which it is built was made, and, in addition to well-groomed lawns and neat clean terraces, there are many stairs leading to the buildings.  Through the efforts of the staff of Chanalai Garden Resort 4 *, the territory and residential buildings are maintained in exemplary cleanliness. </p><p>  The hotel has a comfortable relaxation area, equipped with free umbrellas and sun loungers, the main components of which are two outdoor pools.  Guests in the pool area are given towels free of charge.  Thanks to a buffet working in the daytime, here the guests of the hotel complex can enjoy a snack, drink soft and low alcohol drinks, try ice cream between swims and swimming in the pools. </p><h2>  Comment </h2><p>  For vacationers with young children transported in wheelchairs, or for vacationers with a musculoskeletal system, shortness of breath, it is advisable to settle in a lower hotel building.  Although for older children, as well as for adult guests of Chanalai Garden Resort 4 * (Phuket, Kata), such a landscape design is not imposed, and even seems very original. </p>

    <p>  Comfortable recreation areas are equipped by two outdoor hotel pools.  Each of them has a buffet. </p><p>  The hotel complex also has a spa center, laundry, a modern conference room for 40-60 people. </p><p>  Opposite the hotel is a good (in the sense - with a normal rate) exchanger.  For orientation in shopping, let‚Äôs inform it: to recalculate local prices in rubles, they should be multiplied by 1.8. </p><p>  On the left, leaving the hotel, you can see the massage parlor. </p><h2>  About rooms </h2><p>  Checking into the Chanalai Garden Resort (Kata) 4 * hotel, it makes sense to choose a room on the upper floors.  From there, a gorgeous seascape opens.  The hotel rooms are good: they are newly renovated, very spacious, equipped with a comfortable balcony. </p><p>  Designers feel the design of 93 Superior rooms with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã36 m2 and 113 Deluxe rooms in which guests of the Chanalai Garden Resort 4 * hotel live.  Description of the hotel, renovated in 2014, is attractive to tourists precisely because of the attractive living conditions for them.  The rooms are dominated by soft pastels (cream and yellowish), as well as dull white.  Furniture is in harmony with the room in color and in the ratio of free and occupied space.

    <p>  New arrivals should not be shy to ask to be moved to a better room.  (Hotel windows often overlook the road, or are almost covered with green trees).  Staff readily fulfills such requests. </p><p>  According to the experience of the hotel guests, if every day the personnel cleaning it leave a prominent place in their room for 20 baht, then in addition to uncontrolled cleanliness (it will be brought to Chanalai Garden Resort 4 * (Phuket, Kata) without such a simple payment), beds will be decorated with funny elephants laid out from towels. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  There is a common joke stating that a representative of one country who does not know English well will not understand a person from another country who also does not know him well enough.  This is related to the Chanalai Garden Resort 4 * hotel, where tourists have a Slavic accent in English, and the staff has Thai.  It is recommended to such vacationers, without torturing themselves with ineffective attempts at verbal communication, in contacts with staff, to resort to using a tablet and a Google translator.  It is efficient and works.  Unfortunately, local hotel employees do not speak Russian.  However, they are sociable, smiling and promptly respond to the requests of guests, fulfilling them not according to the current principle of ‚Äúnow‚Äù, but simply immediately. </p><p>  Looking at the hotel staff who work with smiles like bees, you begin to understand that it is not for nothing that Thailand is called the Country of Smiles. </p><p>  Rooms Chanalai Garden Resort 4 * (Thailand, Phuket, Kata) are cleaned daily and efficiently.  However, towels are rarely changed.  To still be changed faster, they should be left on the floor before cleaning. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  The path to the nearest communal <span>beach of Kata</span> will take only 2 minutes from the guest of this first-line hotel.  Just cross the road.  Tourists follow him along a fence-marked path. (Note that in Thailand, the state receives income from the beaches, and the municipal resort property here corresponds to the ‚Äúblue flag‚Äù level.) Moreover, speaking about Kata Beach itself, many people living in the Chanalai Garden Hotel Resort 4 * noticed that rest on its right side (in relation to the direction of movement) is more comfortable for families with children, since the sea is noticeably calmer, which is positive for children to relax.  By the way, on the way to the beach there is a makashnitsa (local cafe) where you can have a bite. </p>

    <p>  If you want to use sun loungers during your vacation, then you should rent them at the beginning of the beach.  Although most tourists do without them.  Many resort shops sell inexpensive waterproof beds, which compactly fold into a rectangular bag-like shape, which has a special handle for easy carrying.  Use this local know-how, you will not regret it. </p><p>  Along the beach are built shingles and massage parlors.  By the way, when ordering a massage, immediately ask for its gentle option. </p><h2>  Sightseeing vacation </h2><p>  Pattaya is famous in the world for its excursion outdoor activities.  You can learn about it from the guests of the Chanalai Garden Resort 4 * hotel.  Their reviews tell of breathtaking boat trips to the idyllic islands, of the first yachting experience (as it turns out, affordable and ‚Äúmere mortals‚Äù).  The most active guests of Pattaya will learn the basics of surfing, ‚Äúriding a wave‚Äù and feeling a wonderful drive from it, and the curious will discover vivid pictures of the tropical coral underwater world (the resort has many relatively inexpensive diving and snorkeling schools, as well as scuba rental points). </p><p>  Surrounded by picturesque karst mountains and impenetrable wild jungle inhabited by wild animals, Lake Cheo Lan is one of the most picturesque places in Thailand.  Tourists stay here in houseboats, they are called rafthouses.  Unforgettable impressions promise the views from the viewing platforms, chic karst caves accessible to tourists, a walk along the safe route in the jungle. </p>

    <p>  The beaches of the coral islands of Racha and Coral can truly be called ideal.  The islands are removed about 10 km from the coast.  Being on them, there is a persistent feeling of the ideality of the world.  That's where it really is - a deserted coast and snow-white sand with emerald waves.  It is especially nice to dive here. </p><p>  For men - fishermen an unforgettable adrenaline rush is promised by active sea fishing, when the boat swims up to a school of fish, and large tuna grabs an abandoned bait.  It's unforgettable!  In this case, do not worry about safety.  The yachts offered to tourists are in perfect technical condition, and the instructors are skillful and friendly. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Today (according to the tours being sold), tourists buy a tour to Chanalai Garden Resort 4 * (Phuket), choosing the option of breakfast only.  The main hotel restaurant is called Morakot, the team of its chefs daily cooks several hundred dishes.  Current tours do not also consider food types like boarding (breakfast, lunch, dinner), half board (breakfast and dinner). </p><p>  The hotel also has two ‚Äúby appointment‚Äù restaurants.  The first treats guests with international dishes, the second - Thai. </p>

    <p>  Chanalai Garden Resort 4 * hotel offers the ‚Äúbreakfast only‚Äù food option, adapted for both meat-eaters and vegetarians.  There are sausages, sausages with omelettes, and salads, and oatmeal with milk, and, of course, tea and coffee.  In addition, it contains fresh fruits: watermelon, papaya, but most of all bananas.  There are three different soups to choose from. </p><p>  Budget lunch and dinner are available at the local beach cafe cafes.  A full meal for three will cost your wallet 1200 - 1300 baht.  However, the status restaurants of the coast deserve special attention of vacationers. </p><p>  Good cuisine is offered at Two chiefs restaurant.  His chip is the joint work of the Scandinavian chef Billy Agren and his Thai counterpart.  Agren - dock in European cuisine, Thai - in his own, national.  Together they make a wonderful duet that attracts gourmets from all over the coast. </p><p>  Ataturk Kata Restaurant will surprise you with excellent Turkish and Mediterranean cuisine.  The local chef is an unsurpassed master of grilling.  The guests of the Chanalai Garden Resort 4 * hotel praised the shrimp and squid they cooked.  It is especially wonderful to spend birthdays here.  Arrange in advance, and the owner of the restaurant will meet you at the entrance with chilled towels, and the waiter Khun Apple will conquer you with his skill in serving and serving. </p><h2>  And a little about the "exotic" </h2><p>  The fact remains: Taiwan is one of the world centers for sex tourism.  The tourist should be mentally prepared in advance by going for a walk, leaving the Chanalai Garden Resort 4 * hotel (Phuket), to see all this personally. </p><p>  How to relate to this phenomenon?  The answer is simple - adequate.  Do not be led by brightness.  This business is not so cheerful, covered in a mask of a smile.  Often, one such ‚Äúbreadwinner‚Äù sacrifices his body and health to support a large family of parasites. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Conscientious work of the staff, effective management, good location near the resort center, decent living conditions, the convenience of beach and poolside relaxation, all this contributes to a decent level of service for guests of the hotel complex. </font></font></p>
