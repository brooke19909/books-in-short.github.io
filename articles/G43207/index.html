These amulets have a history of several centuries, and they owe their invention to the North American tribes of the Indians.  This type of protection allows a person not to be afraid of nightmares and to be sure that evil will never reach him. </p><h2>  The principle of the dreamcatcher </h2><p>  Before talking about how to make a dream catcher with your own hands, it is worthwhile to dwell in more detail on how this amulet works.  The Indians believed that in our world there are both good and evil spirits, so the latter can harm a person when he sleeps and is not able to protect himself.  Dream catchers are designed in such a way that they are able to keep everything bad and negative in their web.  With the arrival of dawn and the appearance of the first rays of the sun, evil simply disappears.  For good dreams, such a trap will not become an obstacle, they can penetrate through the holes located in the middle of the amulet. </p><p>  There is nothing complicated in making a dream catcher yourself.  The main thing is to comply with manufacturing technology. </p><h2>  What you need for work </h2><p>  Before you start creating an amulet, you must acquire the following materials: </p><ul><li>  a wooden hoop that serves as the base.  It is best to take a willow branch, but you can use the inner half of the hoop; </li><li>  a cord 12 meters long, having a thickness of 2 mm; </li><li>  multi-colored threads; </li><li>  large beads or beads; </li><li>  feathers in the amount of several pieces; </li><li>  transparent glue related to quickly hardening types; </li><li>  scissors. </li></ul><p>  Having prepared everything you need, you can proceed to the next step.  How to make a dream catcher with your own hands?  Step-by-step instructions are presented below. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where to begin? </h2><p>  To fix the cord, you will need to tie it to the hoop and leave an end with a length of at least 15 cm, you will need it to tie the feathers later.  The free end of the cord must wrap the entire hoop. </p><p>  The rings of the cord should fit snugly together and be well stretched.  Some people replace the cords with braid, but how much it is useful to make a dream catcher with your own hands will depend on the width of the material. </p><p>  The result should be a wrapped hoop.  The ends of the cord are properly fixed.  To make the amulet more beautiful, you can use multi-colored threads, some craftsmen create patterns and ornaments, but this will suit people who already have experience in making dream catchers. </p><p>  A one-color dream catcher for beginners with their own hands is much easier to do than multi-colored, it is the easiest option. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hellomay.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY dream catcher" class="if uuid-2319264" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2319264.jpg"></div><h2>  How to make a network? </h2><p>  Near the knot fixing the cord, you need to tie the starting thread.  Directly from it, you need to start weaving a web of a network that will catch nightmares. </p><p>  After 5 cm from the beginning, a half-node should be created that will cover the hoop.  The thread is wrapped around the base and threaded into the resulting loop, then it must be tightened.  In a similar way, the entire hoop is braided.  As for the semi-nodes, they should be located at an equal distance from each other. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To form the second row, it is necessary to make another half-node, but this time the thread wraps the thread forming the first row.  Then the work continues in a similar way until its completion, namely, to reduce the radius of the web. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wecanredoit.blogspot.ru" data-author=": " data-source="http://wecanredoit.blogspot.ru/2013/08/embroidery-hoop-dream-catcher.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY beginner dream catcher" class="if uuid-2319289" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2319289.jpg"></div><h2>  When to weave beads? </h2><p>  While a network is being formed in a dream catcher (with your own hands it is quite simple to do it according to our instructions), you must not forget that you should periodically put on large beads or beads on the threads, it all depends on what was chosen by the person.  For lack of other materials, the Indians used wooden beads, but in the modern world plastic or glass jewelry is quite suitable.  The quality of the dream catcher will not get worse from this. </p><p>  By forming a web, you will reduce the circles, which means that the distance between the nodules should be less.  To fix the work, the last knot must be well fixed.  The thread is cut as close to the nodule as possible, and the remainder is smeared with glue so that the thread does not crumble. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wecanredoit.blogspot.ru" data-author=": " data-source="http://wecanredoit.blogspot.ru/2013/08/embroidery-hoop-dream-catcher.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY dream catcher at home" class="if uuid-2319297" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2319297.jpg"></div><h2>  What to do with the remaining ponytails? </h2><p>  There should have been tails on the starting cord.  Here you will need segments 30 cm long that are attached to the tails.  For the pieces, the rest of the cord is used. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Beads are put on a cord, and feathers are attached to the base itself.  If there is no fastening on the pen, it is fixed with a thread or wire.  Knots are made to hold the beads so that the jewelry cannot slide down. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hellomay.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY dream catcher step by step instructions" class="if uuid-2319266" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2319266.jpg"></div><h2>  How to make a fastening loop </h2><p>  This element is necessary so that a dream catcher, made by yourself at home, can be hung over the bed. </p><p>  You will need to take a piece of the cord, thread through the craft and fix the ends.  The mount rotates so that the knot is at the bottom.  The loop that happened is folded in half and the knot is fixed directly next to the hoop. </p><div class="photo" data-original="diyprojects.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY dream catcher step by step instructions" class="if uuid-2319348" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2319348.jpg"></div><p>  So, we made a dream catcher with our own hands.  Step by step instructions describe in detail all the steps. </p><h2>  Interesting to know </h2><p>  The obligatory part of the evil amulet is feathers.  But not every feather can be suitable for crafts, there are some tricks and subtleties. </p><p>  According to the beliefs of the Indians, eagle feathers were suitable exclusively for male amulets, but owl feathers were suitable for female.  To find such items for crafts in a modern city is a rather difficult task, but not so impossible.  There is probably a zoo in the metropolis, you can contact the employees to give the owl or eagle feathers.  An alternative is to use chicken feathers or go shopping for a decorative feather. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a dream catcher with your own hands" class="if uuid-2319306" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2319306.jpg"></div><p>  If you dig a little deeper, then the feather for a dream catcher, made with his own hands, is selected based on the person's gender.  So, feathers from daytime birds of prey - chips, hawks, kites and others are ideal for male energy.  But owls, partridges, guinea fowls will become reliable protectors for women, protecting their peace at night and not letting evil go. </p><p>  The very first dream catchers were made from willow branches, nettle stalks and deer veins.  To date, all these components have been replaced with threads and wooden hoops. </p><p>  Many people wonder: which dream trap is more reliable?  The one that is purchased in the store, or made with your own hands?  Any amulet and talisman will work many times more efficiently if it was made by a person who is going to use it. </p><h2>  How to keep dream catcher effective? </h2><p>  Above, the article has already described the principles of this amulet.  Now it‚Äôs worth a little talk about the fact that in some cases a dream catcher needs to be cleansed of the negative that he accumulates. </p><p>  Traps are located above the head of the bed, and the sun's rays do not always fall into this place, designed to clear the web of a possible negative.  Therefore, it is recommended in the morning to expose the amulet in the sun for purification.  You can also hang the dreamcatcher outside when the sun rises, it snows or the full moon rises. </p><h2>  Why is the dream trap so important? </h2><p>  Today, the dreamcatcher in his own house can be called a necessity.  This is due to the fact that most people live in houses with a large number of floors, surrounded by neighbors from almost all sides.  Each person has his own energy, aura, and far from always these energy components carry a positive charge.  Being constantly under the influence of not the most favorable environment, people begin to feel not in the best way.  Sleep in this case helps to recover emotionally. </p><div class="photo" data-original="legomenon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dream Catcher" class="if uuid-2319355" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2319355.jpg"></div><p>  However, not always dreams are something pleasant.  At night, a nightmare can come from which a person will necessarily wake up to feel that he is not in danger.  Intermittent sleep is not able to fully restore strength, and that is why it is worth making a dream catcher with your own hands.  He will be a reliable guard from nightmares and other evil. </p><p>  Anyone can make a dream catcher at home with their own hands, having read this article, since there is nothing complicated about it. </p>
