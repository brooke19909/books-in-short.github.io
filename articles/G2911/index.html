    <p>  The age of the <span>information revolution</span> compared with the agricultural (8000-5000 years BC) or industrial (1750-1850 years BC) is small.  But, despite its short history (as an official academic discipline), it made a fundamental contribution to the development of science and society.  Along with electronics, computer science as a science has allowed us to realize the idea that this century will be characterized by the ability of people to transmit information freely and have instant access to data that was difficult or impossible to find earlier.  This idea is associated with the advent of digital technology.  As a result, a transition is being made from traditional industry to an economy based on the use of information.  In our country, computer science has been studied in schools since 1985. </p><p>  The concept has several definitions.  If you characterize it as a field of human activity, then you can focus on three main interrelated parts.  One of them is the branch of the national economy, the other is applied discipline.  Both of them are based on the third component - this is computer science, as a <span>science of a fundamental</span> nature. </p><p>  Its achievements are of great importance and are implemented in computer systems, in purely theoretical fields and practical applications.  This is the theory of computational complexity, which studies the fundamental properties of mathematical objects, computer graphics, programming languages, human-computer interactions, research theories and descriptions of computations, and so on. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  American sources claim that the term ‚Äúcomputer science‚Äù (in American English means ‚Äúcomputer science‚Äù and translates ‚Äúcomputer science‚Äù) was first introduced in 1961 by George Elmer Forsythe (1917-1972), who was engaged in numerical analysis and founded the Department of Computer Science in Stanford University. </p><p>  From other data it follows that the term "Informatik" appeared back in 1957 and the championship is given to the German scientist Karl Steinbuch.  At the same time in France ‚ÄúInformatique‚Äù (the word came from the merger of the two French words: ‚Äúinformation‚Äù and ‚Äúautomatique‚Äù) began to be called the area involved in the automated <span>processing of information.</span>  Therefore, we can assume that computer science as a science arose precisely in this period.  In some large universities (for example, in the UK) "computer science" and now means "computational science."  There is currently no generally accepted, established or standardized definition of the term. </p><p>  Computer science is a science that in its studies also often intersects with other disciplines, such as philosophy, <span>cognitive science,</span> linguistics, mathematics, physics, statistics and logic.  Some people think that computer science is especially closely associated with mathematics compared to many scientific disciplines.  Early computer research was heavily influenced by the work of mathematicians such as Kurt G√∂del and <span>Alan Turing.</span>  And at present, it remains useful to exchange ideas with areas such as category theory, algebra, and mathematical logic. </p><p>  The science of computer science is studying the methods of obtaining, storing, accumulating, transmitting, converting, protecting and using information data.  It includes disciplines that relate to information processing by computer systems, analysis of algorithms and the development of programming languages.  Today, its applied value has expanded significantly and covers many areas of science, life or production.  Therefore, there are such sections as <span>computer linguistics,</span> business, geo-, chemo-, bioinformatics and others. </p><p>  An extensive area relates to natural informatics, this includes processes that take place in the human brain or society.  The technical means used by computer science as a science or as an applied discipline are <span>computer equipment</span> and technologies. </p>
