  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Nikon Coolpix p510: review and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many years have passed since the time when photographic guns were used.  A huge, heavy lens was located at the top of the butt.  This was done to suppress vibration when moving without a tripod.  Today, there is a wide variety of camera models.  There are also cameras with a super zoom that can bring an object much closer than other devices. </p><h2>  Short description </h2><p>  <span>Nikon Coolpix p510</span> has a <span>42x</span> zoom lens.  The equivalent of 70 millimeters is 2000 millimeters.  Another important feature was the availability of a GPS module for tracking shooting locations and the chronology of the camera‚Äôs geodata.  Although the Nikon Coolpix p510 was released a long time ago, namely in 2012, it has not lost its popularity and can easily compete with its competitors thanks to its zoom. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikon Coolpix p510 Specifications" class="if uuid-2739278" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/103216/2739278.jpg"></div><p>  This camera is great for macro photography, and for joint shots, portraits, landscapes and so on.  It can deliver high quality images even at night thanks to the sensor and its vibration reduction system.  The resolution of the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äã16 megapixels.  The shooting mode switching button instantly responds to pressing.  When shooting, it is possible to use manual focus, as well as autofocus and magnification up to 42 times. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The camera has everything you need for good photos and videos, and can shoot in any light and situation, even in motion. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Externally, the Nikon Coolpix p510 is not fundamentally different from its competitors, but it also has its own characteristics.  On both sides, rubber inserts are provided for a confident grip.  But because of the small case, holding the camera in the hands, the left thumb is on the display, leaving prints on it.  The display is relatively large - 3 inches, controlled by buttons on the panel, and not a "finger", with the ability to tilt 120 degrees.  There is also a coating from reflected rays, respectively, in good sunny weather it will not be difficult to see the pictures taken.  The display itself is not durable, so wearing a camera is only in the bag.  There is also a flash located on top of the body. </p><p>  An important plus is the GPS module, the cover of which is located on top of the camera, and two microphones are located on the side of the module.  On the right are MicroUSB and HDMI connectors, they are closed by a cover, but due to charging through this connector it will not last long. </p><p>  At the bottom of the camera is the battery cover, and behind it is the battery itself and an SD card with support for up to 128 GB of memory.  A memory card of sixth speed class or higher is recommended. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cgtrader.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikon Coolpix p510 photo" class="if uuid-2739296" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/103216/2739296.jpg"></div><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Nikon Coolpix p510 specifications are common to many cameras, except for zoom.  In details: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Resolution 16 Megapixels; </li><li>  shutter speed 4-1 / 2000; </li><li>  video resolution 1920 * 1080; </li><li>  frames per second when shooting video - 30; </li><li>  monitor size 3 inches; </li><li>  42x optical zoom </li><li>  SD card </li><li>  battery capacity 1100 mAh. </li></ul><h2>  Key Features </h2><p>  The main advantage why it is told about the Nikon Coolpix p510, the review and the photo, and not about any other model is the ultrasound, which is 42 here. Actually, 40, since 2 is an increase in the camera itself.  It can be disabled in the camera settings. </p><p>  An important advantage of this model is the removal of video and photos even in low light.  But it is worth remembering that with a sensitivity of about 100, noises begin to appear. </p><p>  The camera is capable of recording video in Full Hd 1080p, this is not some kind of feature, but it is another plus in the piggy bank of the camera.  But when shooting moving objects, autofocus is very slow, which will not give a good result of shooting video in motion. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bhphotovideo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikon Coolpix p510" class="if uuid-2739205" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/103216/2739205.jpg"></div><p>  You can also note features such as: </p><ul><li>  the presence of a GPS module; </li><li>  panoramic shooting mode in both 360 and 180 degrees; </li><li>  the ability to create 3D images under the condition of a fixed position of the subject; </li><li>  continuous shooting at a maximum speed of 7 frames per second; </li><li>  excellent autofocus: fast and high quality; </li><li>  Wireless data transfer thanks to the Internet and Picturetown: </li><li>  built-in photo enhancement tools, such as custom filters, photo quality settings, and many others; </li><li>  high speed data transmission. </li></ul><h2>  Instructions and reviews Nikon Coolpix p510 </h2><p>  The camera comes in a plain black cardboard box with a minimum amount of waste paper.  The camera is going to China.  Scope of delivery includes: </p><ul><li>  lens cover protection; </li><li>  battery; </li><li>  narrow shoulder strap; </li><li>  software; </li><li>  USB power supply; </li><li>  USB cable </li></ul><p>  You can charge an additional battery both inside the camera and with an external charger, which can be purchased separately.  It is possible to view photos and videos on a TV or computer using an HDMI cable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.keh.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikon Coolpix p510 review and photo" class="if uuid-2739586" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/103216/2739586.jpg"></div><p>  Most buyers respond positively about the camera, highlighting such advantages as a 42-fold increase, a rotary display, the presence of GPS, a small size, a sensitive matrix that allows you to take photos even in low light, fast autofocus, a lot of settings and ease of management.  There are also disadvantages, such as a slow focus when shooting videos and over long distances, the presence of noise at a sensitivity above 100, the presence of competitors in the market. </p><p>  In general, this camera performs all the functions of a photo gun.  Buying this camera as a substitute for a SLR is not a good idea.  For better and more professional shots, you should look at another model. </p>
