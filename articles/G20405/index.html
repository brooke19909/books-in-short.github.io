There are many advertisements on the Internet, where the owners of their houses rent rooms for vacationers.  You can even find rental houses.  Prices in the private sector start from 40 hryvnia (about 120 rubles) per person and up to 100 UAH.  (about 300 rubles). </p><p>  However, you should be careful when renting rooms and houses.  After all, there are different conditions.  The town of <span>Kirillovka (private sector)</span> is no exception to this rule <span>.</span>  Reviews warn that the owners are also different: clean and not very, attentive and welcoming, or vice versa.  There are those who only want to earn money, and the conditions provide, to put it mildly, not the best.  However, for the most part, the owners try to value their reputation, improving the service every year, but still it is better to rent the house about which there are most positive opinions. </p>
