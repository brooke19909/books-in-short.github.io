  <section class="page js-page"><h1>MSU construction: years, history, interesting facts</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the oldest and largest universities in Russia is Moscow State University.  Its construction began in the distant 1755.  Since 1940, the university has been named after Mikhail Vasilievich Lomonosov.  Now the university includes 15 research institutes, more than 40 faculties, 300 departments and 6 branches, five of which are located in the CIS countries. </p><h2>  How did it all start? </h2><p>  Construction began in 1755.  Then, many important persons influenced the formation of this university.  The decree of Elizabeth Petrovna was signed in 1755, so the establishment of the oldest university in the Russian Empire was not delayed for long.  The project was created under the leadership of Shuvalov.  Mikhail Vasilievich Lomonosov also participated in it. </p><p>  The university began teaching on April 26, 1755.  At that time only three faculties worked: philosophical, legal and medical. </p><h2>  New charter </h2><p>  Already in 1804, a new charter began to operate.  Now the university was managed by the Council of Universities, which included professors led by the rector.  At that time, Imperial Moscow University acquired four faculties: moral and political, medical and medical, verbal and physical and mathematical sciences. </p><h2>  Losses </h2><p>  A new stage in the history of construction of Moscow State University began during the Patriotic War of 1812.  On August 18, an order was received on the general evacuation of the university.  But it turned out that there were few funds in the treasury, so I had to prioritize. </p><p>  The opposition was provided by Golenishchev-Kutuzov (university trustee) and Rostopchin (Moscow commander in chief).  They tried in every possible way to hamper the evacuation, advising to save only the most expensive and meaningful things. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Already on August 30, a convoy arrived at the university, which was able to take away valuable exhibits, books, tools and devices.  Many professors and students were left to their own devices, but the rector was able to agree that measures should be taken the next day to at least partially evacuate students. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikidata.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Imperial Moscow University" class="if uuid-3251666" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3251666.jpg"></div><p>  But many loyal professors also helped save everything that had been acquired over the 60 years of the university's existence.  Some even left their personal belongings in exchange for important university exhibits and on foot traveled to Nizhny Novgorod.  September 18, it was in this city that Moscow University received refuge. </p><p>  On the night of September 4-5, the main building of the university on Mokhovaya Street burned down, and behind it all the adjacent educational buildings.  After 5 days, the rest of the university‚Äôs buildings were damaged, in which explosions were arranged by Napoleon, who settled in the Kremlin. </p><h2>  Recovery activities </h2><p>  Already in Nizhny Novgorod I had to think about the future fate of Moscow State University.  Construction was expensive to start, so the option to move the institution to Simbirsk or Kazan was considered.  But in November, the French began to retreat, so the rector insisted on returning to Moscow. </p><p>  Starting December 30, 1812, the restoration of the university began.  It was necessary to find buildings for temporary accommodation.  Buildings near Mokhovaya were selected. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikiwand.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="University of Russian empire" class="if uuid-3251668" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3251668.jpg"></div><p>  After 5 months, all the evacuated professors, as well as the saved property, returned from Nizhny Novgorod.  As a result, a year after the evacuation, classes resumed.  In 1819, the reconstruction of the building on Mokhovaya was completed. </p><h2>  The main building </h2><p>  The story went on.  A very large number of charters came out during the existence of the university.  But there were no concrete changes.  One of the most memorable stages was the construction of the main building of Moscow State University. </p><p>  Now it is the central building of the complex on the Sparrow Hills.  It is considered the highest of the seven Stalinist skyscrapers.  The total height with a spire reaches 240 meters, and without it - 183 meters. </p><p>  The number of floors at Moscow State University is still not known exactly.  According to some sources, there are 32 of them, but there is an assumption that you can add 4 more closed ones to them.  The construction of this building began in 1949.  He was engaged in a large number of famous architects and engineers.  Also, a significant contribution was made by the workshop of Vera Mukhina, who worked on the sculptural design.  For over 40 years, this building was the tallest in Europe. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.videoblocks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Building on Sparrow Hills" class="if uuid-3251676" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3251676.jpg"></div><h2>  Architecture </h2><p>  It should be said right away that Moscow State University was made in the architectural style of the Stalinist Empire.  At that time, it was one of the main and popular destinations in the USSR.  The Stalinist skyscrapers in Moscow are still considered the symbol of the Stalinist empire.  The main details of this design were massive wooden furniture, stucco molding and very high ceilings.  Carved cabinets, bronze lamps and figurines were often used in the interior. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  But the Stalinist Empire served for a short time.  Already 10 years after its appearance, this fashionable trend was crossed out by a decree of 1955, which dealt with the elimination of excesses in design and construction. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  The years of construction of Moscow State University - 1949-1953, but the design began two years earlier, namely with a resolution that was adopted by the Council of Ministers of the USSR.  Joseph Stalin proposed a plan for the construction of eight high-rises in Moscow.  Secretary of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party of Bolsheviks proposed a job to Georgy Popov. </p><div class="photo" data-original="letopis.msu.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Construction of Moscow State University in Moscow" class="if uuid-3251678" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3251678.jpg"></div><p>  According to the plan, on the Sparrow Hills it was necessary to erect a building on 32 floors, in which there would be a hotel and housing.  Also, the structure should not have been knocked out of the Stalinist reconstruction of Moscow.  It was planned that it would indicate the development of the capital. </p><p>  Six months later, it was decided to place Moscow University in the designed building.  This happened after Stalin met with Rector Nesmeyanov.  Obviously, the academician for a long time asked the authorities for a new building for the faculties, but he probably did not expect it to be a building where the whole university could move. </p><h2>  Planning </h2><p>  Without thinking twice, Stalin agreed to the construction of the now main building of Moscow State University.  Already at the beginning of 1948, a plan was approved, which announced the construction during 1948 to 1952.  The Politburo decided to erect a building with a height of at least 20 floors, and its volume was to be 1700 thousand m¬≥. </p><p>  Since it was decided that the university would enter the building, the number of lecture and group classrooms, educational and scientific laboratories, as well as specialized buildings was immediately added to the plan.  A decision was also made regarding residential premises where students and graduate students could reside. </p><h2>  First project </h2><p>  The construction of Moscow State University was entrusted to the Construction Department of the Palace of Soviets.  On the Vorobyovsk highway, they found a site with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã100 ha.  It was he who was allocated for the construction of the structure.  In addition to the construction of the building itself, the plans included the creation of a botanical garden and a forest park.  The manual gave 4 months for the outline plan, and 10 for the technical one. </p><p>  Boris Iofan was hired to help build such a high-rise.  At that time, the architect already had a huge number of works, among which were important government buildings.  It was Iofan who introduced the general architectural idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe future university. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gesture.ru.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Years of construction of Moscow State University" class="if uuid-3251682" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3251682.jpg"></div><p>  He developed a composition of buildings consisting of five elements.  The main thing was the high-rise central part, next to which four symmetrically located lower blocks were located.  They were supposed to be crowned with pinnacles. </p><p>  Boris Iofan also suggested placing on the central block of the pedestal, most likely for a sculpture.  Some believe that the architect planned to install a sculpture of Mikhail Lomonosov there.  But, most likely, this idea was rejected and, on the orders of Stalin, a spire with a five-pointed star appeared on top. </p><h2>  Change of leadership </h2><p>  Boris Iofan had his own ideas regarding the construction of the building.  He missed some of the demands.  For example, he was asked to move the building in the depths of the section from the Moskva River, but the architect considered this action a huge loss for the artistic ensemble of the capital.  The idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãJofan was dangerous in terms of sustainability of the foundation. </p><p>  That is why, just a couple of days before the presentation of the completed sketch, it was suspended from the construction of the high-rise building of Moscow State University and the entire complex.  Stalin and Chadayev decided to transfer the design to the professional team of Rudnev, which also included architects Sergei Chernyshev, Pavel Ambrosimov, Alexander Khryakov and engineer Vsevolod Nasonov. </p><p>  The decree on the appointment of a new architectural group also had requirements that the construction had to be moved 700 meters from the highway towards the South-West region. </p><p>  Lev Rudnev had not many projects before, but in his thesis he created the project ‚ÄúUniversity of a large city‚Äù.  He also mentioned in it some features of such a structure, which were later used in the construction of Moscow State University. </p><p>  Engineer Vsevolod Nasonov also had a lot of experience.  Until 1947 he was the chief engineer of the new buildings of Moscow State University.  He also had a hand in the design of the metal structures of the Palace of Soviets. </p><p>  A huge role was played by Nikolai Nikitin, the creator of the Ostankino television tower.  He worked on the foundation and framework of the main building, and in the process proposed new technical solutions that later turned out to be tested by time and weather conditions for stability and reliability. </p><h2>  Construction start </h2><p>  The architectural complex of Moscow State University began to be erected in December 1948.  It was during this period that excavation work began.  A month later, approved all the sketches and technical projects.  By April, work was completed with soil and pit. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bigpicture.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The architectural complex of Moscow State University" class="if uuid-3251680" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3251680.jpg"></div><p>  The first stone was solemnly laid on April 12, 1949.  Thus began work on the foundation, which ended by September.  At the end of the year, builders presented the frame of the main building on 10 floors.  We decided not to waste time and transport services.  In parallel with the construction of the building, the organization of a railway line from Ochakovo station began. </p><h2>  Reflections on the sculpture </h2><p>  Rudnev also at one time began to think about installing a separate monument on the central high-rise building of Moscow State University.  Now it is not known exactly, but there is an assumption that it could be a statue of Stalin, Lenin or Lomonosov.  It was planned that its height will be 40 meters.  In an interview, the chief architect expressed a desire to establish a sculpture of Lenin to show the desire of science to the heights of knowledge. </p><p>  But as already known, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãinstalling the sculpture remained only in words.  What it was connected with is difficult to say, but many assume that it was decided to show the visual proportionality of the skyscraper with the help of a spire. </p><h2>  Spire </h2><p>  That is how they decided to finish the main building of the university.  The spire of Moscow State University is 57 meters high, and on its top there is a five-pointed star, which, incidentally, fluctuates due to the wind. </p><p>  Installation of this part was extremely difficult.  Most of all, this was due to the weight of the structure - 120 tons.  They assembled it using a UBK-15 self-elevating crane.  But even he could not cope with some structural elements, so the heaviest were delivered through a temporary mine inside the building. </p><h2>  Opening </h2><p>  The building of Moscow State University on the Sparrow Hills was personally visited by Stalin in March 1951.  He went around the territory on which he checked the organization of roads and landscaping.  The control of the construction itself was carried out by Lavrenty Beria.  The skyscraper was erected thanks to some facilities of the nuclear industry, as well as the work of several thousand prisoners. </p><p>  The grand opening took place on September 1, 1953.  They cut the ribbon at the entrance to the Minister of Culture Panteleimon Ponomarenko.  Already at 12 noon the first classes in the new building began. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.videoblocks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="High-rise MSU" class="if uuid-3251672" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3251672.jpg"></div><p>  Some media outlets were calculating funds, so more than 2.5 billion Soviet rubles were allegedly spent on the construction. </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  The building of Moscow State University on the Sparrow Hills has its own characteristics.  This architectural ensemble blends harmoniously on the site next to the main river of Moscow.  The center, as originally planned, was the main building.  The date of construction flaunts over the main entrance.  This part of the ensemble is considered the highest Stalinist skyscraper.  It is considered absolutely symmetrical.  18-story ‚Äúwings‚Äù extend from the central tower.  These structures are decorated with a huge clock, thermometer and barometer.  By the way, in 2014, MSU watches were the largest in Europe. </p><div class="photo" data-original="regnum.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="High-rise MSU" class="if uuid-3251684" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3251684.jpg"></div><p>  The ‚Äúwings‚Äù of the main building have a number of smaller buildings - 12 floors high.  Apart from the main building there are buildings for the physical and chemical faculties.  The approach to the main entrance of the university is decorated with alleys and fountains.  And the whole ensemble as a whole consists of 27 main and 10 serving buildings. </p><h2>  Future </h2><p>  MSU also has a future in the urban development plan of Moscow.  In 2016, a massive renovation was announced.  Namely, it was about a site from university buildings to residential development of Udaltsov and Ramenki streets.  Renovation should go in two stages. </p><p>  One of the sites will be transferred to the construction of a university campus, housing, five kindergartens and two schools.  Also, a shopping and household complex, a medical center of Moscow State University and clinics should appear on the territory. </p><p>  The Department of Urban Development Policy announced the appearance on the territory of Moscow State University of a hostel for students, a boarding school, as well as other cultural objects. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  Where Moscow State University is located, perhaps those who do not even live in Moscow know.  Its legal address: Leninsky mountains, d. 1. Also at the university there are several viewing platforms.  Rudnev stipulated that the view from them be as impressive as possible, which is why this place is called the ‚Äúcrown of Moscow‚Äù.  The main platform offers a view of the Luzhniki Arena and the panorama of the city. </p><p>  As mentioned earlier, for a long time the building was considered the tallest in Europe until the Fair Tower in Germany appeared.  But in Moscow, Moscow State University was the highest right up to 2003.  Then in the city there was a residential complex "Triumph Palace". </p><div class="photo" data-original="iafor.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Main building of Moscow State University" class="if uuid-3251671" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3251671.jpg"></div><p>  The construction of the steel frame took 40 thousand tons of steel, and 175 million bricks were used for the walls. </p><p>  In one high-rise building of Moscow State University, an entire city is located.  Three faculties, a university administration and a scientific library are based here at once.  You can also visit the Museum of Land tenure and the Palace of Culture. </p><p>  On the territory of the university there are a huge number of sculptures and decor.  But there was also a place for a monument to Mikhail Lomonosov.  It is located immediately in front of the main building of the university. </p>
