    <h2>  Trust level </h2><p>  What other indicators are worth paying attention to?  There is a so-called level of trust.  It reflects the confidence of the population in a particular organization.  Each NPF has it. </p><p>  In this area, NPF Elektroenergetiki receives positive feedback from customers.  High trust in the organization‚Äôs work is noted.

Many emphasize that NPF Electricity‚Äôs profitability rating is not too high.  The return is about 7-7.5% per annum. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="npf electricity industry employee reviews" class="if" height="341" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1453459.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  This means that over the year the cash in the account increases precisely by the specified percentage.  Not too much.  Therefore, often "NPF Elektroenergetiki" reviews of retirees are not the best received.  Especially considering the fact that the organization itself promises a yield of 10-12%. </p><p>  A similar situation occurs in all non-state pension funds.  It is explained by high inflation.

    <p>  Lawyers are able to justify this phenomenon without problems.  There are no significant violations of the law.  And the fraud allegations are unfounded.  NPF Elektroenergetiki concludes contracts for servicing various employers.  Automatically all employees become investors.  The employer, and not the private pension fund, should notify about this.  Therefore, it is not necessary to be surprised that the funded part of the pension is in the indicated fund.  And talk about fraud too. </p><h2>  On the part of personnel </h2><p>  NPF Elektroenergetiki reviews get a variety of employees.  It is hard to understand how good a employer this is.  After all, he, as many have noticed, has its pros and cons. </p><p>  The benefits include comfortable working conditions.  Employees work in specially equipped offices.  A full social package is guaranteed, which is provided in the right amount.  The work schedule is set clear.  The salary is paid stably, although sometimes with delays. </p><p>  The disadvantages here are approximately the same as all other employers.  Quite often you have to stay on a side job, the flow of visitors does not end.  Stress after employment is guaranteed.  Earnings are not too high.  This all justifies the situation in which NPF Elektroenergetiki receives undefined feedback from employees. </p><p>  In addition, personnel indicate that the organization is transferring funded pension contributions to the appropriate company.  That is, if a person works at NPF Elektroenergetiki, then his funded part of the pension is also formed there.  This does not suit everyone.  Therefore, people independently change their pension fund to form savings for old age. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  What conclusions can be drawn from the foregoing?  NPF Elektroenergetiki is a modern <span>non-state pension fund,</span> which is very large in Russia.  It offers good profitability and stability. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="NPF Electricity license revocation" class="if" height="377" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1453458.jpg" width="600"></div>
