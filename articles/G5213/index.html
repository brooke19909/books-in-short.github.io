    <h2>  Ravenna Attractions  Basilica of San Vitale </h2><p>  Perhaps this is one of the most famous and significant Byzantine churches in Europe.  Its design is unusual, but the interior is especially interesting.  The mosaics of the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna are the greatest works of art that have no equal in the world. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="equal to italy" class="if" height="255" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1318004.jpg" width="590"></div>

    <p>  The construction of the church of San Vitale began in 527, after the return of the Bishop of Ravenna from Byzantium.  The temple was erected at the expense of the Greek interest-bearing and was consecrated in honor of Vitaly of Milan.  Over time, the design of the basilica has changed.  So, in the XIII century a bell tower was built, in the XVI century, fearing flooding, the city authorities decided to raise the entire basilica above ground level. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The building has specific design features that turned the church into a standard for subsequent religious buildings in the Carolingian Renaissance style.  The interior of the church can be admired for hours.  Most of the premises are decorated with marble slabs, but all the arches and circles are mosaic in the <span>Byzantine style</span> : the paintings depict early Christian subjects.  Here you can see portraits of the Roman emperor Justinian and his wife with a retinue, scenes from the Old Testament - the manifestation of an indelible dome to Moses, the sacrifice of Abel, etc. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="equal to the city" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1318006.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Baptistery of Ariana </h2><p>  The Arian Baptistery was built in the VI century, under King Theodoric.  This event happened a hundred years later than the Neon Baptistery was built.  Ravenna (Italy) has two structures of this kind that are very similar in appearance.  Both of them are small, octagonal in shape, made of the same brick. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mosaics of the basilica of san vitale in the plain" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1317997.jpg" width="550"></div>

      <br>
      <p></p>
    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But the interiors of these structures are significantly different.  Since the baptistery was intended for the baptismal rite, it is decorated with corresponding images.  A mosaic scene of Christ's baptism is laid out on a dome.  The paintings in the Baptistery of Ariana are made in a geometrical style.  The Ostrogoths were notable masters who were versed in the art of gold forging, but not in artistic mosaic.  Therefore, researchers believe that the patterns in the Baptistery of Ariana, as, incidentally, in the Orthodox Baptistery of Neon, were laid out by Orthodox Christians.  In addition to the mosaic on the dome, the baptistery no longer has decorative elements. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Arian Baptistery" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10393/1320536.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Tomb of Dante </h2><p>  Tourists from all over the world are attracted by Ravenna.  The sights of this city are unique.  For example, on Alighieri Street, near the Basilica of St. Francis, is the tomb of the author of the ‚ÄúDivine Comedy‚Äù - the great Dante.  Many are interested in why the Florentine was buried in Ravenna.  This is a really interesting story. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="equal to the sights" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1317999.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Expulsion from Florence </h2><p>  According to historians, Dante was involved in the conflict between the Ghibellines and Guelphs.  After defeating the enemy, the Guelfs were divided into two factions - ‚Äúblacks‚Äù and ‚Äúwhites‚Äù - and began a fierce struggle between themselves.  Dante belonged to the whites, who were defeated in 1301.  The poet was sentenced to exile and sentenced to a heavy fine.  In case of non-payment upon returning to Florence, according to the laws of that time, he could have been burned at the stake. </p><p>  Dante, who passionately loved his native Florence, was hard pressed for exile.  He expressed all the pain of loss in Paradise.  After the death of the poet in Florence, "suddenly" realized that her late citizen was a great national poet, and demanded that the authorities of Ravenna give him his ashes.  In 1519, Pope Leo X ordered the return of the poet‚Äôs remains, which were to be transported to Florence.  The sarcophagus was delivered, but it was empty. </p><h2>  Unsuccessful return of dust </h2><p>  As it turned out later, the Ravenna Franciscans made a hole in the tomb, removed the remains from it and secretly buried them in the monastery of Sienzo.  In 1810, the monks left the monastery and hid the coffin in Bracciofort, which today is not far from the tomb of Dante.  The coffin was discovered during construction work in 1865.  However, back in 1829, a tomb was built for Dante in Florence.  Since then it has been empty. </p><h2>  The internal structure of the tomb </h2><p>  A narrow and quiet street leads to the tomb of Dante in Ravenna, at the end of which you can see a rather modest, but worthy memorial.  It is made in the neoclassical style in 1780 by Camillo Morigia.  Inside is an urn with a Latin epitaph, which was composed in 1327 by Bernardo Canaccio.  A bas-relief of P. Lombardo is carved above the urn, which depicts a poet immersed in thoughts.  He works sitting at a desk.  Previously, <span>this bas-relief</span> was part of the interior of the tomb of Dante, located in the church of St. Francis.  Ravenna, whose sights are very carefully guarded by the authorities and local residents, can rightfully be proud of the priceless monuments located on its territory. </p><h2>  The Mausoleum of Theodoric </h2><p>  This rather modest outward and small-sized mausoleum is located on the outskirts of the city.  It was built by the Ostrogothic king for his future repose.  Many local residents are sure that without this monument Ravenna (Italy) is unthinkable.  The thing is that in the city there are no more purely Gothic monuments.  In addition, Theodorich was not a Christian monarch, which turns his tomb into a unique structure in some way. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mausoleum of theodoric" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1318001.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Many tourists in the reviews note that they were struck by Ravenna.  The sights of the city are very different.  For example, seeing this mausoleum, no one thinks that this building can seriously impress, especially after visiting the monumental and majestic basilicas of the city.  This is a small tower built of limestone, with a central dome, the diameter of which does not exceed ten meters.  The mausoleum was built on the site of the ready-made cemetery in those days, in the suburbs of Ravenna. </p><p>  When Ravenna passed into the hands of the emperor Rome Justinian, the remains of Theodoric were taken out of the mausoleum and began to use the building as a chapel.  Therefore, tourists should know that no one is buried in the mausoleum of Theodorich: the sarcophagus of dark red color is empty. </p><p>  The construction of the mausoleum is two-level, ten-sided.  There is a tomb room on the upper floor, and a chapel in the lower section.  Both inside and outside the walls of the mausoleum have no decorations.  There is no decoration inside, except for the sarcophagus - a powerful block of porphyry, in which a special "bathtub" is carved.  Today the sarcophagus stands open, without a lid, right in the center of the building. </p><h2>  Dome of the mausoleum </h2><p>  If you happen to visit Ravenna, be sure to visit the mausoleum and pay attention to its dome.  It is carved from solid stone weighing more than three hundred tons.  It was impossible to raise such a colossus up in those days, but the builders found an original solution - the mausoleum was completely covered with earth, on the coast, a huge dome was pulled up, and then the ground was removed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="equal to italy" class="if" height="364" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1318003.jpg" width="600"></div>
