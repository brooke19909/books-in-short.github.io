    <p>  If you are interested in the question of how to weave a basket from the vine with your own hands, then you should consider both the ancient methods that our ancestors used and the new technologies.  There are a variety of ways to weave and design baskets.  Among them, there are complex and simple options that are available even to students. </p><h2>  Choosing the best weaving technology </h2><p>  In order to determine the best way, you should experiment a little.  You need to try as many methods as possible to understand which one is most suitable for you.  Below is a detailed master class that will help in finding an answer to the popular question of how to weave a basket from a vine. </p><h2>  What tools and materials may be needed? </h2><p>  In order to weave the craft with your own hands, you will need to purchase some basic tools and materials: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  1. The branches of the vine.  Willow branches are also suitable.  The material should bend well without breaking at the bend points.  In order for the baskets of vines to differ in smoothness, it is necessary to harvest material from autumn or winter.  However, if there is a goal to create such a basket that would have a small number of green leaves, then you can prepare branches in the spring. </p><p>  2. Stationery knife.  Since the branches do not have a large thickness and are young, they can be cut even by using such a simple tool. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself basket weaving" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12760/427995.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  3. In order to secure some of the individual elements of the basket from the rod, a wire is required. </p><p>  4. You must purchase wire cutters with which you can cut the wire. </p><h2>  What is the process of weaving a basket with your own hands? </h2><p>  When all the tools are assembled together with the material, you can proceed directly to such a procedure as <span>weaving baskets</span> with your own hands.  This must be done from top to bottom, to the bottom.  In this case, you just follow some simple rules: </p><p>  1. It is necessary to form a circle of a certain diameter, which will correspond to the bottom of the product.  It must be fixed by wire.  Tightening such a fastener with your hands is quite difficult, so you can use a pair of pliers.  In addition, it is worthwhile to understand that a wire can simply cut a young branch with strong twisting.  Therefore, it is very important not to overdo it. </p><p>  2. It is required to form a framework using branches for this.  Around the frame the weaving of the main part of our basket will take place.  The material must be wrapped around the previously created ring.  Fixation is recommended using wire.  Branches should be taken long enough.  They should be equal in their length to twice the height of the side wall of the basket and the diameter of the bottom.  The pattern of the future product will completely depend on how many branches are taken - even or odd.  For the convenience of weaving, all branches can be connected into one long rod, which you will subsequently braid around the frame.  With an <span>odd number of</span> branches, the rod will go around the frame either in front or back of one branch.  With an even number, the rod around one branch in any case will go in front, and around the other it will always go behind. </p>

    <p>  3. When the side of the basket is completely made, you can proceed to weaving the bottom.  To do this, bend the branch of the frame, move it in the direction that is opposite, and thread between the branches fixed where the exact same branch of the base is located.  This operation should be done with all branches.  If there is no desire to make the bottom thick, then the above procedure should be performed only with a certain part of the vine.  After that, you should tie the remaining branches into one rod and start weaving the bottom of the basket in a circle. </p>

    <p>  4. When both the walls and the bottom of the product are completely finished, all that remains is to make a handle.  Also, the entire basket will need to be designed, guided by their imagination.  When everything is completed, the resulting product can be safely used for decorative or household purposes.  On this weaving lessons on the subject can be considered completed. </p><h2>  Multifunctional product </h2>

    <p>  The resulting basket can always be used as an element of home decoration.  It will look great in any home and perfectly complement the overall picture.  You can use the basket to solve other problems.  Everything will depend on the desire of the person who was involved in its creation. </p><h2>  The first step towards creating beautiful products </h2><p>  It should be noted that a basket of twigs can be a great step forward, to create something more ambitious.  Using material such as tree branches, you can weave not only baskets, but also vases, flowerpots, caskets, lampshades.  And some time later, after confidence in your abilities appears, start creating larger products.  For example, you can always make a cradle, chair, chest, <span>birdcage,</span> lampshade.  And as a material, only a vine is required.  In addition, with the help of such a skill, you can make the interior in your home truly unique and original. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="wickerwork" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12760/427992.jpg" width="480"></div>
