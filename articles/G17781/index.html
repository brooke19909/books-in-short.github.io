The history of the famous Israeli resort deserves special attention, because it is it that makes the rest even more vivid and impressive.  By the way, it is very interesting to know the past of the resort from the mouth of the guide who conducts excursions in Israel. </p><p>  The ancient city of Gadar was founded by the Egyptian Ptolemies immediately after the death of the great commander Alexander of Macedon.  It was a kind of border barrier, as evidenced by the name of the city (in the translation "gadar" means a fence, barrier).  A few kilometers from the settlement, hot springs with healing water were discovered even then. </p><p>  There is no city for a long time.  In memory of him there were only ruins on the Umm Qais hill.  But its name and healing sources were preserved, which became the reason for the foundation of the famous Israeli resort.  Throughout the history of its existence, the city has repeatedly passed from hand to hand.  But only in the second century AD did the Romans finally settle here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.israel21c.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hamat gader hot springs" class="if uuid-2578629" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49954/2578629.jpg"></div><h2>  How did the health resort appear? </h2><p>  The tenth Roman legion, who stormed Masada, and began the construction of the bath "for their own needs."  The health complex was then the second largest and most visited in the entire Roman Empire.  Its remains are still in Hamat Gader.  For this reason, it is recommended that tourists visit excursions in Israel in order to personally look at the remains of the past. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In those days, the health-improving complex was called the ‚ÄúBathhouse named after the Three Graces‚Äù.  The latter were statues erected in niches along the pool.  Their images are minted in coins of that time.  The place immediately became popular and legendary, and soon turned into the largest wellness center of the Roman Empire.  Since the visitors rested for several days, guest houses and entertainment facilities were built for a pleasant pastime. </p><p>  Among the visitors were Greek and Roman sages and philosophers, in the Byzantine era - even authoritative rabbis.  You can talk for a long time about the history of the Hamat Gader hot springs.  The popular resort had a hard time in wartime.  However, all this did not prevent him from turning into the largest <span>medical and health center of</span> international level. </p><div class="photo" data-original="exploreisrael.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tour operator in israel" class="if uuid-2578110" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49954/2578110.jpg"></div><h2>  Thermal bath </h2><p>  Excursion tours to Israel involve a visit to a paradise, spread over 150 thousand square kilometers.  The resort is the focus of many tourist attractions.  So, there is a crocodile nursery, a mini-zoo, a terrarium, a colorful representation of parrots, water attractions, SPA salons, historical and architectural sights, as well as the thermal baths themselves. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Hot spring water may contain sulfur at a concentration of 4.7%.  In its composition there are other minerals that have a beneficial effect on the skin and joints.  This determines the popularity of sightseeing tours to Israel, which involve a whole range of recreational activities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="koshkin.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hamat gader hot springs" class="if uuid-2578631" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49954/2578631.jpg"></div><h2>  Treatment and Wellness </h2><p>  Many are interested in whether children can be in Hamat Gader.

You can experience amazing sensations by moving from a hot pool to cooler fresh water, which is located very close by. </p><p>  Before visiting the pool, it is better to remove jewelry made of gold and silver - the fact is that under the influence of sulfur, jewelry can darken. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.icstrvl.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hamat gader is it possible for children" class="if uuid-2578641" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49954/2578641.jpg"></div><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Thermal springs are not the only thing worth visiting (this will be confirmed by any tour operator in Israel).

By the way, ‚ÄúSplash‚Äù is popular not only among small tourists.  With infectious laughter, their parents are also rolling down the hill. </p><p>  Not far from the spiral-shaped slide is a traditional dance floor with surprises.  Its peculiarity lies in the fact that at various times in various places, fountains quite suddenly burst upwards.  The water level, its pressure and the place of occurrence are constantly changing, which makes the attraction even more attractive. </p><p>  A tour operator in Israel will certainly inform the tourist that there are several SPA salons in the resort, in which several types of massage will be offered to vacationers.  In combination with water treatments, it has an amazing effect. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.familywithkids.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hamat gader israel" class="if uuid-2578654" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49954/2578654.jpg"></div><h2>  Crocodile farm </h2><p>  The nursery was created in 1981.
