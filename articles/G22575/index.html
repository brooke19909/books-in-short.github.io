She has in her arsenal of very high-quality products.  And it makes no difference what is in front of us: microwaves, televisions, consoles or smartphones.  Everything is done perfectly.  However, in the mobile technology market, the company is not doing as well as we would like.  For example, the production of laptops under the Vaio brand had to be completely curtailed.  They simply could not stand the competition.  Smartphones are still somehow afloat.  But this is mainly due to models with moisture protection.  Also, many take into account the glorious past of the company.  Very interesting smartphone <span>Sony Xperia E5</span> F3311.  Reviews about him, as well as his technical characteristics, will be considered a little later.  In the meantime, recall the main milestones of the formation of Sony. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The company was founded in Japan in 1946.  Then it was called TTK.  This is an abbreviation.  The full name of the new firm was so unpronounceable that poor Americans broke their tongues in vain attempts to pronounce it correctly.  Then the company management decided to change the name to Sony, which inexpressibly pleased the Yankees.  And at that time, the American market, along with the European one, was a priority for Sony.  Therefore, the change of name played a very large role in the formation of the future giant.  Sony began its glorious journey with the release of tape recorders with very high-quality sound.  Then came the turn of compact receivers that fit easily in your pocket.  The latter have become very popular in the USA and Europe. </p>

    <p>  The manufacturer began to produce mobile phones back in those days when the ball was ruled by keypads.  In tandem with the famous Scandinavian company Ericsson, the manufacturer managed to create a legend phone.  It's about the <span>Sony Ericsson K750.</span>  It was an exceptionally successful gadget.  In the middle of the 2000s, the first smartphone of the company under the Xperia brand was released.  But there was no question of any Ericsson.  Only Sony.  The device turned out to be very successful.  It was after the release of this device that the long history of Xperia smartphones began.  A striking representative of the devices of the line is the smartphone Sony Xperia E5 F3311.  The reviews of the owners indicate that this is a very high-quality and productive phone.  Sony has no other way. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Smartphone Positioning </h2><p>  Sony Xperia E5 F3311, reviews of which we will analyze in the future, was created as a budget smartphone ‚Äúfor everyone‚Äù.  At the same time, he is a direct competitor to the notorious iPhone 5. This is evidenced by the almost complete identity of the dimensions of both devices and some similarities in design.  At the same time, ‚ÄúSony‚Äù is great inferior to the craft from the guys from Cupertino in performance.  But it is not surprising.  That's why he is a budget smartphone.  Nevertheless, this device has all the prerequisites in order to become a bestseller: it has a nice design, small dimensions, decent performance, an excellent camera and an attractive price.  The latter, by the way, is not among the advantages of the iPhone. </p>

    <p>  The positioning of this smartphone imposes certain obligations on it.  So, it should have an appropriate price with pretty good specs.  Oddly enough, but the Sony Xperia E5 F3311 Black, reviews of which are positive, manages to cope with this task.  Even though his iPhone antagonist is much more expensive.  But do not wait for a miracle for that kind of money.  The smartphone is moderately productive, but no frills.  It seems that the time has come to consider this interesting device in more detail.  And we will start with his appearance.  For this is exactly what attracts potential buyers in the first place. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Design and appearance </h2><p>  As mentioned above, the look of the smartphone is a bit like the look of the iPhone 5C.  But just a little bit.  In fact, we have a completely unique device.  What is only the Xperia trademark on the back.  Nevertheless, there are those who strongly dislike the design.  Yes, he does not shine with excesses.  But the case materials are very practical.  In everyday life, the device does not get dirty at all.  It is made in the classic candy bar form factor.  The front panel is covered with tempered glass.  The back cover is non-removable.  But this is a modern trend.  Now even budget devices do not give access to the battery.  These include the smartphone Sony Xperia E5 F3311 Black.  Reviews about the appearance of the device (especially the black model) are extremely positive.  And that already says a lot. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony xperia e5 f3311 lte reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2102883.jpg"></div>

    <p>  A characteristic feature of this smartphone is that there are no familiar touch buttons under the screen.  They are displayed on the display itself.  Many do not like this solution, since these same buttons tend to pop up where they are completely unnecessary.  However, this makes the gadget unique.  Very few entry-level models have this solution.  Usually they are equipped with touch buttons, which makes the devices faceless and the same.  So such a ‚Äúdesign feature‚Äù is a clear advantage of Sony.  What else can Sony Xperia E5 F3311 LTE offer us?  Reviews about the device make it clear that this smartphone still has trump cards in its sleeve.  And now we will move on to the performance of the hardware platform. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Smartphone hardware specifications </h2><p>  Now consider what is under the hood of the Sony Xperia E5 F3311 LTE.  Owner reviews are mixed.  However, the vast majority of users agree that the smartphone has pretty decent power.  As a processor, a solution based on a chip from MTK is used.  There are four cores with a clock frequency of 1.3 gigahertz.  The processor itself has a 64-bit architecture.  The chip from Mali is responsible for the graphics, which perfectly copes with high-definition content.  The amount of RAM is 1.5 gigabytes.  In modern realities this may not be enough.  We can say that modern "heavy" games are not available for this smartphone.  But this is expected: still a budget device.  Nevertheless, the device copes with everyday tasks one hundred percent.  Also, the multimedia capabilities of the gadget are very wide. </p><p>  The volume of the device‚Äôs internal drive is 16 gigabytes.  At the same time, only 10 is available to the user. Apparently, the system occupies a fair amount of space.  But it's not a problem.  You can increase the amount of memory due to the micro SD card.  The device supports drives up to 128 gigabytes.  What is especially valuable - the manufacturer decided not to supply the device with a hybrid slot, in which you can install only a second SIM card or memory card.  What an honor and praise to him.  In the arsenal of the smartphone are full-fledged connectors for 2 SIM cards and a USB flash drive.  The Sony Xperia E5 F3311 phone, reviews of which will be analyzed a little later, supports the LTE communication standard (although not the latest generation), has high-speed Wi-Fi and Bluetooth transmitters and a fast navigation module.  But what is most valuable is the presence of an NFC chip, which ensures the full operation of Android Pay. </p><h2>  Device screen </h2><p>  Now let's move on to the device display.  It is of particular interest, because this is precisely the component that should work flawlessly, since it is he who is responsible for managing the smartphone and transmitting information.  The device has a five-inch screen, created using IPS OGS technology.  This means that there is no air gap between the glass and the screen itself.  This solution helps to improve color reproduction, but it has a bad effect on the cost of repairing the device.  If the glass is damaged, you will have to change the entire screen.  The display has decent brightness.  This helps to use the gadget more successfully in sunny weather.  There is also an oleophobic and anti-reflective coating.  The pixel density is also decent.  Resolution - 1280 by 720 pixels (HD).  In this situation, it is almost impossible to see individual pixels with the naked eye.  And this can be attributed to the advantages of the Sony Xperia E5 F3311.  Owner reviews confirm the characteristics of the screen, declared by the manufacturer. </p>

    <p>  The color rendering of the screen is quite realistic.  Although after the purchase, it is recommended to correct the color temperature.  "Factory" apparatus a little yellow.  Nevertheless, using the settings, you can achieve a pretty good result.  The display is covered with tempered glass Corning <span>Gorilla Glass.</span>  This positively affects the reliability of the smartphone as a whole.  Do not forget about the advanced sensor, which immediately fulfills 10 simultaneous touches.  But this is the destiny of all modern touch panels.  The five-inch screen is very convenient in everyday use.  This device is perfect for those who are tired of the giant "shovels", the release of which many manufacturers now sin.  The best looking Sony Xperia E5 F3311 is black.  User reviews say that the screen in it almost merges with the body.  Now consider the gadget cameras. </p><h2>  Main and front cameras of the device </h2><p>  As the main camera, a 13-megapixel module from Sony is used.  There is autofocus and support for the fashionable HDR option.  However, one does not have to expect much from this sensor.  He is budgetary.  With daylight, the camera does a great job.  Also, photos are good at good indoor lighting.  But shooting at dusk, judging by the reviews, is generally worthless.  Hard noise and various artifacts immediately become apparent.  The built-in flash does not correct the situation.  In the dark, it‚Äôs better not to use the camera at all, because you will be disappointed with the quality of shooting.  Such a device as the Sony Xperia E5 F3311 Graphite Black is clearly not suitable for creating masterpieces of mobile photography.  User reviews speak very eloquently about this. </p>

    <p>  As the front module, a sensor with 5 megapixels is used.  This component of the smartphone does not shine at all with characteristics.  The lens is wide-angle.  There is even a filter that smoothes the skin.  But overall, the quality of the photos is slightly worse than average.  But for posting pictures on Instagram and communicating on Skype, the front camera is quite enough.  Expecting for more would be foolish, since the smartphone is still budget.  And it can‚Äôt be attributed to the category of camera phones.  Nevertheless, experts say that not all budget devices are able to provide even such quality photos.  So you still have to say thanks to Sony for such high-quality cameras in their smartphone.  Now let's move on to the operating system of the gadget. </p><h2>  Software platform </h2><p>  The smartphone is running an operating system from Google - Android 6.0.  This is a pretty quick system, which is flavored with a proprietary interface from Sony.  This state of affairs is characteristic of all devices of the Xperia line.  There is nothing surprising in this.  The OS runs smoothly and quickly.  No brakes and glitches are found.  Even despite the fact that there is no RAM at all 2 gigabytes.  However, the optimization of iron and system level.  There are a number of preinstalled applications from the manufacturer.  First of all, this is a Walkman branded player.  Also, there are all sorts of "improvers" of sound.  Sony devices have always been associated with high-quality players.  And the company is clearly not going to lose ground in this regard. </p><p>  The proprietary shell modifies not only the appearance of the operating system.  There are also new features that are not in the stock "Android".  All this makes working with a smartphone more enjoyable.  Judging by the reviews, the smartphone Sony Xperia E5 F3311 (LTE), boasts the most beautiful shell among all devices based on Android.  And it's not a joke.  This state of affairs only plays into the hands of companies.  Another plus is that Sony's smartphones are not trying to copy the iPhone interface.  While Huawei (and other manufacturers) make their shells ‚ÄúiPhone-like‚Äù, Xperia devices managed to maintain their uniqueness.  And this is another reason to pay attention to these gadgets. </p><h2>  Battery and battery life </h2><p>  This is probably the very parameter that most potential buyers care about the most.  Not everyone will be happy to depend on the outlet.  That is why the question of the autonomous operation of the device is the most burning.  The smartphone uses a battery with a capacity of 2300 mAh.  Is it a lot or a little?  Modern budget smartphones are most often equipped with batteries of 3000 mAh and higher.  But this does not mean at all that the autonomy of this smartphone is worthless.  It's not about the amount of mAh, but about optimizing the operating system of the device and its filling.  And with this, everything is in order with the Sony Xperia E5 F3311 White.  User reviews confirm this. </p><p>  The device‚Äôs operating system provides two power-saving modes.  They are called Stamina and UltraStamina.  Both are designed to extend the battery life of the smartphone.  If you need only phone functions from the device, then it is better to use the Ultra Stamina mode.  It allows the gadget to work up to two days without recharging.  In normal mode, "Stamina" gadget works, according to reviews, a day and a half without connecting to the mains.  But without all these additions in normal use, the smartphone barely lasts a day.  This is not good.  Even for a budget device.  Sony would have been better equipped with a more capacious battery.  Then there would be no such problems with autonomy.  Well, at least there are energy-saving modes - and thanks for that. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone sony xperia e5 f3311 black reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2102887.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Smartphone Owner Reviews </h2><p>  So we got to the most interesting.  It‚Äôs worth studying the reviews of the owners of a device for the simple reason that it is they that make it possible to understand how the device behaves in everyday use.  You can also find out how much the manufacturers were bewildered by writing down the declared characteristics of the gadget.  As a rule, they are significantly different from the real ones.  Be that as it may, let's take a closer look at the Sony Xperia E5 F3311.  Reviews about this product are mixed.  There are both positive and negative.  But we will start with the positive. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  Everything is simple here.  Ardent fans of equipment from "Sony" in full praise the smartphone and do not even pay attention to the shortcomings.  Although it is impossible not to notice them.  The positive features (according to the owners) include a successful design, small dimensions, good performance and the presence of a proprietary shell that covers the bare "Android".  Also, some users are satisfied with the Sony Xperia E5 F3311 LTE White camera.  Their reviews suggest that she not only shoots excellently in good lighting, but also adequately copes with shooting with a lack of it.  Well, let's take a word.  Also, owners note the high-quality assembly of the device.  This, of course, is standard for Sony products, but still nice.  Tempered glass, according to users, behaves excellently.  History is known when only it saved the screen from certain death.  Well, these things can also be written in pluses. </p><p>  The positive comments include praise for the autonomy of the device.  Although this is rather strange, because the device barely survives the day in normal mode.  Nevertheless, those who use the device in the "Stamina" mode are very satisfied.  What do consumers say about the performance of the Sony Xperia E5 F3311 LTE Black?  Reviews about her are reserved-positive.  The owners note that the device‚Äôs performance is sufficient to cope with its basic responsibilities and play HD content.  You can‚Äôt count on more.  Separate praise from users was awarded the display device.  Well, he is really very high quality.  There is something to praise him for. </p><h2>  Negative owner reviews </h2><p>  Along with those who praise the unusual advantages of the device, there are those who categorically did not like the Sony smartphone.  And there are reasons for that.  Many owners are not happy with battery life.  And that is understandable.  Not everyone agrees to limit the functionality of the device using energy-saving modes.  The second problem of this smartphone is its frankly no camera.  According to many users, all that fans of the brand say about the ‚Äúwonderful‚Äù photo module is frank nonsense.  According to them, the camera is not able to adequately cope even with shooting in the daytime.  Not to mention night photos.  Also, users categorically did not like the front camera.  What they hastened to report to the public.  Especially annoying owners built-in option to improve the skin.  You can‚Äôt disable it in any way.  And this can be attributed to the minuses of the device.  This is the opinion of some users about the Sony Xperia E5 F3311 White.  Reviews do not shine with positive maxims. </p><p>  But that is not all.  Many owners of this smartphone are indignant to the core that the device is unable to cope with any "normal" toy.  Taking these comments into account is hardly worth it.  They are written by those people who, most likely, did not realize that they had acquired a budget device designed exclusively for work.  The only component of the smartphone that does not cause any complaints is the screen.  There is not a single complaint to him.  But there are many complaints about the non-removable back cover (and battery).  But those who complain about this do not seem to understand that this is a modern trend.  All manufacturers produce such devices.  The era of removable batteries has sunk into oblivion. </p><p> Let us consider in more detail the statements about the performance of the software platform of such a device as the Sony Xperia E5 F3311 Black smartphone.  Reviews about the OS and the proprietary shell are simply devastating.  Almost all owners claim that the system with all its "beauties" is severely slow.  And where is the truth?  After all, fans of ‚ÄúSony‚Äù say that everything is fine?  It all depends on the tastes of a particular person.  So rely entirely on the opinions of others is not worth it.  It‚Äôs better to ‚Äútouch‚Äù the smartphone a bit before buying.  Then you can rely on your feelings.  And to buy a black or white smartphone Sony Xperia E5 F3311, the reviews of which we just made out, with a full understanding of all the features of this device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony xperia e5 f3311 graphite black reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2102881.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we reviewed the smartphone Sony Xperia E5 F3311 LTE.  Reviews about this device are mixed.  It has a large army of fans.  But no lesser partisan detachments of ‚Äúhaters‚Äù are trying to convince us that the smartphone is not worth buying.  In general, this device is a standard entry-level device.  You should not expect any unprecedented performance miracles from him.  Battery life, he also does not shine.  However, it has a very high-quality screen and good cameras (whatever they say).  There is no doubt only one thing: it is not possible to find such a high-quality device for such a ridiculous price.  At all the closest competitors, either the quality is lame or the price is too high.  Similar models may also have incomparable functionality.  It is worth saying that devices of this level are not equipped with NFC chips at all.  And black, as well as white Sony Xperia E5 F3311, reviews about which we just made out, it is.  In any case, if you are looking for a reliable, high-quality, functional and inexpensive gadget, then this smartphone is just what you need.  Do not forget about the world famous brand.  Sony cares about its reputation, so the percentage of factory defects is extremely low.  And if a smartphone comes from Japan, then this is generally a fairy tale. </p>
