Reviews sometimes refer to it as the Oasis of Brisas del Carib.  But this is an old name.  This hotel was built in 1916, but in two thousand and fifteen underwent a complete renovation.  The very word "Varadero", present in the title, sets up for a relaxing holiday.  Indeed, this is the most famous beach in Cuba!  And what else, besides the gentle sea and white sand framed by palm trees languidly bending over the water, is the Hotel Brisas Del Caribe 4 * happy?  The rating at this hotel is four points out of five, which is not so bad, taking into account the general service in Cuba.  Let’s take a closer look at this hotel.  Numerous reviews of tourists will help us with this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Brisas del caribe reviews" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1333292.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is the hotel located and how to get to it </h2><p>  The hotel is one hundred and forty kilometers from the <span>capital of Cuba, Havana.</span>  Those tourists who arrived on a package tour are provided with a transfer from the airport.  It will take two and a half hours, or even more.  Therefore, initially be patient.  Independent travelers should first get by bus to Varadero.  But this city also has its own airport, where charter flights land.  It is thirty kilometers from the hotel, which can be overcome with a taxi.  Hotel Brisas Del Caribe 4 * photos of tourists are rarely captured from the main facade.  It is located at Las Morlyas Street, seven kilometers from the center of Varadero.  To plunge into the fun, albeit poor life of a real Cuba, you need to take a minibus that runs along the main highway that connects the city with this wonderful beach.  Near the hotel, according to reviews, there is also a dolphinarium, which children really like. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="brisas del caribe 4 reviews" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1333541.jpg" width="600"></div>

Only the life of local inhabitants, deprived of basic amenities, takes place in the surroundings of the tropical sun and the Caribbean.  Therefore, they are not very discouraged.  Very close, but completely parallel, another reality flows - tourist.  Vibrant parties, all-inclusive, Cuba Libre cocktails, etc. - all this takes place on the closed reservations of hotels such as Brisas Del Caribe.  The reviews hint that it is worth entering into the difficult financial situation of the maintenance staff.  Left tips will make the service even more welcoming.  Varadero is a well-known resort in Cuba.  An endless strip of snow-white sand, extending into the distance for several kilometers, will not leave anyone indifferent.  Here is a great place for all categories of vacationers: newlyweds seeking solitude, mothers with young children, active divers, beach “seals”.  That’s why they go to Cuba. </p><h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  Brisas Del Caribe reviews are often called a hotel complex.  This four-star hotel covers a vast area of ​​fifteen and a half hectares.  The complex can conditionally be divided into two parts: northern and southern.  This is due to the specialization of the hotel, which is part of the Oasis Hotels chain.  Management is trying to attract all categories of customers.  Therefore, there are rooms in multi-storey buildings, in secluded bungalows, in elite cottages.  In total, the complex has six four-story buildings.  The case in the southern part is newer, it is recommended that reviews be taken when checking in.  It has its own pool and a 24-hour restaurant.  However, the entire southern part of the complex is located a little further from the sea.  Five secluded two-story bungalows belong to the southern part.  They are suitable for honeymooners and people who love a quiet measured rest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Brisas Del Caribe 4 reviews" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1333298.jpg" width="600"></div>

Reviews urge you to tune in to positive.  Do not climb with a cotton swab under the rim of the toilet bowl to check for sterility.  Relax - you are in Cuba, and also on one of its best beaches!  The hotel has four truly luxurious rooms - “Jacuzzi suites”.  Two more guest rooms fully take into account the special needs of people with disabilities.  There are forty rooms with a connecting door for families.  Let's look at the "standard" at the Brisas Del Caribe 4 * hotel.

They have large windows and spacious balconies.  If you book a double "standard", reviews recommend that you agree in advance that it will be located in the south wing.  In the northern part, old furniture is still preserved.  As for room service, tourists claim that the staff is trying to maintain everything in working order.  Problems should be reported immediately to the reception.  All breakdowns are eliminated by the specialist who came to the call.  Clean without any tip very carefully.  And for the small reward left, the maids will spin different funny figures from towels and put flowers in a vase.

Reviews say that it is very nice to receive an unexpected gift, albeit symbolic, in the form of a cake and a basket of fruits.

    <h2>  What to see in the vicinity of the hotel </h2><p>  Varadero has only one drawback.  This is a completely new resort, serving as a kind of reservation for wealthy tourists.  Therefore, there are no attractions in the classical sense of the word in the town.  The only thing that attracts tourists to Varadero is its peerless beach and clear sea.  However, there is a tour desk at the Cubanacan Brisas Del Caribe Hotel (reviews repeatedly mention this).  What travels should I book from Varadero?  Tourists are advised to go to Havana.  And not just on the bus, but on a retro car.  There are also thematic excursions around Liberty Island dedicated to the “Comandante Che” or Ernest Hemingway.  In Havana, if you go there yourself, you should not miss the cigar factory and Almendares Park.  There are excursions to other cities of the country, for example, to Santiago de Cuba.  An interesting and informative trip to a tobacco plantation in Pinar del Rio.  Children will enjoy visiting the dolphinarium and the crocodile farm.  You can go to the islands of Cayo Blanco and Cayo Largo both by boat and by helicopter.  Fans of diving and snorkeling will not be indifferent to the coral reefs of Huventud.  The karst <span>valley of Vinales</span> is famous for its amazing nature.  You can watch how sugarcane turns into brown crystals in factories in the province of Matanzas.  For historical sights, head to Trinidad de Cuba.  Do not forget to bring your swimwear with you - in this city you will find the second famous beach in the country, Playa Major.  The cost of an average excursion from Varadero is about seventy convertible pesos. </p>
