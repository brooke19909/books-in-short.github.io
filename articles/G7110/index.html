This rich exotic island located in the <span>Andaman Sea,</span> many call a tropical paradise, which combines the natural landscape, untouched by man, modern comfortable amenities and all kinds of entertainment.  The tropical island, framed by <span>white sand</span> on all sides <span>, is</span> washed by the clear emerald sea, and the cliffs and gorges covered with forest make the island look like a green mountain rising above the sea.  By the way, Phuket in Malaysian means Mountain.  It offers tourists numerous <span>hotels Phuket</span> reviews <strong> </strong>  which can be read on the island's website or found on the Internet. </p><p>  Phuket is a modern tourist center, but beach tourism is especially developed here.  Tourists are primarily attracted by the wonderful, well-equipped sunny beaches.  There, on the shore, professional massage therapists give everyone the famous Thai massage, known throughout the world.  Holidays in Phuket can be combined with diving, windsurfing, spearfishing, or you can just take a yacht to the <span>coral reefs</span> or take an excursion to the nearby islands.  And on the beaches located on the west coast, you can find everything from bars and restaurants to a disco and a golf course.  However, diving in Phuket, as in Thailand in general, is much inferior to this exotic kind of underwater sport in Egypt or the Maldives. </p><p>  Phuket hotels can be divided into several types.  Especially famous are the five-star hotels in Phuket. Reviews, <strong> </strong>  left by visitors help to make a complete picture about the level of service and the service offered, as well as about the shortcomings of a hotel.  Depending on the type of hotel, prices and services offered depend.  Exclusive hotels are very expensive.  But a vacation in Phuket can be quite affordable if you rent inexpensive, but comfortable beach bungalows.  If you travel to Phuket, tourist reviews <strong> </strong>  help you navigate and choose the right option.  In any case, you will find comfortable and hospitable hotels in Phuket, reviews of guests about which honestly tell about all the advantages and disadvantages of hotels.  Reading such reviews is always interesting and instructive, since only from reviews you can find out the unadorned truth about hotels. </p><p>  So the four-star Cape Panwa, the oldest hotel on the island with its own traditions, provides many different amenities and services.  Perhaps this hotel is much better than other hotels in <span>Phuket, reviews</span> of which are generally equally favorable, only many tourists note not only the variety of services provided, a beautiful view of the Andaman Sea, which opens directly and the hotel windows, but also, unfortunately, quite high prices for accommodation. </p><p>  The hotel is 42 kilometers from the airport and is located on a cozy hilly cape Panwa, featuring a beautiful palm grove and an excellent quiet beach.  The distance from the bustling tourist centers of the coast of the island in the southeast makes the hotel a welcome place for families. </p><p>  Thais are a friendly and hospitable people, but with their very characteristic culture and customs.  A European who is unfamiliar with them can easily get into an awkward situation or even offend a Thai.  For example, in Thailand it is customary to tip, and if you hide your money not in a safe, but somewhere far away, the maid who comes to clean the room will surely find it and take it for a tip.  And if you want to feel sorry for the Thai child - never pat him on the head.  Therefore, on a trip to Phuket, reviews from tourists can warn you from such a nuisance. </p>
