This city, located on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, is known for a mix of diverse cultures and nationalities.  On its territory there are a lot of unusual sights and art objects, there are many cultural events and significant events.  That is why in recent years, tours to New York have become extremely popular.  We will discuss all the features of such a journey in this article. </p><h2>  History tour </h2><p>  The first indigenous peoples who lived on the territory of modern New York were the Indians.  Then, in the first half of the 17th century, as part of the East India Company, sailor Henry Hudson landed on these lands.  After several Dutch families founded the first settlement on the territory of the modern island of Manhattan. </p><p>  In the second half of the 17th century, the British army landed near modern Brooklyn with the goal of capturing and controlling Dutch settlers.  As a result, the Englishman Richard Nichols became the new governor and named the city in honor of the king‚Äôs brother - the Duke of York, who organized this expedition. </p><p>  Under British rule, taxes were raised on molasses and sugar for the local population, and the <span>Stamp Act was</span> introduced <span>.</span>  The last straw for New Yorkers was the increase in the tea tax, after which a mass protest was organized. </p><p>  Later, the war for independence from England began, which ended in the victory of the Americans in the second half of the 18th century.  The post-war period is characterized by the rapid development and establishment of New York as a world center of economic, financial and political life. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Currently, the airline market is replete with offers from airlines for every taste and budget.  The most convenient, according to the lucky owners of a tour to New York from Moscow, is the offer of Aeroflot.  The airline operates daily direct flights from Moscow (Sheremetyevo Airport) to New York (John F. Kennedy Airport).  It is worth noting the fact that for tourists who have purchased tours to New York from St. Petersburg, it is necessary to consider options with a change, as there are no direct flights from the cultural capital. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.timeout.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="New York: Manhattan" class="if uuid-2297742" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66454/2297742.jpg"></div><p>  Also, many other airlines make flights from Russia to New York with transfers in major European cities.  As a rule, purchasing such tickets is cheaper.  But it is worth keeping in mind that the time spent at the airport of the transit city can reach twenty-four hours, which will entail payment for the hotel.  To enter the city you need to take care of visa formalities in advance.  This option is worth considering for travelers who have purchased tours to New York from St. Petersburg. </p><p>  There is an alternative option - a cruise ship.  It must be borne in mind that it is expensive, and it will take several weeks to sail.  According to numerous reviews of tourists, purchasing tours to New York with a flight is the most profitable and fastest way to get to the desired place. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel selection </h2><p>  Choosing a hotel in New York is not so easy.  All of them usually have a high cost, especially when booking on weekends and holidays.  Although many tour operators as part of packages of excursion tours to New York will offer you a choice of several options for hotels of different price categories. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.whotelsnewyork.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel in New York" class="if uuid-2297750" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66454/2297750.jpg"></div><p>  In this article, we will consider several general principles that should be followed when choosing a hotel.  The main one is the advance selection and booking of the hotel.  You will have to select and compare dozens of suitable options.  The main criteria when choosing a hotel are the convenience of the room (availability of the necessary number of beds and a separate bathroom, refrigerator, Internet, TV, sufficient room area) and the location of your hotel relative to the city infrastructure (proximity to metro stations or bus stops). </p><p>  It is worth noting that according to the numerous reviews of tourists, you can save by purchasing so-called "last-minute" tours to New York from tour operators. </p><h2>  Transport </h2><p>  New York is a modern metropolis that has an extensive transportation system.  The most popular and cheapest form of transport here is the metro, which operates around the clock.  For a trip on the subway, tourists need to purchase a special card, which is sold not only at the box office, but also in some hardware and grocery stores. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Buses are also very popular with tourists.  Moreover, payment can be made with the same card as trips in the subway.  Each bus is marked with a special prefix that is assigned to each district of the city.  New York buses run even to remote parts of the metropolis, where the subway has not yet been transported. </p><p>  The yellow New York taxi has long become a recognizable symbol of the city.  It should be borne in mind that this is a fairly expensive way to travel.  Taxis can be caught on the street, and the minimum cost of the trip is ten dollars. </p><p>  Among other things, in the city there is a cable car that will take tourists to Roosevelt Island.  The bridge crosses the East River Strait, so along the way you can admire the beautiful scenery. </p><p>  Extremely popular with tourists is the free ferry service that runs between New York's Manhattan and Staten Island.  During the trip you can admire the Statue of Liberty, the harbor and the urban landscapes of lower Manhattan. </p><h2>  The Statue of Liberty </h2><p>  The first attraction that enters the route of any tour to New York is the world-famous statue of Liberty.  This sculpture was donated by the USA to France in honor of the friendship of the two powers.  It is installed on the island of Liberty, which is located in the southwest of the <span>island of Manhattan.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The Statue of Liberty" class="if uuid-2297746" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66454/2297746.jpg"></div><p>  The statue stands on broken shackles, holding a torch and a tablet with the date of adoption of the US Constitution engraved on it.  The sculpture is made of sheets of copper.  In the crown of the statue, to which 356 steps lead, there is an observation deck, and in the pedestal is a museum of the history of its creation. </p><h2>  New York Central Park </h2><p>  New York City <span>Central Park</span> is one of the city's most recognizable attractions.  His landscapes are created by hand.  In the park, in addition to green spaces, there are several lakes where you can go boating, paths for walks, picnic lawns and ice rinks.  There are also many children's playgrounds, zoos, fountains, monuments, museums and theaters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rentberry.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Central park" class="if uuid-2297745" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66454/2297745.jpg"></div><p>  The park hosts sporting events, as well as free performances and concerts of various creative groups.  For children, theaters provide entertainment programs with the participation of professional animators. </p><h2>  Broadway </h2><p>  The famous Broadway Street is a mandatory part of the tour program in New York.  This is the longest street of the city is very popular with all tourists in the world.  Its mass fame is associated mainly with the location of the theater district within it.  This place is famous for its famous musicals, magnificent theatrical productions and a variety of art exhibitions, which locals enjoy visiting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="insider.ticketmaster.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Broadway Street" class="if uuid-2297791" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66454/2297791.jpg"></div><p>  It is worth noting that the abundance of cultural life concentrated in one place makes an indelible impression on travelers from all over the world. </p><h2>  Times Square </h2><p>  It is the duty of every tourist to stroll along the famous symbol of the metropolis - Times Square.  The square looks especially impressive in the evening, when it is replete with its many neon signs.  On its territory there are offices of television studios and world corporations, cutting-edge cinemas, many restaurants, various shows and flash mobs are held here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nycgo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Times Square" class="if uuid-2297751" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66454/2297751.jpg"></div><p>  This area withstands a massive influx of tourists every day.  It is worth noting that a visit to Times Square, according to numerous traveler reviews, is worth starting with the information center, which is located between 46 and 47 streets. </p><h2>  Fifth Avenue </h2><p>  Walking along this famous street is included in all packages of tours to New York.
