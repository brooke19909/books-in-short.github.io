The population of the former Leningrad is approaching the mark of 6 million people, and they all need to live somewhere.  Among Petersburgers, as well as among Muscovites, there is a tendency to purchase housing in facilities under construction not in the city center.  Their location is much more attractive from an environmental point of view, and the price in such areas is much lower.  One of the described <span>residential complexes</span> is Shcheglovo Park. </p>

    <h2>  A little about the village Shcheglovo </h2><p>  Outside the city of Vsevolozhsk, Leningrad Region, with a population of more than 65 thousand people, there is a small village Shcheglovo.  There are only about two hundred inhabitants in it.  Basically, it houses low-rise buildings (about a little more than 100) and a minimum of infrastructure.  There is a school, a bank branch, a settlement administration.  Recently, developers are actively conducting their work here.  Because the territory is very profitable for the implementation of development projects.  Several residential complexes have already climbed up: Firebird, Shcheglovskaya Manor, and Alphabet. </p>

    <h2>  Location of the complex </h2><p>  To get to the complex from the city center, you must first get to the Ring Road.  Then take the A128 "St. Petersburg-Morje" highway, the "Road of Life" highway, to the village of Scheglovo.  This is approximately 15 kilometers, and the travel time can be about 15 minutes if there are no traffic jams.  Right in the center of the village will be located LCD Shcheglovo Park. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can also get to the village by public transport.  For example, by train, coming from Finland Station.  True, it will take much longer - about 42 minutes.  Moreover, the inconvenience is that it is necessary to overcome a distance of about two kilometers from the station to the complex itself.  Which is not very convenient. </p>

    <h2>  Overview and description of the complex </h2><p>  By purchasing apartments in the Shcheglovo Park residential complex, their owners become residents of the village of the same name and get the opportunity to register in the Leningrad Region.  The area under the complex will be more than one and a half hectares.  The complex itself is two monolithic brick buildings with apartments rising five and eight floors in height.  The total building area will be more than twenty thousand square meters. </p><h2>  Apartments, their layout </h2><p>  The housing stock will be represented by a variety of apartments for every taste and budget: from studios to three-room apartments.  The smallest apartment in the LCD Shcheglovo Park will be approximately 20 square meters.  And the largest one is just over 83 square meters.  Kitchens are also planned not the smallest, their minimum dimensions will be eight meters, maximum - 15. Ceilings - 2.7 meters.  Glazing will be carried out with metal-plastic windows.  All apartments of the housing stock will be rented out by the builder without finishing. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Internal infrastructure </h2><p>  Shcheglovo Park does not provide for any special infrastructure, because the built-up area is not as large as in many other new buildings.  Therefore, the internal infrastructure is limited to landscaping the yard.  That is, the design of walking paths, children's playgrounds.  The territory, which will remain free from construction sites, will be landscaped to create the most favorable environmental situation.  The developer, in addition, also provided for a dog walking area and ground parking for owners of their own vehicles and guests of the complex. </p><p>  In addition, as is now customarily accepted by developers, the first floors of buildings will be given over to non-residential areas to accommodate commercial organizations.  There will be pharmacies, shops, beauty salons.  Only about two thousand square meters are planned non-residential. </p><h2>  External infrastructure </h2><p>  The village of Shcheglovo is small, with a small population, but all the infrastructure necessary for a comfortable life is available.  For young residents of the residential complex "Scheglovo Park" (Vsevolozhsk district), a school and a kindergarten are very close.  There is also a sports club, music school, post office and shopping center.  There is a bar, a cafe, and even a bathhouse in the village. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Ecological situation </h2><p>  If we talk about the environmental situation, then there is only a solid positive.  The residential complex "Scheglovo Park", located in the village of the same name, is located almost among the forest, which makes it possible for its residents to enjoy the fresh air.  Living in this residential complex is like a vacation in the country.  It turns out housing with urban amenities and nature.  A little at a distance there are two lakes with beaches equipped for swimming.  All this will force future owners of apartments in the Shcheglovo Park residential complex to strive to come home faster after a working day in the metropolis. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews about the complex </h2><p>  "Scheglovo Park" reviews have various.  The negative ones are mainly related to the delay and postponement of construction.  Judging by the photos that interest holders post on social networks, the construction is at least a slow pace, but it continues and does not stand still.  To assess the quality of housing in an already finished house today is not possible, since the construction of the facility has not yet been completed.  As for the cost of apartments, here Shcheglovo Park receives well-deserved reviews, since the price is adequate (40-55 thousand rubles per square meter). </p><h2>  Developer </h2><p>  Interest holders are interested in the question of who is the developer of the Shcheglovo Park residential complex.  Developer - Megapolis construction company.  It exists on the construction market for a long time, but previously it was engaged in the construction of only industrial facilities and business centers.  And the construction of residential buildings of this type is what the company is doing for the first time.  This is probably why the implementation of the work is a little delayed, moving slowly. </p><h2>  Construction progress </h2><p>  The construction of the residential complex Shcheglovo Park was launched in 2015.  Photographs taken as the work on the implementation of the object progresses give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãits progress.  Until October 2016, a <span>foundation pit</span> was dug <span>, it was</span> poured, fittings were installed.  In February 2017, the construction of a residential building began.  As of March 2017, you can see that the construction of the Shcheglovo Park facility is not very fast, but several floors have already appeared.  Thus, the construction of the complex does not stop even for a minute.  The facility is scheduled for completion only in the 4th quarter of 2018, so it is too early to talk about observing construction schedules. </p><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  If you consider the advantages and disadvantages by which you can determine whether it is worth buying apartments in the complex or not, then you can specify the following. </p>

    <p>  Among the advantages, the following are especially distinguished: </p><ul><li>  Possibility of installment payment.  At the same time, buyers can be provided with interest-free installments until the end of construction.  A prerequisite - the minimum down payment must be at least half the cost of the apartment. </li><li>  Low cost of housing.  The developer set a really low enough cost per square meter of living space. </li><li>  High ceilings in economy class apartments. </li></ul><p>  Now more about the shortcomings. </p><p>  Many equity holders and not only confuse the developer, who first appeared on this market, does not have sufficient experience and reliable reputation. </p><p>  The land plot on which the residential complex is being built is leased, and does not belong to the company on the basis of ownership. </p><p>  The developer does not offer to purchase apartments using mortgage lending, which greatly complicates the sale and limits the ability to purchase. </p><p>  The complex has designed most of the apartments in the form of one-room or studios.  Thus, large families can not find the necessary housing. </p><p>  Remoteness from the city.  In some cases, it is, on the contrary, a plus due to the favorable environmental situation.  But in this case, it was brought in minuses due to the lack of developed infrastructure and because of the need to go to the city. </p><p>  Future tenants consider another significant minus that apartments are rented out by the builder without finishing.  That is, it will be impossible to immediately move into the purchased housing, since first it will be necessary to carry out a full range of repair work in it. </p>

    <p>  Having studied all the information that is currently presented on the official website of the developer and in other sources, each potential buyer will be able to personally decide for himself whether he should buy real estate in this residential complex or not.  The main indicator determining the ‚Äúfor‚Äù position is the favorable environmental situation, the presence of forest and lakes nearby.  Cons are also indicated above. </p>
