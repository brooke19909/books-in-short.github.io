To do this, there are plastic cards - debit or credit.  To work with them, you need to come up with a pin code.  This combination should be known only to the cardholder.  Without it, operations with the account will not be available. </p><p>  But sometimes you have to think about how to change the pin code on the Sberbank card.  There are various options for the development of events.  And every owner of banking plastic should know about them.  Further in the article we will try to answer this question. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lawecon.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Change pin-code from a card in Sberbank" class="if uuid-2447430" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2447430.jpg"></div><h2>  The possibility of surgery </h2><p>  Can I change the pin code of a Sberbank card?  As already mentioned, we are talking about a secret combination, which is known only to the owner of the plastic.  With its help, a person confirms that he is the owner of the card and account from which money will be debited for transactions. </p><p>  The main problem is that not all banks allow changing PINs from plastic.  Fortunately, Sberbank is not among them.  The card holder can easily cope with the task.  The main thing is to know how to act. </p><h2>  Ways to change data </h2><p>  There are different options for how to change the pin code on a Sberbank card.  True, there are not as many of them as customers would like. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the moment, a person can change the PIN of a bank plastic: </p><ul><li>  through self-service; </li><li>  by direct appeal to the bank branch. </li></ul><p>  No more tricks.  Next, we will get acquainted with the listed layouts in more detail.  Step-by-step instructions will help you change the PIN from bank plastic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sosberbank.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Change PIN from card through ATM" class="if uuid-2447429" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2447429.jpg"></div><h2>  Sberbank Online and data changes </h2><p>  Almost every client sooner or later gets acquainted with an Internet banking service called Sberbank Online.  This system allows you to manage accounts, deposits and cards through the World Wide Web.  Is it possible to change the pin code of a Sberbank card online?  There is currently no such feature.  The owner of the plastic can block it or order a new card, but nothing more. </p><h2>  What will be needed to replace </h2><p>  To answer the question of how to change the pin code on the card of Sberbank, the user has to prepare.  Especially if he decided to take a visit to the office of a financial institution to receive a PIN replacement service. </p><p>  In general, the client will be required to: </p><ul><li>  card with which further work is planned; </li><li>  passport or other identification card; </li><li>  mobile phone (optional). </li></ul><p>  This will be enough.  If a person decided to use self-service terminals, you can do only with bank plastic and a mobile phone. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.sberbank-gid.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ATM option selection" class="if uuid-2447428" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2447428.jpg"></div><h2>  Office visit </h2><p>  You can change the pin code on the Sberbank card through a visit to the company‚Äôs office.  This is a rather long, but reliable method, although at the moment it is not in special demand among the population. </p><p>  The instructions for changing the PIN will look like this: </p><ol><li>  Prepare the documents necessary to translate ideas into reality.  We have already talked about them. </li><li>  Contact any office of Sberbank. </li><li>  Inform employees of their intentions.  They will help to take a ticket for further service. </li><li>  Write a PIN change application.  It is important that the old secret combination is not forgotten by the client. </li><li>  Submit a processing request. </li><li>  Wait a while. </li></ol><p>  If everything is done correctly, Sberbank employees will change the data to confirm work with bank plastic.  This technique works with debit cards and credit cards. </p><h2>  Self-service and data adjustment </h2><p>  The next scenario of how to change the pin code on the Sberbank card is an appeal to self-service systems.  We are talking about the use of Sberbank terminals and ATMs.  With their help, everyone can cope with the task in a few minutes. </p><p>  The guide for changing the PIN under such circumstances will look something like this: </p><ol><li>  Insert the plastic into the ATM and enter the pin from the card. </li><li>  Enter the main menu of the machine. </li><li>  Go to the "My Account" block. </li><li>  Open the section "Information and service". </li><li>  Touch the "Change PIN" text. </li><li>  Indicate a new secret combination. </li><li>  Confirm action. </li></ol><p>  Perhaps this is all.  Now the client will be able to use the new data for working with a bank card. </p><p>  Important: the described action algorithm works only with ATMs and Sberbank terminals equipped with the corresponding function.  Therefore, sometimes to change the PIN you have to purposefully look for a suitable ATM machine. </p><h2>  If there is no access to the old PIN </h2><p>  Sometimes it happens that the owner of the plastic does not use cashless payments for a long time, and then he needs to restore access to the plastic.  In this case, the listed tips will not help. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cashbuzz.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it possible to change the pin code from the card of Sberbank" class="if uuid-2447427" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2447427.jpg"></div><p>  How to change a PIN code on a Sberbank card if the initial PIN is forgotten?  Only one solution will help here - blocking the old plastic and its further re-release. </p><p>  All operations can be carried out in any branch of Sberbank.  It is enough to contact the company employees and inform about the intention to block the old card with its further reissue.  Procedures take some time, but in the end, a person will use an old bank account and a new plastic PIN. </p>
