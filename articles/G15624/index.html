Such is Linden Lake (Tyumen).  Photos of its surroundings will impress even the most demanding tourists.  It got its strange name because it was once surrounded by a large lush forest of linden trees.  Now the gentle shores of the lake are mostly covered with sparse deciduous forest, in which you can only occasionally see linden. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="linden lake tyumen" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1150343.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Geographical location and features </h2><p>  The pond is located northeast of the city, just beyond the ring road, on the outskirts.  The distance from Tyumen is only 8 km.  If you go by car, the road will take no more than 10 minutes.  Tourists from Yekaterinburg will have to overcome 300 km, but a vacation in these places is worth it.  Linden Lake (Tyumen) is famous for its amazingly clear, transparent waters.  This is made possible due to the large number of springs that hit from the bottom of the reservoir.  The depth of the lake is quite large - 15 m, and its area is 6.2 square meters.  km  At the bottom, sand predominates, but in some places silt is possible. </p><p>  From October to April, Linden Lake is covered with ice.  But in the summer it warms up well, which is ideal for swimming. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tyumen Lake Tyumen how to get there" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1150345.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Flora and fauna </h2><p>  Linden Lake (Tyumen) is rich in a variety of fish species: perch, crucian carp, pike, roach, chebak, rotan.  This place is a paradise for fishing enthusiasts.  There are also crayfish in the lake.  Currently, you will rarely find such waters in which they will live.  This trait characterizes the body of water as the cleanest and most environmentally friendly, as crayfish die in dirty waters. </p><p>  White swans periodically fly to the lake.  Gentle shores, densely overgrown with tall reeds, are well suited for hunting.  In the wild part of the lake you can relax and fish for free.  Many tourists do not use the services of a recreation center, but come here "savages", sitting in tents or cars. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Surrounding Linden Lake (Tyumen) recreation center with the same name and the country club "House".  In their territories a whole range of various entertainments is provided for everyone.  It often hosts parties for young people who prefer extreme sports.  One of the main entertainments is wakeboarding (board skating on water).  A daredevil who wants to take a ride sets in motion a cable stretched across the lake.  Such entertainment is a bit like water skiing, only without a motor boat.  Another priority area for recreation is diving.  Because of the purity and transparency of the waters, Linden Lake (Tyumen) is very popular among lovers to dive under water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="linden lake tyumen photo" class="if" height="377" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1150346.jpg" width="600"></div>
