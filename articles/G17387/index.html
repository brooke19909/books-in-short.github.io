The ancient Mayan land with its mysterious pyramids, cenotes - natural wells, hollowed out by tropical showers in limestone, the jungle, mangroves, lagoons ... All this is in abundance in the eco-hotel Sandos Caracol Eco Experience Resort 5 *.  Mexico in miniature ... All the natural beauties of the Mayan Riviera are collected on the territory of this complex, which belongs to the Sandoz Hotels and Resorts line.  Until May, two thousand and thirteen, the hotel was called Sandos Caracol Eco Resort &amp; Spa.  But changing the sign does not mean that spa treatments are over.  The complex has a water park.  The word ‚ÄúExperience‚Äù appeared in the name of the hotel for a reason.  The administration focuses on environmental friendliness, on living in harmony with the environment.  Therefore, during your vacation you will accumulate considerable experience in communicating with the rich Mexican nature.  The complex also houses a golf club. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sandos Caracol eco experience resort 5" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1065814.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is located </h2><p>  The official address of the Sandos Caracol Eco Experience Resort 5 * hotel: Mexico, Mayan Riviera, city of Playa del Carmen.  In fact, the hotel is located on the outskirts of the resort, close to the wild jungle, on the front page of a pristine snow-white beach.  From the balconies of the hotel rooms you can see the picturesque Caribbean Sea, as well as the world famous island of Cozumel.  The resort town of <span>Playa del Carmen,</span> so popular with tourists, is just five minutes by car.  Cancun International Airport is a forty-five minute drive.  With local airlines, you can land in Cozumel.  This airport is located only nineteen kilometers from the hotel.  There are other Sandos hotels next to the complex: Sandoz Karakol Select Club Editable Only Inclusive and Sandos Select Club Resort and SPA four stars.  Our hotel is a series of three-story snow-white buildings, stretched out with the wide letter "P" along the beach. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Resort specifics </h2><p>  As is often the case with coastal towns, Playa del Carmen, before the beach boom, was a fishing village forgotten by God.  Now it is one of the most famous and popular resorts of the Mayan Riviera.  Playa del Carmen managed to combine the spirit of youth parties in the style of North Goa and the restrained European chic of Nice.  The resort has where to have fun, what to see and what to taste.  Of course, shopping is thriving in such places.  Local craftsmen bring their products from all around: sombrero, hammocks, wicker mats, pottery and souvenirs.  The area in which the Hotel Sandos Caracol Eco Experience Resort 5 * is located is amazingly beautiful.  There are cenotes with butterflies and bats, natural lagoons and other natural wonders.  To recreate the virgin appearance of these places, the hotel administration organized a small zoo.  Harmless animals, like cute raccoons, roam the territory absolutely freely. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sandos Caracol eco experience resort 5 reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1065818.jpg" width="600"></div>
