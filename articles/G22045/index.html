  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Screen auto-rotation does not work: causes and solutions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A lot of phone users are faced with a problem when the auto-rotate screen does not work.  Why does this happen?  The reasons are various, ranging from a software failure to a hardware failure.  In today's article, we will talk in detail about the most common problems that cause auto-rotation to stop working, and also consider ways to fix malfunctions.  Let's get started! </p><h2>  Auto rotate disabled </h2><p>  The first and most banal reason why the auto-rotate screen does not work is to disable the function in the phone settings.  Some users specifically turn off auto-rotation in the settings so that it does not interfere in any specific situations, but often forget to turn it back on.  Also, the function can be disabled accidentally, which is not always immediately obvious. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rokwell.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="enable auto-rotate screen through the status bar" class="if uuid-2554678" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2554678.jpg"></div><p>  In any case, this problem is solved very quickly and simply, just activate auto-rotate in the phone so that it will work again.  There are two ways to do this: </p><ol><li>  Using the status bar.  You need to swipe down from the top of the screen, after which among the quick access icons you should find the one on which the frame with arrows or just a round arrow will be drawn.  On some phones, the icons are signed, so this further simplifies the situation.  All that remains to be done is to click on the corresponding ‚Äúbutton‚Äù and activate the treasured function. </li><li>  Using the settings.  You need to go to your phone‚Äôs settings, find the ‚ÄúDisplay‚Äù or ‚ÄúScreen‚Äù item and go there.  In the opened submenu, usually at the very bottom, there will be an item with the ‚ÄúAuto-rotate screen‚Äù switch.  If the switch is inactive, then you just need to turn it on for the function to work. </li></ol><h2>  System malfunction </h2><p>  The second reason why the auto-rotate screen does not work is a system malfunction.  In fact, there is nothing wrong with this, since failures periodically happen, and this is, in general, quite a common occurrence.  Another thing is that during failures, the functionality of certain phone functions, including auto-rotate, may be disrupted. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can fix this problem with a simple reboot of the device.  There is another option - turn off the device completely, remove the battery for a few minutes, then collect everything and turn on the device.  As a rule, a simple reboot is enough. </p><h2>  Firmware issues </h2><p>  The third reason why auto-rotate the screen does not work is problems with the firmware itself.  Sometimes a failure in the operating system can lead to the fact that malfunctions in the functions become more global in nature and it is simply impossible to restore them to their previous state with a reboot. </p><p>  In this case, either a reset to the factory settings or a complete flashing of the device can help. </p><div class="photo" data-original="4idroid.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="screen auto-rotation does not work due to software failure" class="if uuid-2554680" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2554680.jpg"></div><p>  The first item is very simple, just go to the settings and find the section there related to memory and backup.  In this section, as a rule, there is a reset point. </p><p>  As for the flashing of the device, this procedure is already more difficult.  Alas, there is no universal method of flashing, so it‚Äôs worthwhile to study in detail the forums devoted to a specific device model. </p><h2>  Calibration outage </h2><p>  Another reason why the auto-rotate screen does not work on Android and other operating systems is the violation of the accelerometer calibration.  This problem occurs as a result of malfunctions in the system, as well as due to serious device crashes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This ‚Äúbreakdown‚Äù is also treated in two ways.  First, you need to go into the phone‚Äôs settings and in the accessibility menu find the item ‚ÄúAcceleration sensor and gyroscope‚Äù.  Important: on different phones, this item may be called differently and located in other sections.  When you click on the appropriate item, you will need to put the phone on a flat surface, and calibration will happen automatically. </p><div class="photo" data-original="4pda.biz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="screen auto-rotation does not work due to poor calibration of the g-sensor" class="if uuid-2554681" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2554681.jpg"></div><p>  The second way is to use a third-party calibration application, since there are a lot of them now and they are all easy to use.  Of the most effective, it is worth noting Accelerometr Calibration, GPS Status &amp; Toolbox, "Accelerometer". </p><h2>  G-sensor failure </h2><p>  Well, the last reason why auto-rotate the screen does not work is a malfunction of the accelerometer itself (G-sensor).  Unfortunately, this also happens, and the position sensor simply fails. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ifixit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="auto-rotate screen does not work due to faulty accelerometer" class="if uuid-2554679" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2554679.jpg"></div><p>  Alas, in this case it will not be possible to quickly fix the problem, and the phone will need to be taken for repair to a service center or workshop. </p>
