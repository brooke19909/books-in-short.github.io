Then people learned to <span>burn clay,</span> began to make faience and so on.  The origin of beadwork began a long time ago.  But still needlewomen are looking for a new interesting shape and design solution for various decor.  Beaded jewelry never goes out of style.  A woven cord made of beads is a fashionable and versatile accessory that easily accentuates your style.  The weaving of a string of beads is completely subject to even completely inexperienced craftswomen.  We suggest you familiarize yourself with some of the secrets of this fascinating activity. </p><h2>  Scheme weaving </h2><p>  A bead cord is a universal accessory that will wonderfully emphasize your stylish look.  You can create such a decoration yourself by learning to read the diagrams. </p><div class="photo" data-original="svojo-rukodelie.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="description of the scheme" class="if uuid-2675799" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2675799.jpg"></div><p>  The number 6 here indicates how many beads are typed for the circle.  This is also the thickness of the future tow. </p><p>  The downstream figure (in our case it is 358) is the quantitative expression of the beads in the report - the size of the pattern repeated in the bundle. </p><p>  The columns located on the left side of the diagram are also important: the leftmost one is a detailed diagram, the middle one is a pattern in the process, the rightmost one is a finished product. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To make it easier to work with the scheme, there are columns on the right side where the order and number of beads in rows are indicated. </p><p>  They start reading the diagram from the top left, go vertically - first from top to bottom, then from bottom to top.  So continue until the end of weaving. </p><h2>  Types of Harnesses </h2><p>  There are a huge number of varieties of harnesses made of beads. </p><div class="photo" data-original="artcalling.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="various beaded bracelets" class="if uuid-2679196" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2679196.jpg"></div><p>  By the complexity of manufacturing, they are all completely different - from simple ones that do not require special skills, to extremely complex ones, where a lot of patience and attentiveness are needed.  There are some of the most popular methods: </p><ul><li>  The technique of openwork weaving - it is used to create thick strands of beads.  Any number of beads is typed. </li><li>  American is a very simple technique, great for beginners.  Beads of different sizes are used or in combination with beads.  Usually weaves a cord of two colors. </li><li>  Mosaic - the most popular weaving.  Be sure to take an odd number of beads - up to 11 pieces, but the smaller, the more accurately the finished product looks. </li><li>  Twisted technique - it turns out a relief, spiral tourniquet that is different from others. </li></ul><p>  Any of these techniques is used as the basis for manufacturing. </p><h2>  Essential tools and ideas for creativity </h2><p>  We begin to weave the first bead cord.  To do this, prepare the tools. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  According to the manufacturing method, the tows are openwork or dense, knitted or woven. </p><p>  The predecessors of modern harnesses were created from threads and beads.  At first, a wide ribbon was made, it was sewn along the edge, and then into a cord.  This technology has survived the change.  Modern craftswomen have figured out how to weave without subsequent stitching. </p><p>  For work you will need: </p><ul><li>  Thread or fishing line. </li><li>  Beads. </li><li>  Special bead needle. </li><li>  Scissors. </li></ul><p>  If you plan to weave bracelets - bundles of beads, necklaces or other jewelry, then you will also need some types of accessories - rings, carabiners, "lobsters", etc. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="harness made of beads" class="if uuid-2682542" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57442/2682542.jpg"></div><p>  The harness is an empty cord inside.  To add additional density, sometimes use textile laces, plastic flexible tubes (for example, from a dropper). </p><h2>  The Basics of Weaving a Simple Bead Harness for Beginners </h2><p>  One of the simplest techniques is the usual set of beads in the order specified by the scheme.  Thus, both monochrome and multicolor products are performed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dekormyhome.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="simple braid weaving pattern" class="if uuid-2675713" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2675713.jpg"></div><p>  Step-by-step instructions are as follows: </p><ul><li>  On a string, collect 4 beads.  Then the needle is inserted into bead No. 1. </li><li>  Collect 3 more beads, the needle is inserted into the third bead of circle number 1. </li><li>  Again, string 3 beads onto the string.  Now the needle is inserted into the first bead of circle number 2.  Add 2 beads - for balance. </li><li>  Collect 3 more beads and continue using the same method. </li></ul><h2>  Simple mosaic products </h2><p>  This technique is one of the simplest.  Beginner needlewomen can easily do this job. </p><p>  The main condition for this creation of a bead cord is an odd number of beads, recruited at the beginning of the process.  Better to collect from five to eleven beads.  A larger number will make the tourniquet sloppy and messy.  It is necessary to ensure that the plasticity of the product is maintained at a sufficiently high density.  It is also important to observe the degree of tension of the working thread - it should be uniform. </p><p>  When working, focus on the scheme.  Follow these steps: </p><ol><li>  We string seven beads on a working thread.  Next, you need to lock in the ring, pulling the thread through the hole of the bead number 1. Leave the tip of the thread about twenty centimeters to fix the cord. </li><li>  In the second row, continue to weave, stringing the beads one at a time and passing the thread into the first, third, fifth and seventh beads.  So weave to the end of the row. </li><li>  The next circle is done similarly to the second, but the thread is passed through each bead. </li><li>  Thus weave to the desired length of the tow.  Fix the work by passing the needle and thread through the last bead several times. </li><li>  Hide all loose ends under the fasteners. </li></ol><h2>  Crocheting a Bead Harness </h2><p>  Many needlewomen find it much more convenient to do work differently. </p><p>  For the manufacture of such bundles, prepare thin threads for knitting, a hook (preferably less than a few), beads. </p><p>  Crocheting a bead cord from a bead is a great way for beginners to learn how to create beautiful products. </p><p>  Before starting work, it is necessary to make a loop at the end of the thread and string the beads.  Next we continue as usual crocheting - we move the bead to the loop on the hook and grab the thread, pulling it into the loop. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dekormyhome.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet crochet pattern" class="if uuid-2675719" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2675719.jpg"></div><p>  This method is very similar to a set of air loops, but do not forget to tighten the beads.  After collecting the desired number of loops, lock them in a ring. </p><p>  Be sure to control the location of the beads - it should be stacked up and to the right in relation to the bottom row.  To obtain a bulk tourniquet, enclose the base inside - a cord or a rod. </p><p>  At the end of the work, knit in the last row half-columns without beads and close them. </p><p>  This technique of making harnesses will appeal to craftswomen who know how to crochet.  A unique and interesting cord made of beads will become a bright accessory that attracts attention. </p><h2>  Making a square cord </h2><p>  The method of creating square bundles has a more complicated scheme.  To get a tight and neat product, use the same beads in shape and size, experimenting with shades and patterns. </p><p>  So, we start weaving: </p><ul><li>  We take the fishing line, string 4 beads on it.  We fix it in the ring, threading the fishing line into the first bead. </li><li>  Next, we collect 3 beads, we extend the fishing line in the third from the beginning. </li><li>  Again we will collect 3 beads, and we extend the fishing line into the second bead.  We get a cube. </li><li>  Now the fishing line goes to bead number 5, and then stretches through the middle bead on either side of the cube. </li><li>  We string the next bead and stretch the line through the bead in the center on the opposite side. </li></ul><p>  Perhaps at first it will be difficult to deal with all this, but the further process will go easily, since it has a similar character.  It is better to weave according to the pattern.  This will provide an opportunity to quickly understand the operating procedure. </p><h2>  Secrets of experienced needlewomen </h2><p>  To create unique and stylish jewelry, use patterns.  When a craftswoman can read a schematic description, it‚Äôs easier for her to realize any bold ideas.  Stunning harnesses of beads are worn in the form of separate jewelry, complemented with pendants, chains. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lovely Flower Bracelet" class="if uuid-2679234" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2679234.jpg"></div><p>  To create an interesting pattern, you must correctly parse the description of the scheme.  It includes the width of the harnesses, a pattern that is repeated several times (rapport), an expanded view of the product and the final view of the harness. </p><p>  For beginner needlewomen, it is important to improve their ability so that they can create new patterns with their own hands, using a sheet in a cage. </p><h2>  Options for finished jewelry </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.thehoffmans.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="smart bracelets" class="if uuid-2679269" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2679269.jpg"></div><p>  Original, beautiful and stylish bead tows, the photos of which are posted above, clearly demonstrate what beauty can be created from ordinary beads and fishing line.  Wearing such jewelry is very nice.  You can create harnesses for any clothes from your wardrobe and always look stylish. </p><p>  Having created a necklace and bracelet, you will get a wonderful set that is great as a presentation for mom or best friend. </p>
