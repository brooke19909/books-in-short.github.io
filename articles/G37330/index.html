The entire hotel complex overlooks the pools towards the pools and is endowed with signs of open architecture.  The spacious terraces, lined with stylish hotel trestle beds and umbrellas, open onto the <span>panoramic windows of the</span> buildings, as well as the open part of the restaurant, equipped with cozy tables with umbrellas protecting visitors from the sun.

    <p>  In addition, the Turkish and Finnish baths under the all inclusive program are open daily for guests as part of the spa services provided.  By the way, we recommend that you visit the Turkish bath on the first day and pay for a massage.  The procedure will perfectly prepare the skin for further perception of the sea and the sun. </p><h2>  About the beaches </h2><p>  Of course, the area favors finding a boarding house here!  The hotel offers a panoramic landscape of the Taurus Mountains.  In addition, from here to the sea five hundred meters, go to the water's edge - about five minutes.  The Larissa Vista Hotel 4 * hotel on an ongoing basis rents a 100-meter strip of sand and pebble beach on the coast from a five-star hotel.  However, if you walk another 400 meters from this rented beach along the coast, you can get to the city beach.  He, of course, more simply.  By the way, the expression "city beach" in Turkey is not synonymous with the words "dirty" and "groomed".  After all, the local budgets of resort towns in Turkey receive a significant stable income, and therefore they are trying their best to please vacationers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Why are we telling this?  Let‚Äôs explain.  Since the beach rented by the hotel is relatively small, then, having arrived at it at ten (and sometimes nine) in the morning, the resort of the Larissa Vista Hotel 4 * hotel may find that all the trestle beds are occupied.  Then this person at any time of the day will be able to comfortably settle in on the city beach, paying a small amount for the trestle bed. </p><p>  Getting to the seashore is quite simple for vacationers.  After all, from the hotel to the aforementioned beaches regularly (every fifteen minutes in the intervals from 08 <sup>00</sup> to 12 <sup>00</sup> and from 13 <sup>30 to</sup> 18 <sup>00 the</sup> hotel bus makes flights. </p><h2>  Customer Rooms </h2>

In the XII century BC.  e.  the Lycian king Sarpedon with his mighty cousin Glaucus became powerful allies of Troy.  The great Homer mentioned them more than once in his Iliad.  However, even before the epochal battle, pirate bays and hiding places were hidden from view on the rocky shores of this coast.  One of them was located in a truly wonderful place, reliably sheltered by nature itself.

    <h2>  Famous grotto </h2><p>  It's about the Dalmash grotto.  Quite by chance, industrialists, developing quarries, discovered an underground passage leading into it.  The age of this creation of nature, decorated with stalactites and stalagmites, is about 15 thousand years.  The "main hall" of this cave is quite impressive: about 15 meters in height and about 10 meters in length.  For tourists, the beauty of the grotto is emphasized by special lighting and sounding music.  Its unique microclimate is healing, including for patients with asthma.  At a constant temperature of +22 <sup>0</sup> C, the humidity in the grotto is 98%. </p><h2>  Pamukkale </h2><p>  Guests of the Larissa Vista Hotel 4 * Standard often visit it.  Even in ancient times, when Turkey (or Asia Minor, as it was called before) under the rule of the Roman Empire, another unique, thanks to healing mountain springs, healing place was used - Pamukkale, or Cotton Castle.  From afar, it stands out from the surrounding green with its <span>pearl-pearl color.</span>  By the nature of its mineralogical formation, this is a cascade of travertine baths with healing thermal water of different temperatures.  Its main pool, from ancient times called Cleopatra's pool, was used by the ancient Romans, equipping it under their famous baths.  Unfortunately, the earthquake destroyed the ancient columns and porticoes decorating it. </p><p>  It is characteristic that the excursions bought by vacationers from city travel agents are two to three times cheaper than those purchased from guides from Larissa Vista Hotel 4 *.  For example, for the same tour you can pay $ 45, or you can pay $ 15.  Features of the tourism industry in Turkey ... </p><h2>  Mira Demre Kekova </h2>

    <p>  However, back to the cultural program ... Reviews of tourists indicate the popularity of excursions along the route World-Demre-Kekova.  Indeed, in the small town of Demre, the existing church of St. Nicholas has been preserved, where at the beginning of our era this saint, revered in Russia and Ukraine, ruled the service.  In the World, the eyes of sightseers will discover the impressive and almost indestructible antique Greco-Roman amphitheater, cut out of the rock in the 2nd century AD, which has wonderful acoustics.  The pearl of the Mediterranean - the small island of Kekova near the city of Kas - has long been chosen by sailors from different countries.  Here are the well-preserved ruins of the ancient city of Dolichist, partially flooded by the sea. </p><h2>  <strong>About choosing excursions</strong> </h2><p>  It is rather problematic to talk about popular excursion sites in Asia Minor.  These are the burning cliffs of Chimera, the cliff of Lovers, and the Byzantine fortress of Ich-Kale.  You can list for a long time.  Ancient Turkey is rich in wonderful places ... </p><p>  In a word, we recommend that tourists in advance, even before flying to the Country of Stars and Crescent, develop their own excursion route for the duration of their stay.  A good option is to buy a two-day trip to the Christian shrines with a trip to Israel at a Turkish travel agency.  Rich in all kinds of excursions and distinctive Turkey.  The city of Kemer offers tourists the possibility of outdoor activities in the Kapruchay gorge: rafting, tourist routes, mountain climbing.  That is, here everyone chooses a cultural program on their own. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>
