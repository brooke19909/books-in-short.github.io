    <h2>  What do the guests say? </h2><p>  People who have been to the DIT Evrika Beach Club Hotel (Bulgaria) leave positive feedback about their stay at the hotel.  With special attention they note the atmosphere that prevails in the hotel.  The balconies of the rooms offer amazing views.  Watching tourists relaxing on the beach, people walking around the neighborhood and playing pleasant music from restaurants and cafes from the promenade, it is simply impossible not to feel on vacation.  But, what‚Äôs important - at night, nothing prevents a peaceful rest.  The soundproofing in the apartment is excellent. </p><p>  The all-inclusive service is worth it.  The food is tasty, fresh and of high quality, desserts, coffee and cocktails are especially good. </p><p>  But what deserves special praise is the work of the staff.  Each review contains positive comments about the work of the hotel staff.  If you need help, they will provide without slowing down.  By the way, the hotel has a medical office where doctors are always ready to provide their services.  People who came to them in emergency situations, note the attention of the speed of doctors.  The office works around the clock, by the way. </p><p>  The cleaning is also decent.  The apartments are always clean, the maids try - they remove the garbage, report shampoo-gels, change linen with towels. </p><p>  But the best reviews are, of course, the beach.  It is clean, spacious, with sun loungers and umbrellas.  Water is clean and warm.  Of course, algae and jellyfish are characteristic of the Black Sea - but such a phenomenon can be encountered only at the end of August. </p><p>  In general, this is a great hotel for a budget holiday.  You can relax and do not deny yourself anything.  Comfortable conditions, good staff and excellent atmosphere are provided. </p>
