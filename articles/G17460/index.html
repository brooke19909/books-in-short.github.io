  <section class="page js-page"><h1>German Flying Saucers of World War II</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Once, the famous British engineer John Frost, the creator of the first secret prototype of a flying saucer, the U.S. Air Force was asked whether he believes in the existence of such devices.  Smiling at the pretty TV presenter, he gave an affirmative answer and explained: ‚ÄúBut not in the sense that those who consider them aliens from Mars‚Äù.  John Frost did not believe in the alien origin of <span>unidentified flying objects</span> , which people dubbed plates.  He developed secret weapons for the Pentagon and was undoubtedly knowledgeable about the history of the creation of the first flying saucers of the Third Reich.  It was on them that the German command had hopes of victory in the Second World War. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Flying saucer" class="if uuid-2324727" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55362/2324727.jpg"></div><h2>  Discovery of Henry Coand </h2><p>  In 1932, Henry (Henri) Coanda conducted an interesting experiment in Bucharest, witnessed by Radu Manicatida.  He recalls how his famous teacher and inventor of the world's first jet-powered aircraft project, Henry Coande, demonstrated the experience of a disc that rose up and, upon reaching the ceiling, hovered.  At this momentous demonstration, unconventional flight methods were used. </p><p>  If we talk about these principles in a simplified manner, their essence boils down to the following: if you draw air down and along the sloping surface of a plate (disk), then it moves along the object in question.  By drawing in air above the plate, allowing it to flow around and below, the experimenter was able to simultaneously lower the air pressure above the plate and increase this pressure from below, which, in turn, led to the evaporation of the apparatus.  This phenomenon is called the ‚ÄúCoande effect‚Äù.  According to some researchers, the effect formed the basis of the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãGerman flying saucers of World War II. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="7JZVMf1Ufl0" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JZVMf1Ufl0" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/4/4/3/1443.jpg"></div><h2>  Encounters with obscure flying discs </h2><p>  Adherents of the theory of alien contacts put forward the version that aliens from outer space during the Second World War with undisguised interest observed how earthlings improve their skills in exterminating each other.  Here we can recall the incident that occurred in the Indian Ocean in September 1941.  The British, who were on a Polish transport plane, watched a bright shining disk.  Houston sailors were fortunate enough to see several flying lights in February 1942.  During the battle on the Kursk Bulge, two obscure objects were recorded in the sky. </p><p>  At first, nobody paid much attention to these phenomena, preferring to keep some ‚Äúeyewitnesses‚Äù in specialized medical institutions.  However, there were more and more reports.  The Soviet and American command did not know what to do with all this.  Trying to rationally explain everything, they put forward two versions: it was either a grandiose hoax that caused hysteria in the fragile minds of brave soldiers, and in the second case, the probability of a new type of weapon appearing in the enemy was considered. </p><div class="photo" data-original="exopolitics.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="german flying saucers of the second world war" class="if uuid-2324765" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55362/2324765.jpg"></div><p>  It was noticed that this phenomenon was most often observed in the sky above the sea.  What it was connected with, various assumptions were made.  The most plausible can be considered the following: even if we accept the version of the successful German development of flying saucers, the sky above the sea surface seems the most ideal option.  Firstly, there is a low probability of meeting with unwanted witnesses, and secondly, in the event of a disaster, you can easily hide all traces of activity by sending a secret apparatus under water. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Victor Schauberg </h2><p>  The name of this Austrian nugget from the people associated German flying saucers of World War II.  While in a concentration camp, he was forced to take part in the development of a secret "weapon of retaliation."  His main merit is the study of the use of water power.  The introduction of its development would allow mankind to escape from the predatory plunder of the bowels of the earth with the subsequent destruction of the planet.  Throughout his life, the scientist has been the most ardent supporter of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãharmony between man and nature.  He, like his ancestors, worked as a forester, and in his free time he was engaged in natural science. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.renegadetribune.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="photo of a german flying saucer" class="if uuid-2324782" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55362/2324782.jpg"></div><p>  He was especially fascinated by the actions of trout, which is able to freeze in the rapid stream of the stream or, if necessary, to retreat against the stream, although according to the logic of things it should be carried away by the strength of the stream.  Viktor Schauberg associated this ability of fish with temperature in a stream.  He soon conducted an experiment.  Heated about a hundred liters of water, pouring them upstream.  Such a concentration of hot liquid could not significantly affect the overall temperature in the stream.  However, after some time, the trout was not able to fight the course - it was carried away.  This and other interesting experiments allowed us to approach the discovery of self-sustaining dynamic flows.  According to some researchers, this discovery allowed the creation of flying saucers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The principle of operation of the drive for Schauberg levitation </h2><p>  A brilliant scientist argued that a person should learn to create from nature, use this power wisely for his own purposes, without disturbing the natural balance.  Observing vortex flows in air, in water, he noticed that under certain conditions - the conical shape of the vortex, temperature, speed, other parameters - such a flow becomes self-sustaining.  In addition, you can use the energy of the vortex itself, as Schauberg wrote about. </p><blockquote><p>  If water or air is forced to move ‚Äúcycloidally‚Äù - spirally under the influence of high-speed vibrations, then this leads to the formation of a structure of energy or high-quality fine matter, which levitates with incredible strength, dragging the generator body along with it. </p><p>  If you refine this idea according to natural laws, you get the perfect plane or the perfect submarine, and all this with almost no cost for production materials. </p></blockquote><div class="photo" data-original="www.newalexandria.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what is the name of the flying saucer" class="if uuid-2324784" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55362/2324784.jpg"></div><p>  In other words, he proposed the use of condensation and cooling (low pressure), contrasting this energy with the traditional principles of engine operation, where everything is based on high temperature with overpressure. </p><p>  After the war, a whole hunt unfolded between the special services of various countries for its developments.  Americans are more fortunate.  They managed to capture the scientist, holding for almost a year as a prisoner of war.  Valorous Soviet intelligence was only able to thoroughly search his apartment in Vienna, then it was safely blown up. </p><p>  Toward the end of his life, Schauberg became disillusioned with modern science, considering it a henchman‚Äôs usual gang of thieves in the service of corporations, robbing the bright future of humanity. </p><h2>  Shriver-Habermol disks - the first devices with vertical take-off </h2><p>  Since 1937, several classified design teams have been formed in Germany.  Their goal is to create flying discs with vertical take-off.  This was one of the main conditions for creating a combat vehicle that did not need to take off at an airfield.  The project was led by Captain Rudolf Schriever.  Also involved were Andreas Epp, Otto Habermol, Walter Mitte. </p><p>  Their office was located in Prague.  In terms of secrecy, it could argue with the Nazi missile center in Peenemuende.  It was here that the main work was carried out to develop German flying saucers.  The original prototype was a "wheel with a wing."  Had piston and liquid rocket engines.  It looked like a bicycle wheel.  This similarity was given to him by adjustable blades located around the cockpit, which serve to select vertical or horizontal flight. </p><p>  The main defect of this product was the strong vibration caused by the imbalance of the rotor.  They tried to fix this problem by making the outer rim heavier, but failed.  In the end, the creators concentrated all their efforts on a ‚Äúvertical plane‚Äù, as they themselves christened this German flying saucer V 7. It was developed as a high-tech weapon in a war where Germany obviously could not win: the forces were too unequal.  Therefore, the main stake was placed on weapons, which, in terms of their characteristics and operating principles, reached a qualitatively different level. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.strangetruenews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the sound of a flying saucer" class="if uuid-2324781" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55362/2324781.jpg"></div><h2>  The weapon of retaliation - flying disc V 7 </h2><p>  First you need to answer the question: what is the name of the flying saucer, which the creators themselves considered a vertical plane?  It was developed as part of the Vergeltungs Waffen (Weapon of Retaliation), or V-7 (V 7).  The seriousness of the Germans' intentions to develop such unusual ballooning ships is evidenced by the fact that, according to intelligence, about 9 research enterprises worked on this issue. </p><p>  They assembled unusual devices at the Skoda factory.  The figure is 15 units of such prototypes, which were all destroyed in turn.  Evidence of such studies can be found in numerous photos of a German flying saucer, technical documentation that fell into the hands of various special services, eyewitness accounts and some brilliant scientists who continued their secret research after the war, agreeing to cooperate.  Thanks to such a leak, some facts became known to the public.  But even such fragmented information, collected bit by bit, is amazing. </p><h2>  Description of Reich Flying Saucers </h2><p>  To stabilize the control, a steering mechanism was used.  It was similar to the one existing in those days (vertical plumage).  The first test model was 21 meters in diameter.  Its launch was made in the vicinity of Prague in late spring 1944.  She had a horizontal flight speed of about two hundred kilometers per hour. </p><p>  The next version of the flying saucer, assembled at the Ceska Morava plant, had a diameter of 42 meters.  Nozzles placed at the ends of the blades set the rotor in motion.  As in previous models, the engine was the Walter rocket launcher.  The fuel used was the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide.  The cockpit was dome-shaped, around it a wide flat ring rotated under the influence of controlled nozzles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="discaircraft.greyfalcon.us" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reich flying saucers" class="if uuid-2324728" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55362/2324728.jpg"></div><p>  This car in February 1945 was able to rise to a height of over 12,000 meters and develop a horizontal speed of 200 km / h.  There is also a mention that a similar disc was seen shortly before the described events in the Svalbard area.  This information could be perceived skeptically, attributing it to the category of rumors.  However, in 1952, a disk-shaped apparatus suitable for description was indeed found there. </p><h2>  Alien trail </h2><p>  Much has been written about flying saucers made thanks to the efforts of secret occult organizations.  It is alleged that German scientists, relying on certain spiritual practices, were able to create all these technologies on the basis of a symbiosis of science, mysticism and secret knowledge of proto-civilizations.  For a long time there is no doubt that Hitler, his closest associates attached great importance to the study of magic.  Here it‚Äôs enough to recall Ananerbe, the Thule society, as well as a number of other organizations. </p><p>  There are unconfirmed data, which nonetheless are referenced by some Western researchers about the incident that occurred in 1936 near the town of Freiburg.  Allegedly, an <span>alien ship</span> crashed there <span>.</span>  Scientists from the Vril Society immediately clung to this find.  They had enough talent and knowledge to fix an unusual celestial chariot, putting in order its propulsion system and energy system. </p><p>  And then - even more interesting ... They decided to recreate this object, intending to use it for military purposes.  Judging by the photos of a German flying saucer preserved in the archive, scientists from this organization approached this case ‚Äúwith a twinkle‚Äù.  A turret from the Pz-V Panther tank was installed on the flying disk.  Landing poles, machine gun nests, and radio antennas were clearly visible.  The authorship of such a technological device is attributed to Dr. O. V. Shum. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="vcc4PXltRnc" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcc4PXltRnc" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/4/4/4/1444.jpg"></div><h2>  Haunebu </h2><p>  The book ‚ÄúGerman Flying Saucers‚Äù states that the success of the Vril organization pushed another research and development center to launch another series of floppy disks, code-named ‚ÄúHaunebu,‚Äù based on existing developments. </p><blockquote><p>  In his book, German Flying Saucers, O. Bergmann provides some technical specifications (Haunebu-II).  Diameter: 26.3 meters.  Engine: "Tule-tachyonator-70" with a diameter of 23.1 meters.  Control: pulsed magnetic field generator.  Speed: 6000 km / h (estimated - 21 000 km / h).  Flight Duration: 55 hours and above.  Space flight fitness: 100 percent.  Crew: nine people, with passengers: twenty people.  The three <span>rotating turrets</span> below were designed for armament: 6- and 8-inch cruising volley guns and remotely controlled one 11-inch short-range defense in a separate upper rotating turret. </p></blockquote><p>  The famous Victor Schauberg was forced to provide this series with his engine.  What he did with a group of the same unfortunate in a concentration camp. </p><h2>  The mythology of the Third Reich </h2><p>  The famous Italian Giuseppe Bellutstso (Belonze) since the 50s began to shock the public with stories of his involvement in the development of some top-secret flying vehicles.  He is a famous designer, author of steam turbines used in the Navy.  About flying saucers, he said that they were created as unmanned rockets. </p><p>  This type of weapon, he said, was supposed to fly until he ran out of fuel.  Then, according to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhis authors, it will collapse down to explode.  In such a "reliable" way they had to deliver atomic bombs.  There is another no less exciting field of application of mysterious disks - air defense.  They can be sent to the bombers, exploding right in the air. </p><p>  Bellutstso, Sriver, Klein - the names of these individuals were on the lips of the whole world.  Annoying journalists have repeatedly sought comment from Albert Speer, the former Minister of Arms and Erhard Milch, who once served as Minister of Aviation.  These gentlemen, on duty, should have known about various "miracle weapons."  To the dismay of many, they did not confirm their awareness of flying saucers.  Thus, they denied that the Germans had such weapons at the highest level.  But maybe they lied? </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": Richard Byrd in flight jacket, 1920s, "><img itemprop="image" alt="about flying saucers" class="if uuid-2324759" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55362/2324759.jpg"></div><h2>  Admiral Byrd's Inglourious Expedition </h2><p> The legendary American polar explorer Richard Bird in early 1947 approached the shores of Antarctica.  From the very beginning, the objectives of this expedition, its composition raised many questions.  It had the name of the high jump military operation.  Fully funded by the US Navy.  It was no exaggeration a powerful naval group.  An aircraft carrier was sent there, 12 surface ships covered by a submarine.  About 20 aircraft, 5,000 personnel. </p><p>  Immediately before the start of the expedition, in 1946, Admiral Byrd could not resist and stated that he had a very specific military task, but did not go into details.  At the end of January 1947, Americans began aerial reconnaissance in the Queen Maud Land area.  However, this idyll was interrupted in the most severe way, forcing the sailors to flee. </p><p>  During a skirmish with an unknown enemy, the destroyer, half of carrier-based aircraft and several dozen of the lives of American soldiers and officers were lost.  The sound of a flying saucer emerging from the water was not heard by the human ear.  These silent killers flew with incredible speed in front of people mad with horror.  Strange beams sent from the bow set on fire everything in its path.  This massacre lasted about 20 minutes, ending as suddenly as it had begun. </p><p>  The battle that took place on February 26, 1947 off the coast of Antarctica, proves the existence of an unknown powerful force superior to human technology.  Photo of a flying saucer in popular culture is usually associated with an alien presence.  Someone considers these celestial chariots to be the prototype of perfect earth combat vehicles created in secret institutions.  One thing is certain: they are watching and waiting. </p>
