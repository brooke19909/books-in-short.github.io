  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Carolina Bonaparte: biography and family</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The life of Carolina Bonaparte was closely connected with her family, and first of all with her great elder brother - Emperor of France Napoleon I. However, the woman herself possessed, according to contemporaries, a remarkable mind, which in her circle was estimated as state.  And also she was endowed with ambition, not inferior to the ambitions of her brother.  Let's talk more about the biography and family of Carolina Bonaparte. </p><h2>  Proponents of good deeds </h2><p>  Carolina was born in 1782 in Corsica in the city of Ajaccio in a noble family of Corsican origin and known since the XI century.  These were the descendants of Count William Cadoling of Florence, who took part in the Crusades and the struggle between the popes and the Holy Roman Empire on the side of the latter. </p><p>  According to researchers, this is how they got the nickname buona parte (translated from Italian as ‚Äúsupporters of a good cause‚Äù), which became their last name - Bonaparte.  At the beginning of the XVI century, they moved to Corsica. </p><p>  Carolina's father, Carlo Maria, was a low-income court judge.  And her mother, Maria Letizia Ramolino, brought a rich dowry and a high position in society to the family.  She was very attractive and had a solid character. </p><p>  13 children were born in the family, of which 5 died at an early age.  5 brothers and 3 sisters survived to maturity, among whom was Carolina.  At the beginning of the 19th century, Napoleon elevated his sisters and brothers to a number of royal thrones of Europe or made him dukes. </p><h2>  early years </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.fanpop.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Carolina in her youth" class="if uuid-2561675" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2561675.jpg"></div><p>  Together with her family, Carolina Bonaparte moved to France in 1793.  In 1797, while in Italy, she met <span>Joachim Murat.</span>  He was a 30-year-old general in the army of Napoleon.  The girl passionately fell in love with him. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1798, her brother sent her to Madame Campaign's private school in Saint-Germain to receive an education.  There she meets and makes friends with Hortense, daughter of Josephine Beauharnais from a marriage with Alexander Beauharnais.  Having subsequently married her mother, Napoleon adopted her, like her brother Eugene, and treated them with great sympathy. </p><p>  After 18 coup d'√©tat Napoleon carried out a coup d'etat, Joachim Murat came to the boarding house of Carolina Bonaparte to tell her about this great news personally.  Young people decided to get married, but the older brother did not give consent for a long time.  He wanted to pass her off as his other general, Jean Victor Moreau.  But long persuasions on the part of Carolina and Murat had their effect, and the marriage took place. </p><h2>  Marriage </h2><div class="photo" data-original="theesotericcuriosa.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Joachim Murat" class="if uuid-2561682" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2561682.jpg"></div><p>  In the presence of all family members, in January 1800, a marriage contract was signed between 18-year-old Carolina and 32-year-old Joachim.  And then a wedding celebration was held in Mortfontaine. </p><p>  At first, the newlyweds lived in the Brion hotel in Paris, and also spent most of their time in Milan.  In 1805, his brother allocated them funds for the purchase and restoration of the <span>Champs Elysees.</span>  Together with her husband, she took up repairs, acquiring works of art for her new home.  After that, Carolina Bonaparte organized her own salon there. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After Murat went to Naples, Emperor Napoleon I settled there. Today, the Champs Elysees is the Paris residence of the French president.  And here, in the Murat Hall, the Council of Ministers is sitting.  Holidays are organized in the gardens of the palace on Bastille Day. </p><h2>  Deceiving appearance </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.gogmsite.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Portrait with children" class="if uuid-2561672" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2561672.jpg"></div><p>  Some facts of the biography of Carolina Bonaparte, as well as her appearance and character traits, are known from the memoirs of Countess Anna Potocka.  She described Napoleon's sister as follows. </p><p>  Beauty, in her classical sense, she could not boast, as, for example, her sister.  But her features were mobile, and her skin color was dazzling, like many blondes.  Even Carolina, not having a noble origin, was nevertheless distinguished by her impeccable hands and figure, as well as regal posture. </p><p>  French politician and diplomat Charles de Talleyrand, a former foreign minister under three regimes and a master of political intrigue, spoke of this pretty woman that her head was on the shoulders of a state husband. </p><h2>  Craving for power </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.napoleonsites.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Carolina did not shine with beauty" class="if uuid-2561668" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2561668.jpg"></div><p>  Carolina was her brother's darling, she longed for power no less than he did, and not only used his position in her intrigues, but also conspired against him. </p><p>  As the wife of Murat, in 1806 she received the title of Duchess of Berg and Cleve.  And although Bonaparte was not destined to become the French Queen Carolina (as she saw in her dreams), in 1808, again through her husband, she rose to the Queen of Naples. </p><p>  In her affairs, this woman used such statesmen as Jean Junot, Joseph Foucher and the already mentioned Talleyrand.  Carolina dreamed that Napoleon-Achilles-Murat, her eldest son, would become Napoleon I‚Äôs heir on the French throne.  But these plans were not destined to come true, since Napoleon II, the son of the emperor, was born. </p><p>  After her brother was defeated in the war with Russia, in 1813 she entered into an alliance with his enemy, Clement Metternich, at that time the Austrian Foreign Minister.  There is an opinion that this union was not only political, but also of a love nature.  Metternich for one hundred days without any success tried to save the Neapolitan throne for Murat. </p><h2>  Last years and demise </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikiart.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Widow Murat" class="if uuid-2561670" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2561670.jpg"></div><p>  In October 1815, Murat was shot for trying to organize an uprising on the orders of the Neapolitan King Ferdinand IV.  Carolina Murat had to flee to Austria.  In 1830, King Louis Philippe was allowed to visit France. </p><p>  Since 1831, the widow lived in Florence in the Palazzo Griffoni open house.  According to contemporaries, she enjoyed great respect in society, as she was simple and welcoming.  She died in 1839 and was buried in Florence in the church of All Saints.  Her death caused general grief in the city.  Carolina and Joachim had four children: two sons and two daughters. </p><p>  In 1994, a historical adventure novel written by C. Frank and E. Evelyn, My Brother Napoleon, was released.  This book is positioned by the authors as memoirs, allegedly written by Carolina Murat.  According to the authors, she helped her brother become a general and a French emperor by intrigue and female charms.  The novel is entitled "The Revelations of Carolina Bonaparte." </p>
