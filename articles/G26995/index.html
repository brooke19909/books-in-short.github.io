  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Dubai Hotel Sail This is a Modern Arabian Tale</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the most luxurious hotels in the world, Burj Al Arab, better known as Sail, is surrounded by a variety of epithets in superlatives.  Its construction embodied a magnificent and bold architectural solution.  The location of the Sail Hotel in Dubai is made in such a way that it seems as if the hotel tower is protruding into the bay and is about to begin its swimming.  The tower itself, 321 meters high, was built on an artificial island, with a narrow highway strip connecting it to the shore. </p><p>  Some scold <span>Dubai Hotel Parus</span> for excessive luxury, many admire him, but only one thing is clear that any visitor to this grand hotel will remember his stay in it for a long time.  <span>The media</span> constantly publish reviews of the Parus Hotel in Dubai and, as if by agreement, assign it the category of a seven-star hotel, although this level does not exist officially.  However, no one doubts that each of the official five stars assigned to this hotel is made of pure gold and decorated with loose diamonds. </p><p>  Since its appearance in 1991 <span>in Dubai, the</span> Parus <span>Hotel has</span> grown into a variety of legends and myths.  Tourists who are fortunate enough to visit it, can experience this or refute it from their own experience.  Despite the fact that the island is connected to the mainland by motorway, there is a helipad at the very top of the hotel and many guests prefer to arrive here by helicopter.  At the hotel parking lots you can find a variety of top-class cars, hotel taxis - snow-white Rolls-Royces. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Naturally, a hotel stay is not cheap at all, even the simplest room, decorated with rare varieties of marble on the floor and <span>mahogany</span> furniture costs somewhere around $ 5,000, but you need to book it in advance, as there are a lot of people who want to stay at the hotel.  The most luxurious Royal Suite costs about $ 30,000 for one day in it.  In some suites, the interior is decorated with real diamonds, and the toilets are made of special tiles with streaks of fine gold. </p><p>  In <span>Dubai, the</span> Parus <span>Hotel</span> is located so that its panoramic rooms offer views of the coastal strip and absolutely incredible luxurious sea views.  Below is an underwater restaurant, located around a huge aquarium, the volume of which is more than a million liters.  To get to the restaurant, you need to sail on a ship that simulates a submarine.  Almost all hotel staff communicating with guests must speak three European languages ‚Äã‚Äã(English, German, French) and one or two languages ‚Äã‚Äãfrom Asian and Slavic.  The staff is carefully selected in such a way that if the receptionist or the maid can not communicate with the guest in his native language, immediately there is an employee who will be able to easily communicate with the guest. </p><p>  For the convenience of guests arriving in Dubai Hotel Parus by helicopter, registration can be done on any floor of the complex and it‚Äôs not necessary for this to go down to the ground floor at the reception.  In addition to a copy of the passport, a settlement deposit is also required to guarantee payment of additional services.  The amount of deposit usually depends on the category of room.  Each hotel room is distinguished by its unusualness, there is not a single one-story room, they are all on two floors and a magnificent panorama opens from the windows.  The beds are simply huge, king-size.  When developing the design and decoration of rooms, the latest technologies were used.  The design of the entire hotel shows its own local specificity and local <span>mentality.</span>  <span>This is a</span> heavy oriental luxury, decor elements are saturated with gilding, red and burgundy tones, everywhere there is a strong smell of incense.  Relax at this hotel reminiscent of a stay in a modern Arabian tale. </p>
