    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  According to scientists, the <span>Round Lake</span> (Bryansk) is of karst origin, and it maintains the level of groundwater in the surrounding territories.  The diameter of the water mirror is almost 300 m, and the area is 5.3 ha.  Evenly located shallow water zone has a width of 10-15 m and a depth of 1 m. Immediately behind it there is a sharp descent of the bottom.  First, the depth of the lake reaches 3-4 m, and at a distance of 20 m from the coast - 7-9 m. Then, over about 50 m, the column of water from the bottom to the surface is 9-10 m. It gradually increases towards the center, reaching 15-16 m </p><p>  The bottom of the lake is round sandy and weakly silty.  The water is very clear, but the banks along the entire perimeter are swampy and low. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Round Lake (Bryansk): how to get there </h2><p>  Getting to this natural monument, located on the territory of the hydrological reserve, is quite simple.  The lake is located 23 km from Bryansk and the road to it runs past the town of Fokino (5 km to the west) and the Iskork children's camp.  Next, you need to drive through the <span>Bryansk forest,</span> following the signs. </p><p>  To the joy of motorists, the asphalt road, although narrow, is new, so the journey is absolutely safe for the "iron horses", except for the problems with oncoming cars, which are very difficult to part with. </p>

    <h2>  Parking Vinogradova </h2><p>  Bryansk region during the Second World War was one of the centers of the partisan movement.  Near the lake in the 47th square of the Fokinsky forestry, the site of the Vinogradov detachment was relatively recently restored.  Having gone there, you can see dugouts, a well, a furnace with a canopy.  Memorial plates and <span>information boards were</span> installed in the parking lot <span>.</span>  In the forest you can also see a monument to the commander of the partisan detachment Vinogradov, who died at the hands of the Nazis in unclear circumstances. </p><p>  By the way, local residents say that in the 90s, some entrepreneurs made an attempt to destroy the parking lot and memorial objects in the forest near Lake Krugloye in order to build an entertainment center there.  However, thanks to the descendants of the Bryansk partisans, they failed to realize their plan.  The grandchildren of the heroes managed to force the local authorities to ban the construction and preserve objects reminiscent of the feat of Vinogradov and his soldiers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Rest zone </h2><p>  The round lake (Bryansk), whose photos are especially successful in the fall, has long attracted all those who love picnics.  For them, on its shores are equipped two recreation areas with tables, bonfires, gangways to the water and pits for garbage. </p><p>  A gudgeon and river perch live on the lake.  Amateur fishing is allowed, so you can often meet people with fishing rods there.  In addition, in the vicinity of Lake Krugloye, especially in the autumn, there are a lot of mushrooms, and in summer you can collect wild strawberries there.  In the summer, there are many who want to sunbathe and swim, but some vacationers do not dare to go into the water, as many snakes swim near the shore. </p><h2>  The legend of how Round Lake appeared </h2><p>  Bryansk is surrounded by many reservoirs and rivers.  In total, there are 49 large and small lakes in the region.  Many of them are of karst nature.  These include the Round Lake (Bryansk).  At the same time, from ancient times, word of mouth residents of the region passed on the legend of an old man, whose name was associated with his origin.  According to her, once on the site of the lake was a hut.  A wise old man and grandson lived there far from people.  Everyone who despaired of finding a way out of a difficult life situation came to him for advice and spiritual help.  The good old man did not refuse comfort to anyone, but once the pilgrims were amazed to see that the hut had disappeared, and an absolutely round lake had formed in its place. </p>

    <h2>  Meteorite version </h2><p>  Some enthusiasts engaged in leisure activities researching the influence of space "aliens" on the formation of the modern look of our planet do not agree with the version of karst nature of Lake Krugloye.  In their opinion, it arose as a result of a meteorite fall.  Moreover, self-taught researchers believe that this was a real heavenly attack that hit the territory of the modern Dyatkovo and Zhukovsky districts of the Bryansk region.  As a result, 4 lakes arose immediately, one of which is Krugloye.  In support of their version, they note the shape of all these reservoirs, their considerable depth and the presence of similar elevations along the northern shores.  There is also an opinion that there was one meteorite, and during the flight in dense layers of the earth's atmosphere it split into 4 parts.  According to researchers, this is indicated by the crowded location of lake craters in the territory of 11-29 km. </p>

    <h2>  Fern flower </h2><p>  You can hear many incredible eyewitness accounts that mention the Round Lake (Bryansk).  The story of <span>a fern flower</span> is one of them.  If you believe her, then a couple of years ago at night on the <span>holiday of Ivan Kupala</span> on the shore of Lake Krugloy a youth company was resting.  Suddenly they saw a glow, and then found a fern flower.  Moreover, they allegedly even managed to remove it in the photo.  True, it should be noted that fern cannot bloom in principle, which has long been proved by botanists. </p><h2>  The "master" of the lake </h2><p>  Another story concerns a joke, which for one of the residents of Bryansk ended with a slight fright.  According to him, one day, resting on the shores of Lake Krugloye, he loudly shouted a greeting to his "master" and asked him to appear.  After these words, a rather large log floated in his direction from the opposite bank.  Motivated by curiosity, the man swam towards and noticed that his bark was stirring.  It turned out that a few snakes are sitting on a log.  Frightened, the joker swam back.  Since then, he vowed not to enter the water of Lake Krugloye and, coming there on vacation, confines himself to cooking barbecue and sunbathing. </p>

    <h2>  UFO </h2><p>  Some residents of Dyatkovo say that they saw an incomprehensible glow under the water column of Lake Round and even noticed an object resembling a cigar or plate in shape.  According to their version, they could well be a UFO.  This information required verification, so some students who hoped to take a picture of him came to the lake some time ago.  According to one of the expedition members, they saw some pink objects.  They hung in the air above the trees surrounding the Round Lake (Bryansk), whose depth reaches 16 m. Young people took many pictures.  However, upon returning home, there were no traces of UFOs on them.  Scientists explain this phenomenon by optical illusion.  According to them, it occurs when a person sees the light from a flash.  A bright spot remains "imprinted" on the retina for several seconds.  Because of this, it seems to a person that he sees a luminous object. </p><p>  Now you know where the Round Lake is.  There are other interesting sights in Bryansk and its environs, so this Russian region can be a great place to spend a long weekend. </p>
