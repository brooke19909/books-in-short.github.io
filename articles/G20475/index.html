One of the relatively young forms of art is photography (in the form in which we know it). </p><h2>  Pinhole Camera Features </h2><p>  The word "photography" itself appeared before our era and probably had Greek origin.  ‚ÄúPhoto‚Äù from Greek is translated as ‚Äúlight‚Äù, and ‚Äúgrapho‚Äù - ‚ÄúI write.‚Äù So the name itself already explains the essence of the photographing process - drawing with light, obtaining an image on photosensitive material. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="world photography day" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45615/1578334.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  For example, Aristotle already in the 4th century BC.  e.  was well aware of the possibilities of a dark room, the so-called pinhole camera.  The whole essence of this feature is that when light penetrates a room through a small hole outside, it leaves a light image on the wall of existing objects, but in a reduced size and inverted form. </p><p>  Some time later, this principle was described by Leonardo da Vinci in several works. </p><h2>  Getting prototype photos </h2><p>  Such a phenomenon as photography appeared in our life not so long ago, less than 200 years ago.  Despite the fact that the prerequisites for its invention arose at the dawn of the current millennium, they were crowned with final success only in 1826. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After a long experiment, a certain Frenchman named Joseph Niepce managed to capture the image using a pinhole camera on a thin tin plate covered with a layer of asphalt. </p><p>  This photo has been preserved to our times and has the name `` View from the window. ''  It is noteworthy that the image was embossed, which allowed him to copy.  In 1840, began to take black and white photographs on paper. </p><h2>  Color photography and modern digital technology </h2><p>  Already in 1861 they managed to take the first color photograph using three cameras with color filters installed in them in red, green and blue. </p><p>  For almost the entire 20th century, people used <span>film cameras,</span> displaying negatives on their own in a dark room or taking film to specialized departments.  And then for several days they were looking forward to the results. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="World Photography Day August 19" class="if" height="209" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45615/1578336.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the modern world, the vast majority use digital cameras or smartphones. </p><p>  Digital photography first appeared a little over 30 years ago.  But the first full-fledged digital camera was released in 1990 by the American company Kodak. </p><h2>  How World Photography Day came about </h2><p>  Photography is a unique phenomenon, without which no significant event, trip or vacation is complete.  Often people try to capture every moment of their life, the stages of growing up children, the faces of their relatives and friends, beloved pets.  Using a printed image on paper, you can tell friends about your surroundings. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Not surprisingly, an official celebration was devised to celebrate the aforementioned phenomenon - World Photography Day.  It is celebrated on August 19, and it is celebrated not only by professionals, but also simply by amateurs, as well as all those who are partial to this art form. </p><p>  The World Photography Day was established not so long ago, in 2009 with the light hand of Korske Ara, a well-known photographer of Australian origin in certain circles.  The date of the celebration - August 19 - was not chosen by chance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="World Photography Day Congratulations" class="if" height="311" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45615/1578342.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  On this day in 1839, the general public for the first time familiarized themselves with the method of obtaining a photographic print - a daguerreotype.  The merit of this method belonged to Louis Jacques Mande Daguerre, a French artist, chemist and inventor.  Later, the French government bought the rights of Daguerre to invent and proclaimed it a `` gift to the world. '' </p><p>  Daguerreotype allowed to capture the image on a metal plate and was, in fact, the forerunner of full-fledged photography.  Daguerre improved Niepce‚Äôs method of producing an imprint of an image. </p><h2>  Holiday features <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="world photography day world photography day" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45615/1578338.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  World Photography Day is an event for all those who like to take pictures, for those who are not averse to being a model.  Of course, a holiday of this nature with the participation of a huge number of creative people simply can not be boring.  It is always a bright event, where the atmosphere of lightness, fun, ease and positive reigns. </p><p>  How is World Photography Day celebrated?  Its scenario includes, as a rule, the organization of photo exhibitions by free artists, managers or agencies, presentations of professional equipment, interesting flash mobs, as well as great opportunities to make unique and vivid pictures.  It is celebrated in all countries of the world, because activists and fans of this work are in every country, in every city. </p><p>  The holiday is recommended to everyone who wants to have a good time, get professional photos and make friends of interest. </p><h2>  Day of St. Veronica - the patroness of photographers </h2><p>  World Photography Day is celebrated on August 19, but there is another similar event that is celebrated on July 12.  This is the day of St. Veronica, the patroness of photography (Photographer's Day). </p><p>  Legend has it that during the procession of Jesus Christ to Mount Calvary, where the execution was to take place, many people accompanied him.  Among the common people was a girl named Veronica.  When Jesus fell, tired of carrying a huge cross, Veronica, full of pity for the Savior, gave him a drink of water and wiped sweat from her long-suffering face with a handkerchief.  When the girl returned home, she discovered that the image of the face of Christ remained on the scarf. </p>
