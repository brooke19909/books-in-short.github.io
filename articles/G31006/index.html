This can be a powerful offensive weapon.  But even without <span>this, the rook</span> becomes in the center of the vertical.  There, her position is more advantageous.

    <h2>  How to make a chess move? </h2><p>  According to the technique, castling in chess is a double move, which can be made by pieces that have never been played throughout the game.  The first movement you need to move the king to the side to the rook immediately by 2 cells.  Next move we put the rook in the place recently occupied by the king. </p><p>  Although the movements of two figures take place during castling, it is considered to be considered as one move.  First of all, the rule works: touched - go.  Therefore, you need to start castling with a rearrangement of the king into 2 cells, and not a rook.  This is an important aspect in technology, which sometimes results in violation of the rules. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Castling is performed in any of the directions.  It makes no difference whether you move towards the queen or on a short flank.  When creating a short castling, the king is placed on the position of the horse, and the rook replaces the elephant.  If you use its long version, then the king will find himself in the position of an elephant near the queen, in the position of which the rook will fall. </p><h2>  Castling Prohibitions </h2>

    <p>  - the move is excluded if the king or rook has previously walked, or a rook and pawn is vertically castled; </p><p>  - it is forbidden to do such a chess trick if the king is under attack, that is, a check is assigned to him; </p><p>  - if other pieces are placed between the king and the rook, the move is prohibited until the opening of the clear fields. </p><h2>  Chess etiquette - what is it? </h2><p>  It is worth following some rules of the game of chess.  Castling is performed with one hand (like all moves).  This gives a certain elegance to the game.  By itself, it represents a single move, because at first the king moves, and then the rook.  All this is done alternately and one of the hands.  In competitions, there is a rule that if a player takes both the king and the rook, then it is necessary to make the last castling.  If you accidentally touch, and you are not going to carry out this trick, then you need to make any other of the moves king.  In such cases, if the participants touched the rook, then they must make a move with it.  Only castling will not work. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The rules describe such options when the playing participant castles in violation of the previously specified rules.  In this case, the game stops, the move is canceled, and the pieces are put in the initial places.  The participant is obligated to perform any other movement by the king. </p><h2>  One of the varieties of chess tricks </h2>

In this case, the move is considered completed when the clock is translated.  If time management does not go, the participant must say that he is castling.

    <p>  In Fischer chess, according to the results of castling, the king and the rook are placed on the same fields as in the classical version.  At the same time, depending on the initial setting, two pieces can move, and only the king, and only the rook.  Therefore, the rule described earlier does not apply here.  A participant in the game has the right to move castling pieces in any order.  Castling is completed <span>when the clock is translated.</span>  If the party passes without time control, in order to avoid losing the partner‚Äôs orientation, the castled participant of the game must, before moving the pieces, say ‚Äúcastling‚Äù or ‚Äúcastling‚Äù. </p><h2>  Bit of history </h2><p>  Castling in chess is a relatively recent innovation in Europe, whose ‚Äúbirthday‚Äù dates back to the 14th and 15th centuries. </p><p>  Initially, the elephant and the queen turned out to be very weak pieces, and the king felt very well in the center of the playing board.  Some rules provided the king with the first move, like a knight‚Äôs, or 2 squares - because the participant in the game could move the rook and move through it with the next move, this is called ‚Äúproto-castling‚Äù.  Then in the XVI century elephants and queens became long-range.  Therefore, 2 moves are summarized in one. </p>

For a long time in different countries of Europe the rules did not apply to prohibit the movement of the king through a beaten field and to castling from under the shah.  However, it was not everywhere that there were no pieces between the rooks and kings.  Non-standard rules of castling in regular chess lasted the most time in the Italian state - there, the rules accepted by everyone in society now passed only in the early nineteenth century, when Italians had to choose: either to remain faithful to their rules of the national chess game, or to take part in international tournaments.

The king has the right to castle with any rook.  Moreover, after such a move, the king and the rook move to the fields to which they would pass in an ordinary game.  That is, with a short movement, the king finds himself on the field g1, and the rook - on f1.  After the long castling in chess is completed, the king will move to the c1-square, and the rook to the d1-square.  These pieces are not required to make moves before castling.  The king can stand under the check.  The fields through which the pieces move can be occupied, and those through which the king moves can be attacked by an opponent.  During a castling move, situations are possible when the king will stand in his original place and the rook will move.  You can move the king himself first.

    <h2>  Game on the web </h2><p>  When playing Fisher‚Äôs chess on the Internet, the castling move is marked by indicating the field on which the king is located, and the square on which the rook stands.  In such cases, if the initial position remains the position of ordinary chess, the movement must be performed according to the rule indicated earlier.  The explanation of the moves in the case of castling is the same as in ordinary chess.  Other classical chess rules are also suitable for Fisher rules. </p>

In this case, the king and even all the fields on which he moves, may be threatened or be occupied by another figure.  If the king or rook made a move, then the essence of the possibility of castling disappears.  Or, if only a single rook made a move, then there remains the possibility of castling with the second rook.
