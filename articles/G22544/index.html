    <h2>  The childhood of the Polish princess </h2><p>  Maria Leshchinsky was born on June 23, 1703 in Trzebnice, Poland.  She was the daughter of Polish aristocrat <span>Stanislav Leshchinsky.</span>  But, despite this, the girl was not able to enjoy the delights of a luxurious life.  Two years after her birth, a fierce struggle for the throne began in Poland, and her father was involved in a series of bloody battles. </p><p>  Thanks to the support of the Swedes, Stanislav Leshchinsky wins a short-term victory over his opponent Augustus II.  In 1706 he became the rightful <span>king of Poland.</span>  Alas, his reign lasted only three years.  After the crushing defeat of the Swedes near Poltava, August II regains his throne. </p><p>  Having lost patronage, Stanislav with his family flees first to Prussia, and then to France.  Here they have to lead a very modest lifestyle.  Thus, the Polish princess, having noble roots, completely did not know the joys of palace life. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Wife for the king of France </h2><p>  In 1724, <span>King</span> Louis XV of <span>France</span> announced his decision to marry.  Rather, this decision was made by his regent Henri de Bourbon-Conde.  The reason for this was fear for the dynasty.  After all, Louis was her last representative.  In the event of his death, the throne would be without direct heirs, which would lead the country to protracted strife and strife. </p><p>  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has begun searching for a suitable pair for the king.  Soon they had a list of one hundred applicants.  And only after three tough selections, Maria Leshchinsky defeated her competitors.  This was a complete surprise for many, since the girl did not have a dowry. </p><p>  However, she had other advantages.  Firstly, her family was out of political intrigue, which suited the regent.  Secondly, the age of the girl, according to doctors, was ideal for conceiving a child.  Ultimately, it was these virtues that outweighed the rest.  And in 1725, Maria Leshchinsky became the wife of Louis XV, who at that time was only 15 years old. </p>

    <h2>  Children of the Queen of France </h2><p>  The new alliance quickly brought results.  A year later, the newly made queen became pregnant.  In 1727, she gave birth to twins - girls Maria Louise and Henrietta Anna.  This event greatly pleased Louis XV, and in honor of the princesses, a chic feast was arranged. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Soon Maria Leshchinsky became pregnant again.  The whole courtyard was sure that a boy would be born, but the queen gave birth to a daughter.  The king was indignant.  However, a year later, his discontent and unrest were dispelled - the queen swarmed the heir.  In general, their marriage gave France ten children: 8 girls and 2 boys. </p><h2>  Sad fate </h2><p>  Maria Leshchinsky was the queen of France, but was not the mistress of her house.  As soon as Louis grew up, he began to regularly cheat on his wife.  At the same time, he was not ashamed of his love affairs, which touched the queen even more. </p><p>  Over the years, the situation has only worsened.  In 1745, <span>Madame Pompadour</span> became the official favorite of Louis XV <span>.</span>  This lady skillfully courted the king, so that he fulfilled all her whims.  Naturally, the new lover minimized the convenience of a legal wife.  Ultimately, Maria Leshchinsky began to live only with her children, leaving political battles far away. </p>

    <h2>  Mark on history </h2><p>  Becoming the king‚Äôs wife, Mary persuaded Louis XV to support her father in claims to the Polish throne.  In 1733, thanks to the influence of France, Stanislav Leshchinsky again gained power in his native country.  However, the intervention of Russia and Austria led to the fact that the Leschinsky family was forever expelled from Poland. </p><p>  Otherwise, Maria Leshchinsky was remembered as the patroness of the poor.  While her husband burned the wealth of the country for pleasure, she helped those in need with money and food.  That is why the people loved her much more than Louis, who later died in contempt, at the hands of one of his mistresses. </p>
