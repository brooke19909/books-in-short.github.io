Before the start of World War II in Leningrad there was a sufficient amount of products.  They were stored in different areas of the city. </p>

    <p>  During the war, the leadership of Leningrad decided to place all the products in one place.  The choice stopped at the Badayevsky warehouses.  This decision was due to the fact that the products were easier to protect in one place and guarantee their safety.  In September 1941, after German air raids, the warehouses completely burned down.  The city was virtually left without food supplies, and a terrible famine began.  Only after the end of World War II did the restoration of the Badayevsky warehouses begin.  Further you will find out why they are so called. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Badayevsky warehouses in St. Petersburg </h2><p>  It is interesting to know when this famous place was built and why it bears such a name.  Badayevsky warehouses were built in 1914.  They did not belong to their owner, merchant Rasteryaev, for very short time, only a few years.  In 1917, the building became the property of workers and peasants.  For several years, the Badayevsky warehouses were simply called storage facilities.  Only after 1936 did they receive the name that they still have today. </p>

    <p>  We think that many readers will be interested to know why the warehouses began to be called Badayevsky?  Let's make a short excursion into history.  So, in 1937, Aleksey Yegorovich Badayev, a Bolshevik, a prominent party leader in the early 20th century, was appointed People's Commissar of the food industry of the RSFSR.  For many years he dealt with the food supply of the city, and therefore it was decided to name the warehouses in which the products were stored in his honor. </p><h2>  Where were the Badayevsky warehouses </h2><p>  The initial address of their location was somewhat different.  Badayevsky warehouses were located in the area of ​​the Moscow Gate metro.  It is interesting to know where this place is located in St. Petersburg today.  Badayevsky warehouses are located in one of the most popular areas of the city - Moscow.  Remember or write down a more detailed address: Kievskaya street, house 5. How can I get here?  In a huge metropolis, the most convenient and fastest way to get around is the metro.  If you decide to visit the Badayevsky warehouses, then you will need to go to the Frunzenskaya station.  You will only have to walk about eight hundred meters to your destination. </p><h2>  Further perspectives </h2><p>  Badayevsky warehouses today are a large number of warehouse facilities.  In the near future, construction of new buildings will begin here. </p>

    <p>  Developers plan a whole network of structures: </p><ul><li>  new stores; </li><li>  Offices </li><li>  a congress center where business conferences and seminars will be held; </li><li>  the hotel complex, which will consist of three buildings, where about three thousand people can comfortably accommodate. </li></ul><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Badayevsky warehouses - this is one of the places that has <span>become the hallmark of the</span> city ​​along with the Winter Palace, Nevsky Prospect, Summer Garden and other attractions.  Here I want to stop and stand in silence, recalling the sad past of St. Petersburg.  It is hoped that centuries will pass, and other generations will no longer connect the Badaevsky warehouses with fires.  And this place will cause only pleasant emotions and impressions. </p>
