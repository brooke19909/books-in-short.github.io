Especially successful are the island resorts of the Bolearic Islands, washed by the Mediterranean Sea.  There are only four of them, among them are the <span>islands of Ibiza</span> and Mallorca.  If the first of them can be called a paradise for twenty-year-old tourists, then the second, much larger in size, attracts the attention of older holiday-makers, it is very good for families. </p><h2>  Climate and geographical location </h2><p>  The tourist season in Mallorca begins in April and ends in October.  The island is located in a zone of humid subtropical Mediterranean climate.  It is better than all the other Bolear Islands with its mountains protected from the winds, the risk of bad weather on it is minimal. </p>

    <p>  The period from the end of May to the beginning of August is the time of the high holiday season.  In the velvet season (August-September), the weather becomes milder, there are practically no storms, but prices are rising during this period.  It is curious that on the island with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã3.6 thousand km <sup>2</sup> and a population of 860 thousand people there is not a single river.  Majorca drinks and uses only underground fresh water and spring water. </p><p>  Tourists usually fly to the island through its ‚Äúair gate‚Äù, Son San Joan International Airport, located in the suburbs of the island‚Äôs capital, Palma de Mallorca. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  Tourists arriving in Mallorca get to the hotel Hi Mimosa By Globales 3 * (Spain) from the airport using a short (about twenty minutes) car shuttle.  Its address: Avenida Cas Saboners, 28. The hotel complex is located on the second line from the international class beaches of Magaluf and Palmanova.  It was built in 2009.  This is a network hotel complex of economy class from Hoteles Globales with an established corporate culture and company standards of service. </p><p>  You can relax in it relatively quietly and measuredly, because the surrounding developed infrastructure, where the club-bar nightlife flows, is a bit removed (the hotel was built 3 km from the resort center of Palma Nova).  The island shopping center is 15 kilometers away from Hi Mimosa By Globales 3 * (Mallorca).  Photos of shopaholic guests, however, confirm that this is not a problem for them.  Indeed, to the desired shopping centers and boutiques can be reached in a quarter of an hour by regular bus. </p><h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  According to tourists' reviews, the Hi Mimosa By Globales 3 * hotel (Mallorca) fully complies with international three-star standards of service.

    <p>  The layout of the hotel is typical for the <span>resort of Mallorca.</span>  On the ground floor of a ten-story snow-white residential building of the hotel complex there is a reception area, and its diverse and fairly well-developed service infrastructure is concentrated in a spectacular two-story building-annex that complements the general architectural ensemble of the hotel complex.  The hotel area is ennobled by a garden with terraces for walking, a swimming pool and a comfortable seating area near it.  On the floors of the hotel building for tourists are also equipped with comfortable lounge areas.  They are effectively decorated by designers, and their furniture is not cheap: either model-plastic or elegantly wicker. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  For motorists, a free car park is available here. </p><p>  Communication with staff is exclusively in English.  And this is no coincidence, because most of the vacationers in it are British. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  Three standard room types are available at the budget hotel Hi Mimosa By Globales 3 *.  Reviews 2016 characterize their internal design as minimalism.  Furniture and household appliances harmoniously fit into the volume of the room: sofa, beds, safe, TV with satellite channels, air conditioning.  The bathroom is comfortable enough.  The housing stock is well repaired.  Everything is neat, everything is in order.  Housekeeping is meticulous.  This is not even discussed.  For some reason, Europeans consider Germans to be # 1 neatness, although experienced tourists still give the Spaniards leadership in this regard.  It seems that the pursuit of order in their blood. </p><p>  A wide block - in the entire outer wall - Euro-windows and balcony doors.  Spacious balcony with a plastic table and the same chairs.  Walls, ceiling, tiled floors are mostly white.  For the necessary contrast, one of the fragments of the walls is painted in a soft pastel orange color. </p>

    <p>  What is there that you will not find in hotels in other countries?  Numerous closets built into the walls (you're in Spain, sir!).  In them, guests can easily place all their belongings (suitcases, etc.), clothes, household appliances, without cluttering up their premises.  Thanks to this standard, in 19 m <sup>2</sup> , <sup>  </sup>  the hotel room turns out to be much more neat and visually increases.  Tourists in the hotel complex are allocated 4 types of premises: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  3-bed room; </li><li>  Double room with two beds; </li><li>  Double room with one bed; </li><li>  4-seater two-room. </li></ul><p>  For those interested in more accurate statistics, we will inform you that the number of rooms in Mimosa By Globales has 8 quadruple, 149 triple and 130 double rooms. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The infrastructure of Hi Mimosa By Globales 3 * is quite developed.  We have already mentioned the pool and the planted garden.  The hotel complex also has its own comfortable, spectacular white sandy beach.  Plus a hotel restaurant and bar.  In the evenings, its animators invariably hold a disco at a high level. </p><p>  The hotel has numerous sports facilities for playing volleyball, basketball, tennis, mini-golf, billiards, archery.  A very popular car rental is available. </p><p>  The hotel has a modern conference room.  Laundry service is available.  There is no regular mini-club, however, a games room, a playground, a children's pool and a cinema are perfectly equipped, and on certain days children's programs are conducted by the animators. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  400 meters from the nearest Palmanova beach is Hi Mimosa By Globales 3 * (Mallorca).  The reviews of its guests, however, testifies to their experience of relaxing in several sandy places for swimming and the Mediterranean lounge of Mallorca.  Many liked Es Trenc beach for its comfort with crystal clear turquoise water.  However, real aesthetes nevertheless gave the priority to completely white sand and the decayed crowns of the royal palms of Cala Mesquida beach.  They called its marine area more than transparent. </p>

    <p>  However, guests of Hi Mimosa By Globales 3 * mention a much larger number of attractive beaches.  And this is not surprising, because there are about 200 of them in Mallorca! </p><p>  Hunters for drive and foamy parties will like S'Arenal, staunch and loyal lovers of good German beer prefer Balnearos with its dozens of glass beers.  The beaches of Mondago, Es Trenc, Port de Sawyer, the harbors of Thuen, Figuere and Sa Capra are comfortable and attractive. </p><p>  And yet, most hotel guests still prefer to relax on the nearby and cozy beaches of Magaluf and Palmanova.  In addition to the traditional swimming and lounge by the sea, they have developed infrastructure for amateur water skiing, windsurfing (they also teach beginners here), diving (including scuba diving courses), catamarans, and surfing. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Dining at the Hi Mimosa By Globales 3 * hotel (Mallorca) is organized by the restaurant on the basis of a buffet and an all-inclusive system.  The menu is balanced.  Judging by the reviews, neither the meat-eater, the fish lover, nor the vegetarian will remain offended. </p><p>  Breakfast in the hotel restaurant is quite dense: several types of cheeses, sausages, scrambled eggs, scrambled eggs, cereal, yoghurts, croissants, pastries, lots of fruits and vegetables.  Guests here are also treated to an afternoon snack (hamburgers, hot dogs, sandwiches, tea, coffee, fruits). </p>

Lots of salads, fruits, soft drinks. </p><p>  As part of the all inclusive, tourists are treated portionwise with local wines and low alcohol drinks.  Judging by the reviews, sangria is especially good. </p><h2>  Excursions, outdoor activities </h2><p>  Guests of the Hi Mimosa By Globales 3 * hotel will enjoy a rich excursion program. </p><p>  Spain is a country of attractions.  Many Mallorca guests travel to the mainland to see the unique architecture of Barcelona, ‚Äã‚ÄãMadrid, and Granada. </p><p>  However, most of Mallorca's guests are limited to its wonderful facilities.  They willingly visit the boring water parks of the island.  The most popular among them is Hidropark Alcudia.  Favorite nightlife for young people in Mallorca is the Titos, Garito Club, Abraxas, Puro Beach. </p><p>  Creative people gather in Mallorca in communities on the Formentor Peninsula and in the harbor of San Vincennes. </p><p>  Lovers of architecture and spectacular photographs enjoy the aesthetic pleasure of contemplating the ruins of an ancient Roman city near Alcudia, the Cartesian monastery (where Chopin and <span>Georges Sand</span> used to live <span>), the</span> textured buildings of Palm New: the Baroque city hall, the Gothic cathedral, the picturesque <span>Belver castle</span> (later the Middle Ages) ), the palace of the rulers of the island of Almudain (now it houses the Museum of Local History of Mallorca). </p><p>  Tourists travel through the island's tunnels on the Palma Sawyer train in a spectacular and creative way.  Unusually spectacular scenery around the island town of Miromar, the recognition of experts, one of the most picturesque on Earth. In Mallorca, there are accessible karst caves Hams and Drach. </p><h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  The trip to the capital of the island is associated with the most effective shopping for guests of the Hi Mimosa By Globales 3 * hotel.  Reviews of tourists mention the main shopping streets of Palma de Mallorca, saturated with fashionable and souvenir boutiques: </p><ul><li>  Alexandre Rosselo. </li><li>  Passeig des Born. </li><li>  Avinguda Jaume III. </li></ul><p>  Judging by the reviews of tourists, lovers of the purchase of branded things have long chosen the shopping and entertainment center Porto Pi.  The guests of Spain are especially in demand for shoes produced here, and therefore sold at very attractive prices.  The brands Bestard, Barrats, Camper, Lotusse, Kollflex deserve attention. </p>

    <p>  Food and everyday items are best bought at El Corte Ingles Shopping Center or Festival Park Outlet.  What do tourists especially praise?  They like Spanish liquors: herbal Hierbas de Mallorca and fruit Palo. </p><p>  Some souvenirs are better to buy in local markets, working in the morning.  So you can buy intricate ceramic siurels figures, crafts made from blown glass or from olive wood. </p><p>  However, the most experienced shopping hunters associate shopping in Mallorca with shopping special, pleasant for ladies.
