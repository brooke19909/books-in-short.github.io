What to call a real estate agency</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Remember the dictum of the notorious Vrungel about a boat that will sail the way you call?  Agree that the choice of a catchy name that immediately strikes the memory is already half the success in the business of any business.  And the office for the provision of real estate services is no exception. </p><h2>  Choose the name of a real estate agency </h2><p>  So, you are a businessman, your area is transactions in the housing market.  But what is the name of a real estate agency if there is not too much creativity?  Or simply nothing comes to mind? </p><p>  In this case, there are simple algorithms for generating a suitable name.  Consider the main ones. </p><p>  <em>The magic of foreign pronunciation</em> </p><p>  Not everyone is fluent in a foreign language.  Having picked up a sonorous foreign language name, the owner of almost any business can add mystery and ambiguity to his own sign.  The phrase should be short, uncomplicated, consist of 1-3 words, more or less understandable to the average consumer, and be pleasant to hear. </p><p>  At the subconscious level, he should associatively induce a recognition motive among potential customers.  For the first time people going to an agency should feel that this place is already familiar to them. </p>

    <p>  It is important to ensure that the name of the real estate agency, even a foreign one, does not turn out to be a random, meaningless verbal set.  There will always be a meticulous client who is not too lazy to analyze the true meaning of a word or phrase.  And the case may end in serious failure. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <em>Direct associations</em> </p><p>  This is the easiest and most straightforward way.  Its essence is in the direct indication of the field of activity of your office.  Most of these signs.  These include the numerous ‚ÄúUrban Real Estate‚Äù, ‚ÄúSquare Meters‚Äù and ‚ÄúHousing Issues‚Äù.  The classics of the genre are "Home" or "Mortgage Agency". </p><p>  The plus of such a name is in the absence of a client‚Äôs doubt about where he got to.  Agree, opening the door under the sign "Your home", you hardly expect to go to a pharmacy or an antique shop.  The flip side is mediocrity.  With this name, you will not stand out from the many and sometimes very creative competitors.  And, as a result, advertising costs will increase. </p><h2>  We complicate the task </h2><p>  <em>Indirect associations</em> </p><p>  If you designate your activity by some beautiful and sonorous word like "Elite", nobody will sense its meaning without decoding.  For example, the name "Guarantor" alludes to commitment and quality, but does not say anything about the specific scope of the services offered. </p><p>  <em>Something personal</em> </p><p>  You can call the agency a beautiful female name or, for example, "Ignatiev and K" - by the name of the owner.  This option is not bad, but we should not forget that it is more suitable for a small town in which famous personalities are in vain.  In a metropolis, it is difficult for an ordinary client to keep such a name in their head, since no association with a specific person arises.  In this case, the struggle with competitors will have to be forced in other ways. </p>

    <h2>  What else can you come up with </h2><p>  You can sit down with your business colleagues and brainstorm.  And you can calculate the desired option by banal enumeration of more or less suitable words and their combinations.  You can order a beautiful name for a real estate agency in a specialized naming office - there are many of them now.  In a word, there are not one or two ways to come up with a sonorous and satisfying owner name for your business. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  What else should be taken care of in this difficult creative matter? </p><h2>  Feng Shui to help you </h2><p>  It's no secret that now it is very fashionable to conduct almost any business with an eye on the postulates of Feng Shui.  What does this mean for our case?  For the successful development of the business, you should know the element to which it can relate.  And it depends on the functions to be performed by your agency. </p><p>  These, by definition, include the preservation and protection of customer housing and caring for people.  In general, this moment can be attributed to the element of the Earth.  Beat its manifestation in both the name and the interior design. </p><p>  Among other things, you should use it when developing a website design, choosing advertising banners, etc. </p>

    <p>  Another element that may also come up is Fire.  His task is to support the Earth.  The colors of these two elements should choose yellow and brown (for the Earth).  By fire, all the shades of red available in nature are related to fire. </p><h2>  How it works </h2><p>  If you use these colors in the interiors of the agency‚Äôs premises, this will affect the subconscious of customers in the right direction.  Against the background of such an impact, a person entering the office can more easily relax and trust a professional realtor. </p><p>  If the elements of Feng Shui will be used in the design of the outdoor sign, it will attract more customers from the street.  The fact is that such advertising operates on an unconscious level and can lead you to visit even those who are not currently planning to buy or sell a home.  Perhaps a person suddenly wants to get acquainted with the full list of services provided.  Such people are your <span>potential customers.</span> </p><p>  If you use Feng Shui technology when choosing the name of a real estate agency, you should focus on words that evoke pleasant associations with comfort, security, reliability and a warm home.  In this case, it is especially not recommended to experiment with complex names - this does not contribute to customer confidence. </p>

    <h2>  Thoughts on a note </h2><p>  What other advice can be given to a newly-made businessman racking his brains over what to call a real estate agency? </p><p>  Here are some useful tricks.  Do not use words that are not specific to your niche in the name.  For example, if you focus on a more or less affluent audience, the slogan "affordable housing" only harm yourself. </p><p>  The opposite situation - ordinary buyers sign "Elite Real Estate" is likely to scare. </p><p>  Try to avoid abstract names that do not have a specific meaning.  Always keep in mind the image of your target audience.  Try to consider the maximum possible number of services that you are going to provide - rent, sale or all together. </p>
