Reviews of this premium device, its technical specifications, the relevance of the computer and the cost are discussed in detail in this material.  User reviews are also provided. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ipadwiki.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="reviews ipad 3 64gb" class="if uuid-2329322" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2329322.jpg"></div><h2>  The background of the appearance.  Equipment.  Specialization </h2><p>  In 2011, the advanced iPad2 tablet computer was introduced.  He became so successful that no analogue could compete with him.  In 2012, Apple was forced to upgrade an already successful computing solution.  At the same time, the key innovations were support for 4G networks, an updated Retina screen and an advanced processor.  That is exactly how the hero of this review appeared on the shelves of computer equipment stores. </p><p>  The configuration of the mobile computer in question includes the following: </p><ol><li>  The tablet. </li><li>  Charger. </li><li>  Communication interface cord for synchronizing with a PC and charging the battery. </li><li>  User's manual. </li><li>  A set of advertising booklets with a detailed description of the capabilities of this device. </li></ol><p>  The iPad 3 is most suitable for creating mobile entertainment computing systems. Reviews, specifications and a description indicate exactly such an application. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="itavisen.no" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ipad 3 64gb 4g reviews" class="if uuid-2329323" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2329323.jpg"></div><h2>  Design.  Its features </h2><p>  A key element of the front panel is the screen.  In this case, its diagonal is 9.7 ‚Äù.  A rather thick frame surrounds the screen around the perimeter, which increases the size of the device to 241 mm in length and 185 mm in width.  The thickness of the device is 9.4 mm and the weight is 662 grams.  Above the display, exactly in the middle of this frame, is the front camera.  At the bottom, a single control button is displayed.  The front panel of the gadget is fully protected by shockproof glass. </p><p>  The back cover of the tablet is made of sheet aluminum.  On the bottom edge is a wired connector.  Using it, the battery is charged or synchronized with a personal computer.  On the opposite side there is a regular audio port for connecting external speakers.  On the left edge of the device in question there is a slot for a SIM card.  But to install a memory card in this case is impossible for the reason that it does not have a tray.  Therefore, the most optimal internal storage capacity for the iPad 3 is 64Gb.  Reviews indicate that in this case there is enough memory space for everything.  A lock button is displayed on the opposite side of the case. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Directly on the back of the case you can find only the company logo and the peephole of the main camera. </p><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  The characteristics of the iPad 3 indicated the presence of the A5X semiconductor chip. Reviews highlighted a sufficient level of its performance.  This microprocessor included only two computing units.  The highest frequency value of the latter was 1 GHz.  Again, in the process, this parameter was dynamically changed depending on the complexity of the processed software and the degree of heating of the silicon base of the CPU. </p><p>  If for ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù such specifications were not enough, then for iOS it is quite enough.  This operating system has a high degree of optimization and therefore puts forward not so critical hardware requirements. </p><p>  The A5X semiconductor crystal was fabricated using 45 nm technology, which was considered advanced in 2012.  It should also be noted separately that the computing cores of this chip are based on the Cortex ‚Äì A9 architecture.  The latter indicates that this tablet can only work with 32-bit software.  At the moment, it is completely outdated, both in terms of productivity and energy efficiency. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.geek.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ipad 3 owner reviews" class="if uuid-2329324" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2329324.jpg"></div><h2>  Graphics Accelerator </h2><p>  Also, a discrete accelerator was part of the iPad 3. Reviews focus on the high level of its performance.  But in terms of energy efficiency, this adapter is quite acceptable.  The model of the video card is PowerVR SGX543MP4.  It includes four independent graphics processors and can easily cope with such a high resolution as 2048 √ó 1536. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Screen.  Its characteristics </h2><p>  The Apple iPad 3 is equipped with a very high-quality screen. Reviews focus on the complete absence of grain on it.  This is achieved by increasing the resolution of the touch screen to 2048 √ó 1536. Moreover, its diagonal, as already noted, is 9.7 ‚Äù.  The matrix of the screen is made using IPS technology.  This circumstance ensures high color rendering quality and the maximum viewing angles currently possible, which are almost equal to 180 ¬∞. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  As previously noted, two cameras are part of this tablet computer.  One of them is located on the front panel of the mobile device.  She has a 0.3 megapixel sensor, and the picture quality is just disgusting.  But there‚Äôs nothing more from VGA resolution.  Therefore, its only possible use is video calls, and then with a stretch of the imagination. </p><p>  But the main camera is based on a 5 megapixel sensor.  As a result, in this case, the photo quality improves by an order of magnitude, and the video can be recorded in 1080 p.  Its only minus is the lack of an LED, with which you can take pictures in the dark. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.slideshare.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ipad mini 3 reviews" class="if uuid-2329327" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2329327.jpg"></div><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  The memory subsystem in this mobile gadget has been substantially redesigned.  In previous models, RAM was part of the microprocessor.  Moreover, the RAM consisted of 2 segments of 256 MB, and this allowed to get 512 MB.  In this case, the developers of RAM took out separately.  Now the RAM consists of 2 separate 512 MB chips.  That is, this device has already installed 1 GB of RAM.  Again, such a layout of the RAM subsystem indicates the presence of a 2-channel controller and an increase in performance by 15 percent. </p><p>  Nominally, the main volume of the integrated drive for the iPad 3 is 64Gb.  Owner reviews indicate its adequacy.  That is, in this case, there will certainly not be problems with installing software or storing personal data.  But there is also a modification of this device with a reduced memory capacity of up to 16 GB.  In this case, problems with the availability of free space on the integrated drive are quite possible. </p><p>  Also, the disadvantages of this mobile computing system include the fact that there is no possibility of installing an external memory card.  But this is a typical device problem for the apple company. </p><h2>  Communications </h2><p>  The developers have equipped the Apple iPad 3 with a truly impeccable communication list. Reviews indicate a complete lack of flaws in the list of supported interfaces.  It includes the following: </p><ol><li>  An expanded set of modern cellular networks.  In addition to the usual GSM / 2G and HSUPA / 3G, LTE / 4G is also present in it.  In this case, the highest data transfer rate can reach 150 Mbps.  The presence of such a list of supported cellular networks allows this mobile computer to be used not only as a multimedia center, but also as a smartphone.  Only in the latter case it will not be so convenient to talk.  At least without headphones. </li><li>  Another very important way to get information in this case is Wi-Fi.  This transmitter is capable of transmitting information at a speed of 150 Mbps.  The list of supported 802.11 interfaces in this case includes its subversion a / b / g / n. </li><li>  The communication capabilities of this mobile solution are complemented by a Bluetooth 4.0 wireless transmitter.  It is used when connecting wireless speakers or sharing files with various similar devices. </li><li>  The navigation capabilities of the device are implemented using the A-GPS transmitter.  In this case, using the nearest cell towers, the location of the mobile gadget is determined quite accurately.  But there is no support for satellite navigation systems. </li><li>  The primary wired connection method is the Dock Connector port.  It is universal and allows not only charging the battery, but also synchronizing the device with a personal computer. </li><li>  Another important way to connect using wires is the audio port.  It allows you to output sound to various external speakers. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.wired.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet apple ipad 3 reviews" class="if uuid-2329330" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2329330.jpg"></div><h2>  Battery.  Degree of autonomy </h2><p>  Significantly increased battery capacity requires updated hardware iPad 3 64Gb 4G.  Reviews at the same time highlight the small thickness of this computing device, which, as noted earlier, is only 9.4 mm.  The declared capacity of the built-in battery is 42.5 Wh.  At the same time, the previous devices were equipped with a 25 Wh battery.  That is, such an increase in battery power should in theory increase autonomy by 1.7 times.  But the increased power consumption of the microprocessor and the memory subsystem leads to the fact that the battery life will be the same 17 hours with a 3G connection. </p><p>  A complete charger is capable of delivering 10 watts per hour.  That is, one battery charge will take more than 4 hours.  And somehow it is not possible to speed up this process. </p><h2>  Software Features </h2><p>  Initially, the iPad 3 was running the iOS 9.2.1 operating system. Reviews highlight its reliable and stable operation.  Subsequently, a number of updates to this software appeared.  Officially, the latest version of iOS that can be installed on this tablet is 9.3.5. </p><p>  Then Apple released a series of operating systems 10.X.X.  But it is impossible to install any of them on such hardware.  For example, it will not install on the iPad iOS 10.3.3.  Reviews of this feature of this device are classified as disadvantages.  But this is the standard procedure for this manufacturer, and obsolete devices at some point simply stop receiving updates.  And this approach is very easily explained: the new software requires a new ‚Äúhardware‚Äù.  It will simply not work with old equipment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="phonemobiles-review.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ipad 3 specifications reviews" class="if uuid-2329332" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2329332.jpg"></div><h2>  The cost of a mobile device.  Its relevance </h2><p>  In the new state, it is now impossible to purchase an iPad 3. Reviews at the same time indicate that used modifications of such a computer can be bought at a price of 2,000 to 5,000 rubles.  Moreover, the cost depends on the degree of wear of the mobile solution.  Also, battery capabilities greatly affect the price tag.  The longer the battery holds, the more expensive the tablet will cost. </p><p>  Again, the case of the device is non-separable, and it is very problematic to replace the battery on its own without third-party assistance.  Therefore, before purchasing a used tablet computer of this model, it is strongly recommended that you check the status of the battery.  The longer the battery ‚Äúholds‚Äù, the better the autonomy of the computing system. </p><h2>  Owner reviews.  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  Certain flaws were inherent in iPad 3. Owner reviews highlighted these of them: </p><ol><li>  Overheating of the central processor and periodic device shutdowns for this reason.  This problem was resolved by updating the system software. </li><li>  Long-term battery charging.  This disadvantage, alas, cannot be eliminated. </li><li>  The hero of this review is not able to work with all 4th generation cellular networks.  At least in the USA or Canada, no connection problems were found.  But in Australia, with LTE networks, this device did not always work correctly. </li><li>  Slightly increased dimensions of the device compared to its predecessor.  But this is a necessary measure, which is due to the increased capacity of the battery. </li><li>  High cost in new condition. </li><li>  Mediocre image quality from the front camera, which is due to the VGA resolution. </li></ol><p>  The advantages of the device in this case include: </p><ol><li>  Screen quality, which in this case is simply beyond competition.  Increased resolution eliminates the appearance of graininess.  But the IPS matrix provides a really excellent level of color reproduction in the picture. </li><li>  High autonomy combined with an excellent level of performance. </li><li>  Extended communication list. </li><li>  Excellent build quality. </li></ol><p>  It should also be noted that there is an iPad Mini 3 tablet computer in Apple's lineup. User reviews indicate that these are completely different tablet devices.  The latter was released much later and has improved hardware. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.speckproducts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="apple ipad 3 reviews" class="if uuid-2329333" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2329333.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Of course, certain innovations were implemented in the iPad 3. Owner reviews repeatedly highlight them.  They are also mainly attributed to the benefits of this tablet model. </p><p>  Now such a device is deprived of manufacturer support and is completely outdated.  Moreover, the price tag of 2000‚Äì5000 rubles makes its purchase affordable for many users.  But the question of the appropriateness of such a second-hand acquisition is still open.  For the same amount, you can find an analog of this Android-based mobile computer in a new state, and it is such a solution that is recommended to be purchased today.  At the same time, the version of system software will certainly be current. </p>
