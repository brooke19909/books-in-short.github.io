At the moment, it is customary to distinguish about 4 dozen types of such symbols, differing in the mutual arrangement of the crossbars, their proportions, as well as the presence of decorative elements.  Among them is the Teutonic Cross. </p><h2>  A few words about the order </h2><p>  The Teutonic Cross is the main symbol of the eponymous association of knights that arose in 1190 in Palestine during the Third Crusade.  Initially, a group of German pilgrims, led by chaplain Konrad and Canon Voorhard, established a hospital on the outskirts of the fortress of Acre, where they assisted wounded and sick knights from Germany.  Soon the spiritual church of St. John took over the spiritual patronage of the hospital.  Virgin, and a little later, Pope Clement the Third established the brotherhood of St. Mary of the Teutonic.  After the German knights distinguished themselves in the assault on Acre, the Duke Frederick of Swabian received permission to convert him into the eponymous spiritual-chivalric order, placing Conrad at the head of the chaplain.  The Teutons only obeyed the Holy Roman Emperor and the Pope.  Returning to Europe at the beginning of the 13th century, they settled in the town of Eshenbach. </p>

    <h2>  The meaning of symbolism in the life of the spiritual and chivalric orders </h2><p>  <span>The Middle Ages</span> were an era when special significance was attached to signs.  They carried various functions, from mystical to informative.  Symbols played a particularly important role in the life of military units, including <span>spiritual and chivalric orders.</span>  Not only the organizations themselves had their emblem and flag.  There was also a elaborate system of symbols used to designate posts and duties within the order itself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Teutonic Cross: Description </h2><p>  This symbol, which first appeared on the clothing, flags, and armor of the Order of the Knights in Palestine, underwent some changes over time.  Initially, it was a simple <span>black cross</span> on a white field.  Later, his improvements began to appear.  Today, the symbol of the organization that calls itself the Teutonic Order is the Latin <span>(Catholic)</span> black enamel <span>cross</span> with a white border that overlaps the helmet with black and white feathers. </p>

    <h2>  Crosslet </h2><p>  There is another symbol that is associated with German knights.  It's about crosslet.  Some also call it the Teutonic Cross.  It is an absolutely symmetrical symbol.  The cross is based on a Greek cross with small crossbars on its branches.  It is believed that he is endowed with a deep symbolic meaning.  In particular, in religious literature it is mentioned that small crosses at the ends of the crossbeams indicate the four Gospels of Christ.  At the same time, in paganism, the usual Teutonic cross means the unity of 4 elements. </p><h2>  Hierarchical signs </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the main cross of the Teutonic Order was far from its only symbol.  Different categories of members of the organization also had their own signs.  They wore them on clothes and armor, just as modern military men indicate their ranks in uniform, using stars or other uniforms. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Grand Master </h2><p>  The head of the order was the owner of his own coat of arms.  Its basis was the Teutonic Cross (you already know the meaning of the symbol) with a yellow border.  On top of it was another one superimposed.  It was distinguished by a smaller size and yellow color.  In addition, in the center of the second cross was a small shield with a black eagle.  The latter symbolized the German imperial house.  Thus, the Teutonic Cross of the Grand Master meant the recognition of its senior representative as the sovereign of the order. </p><h2>  Landmaster of the Order </h2><p>  This post had a territorial reference.  For example, the landmaster in Prussia was the plenipotentiary of the great master in the lands of this historical region.  In order for their own and alien knights, as well as ordinary people to know who they were dealing with, the bearers of this rank sewed on their robes a black Teutonic cross (see photo above), on top of which a second one of the same, but smaller and white color was applied. </p><h2>  Insignia of the Great Marshal of the Order </h2><p>  Depending on the historical period, the knights who wore this title used different types of hierarchical coat of arms.  Initially, it did not differ from the one worn by the Grand Master, but there was no yellow cross on it.  He later appeared, but the colored border reached only the middle of each of the crossbars. </p>

    <h2>  Symbols of the Great Komtur </h2><p>  In the modern sense, this position meant the Deputy Grand Master for minor assignments.  In addition, the Komtur led the administrative units of the state of the Teutonic Order of the lowest rank.  They did not have separate emblems, but they carried with them special rods with a cross, symbolizing their authority to administer the court. </p><h2>  Insignia of Full Knights </h2><p>  This group was the backbone of the Teutonic Order.  She was supposed to put on completely white clothes.  From above, they put on raincoats of the same fabric, on which - both on the back and on the chest - the Teutonic crosses were depicted. </p><h2>  Half brothers </h2><p>  Since they were not considered full-fledged knights, they were not allowed to put on a special uniform.  However, among this category of members of the Teutonic Order there was a certain hierarchy.  Top-level half-brothers were allowed to wear gray cloaks.  A black T-shaped cross was sewn on them in the shoulder area. </p>

    <h2>  Sergeants </h2><p>  Such a junior command staff was provided only for mercenary units.  They were ordered to wear white tunics with a narrow sleeve over which gray cloaks were thrown over with a sewn T-shaped cross. </p><h2>  Mercenaries or bollards </h2><p>  To distinguish such soldiers from enemy soldiers in battle, small white ‚Äúshields‚Äù were sewn onto their plain black clothes with T-shaped crosses applied to them.  Their location at different periods was different (on the chest, on the back, on the shoulder, etc.). </p><h2>  "Iron Cross" </h2><p>  An order with this name was established in March 1813.  His sketch was created by King <span>Frederick William the Third himself.</span>  He took the Teutonic cross as the basis for his creation.  The symbolism was extremely simple: the award was intended to encourage those Germans who fiercely fought for the liberation of their country from Napoleonic occupation, so Frederick sought to remind fellow citizens of the golden period of German chivalry. </p><p>  Later, the Iron Cross was revived by Adolf Hitler.  He ordered a swastika to be placed in its center, and the figure ‚Äú1939‚Äù was engraved below. </p><p>  In 1940, knightly varieties of this award were also established, thereby the Fuhrer further confirmed the continuity of traditions and the connection of his regime with the Teutonic Order.  Interestingly, the highest of these orders, which was decorated with golden <span>oak leaves,</span> diamonds and swords, was awarded only one person - Hans Ulrich Rudel - the legendary pilot of the German Luftwaffe.  He received it for the fact that for a long time disabled the Soviet battleship Marat and knocked out several hundred tanks of the Red Army. </p>
