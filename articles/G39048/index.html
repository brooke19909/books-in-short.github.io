    <p>  Soviet history says that this boy during the period of collectivization exposed his father in the kulaks.  He testified against his dad, who was sentenced to 10 years.  He also spoke about the hidden bread from a neighbor, about the theft of state grain, which his uncle committed.  Pavlik Morozov took an active part in the campaigns and, together with the chairman, sought out the hidden good of the villagers. </p><p>  In court, the boy did not speak out against his father and did not write denunciations against him.  The only thing he did was confirm the words of his mother, who put forward the main accusations.  Trofim Morozov, Pavlik‚Äôs father, beat his wife and often brought home things that he received for issuing false documents, he also kept a large amount of grain. </p>

    <p>  According to the official version, the grandfather and cousin uncle were killed in 1932 in the forest.  Mother at that time briefly left on business in the city.  The killers were sentenced to death, Pavlik‚Äôs father was also shot, although he was far away at that time.  His mother received an apartment in the Crimea as compensation for the death of her son.  Many collective farms, schools and pioneer squads received the name - "Pavlik Morozov". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The story of the life of this boy was known throughout the Union.  Songs and poems were composed about him, an opera of the same name was created, and Eisenstein even tried to make a film, but his idea could not come true.  Today various sources provide such varied information that the question arises of whether Pavlik Morozov even existed?  In half the cases, his feat was attributed to denunciations and he himself was called a traitor.  But we are all the same sure that it existed. </p><p>  At first, Pavlik Morozov, who planted his father, was considered a national hero.  ‚ÄúPioneer Truth‚Äù wrote about him: ‚ÄúPavlik does not spare anyone.  My father came across - he gave it to him, uncle, grandfather - he gave them out too, Shatrakov hid his weapons, Silin speculated on vodka - Pavlik exposed them all.  He was brought up in a <span>pioneer organization</span> and therefore grew up as a Bolshevik. ‚Äù </p><p>  The story of the murder of Pavlik Morozov was immediately picked up by Soviet propaganda.  He was represented by a bold peony </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pavlik Frost Story" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14614/162364.jpg" width="600"></div>  yerom, who conveyed to his father-fist.  His name was also recorded in the Book of Honor of the All-Union Pioneer Organization named after Lenin.  But after half a century, the image began to change, since this story was already unattractive.  With the <span>collapse of the USSR,</span> dissertations were written in which it was said that Pavlik was not a hero at all, but simply conveyed absolutely to everyone.

    <p>  For the fact that he passed his father, Stalin said about him: "Of course, the boy is a bastard, but the country needs heroes."  At that time, it was necessary to educate a generation of scammers and informers, and this boy became an example. </p><p>  Today Pavlik Morozov is not considered either a hero or a traitor.  He is simply a victim of a harsh and difficult time.  This boy died for telling the truth.  If you look at this story, you can understand that it is very distorted and changed for the convenience of the authorities of that time. </p>
