  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is nanotechnology, and how will they change our lives?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Nanotechnology will revolutionize the world in the same way that computers and cell phones did.  What is nanotechnology?  This is work with values ‚Äã‚Äãcomparable to the size of atoms (about a millionth of a millimeter).  They are developing in three directions: </p><ul><li>  creation of electronic circuits; </li><li>  machinery manufacturing; </li><li>  assembly of items. </li></ul><p>  Phrases that are completely familiar to the ear are surprising only in size.  An electronic circuit or mechanism the size of a molecule is amazing.  Someone may ask, why do we need this?  What does this give us?  Let's try to look into the future and see what nanotechnologies of the future are, or at least scientists are working on. </p><p>  <strong>The main problem of nanoindustry</strong> </p><p>  Almost all the laboratories in the world working in this field are mainly concerned with the creation of a nanomanipulator that could advance nanotechnology immediately 100 steps ahead.  What is a nanomanipulator?  This is a mechanism that can control individual atoms and molecules and provide mechanosynthesis.  Moreover, this manipulator will be controlled by a nanocomputer, which is built into the assembler (robot-assembler). <br>  As soon as such a nanomanipulator is created, the further development of nanotechnology will practically become a ‚Äúmatter of technology‚Äù or the cloning of any systems according to specified parameters.  That is, any factory, production, etc.  it will be possible to replace a nanoscale collector, who, according to a given program, will create any product - that‚Äôs what nanotechnology is. <br>  It is known, for example, that Xerox is working on the creation of duplicators of matter: one group of disassembler robots will be sorted into separate atoms by the original object, and the other group will create an exact copy of matter. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p><br>  <strong>Nanotechnology - what is it?</strong>  <strong>Reality or fiction?</strong> </p><p>  Until now, the development of other planets has remained a fantasy.  This means that nanotechnology is a pass into this fantastic world, because it will be possible without human participation to build entire colonies on other planets that will meet all the necessary requirements.  The appearance of a nanomanipulator is the ability to self-assemble any objects in the oceans and even in the air.  The ability to automatically create any kind of matter is a pass into a comfortable life, a solution to all the problems of mankind, it is food, housing and energy in almost unlimited quantities. <br>  Nanotechnology is a revolution in the energy system.  The efficiency of the nanoconverter of solar energy into electrical energy will be about 90%.  This is a new approach to waste management, which will make it possible to replenish raw materials reserves on the planet.  These are synchronously working nanorobots that globally carry out environmental and weather control around the world. </p><p><br>  <strong>What is <span>nanotechnology in medicine</span> and biology</strong> </p><p>  This is an extension of human life for an indefinite period, it is the possibility of restructuring the human body, providing it with energy regardless of food intake.  The ability to automatically reproduce any type of matter will allow you to create a qualitatively new implant that is fully compatible with the body of any person.  Sounds like a science fiction movie.  A person comes to the doctor, they give him, say, a tablet with nanoelements that disperse throughout the body and purposefully destroy sick and unnecessary cells (and no side effects).  Or they will replace all bad tissues and organs, and an updated healthy member of society will come out. <br>  Real virtual reality awaits us, because at the nanotechnology level, human interaction with computers through nerve receptors will improve.  And a person will become a terminal, giving access to the work of all the senses and even the brain. </p><p>  It is still hard to imagine all the possibilities of nanotechnology.  But a radical transformation of the whole society and the life of individuals is inevitable. </p>
