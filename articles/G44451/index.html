On the other hand, Montenegro (as this country is known all over the world) possesses such vast natural resources - a beautiful landscape, magnificent sea beaches, cozy bays, etc., that real connoisseurs of beauty seek here.  However, the country has long been under a socialist regime, so hotel infrastructure is not well developed here.  Although in recent years a lot of magnificent hotels have been built, less often 5 *, more often - 4 and 3-star hotels, for example, Obala Zelena 3 *.  Montenegro today is considered a popular holiday destination for Russian tourists.  This is due to affordable prices for accommodation, food and other services. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Obala Zelena 3" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/791072.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get to Montenegro </h2><p>  So, you have purchased a tour in Obala Zelena 3 *.  How can one get there?  Naturally, the most convenient option is air transport.  In Montenegro, there are as many as two international airports - in Podgorica and Tivat.  Flights from Russia to Montenegro and vice versa are carried out by two carriers - Transaero and Montenegro Airlines.  But if you use the services of other European carriers, then the prices will be much higher.  And you can first fly ‚ÄúAeroflot‚Äù to Belgrade, and then on domestic flights to get to the resorts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  The climate of Montenegro is just perfect for a <span>beach holiday.</span>  On the Adriatic coast, it is Mediterranean.

As in many European ‚Äútreshki‚Äù, a <span>continental breakfast</span> is a must for tourists here <span>.</span>  However, the hotel's restaurant always offers international and local cuisine. </p><h2>  Sea and beach </h2><p>  From the hotel to the beach about 300 meters.  Since it is public, the use of equipment - umbrellas, deck chairs, mattresses - is possible only for a fee.  The coast is quite clean, the beach is covered with small pebbles.  There are a large number of beach activities: catamarans, boats, bananas, scooters, etc. </p><h2>  Obala Zelena 3: tourists reviews and ratings </h2><p>  Tourists who left reviews about this hotel can be divided into two groups: some are satisfied with everything, while others are dissatisfied with the service.  Some complain that this hotel is far from the main building, where the restaurant and other administrative points are located.  This is not very convenient, especially if the weather is bad: people have to give up their dinner or breakfast.  In addition, the rooms do not have telephones, and in order to communicate with the hotel administration, you must go to the central building each time.  But the reviews are pretty good about the kitchen.  This means that the chefs work wonderfully and treat guests with delicious dishes of both local and international cuisine. </p>
