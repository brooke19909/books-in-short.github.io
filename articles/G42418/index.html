The entire list of layouts is usually divided into several types.  The most popular today are the following layouts: </p><p>  "Khrushchev" </p><p>  This type <noindex>  <span>floor plans</span> </noindex>  arose back in the 70s, in connection with which they gave it such a name.  Khrushchevka has a small kitchen, adjacent walk-through rooms and a combined bathroom.  The construction of such apartments was built of panels and almost all the walls in them bearing.  At the same time, it is these apartments that are most often subject to redevelopment.  Due to the considerable dimensions of one room, it will not be possible to equip a separate bedroom, so it will be multifunctional.  Also in this case, you will have to abandon the bedside tables.  The main room will serve as a nursery, and a living room, and an office. </p><p>  "Stalin" layout </p><p>  This type of housing construction appeared in the 30-60 years of the XX century.  It includes large multi-apartment, five-, three-story houses with fairly large communal apartments and high ceilings.  Long corridors, a single bathroom and one kitchen.  Along the corridor on one side are all the rooms. </p><p>  Unlike typical layout <noindex>  <span>KOPE</span> </noindex>  , where the external walls can be faced with facade tiles, ‚Äústalinka‚Äù are massive houses made of ceramic panels or bricks.  Granite slabs were often used as cladding.  Particularly significant buildings were decorated with pointed pedestals, similar to the Kremlin ones. </p><p>  Usually pre-war houses of this type are plastered and have apartments with a good area, with large bathrooms and reliable ceilings.  Post-war stalinkas are usually lined or decorated with bricks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img width="415" height="319" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12434/78542.jpg" class="if" alt="European-quality repair of a two-room apartment"></div>

    <p>  Improved layout </p><p>  Apartments included in the list of improved layout, regarding convenience and comfort, are slightly better than the "Khrushchev".  Brick walls have a thickness of 510 mm and can provide homeliness and comfort.  But the kitchens are still small up to 8 meters, and the rooms are still aisles.  Such apartments were built for families with a small number of people, and did not differ in large area, even when the apartment had enough rooms. </p><div class="photo iau"><img width="250" height="286" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12434/75966.jpg" class="il" alt="Layout of a two-room apartment"></div>

    <p>  "New" layout </p><p>  Over time, architects have studied all the shortcomings of projects of past years and tried to eliminate narrow long corridors.  Also replaced were built-in wardrobes, which during the Khrushchev era occupied a huge space of all angles.  When planning such apartments, a large area of ‚Äã‚Äãall rooms, a separate bathroom and a kitchen with a footage of at least 9 square meters are always implied.  m </p><p>  Free layout. </p><p>  Today, the so-called free layouts of apartments have become increasingly widespread.  Apartments in this series have no load-bearing partitions.  This, as a rule, has positive aspects, however, it can not do without drawbacks either.  Among them, high cost can be distinguished, since these apartments most often relate </p></div></article>
