    <p>  The information society that has formed at the moment has gone through several stages in its development.  The information revolution in this process does not take the last place, or rather, there were several of them.  They radically changed not only production, value system and lifestyle, but also the ways in which data was processed. </p><p>  The information revolution, which laid the foundation for the formation of a modern educated society, was associated with the advent of writing.  It was written language that made it possible to preserve information and knowledge with the help of signs for future generations.  But no less important in this process was the appearance of speech, which preceded writing, and which rightfully takes first place among information revolutions. </p><p>  The third information revolution was marked by the active development of typography.  The technologies for the production of printed products have been rapidly improving, and the apogee of the printing revolution is an active publication of magazines, newspapers, information directories and other products, which began to be distributed in large volumes. </p><p>  The end of the 19th century was marked by the beginning of the fourth information revolution, namely, the intensive development of communication tools, such as telegraph, telephone, radio and, of course, television.  It was thanks to their appearance that society began to actively not only accumulate, but also easily distribute large amounts of data to the vast expanses of the universe. </p><p>  The information revolution, which occupies the fifth position, is associated with the development and implementation of digital <span>computing, a</span> personal computer, and many other technical innovations of the 21st century. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The fifth contains the stages of development of information technology.  Firstly, the advent of <span>electronic computers,</span> but that was only the beginning.  In 1969, Intel created the first microprocessor, which marked the beginning of the development of computer technology.  Over the years, the microprocessor and software have improved, and now society cannot imagine its life without a computer. </p><p>  If initially the computer took up a lot of space, was quite difficult to use and could perform a limited number of tasks, then over time, the inventors solved this problem.  So, the world famous Microsoft company together with Intel developed the operating system and processor, which later became the standard, without which the computer market could not imagine its existence. </p><p>  Improving computer technology has not only reduced the size of the device, but also significantly increased its functionality.  Work with the device was becoming easier, and the user did not need additional instructions. </p><p>  An incredible breakthrough in the formation of the information society was marked by the advent of the Internet.  It is this global network that allows affecting all <span>areas of public life.</span> </p><p>  If we talk about the signs of the information society, we should highlight several of its features.  Firstly, this is the presence of a special information structure, consisting primarily of telecommunication networks.  Secondly, this is the massive use of computer technology.  Thirdly, this is the development of new technologies and the improvement of existing ones.  Fourth, this is the absence of borders between states when it comes to the use of <span>information law.</span> </p><p>  In conclusion, it is worth noting that although information cannot replace <span>material production,</span> but it positively affects its functionality.  It is the information component that plays a decisive role in the economy of any country.  Since this allows the use of resources not only functionally, but also rationally. </p>
