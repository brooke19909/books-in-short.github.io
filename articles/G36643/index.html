It is a device in which there are contacts and a control coil.  For the device to work, we need a voltage with which it will be affected.  It will cause the contacts to open or close while it is being fed to the coil.  A solid state relay works in a similar way.  Only instead of contacts, <span>semiconductor devices are used.</span>  The most common are triacs, thyristors (to switch <span>alternating current)</span> and transistors (for direct).  Solid state relays also use <span>galvanic isolation</span> between the voltages on the power contacts and the coil.  This is achieved due to the presence of an optocoupler at the input.  If the functional is implemented through thyristors and triacs, then they say that we have solid-state AC relays.

Let's recall how most motion or light sensors work.  After all, they are created according to the principle according to which a transistor supplies voltage to a conventional relay.  Coil and semiconductor element as contact.  As for the use of triacs and thyristors, they can pass current in both directions (which is not available to the transistor).  If we continue our comparison further, it is worth noting that solid-state relays are consumed and much less energy is lost during operation.  They also have small dimensions, high speed, long service life and absolute noiselessness.  But, despite all the advantages, it is impossible to say that we can refuse conventional relays in the near future.

There must be a control circuit that provides protection against false switching.  Reversing relays are characterized by three-phase operation and a long service life.

The company has a machine on which <span>solenoid valves are</span> installed <span>.</span>  Food on them - 24VDC 2A.  They are connected in parallel.  Turn off / on about once per second.  Power is supplied via a relay.  Even if it can withstand 10 amperes of inductive load, then it will be necessary to change it once a month or a second.  While a solid-state relay will forget about it for years.  Although the conduct of the planned technical inspection has not been canceled.  In this regard, it is advisable to focus on the recommendations received from the manufacturer in the accompanying documentation. </p><h2>  Indications for use </h2><p>  If ordinary contacts do not cope with their duties, burn like candles, then this is the best recommendation for use.  Solid state relays can provide reliable performance.  They can easily handle commutation of inductive loads.  Also, if you need to make sure that the contacts do not stick, or if there is a strict size limit, solid-state relays will come to your aid. </p><h2>  What types of solid state relays are there? </h2>

There is still the possibility of dividing by the presence or absence of a reverse. </li></ol><ul><li>  By design features (where installation is carried out): </li></ul><ol><li>  On the surface. </li><li>  On a DIN rail. </li></ol><h2>  Choosing a Solid State Relay </h2><p>  Some features should be noted.  So, conventional relays can withstand short-term overloads without any problems, the value of which will be 150% or even 200% of the nominal value.  If everything is done correctly, then cleaning contacts can be dispensed with in all cases.  With a solid state relay, this is not possible.  So, if you exceed the figure by 150%, you can safely discard the device.  Therefore, for an active load, a margin of 2-4 times should be provided for at rated current.  If a solid-state relay will be used to start induction motors, this figure will need to be increased by 6-10 times.  Such a reserve, although it makes us choose more expensive parts, at the same time allows us to guarantee a long service life of the device to which the device is connected. </p><h2>  Add-ins for correct operation </h2><p>  When interacting with inductive load, structures can function with certain problems.  Therefore, when working with transformers, electric bells, coils with magnetic circuits and similar devices, it is necessary to turn on the RC circuit in parallel to reduce the effect of counter-EMF.  It will also reduce the overall inductance of the load, and the solid state relay will be easier to operate. </p><h2>  Short circuit protection </h2>

Therefore, as an alternative, circuit breakers are used (class B). </p><h2>  Where can I get it? </h2><p>  You can buy AC solid state relays at your local electronics store.

They usually provide delivery to the recipient for a certain amount or free of charge. </p><p>  And what can we say directly about the cost that a solid-state relay has?
