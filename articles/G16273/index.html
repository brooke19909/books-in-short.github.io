But if earlier it was considered prestigious to visit Yalta, Sochi or, at worst, Odessa, now more and more exotic routes are being chosen.  Turkey in this regard has become as dear to us as Crimea. </p><h2>  We leave for Kemer </h2>

There are many amazing places on our planet, and Kemer can rightfully be attributed to them.  This is one of the areas of the famous province of Antalya, a Mediterranean resort town on the Turkish coast.  The local corner of the earth breathes antiquity; its history remembers Alexander the Great and <span>Mark Anthony.</span>  Near the resort are the ruins of ancient cities.  No wonder it was here that one of the largest tourist centers of Turkey is spread.  The only ‚Äúbut‚Äù - Kemer hotels with a sandy beach are quite rare, but more on that later.  In general, there are many different types of hotels here - luxury five-star, budget - 1-2 stars, family pensions ... The provincial resort area includes such areas as Kemer, Tekirova, Beldibi, Kirish, and others.

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kemer hotels with a sandy beach for families with children" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7454/468697.jpg" width="600"></div>  Now let's talk about Kemer hotels with a sandy beach.  We‚Äôll clarify right away: the soil here is rocky, the terrain is mountainous, and there is simply no sandy coast, familiar to us.  The natural approaches to the sea are only pebble.  Of course, the pebbles are turned by waves and do not bother too much when walking.  Especially if the technical staff of the hotels cleans the coastal area and removes large "naked".  And also sprinkles the surface with imported sand.  Which Kemer hotels with a sandy beach, more precisely, almost a sandy one, can we name?  These are Boran Mare, Amara Wing, Royal Palm, Amara Club Marine and others.  We repeat: basically the surface of the coastline is pebble here, but the pebbles are so sifted, shallow, that it seems as if you are walking along <span>coarse-grained sand.</span>  Well, a thin layer of it is also present.  In addition, there are upscale, five-star Kemer hotels with a sandy beach - also bulk but scattered in a thick layer, under which the rocky base is almost not felt.  At the water‚Äôs edge, naturally, further down, you‚Äôll have the same pebbles under your feet, but it‚Äôs almost impossible to hit it or cut yourself.  We mean the well-maintained beaches of the hotels Clicquia Palace 5, Amara Dolce Vita, Pressa Finica Resort 5, Marco Polo and others.

Which Kemer hotels with a sandy beach are suitable for you?  For families with children, choose first of all those in which, in addition to the common table, menus are also provided for the children.  In addition, it is important that your child has an interesting leisure time, so that he can have fun, play, without interfering with the rest of his parents.  Therefore, the hotel should have playgrounds, attractions, children's pools with various entertainments.  Further, for your convenience, it is desirable that the services provided by the hotel include a rental of prams and babysitters for very young children, as well as instructor-educators for children from 2 to 5-6 years old.  It is important that there are Russian-speaking employees among them.  Which hotels meet the above requirements?  The above-mentioned ‚ÄúAmara Dolce Vita 5‚Äù, ‚ÄúPR Club Kaplan 5‚Äù, ‚ÄúVog Avantazh‚Äù ‚ÄúCilicia Palazzo‚Äù and others.  Actually, the Kemerovo sandy-pebbled beach, shaded by orange trees, will give luxurious enjoyment of the sea and entertainment to both children and adults.
