It can be a miracle of nature or an impressive structure.  Our country also has many such unique places.  In 2007-2008, a competition entitled "7 Wonders of Russia" was held.  It was attended by 49 objects from different areas.  By voting for three stages, places were selected that today are rightfully awarded the title of one of the <span>seven wonders of Russia.</span>  What objects are included in this seven? </p><h2>  Lake Baikal (Buryatia) </h2>

The famous feature of this reservoir is its depth.  On the whole planet, it is the deepest.  It is located in eastern Siberia in the southern part and has a tectonic origin.  Also, this lake is 19% of the world reserve of fresh water.  <span>The nature of Baikal</span> and its deep expanses are distinguished by a variety of flora and fauna.  Many call this pond the sea.  According to the vote, Baikal took first place in the competition.  But besides the lake, there are other <span>natural</span> wonders <span>of Russia.</span>

    <h2>  Valley of Geysers in Kamchatka </h2><p>  The Valley of Geysers is considered the largest geyser field on the whole Earth, in Eurasia it is the only one.  It is not surprising that the wonders of Russia (a photo of the valley is shown below) include this geyser field in their list.  It is located in the biosphere reserve in Kamchatka.  You can see this place with your own eyes only if you fly by helicopter, because it is hiding in the Kronotsky gorge.  On the territory of 2 km <sup>2</sup> there are about 20 large geysers, and there are also many small sources that occasionally pour out practically boiling water or steam.  Here is the confluence of the two rivers Shumnaya and Geysernaya, under the waters of which there are also several sources. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="7 wonders of Russia" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1091085.jpg" width="600"></div>

This is a monumental ensemble of magnificent sizes.  The main monument is the Motherland Calls.  This huge sculpture of a woman who steps forward and calls for her own children is 52 meters high.  Mamaev Kurgan is considered a sacred place for Slavic people.  This sculptural composition reminds what courage the Russian people showed in defending their hometown.  These miracles of Russia are in Volgograd. </p><h2>  Peterhof </h2><p>  On the shores of the Gulf of Finland there is a palace and park ensemble called Peterhof.  It stands just 29 km from St. Petersburg in the city of Peterhof.  This miracle, like the previous one, united two components - the Grand Palace and the Palace and Park Ensemble.  These miracles of Russia are under the supervision of the Peterhof Museum-Reserve.  Impressive buildings were originally the residence of Peter I, and today they are a museum. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Wonders of Russia photo" class="if" height="428" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1091086.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Pokrovsky Cathedral in Moscow </h2><p>  The most famous attraction where many tourists go is Pokrovsky Cathedral, which has another name "St. Basil's Cathedral".  Interestingly, residents of other countries inextricably associate Moscow with this cathedral.  Therefore, he rightfully received a place among the seven miracles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Weathering pillars </h2><p>  Of course, the miracles of Russia cannot do without these remnants of unknown and mysterious origin.  They are located in the Urals on <span>the Man-Pupu-Ner plateau.</span>  About how and when these pillars appeared, the local settlement composed many stories and legends.  If you come closer to them, you can see their unusual shape and appearance. </p><p>  For example, one outlier, who remained a little away from the rest, has a height of 34 meters and looks like a large bottle standing upside down.  But each pillar has its own unusual shape.  It is not surprising that the people of Russia considered these remnants worthy to be included in the list of seven miracles. </p>

    <h2>  Mountain Elbrus </h2><p>  This mountain is located in the Caucasus, at one time it was an active volcano.  But Elbrus is not only on the list of wonders of Russia, but also among the largest extinct volcanoes on the planet.  Its height is 5642 m. For example, <span>the Kilimanjaro volcano</span> (253 higher) is almost the same as Elbrus.  But in Russia and among the Asian mountains, this giant under consideration is considered the highest peak.  Elbrus takes pride of place among the wonders of the country. </p><h2>  Other wonders of Russia </h2><p>  As already noted, several amazing places of our country took part in the competition.  Although everyone could not make it to the finalists, many of them are truly unique.  For example, this number includes many magnificent cathedrals and monasteries, museums and estates.  But the miracles of Russia that nature itself has created are still special.  So in the Perm region there is an ice cave, the length of it is the seventh in the world list. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian gardens miracle tomatoes" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1091100.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The Novosibirsk Zoo, which covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã63 hectares, is also impressive.  On its territory live 738 different species of animals, of which 350 are in the international Red Book. </p><p>  Others are enthusiastic about the salt lake Buskunchak, whose area is 115 km <sup>2</sup> .  There is also a majestic peak Dombay-Ulgen, always covered with snow, and itself is composed of granites, crystalline schists and gneisses. </p><p>  But for ordinary people, even their own achievements, for example, grown vegetables, planted flowers and so on, can become miracles.  For example, many admire the hybrids that are offered by the company "Gardens of Russia".  Miracle tomatoes can replace an entire plantation.  It is enough to plant several bushes, and you will get a rich harvest.  But about such miracles of Russia, you can make your own rating. </p>
