    <h2>  Reasons for the collapse </h2><p>  Until now, historians cannot agree on what specifically provoked this process, whether it was possible to prevent a critical situation and internal destruction of the country.  In the years of the USSR, the degradation of power structures was actively going on, and a sharp aging of members of the higher apparatus was noted.  It should be said that the average age of people in the Politburo was already 75 by the 80s.  At first this led to the "era of burial."  Then Gorbachev entered the higher apparatus.  Mikhail Sergeyevich began to quickly gain power and spread his influence in view of his relatively young age.  At the time of his election, the fifth Secretary General he was 54. During the years of the USSR, exceptional monocentrism of the adoption of any decisions was noted.  This right was possessed only by the "union center" - Moscow.  In most cases, this led to a loss of time and inefficient implementation of solutions on the ground.  Accordingly, this situation provoked sharp criticism in the regions.  A number of authors believe that the nationalist tendencies that have taken place in the country have become the driving force.  When the USSR collapsed, interethnic contradictions reached their peak.  Individual peoples categorically declared their intention to independently develop their own economy and culture.  Among the reasons for the collapse are called the incompetence of the leadership.  The leaders of the republics sought to get rid of the control coming from the central government and use the democratic reforms that Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev proposed.  With their help, it was supposed to destroy the unified system of statehood, decentralize society. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gorbachev Mikhail Sergeevich" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1052687.jpg" width="520"></div>

The consequence of this was: </p><ol><li>  The constant shortage of consumer goods. </li><li>  The growing technical gap in all areas of the manufacturing industry. </li></ol><p>  It was possible to compensate for the latter with exclusively high-cost mobilization mechanisms.  In 1987, a set of such measures was adopted.  It was called "Acceleration."  However, to put it into practice was no longer possible, due to the lack of economic opportunities. </p><h2>  Quantitative plan </h2><p>  When the USSR collapsed, confidence in the economic system was in critical condition.  In 1960-70.  the main method of combating the shortage of consumer goods in a planned economy was the bet on the mass, cheapness and simplicity of materials.  Most enterprises worked in three shifts.  They produced similar goods from raw materials of poor quality.  As the only way to evaluate the performance of enterprises was a quantitative plan.  As a result, the quality of products manufactured in the USSR sharply decreased. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gorbachev Secretary General of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union" class="if" height="272" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1052688.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Public discontent </h2><p>  It was caused by regular interruptions in food products.  The situation was especially acute during the <span>era of stagnation</span> and perestroika.  Deficit was observed in other essential goods and long-term use (toilet paper, refrigerators, etc.).  Restrictions and prohibitions were strictly enforced in the country, which also negatively affected the mood of the masses.  The standard of living of citizens constantly lagged behind the Western powers.  The administrative apparatus attempted to catch up with foreign countries, but in such economic conditions they were unsuccessful. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Artificial closure of the state </h2><p>  By the 80s  it has become clear to the entire population of the country.  The USSR introduced the procedure for compulsory issuance of visas for traveling abroad.  Documents were needed for trips to the states of the socialist camp.  The state was subjected to the most severe prohibitions on listening to the voices of enemies, many facts about internal political problems and a higher quality of life in other countries were hushed up.  There was censorship on television and in the press.  A number of objectionable works and unknown events of the country's history were published, the fact of the prohibition of publications was revealed.  As a result, mass repressions, the <span>Novocherkassk execution, the</span> Anti-Soviet rebellion in the city of Krasnodar followed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gkchp ussr" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1052689.jpg" width="589"></div>

    <h2>  The crisis </h2><p>  When the USSR collapsed, the chronic shortage of goods reached its maximum.  Since 1985, the administrative apparatus began restructuring.  As a result, the political activity of the population sharply increased.  Mass, nationalist and radical organizations, including movements and movements, began to take shape.  In 1898, it was officially announced that a crisis had occurred in the country.  By 1991, virtually all goods except bread had disappeared from free sale.  In almost all regions, standardized supply in the form of coupons was introduced.  In 1991, mortality exceeded the birth rate.  This was the first officially recorded demographic crisis. </p><h2>  Cold war </h2><p>  During the last <span>years of the existence of the USSR,</span> active destabilizing activities of Western countries <span>were</span> noted.  It was an integral part of the Cold War.  Subversive activity was accompanied by "undercover influence" within the country's leadership apparatus.  This opinion is expressed in some analyzes made, in particular, by a number of former KGB leaders and communist movements. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="USSR 1991" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1052690.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Boris Yeltsin </h2><p>  Gorbachev tried to save the USSR with all his might.  However, he was prevented from doing so by Yeltsin, who was elected May 29, 1990 to the post of Chairman of the Supreme Council of the Russian Federation.  Russia was part of the USSR as one of the republics.  She represented the majority of the population of the Union.  The central organs of the Russian Republic, as well as the all-union ones, were in Moscow.  But they were perceived as secondary.  After the election of Yeltsin, the RFSR began to focus on the proclamation of its sovereignty in the Union, as well as recognition of the independence of other Union and its autonomous republics.  As Chairman of the Armed Forces, he also achieved the establishment of the post of President of the Russian Federation.  June 12, 1991 he became the winner of the popular elections.  So he became the <span>first president of Russia.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="USSR under Gorbachev" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1052691.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  GKChP </h2><p>  The USSR has reached the deepest crisis in all spheres of life.  In order to preserve the Union and withdraw it from this situation, the State Committee on the state of emergency was formed.  This body lasted from August 18 to 21, 1991.  The State Emergency Committee included government officials and government officials who opposed the reforms of Perestroika by the current president of the Union.  Committee members opposed the country's transformation into a new confederation.  The forces, led by Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin, refused to submit to the formed body, calling their activity unconstitutional.  The task of the Emergency Committee was to remove Gorbachev from the presidency, preserve the integrity of the USSR, and prevent the sovereignty of the republics.  The events that took place these days are called the ‚ÄúAugust putsch‚Äù.  As a result, the activity of the State Emergency Committee was suppressed, and its members were arrested. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="years of the ussr" class="if" height="404" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1052692.jpg" width="492"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In the process of the collapse of the USSR, they were first denied, and then the problems of Soviet society were sharply recognized.  Alcoholism, drug addiction, prostitution have spread to a catastrophic scale.  Society has become sharply criminalized, the shadow economy has sharply increased.  This period was also marked by a number of technological disasters (Chernobyl accident, <span>gas explosions</span> and others).  There were also problems in the foreign policy arena.  Refusal to participate in the internal affairs of other states led to a massive collapse of pro-Soviet communist systems in Eastern Europe in 1989. Thus, in Poland, Lech Walesa (former head of the Solidarity trade union) takes power, and in Czechoslovakia - Vaclav Havel (former dissident) .  In Romania, the displacement of the Communists was using force.  By the verdict of the tribunal, President Ceausescu and his wife were shot.  As a result, the Soviet system collapsed after the Second World War. </p>
