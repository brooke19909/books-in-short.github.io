There are many of them in Gatchina, where the famous museum-reserve is located with numerous palaces and pavilions surrounded by a magnificent park.  However, few people know that in these places there are also many unique natural sites.  These include the Gatchina geysers.  There is no consensus on the origin of these fountains to this day, however, they deserve attention, especially since the surrounding forest is a great place for hiking. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gatchina Geysers" class="if" height="441" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1426292.jpg" width="583"></div></h2><h2>  Where do the geysers from around St. Petersburg come from? </h2><p>  Those who first hear the name Gatchina Geysers (see photo below) are amazed.  After all, everyone from the school bench knows that fountains of hot water falling from underground can occur only in areas of volcanic activity, and it cannot be observed in principle in the next millennia in the outskirts of St. Petersburg.  It turns out that skeptics are right, because in fact the Gatchina geysers are not real.  It would be more correct to call them natural fountains or ordinary springs.  However, local residents called them ‚Äúgeysers‚Äù two decades ago, and it stuck with them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Origin </h2><p>  How and as a result of which there were geysers in the Gatchina region, is still not reliably known.  There are 2 most plausible versions.  According to the first of them, in the 1980s, several wells were drilled in order to search for additional sources of water supply on the Izhora Plateau.  Later, the project was recognized as unpromising and closed.  As for the wells, they were hammered with plugs.  Apparently, this was done somehow, and some eventually turned into Gatchina geysers. </p><p>  According to another version, the unexpected appearance of fountains was the result of a Soviet project involving the creation of reserve gas storages using special technology in aquifers.  As a result, an increase in gas pressure in an underground water bubble forces these fountains to beat. </p>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  Gatchina geysers are six sources located near the village of Korpikovo.  Of them, columns of water with a height of 1 to 1.5 m are thrown under pressure. They are an amazing sight.  Geysers look especially beautiful in winter when splashes and streaks of water create sparkling large domes of ice. </p><p>  Local residents have long given popular names to each of the geysers.  In particular, source number one resembles a Water Column.  However, to fill the canister, there is no need to pump it.  Water from the geyser beats quite a powerful stream.  It is very cold and changes pressure during the day. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Source number 2 is known as the Geyser Fountain.  It hits directly from under the ground at different heights with very cold water. </p><p>  3 and 4 sources are also called "Water columns."  They are pipes protruding from the ground, which have side bends.  Of these, water beats with high pressure. </p><p>  5 geyser is called ‚ÄúBaby‚Äù.  It is a beautiful wide fountain resembling a waterfall. </p><p>  6 source, judging by the reviews, is the most beautiful of all.  The Geyser Stump is a piece of thick pipe with holes.  Of them, under fairly strong pressure, streams of water erupt in all directions.  The pipe itself is so overgrown with moss that it resembles a rather mossy stump. </p>

    <h2>  Gatchina geysers: how to get there by car? </h2><p>  You can get to this interesting attraction by your own vehicle if you are well versed in unfamiliar areas.  To do this, following through Gatchina, you need to go towards the village of Korpikovo.  Before the ‚Äúbridge‚Äù, which is an earthen embankment with a large-diameter pipe, it is necessary to turn left onto a dirt road.  On it you need to get to Gardening, and at the first big fork, make a right turn.  Then you need to get to the barrier, behind which there is a small parking lot.  Leaving your car on it, you will have to go in search of geysers on foot.  The reference point should be the lake, which is visible from the parking lot. </p>

    <h2>  Gatchina geysers: how to get to the "Fountain"? <strong></strong></h2><p>  To see this most beautiful "water miracle" of the Leningrad region, you need to delve into the forest. </p><p>  To do this, you must first drive along a <span>dirt road.</span>  Then pass a circular platform with a store and continue driving until the end of the gardening.  There at the intersection you will need to turn right and drive another 300 meters.  A few meters before the river, on the right side, you should not miss a small path that will lead to the "Fountain". </p><h2>  How to get to the stump geyser? </h2><p>  You can quickly find this man-made fountain by driving along the main gardening road to the clearing.  There you need to decide whether to leave the car in the parking lot or go on it further.  The fact is that the road that goes to the right is not of the best quality.  You need to go 2 km.  By high car you can reach almost the geyser.  To do this, before reaching the river where the fork is located, turn right.  There it will be difficult not to notice the Stump geyser. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Those who have already seen Gatchina geysers, as a rule, claim that they did not regret that they spent several hours to see these natural objects.  However, those who examined them repeatedly note that their condition worsens from year to year.  The reason is the behavior of vandals, who not only leave garbage right at the springs, but also try to plug them with stones and garbage. </p><p>  In addition, local residents claim that from year to year the pressure of their jets decreases.  So, perhaps, over time, water from the wells will stop beating and the Gatchina geysers will cease to act at all.  Thus, it is worthwhile, without delay, to take the chance to see the water columns before they have turned into ordinary springs. </p>

    <h2>  Walking route to the Gatchina Geysers </h2><p>  In good weather, their visit can be turned into something akin to a walk in the fresh air with elements of a quest.  To do this, walk from the Marienburg platform to the station square and then along Kuprina Street, which is perpendicular to the railway.  After 1.1 km there is a crossroads with the street of the 120th Gatchina Division.  Crossing the pedestrian crossing, turn right and walk another <span>150 m.</span> </p><p>  There begins an asphalt highway, which locals call the road to Electronstandart.  You should walk 900 m along it and turn right at the bus stop.  Next, you need to follow another 30 meters to the place where on the left side you can see a narrow path with a bed leading to the border of gardening.  From this place to the geysers, you must first go around the cottages and then, as described above, depending on which one you want to get to. </p><p>  Since it is difficult to get lost there, precise instructions are not required.  Surely, it will even be more interesting for you to organize a quest to find fountains. </p>

    <h2>  Bus route </h2><p>  Geysers can also be reached by public transport.  There is a 525 bus route <span>from Gatchina Warszawa Railway Station</span> . It passes by the Gatchina-Baltiyskaya station and past the Marienburg platform.  The final destination is the New Uchkhoz and along the way it passes through the village of Korpikovo, almost next to the first source. </p><p>  Now you know how to find Gatchina geysers.  Judging by the reviews of those who have already seen them, the best time to explore these natural sites is winter.  However, in the summer, especially on a hot day, their visit will please both adults and children. </p>
