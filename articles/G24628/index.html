    <p>  The principle of creating a flower is simple and straightforward.  Taking it as a basis, you can create a wide variety of compositions, changing the color, material, number of petals, etc. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How to make an autumn bouquet of sweets? </h2><p>  After you have mastered various types of creating individual colors, you can proceed to the implementation of the idea itself.  You need to come up with a design and find the remaining decor.  Autumn is generous not only for gifts, but also for holidays: September 1, Teacher‚Äôs Day, International Literacy Day, Peace Day, Seniors Day, Halloween, Harvest Festival, etc.  To make a gift look out of place, you need to match the day.  For example, a teacher can decorate a present with colored pencils or leaves from a notebook, but on Halloween beautiful flowers from sweets can be ‚Äúplanted‚Äù in a pumpkin.  The idea gives a lot of opportunities, the main thing is not to miss them.  The principle of creation is one, only the design of the bouquet differs.  The algorithm of actions is as follows: </p><ul><li>  preparation and collection of necessary materials; </li><li>  the creation of flowers and buds in which the sweetness itself is placed; </li><li>  gluing twigs and leaves; </li><li>  foundation creation; </li><li>  decorating the basics with flowers and other elements. </li></ul><p>  Optional decor (acorns, bright autumn leaves, branches, etc.) is added. </p><p>  The final touch may be the completion of the floral frame: bandaging the ribbon, adding ribbons, butterflies and other accessories.  The process is simple and quite interesting.  A bouquet of sweets ‚ÄúAutumn Waltz‚Äù will look beautiful, they have a suitable shape and a wrapper made of foil, which looks very impressive. </p><h2>  Teacher's Day </h2><p>  If you decide to conquer your child‚Äôs teacher, you can create a unique gift for the teacher together with the child.  Its creation is worth the effort, but it is worth it.  How to create an autumn bouquet of sweets for a teacher? </p><p>  Necessary materials: </p><ul><li>  sweets; </li><li>  autumn leaves; </li><li>  double-sided and decorative tape; </li><li>  ribbons, decorative threads, lace (which is at hand); </li><li>  corrugated multi-colored paper; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  colored foil; </li><li>  glue; </li><li>  base materials; </li><li>  wire; </li><li>  colour pencils. </li></ul><p>  We begin our work.  The process does not take much time, but requires special care and attention. </p><ol><li>  Choose a paper color.  Cut it into strips (width and height depend on the size of the flower).  Then cut one side of the fence. </li><li>  We wrap the candy in the resulting part and fix it on the end with an elastic band.  The protruding cola is slightly rounded to give a resemblance to real flowers. </li><li>  We make as many flowers as you need for a bouquet. </li><li>  We take paper of any other shade.  We make five hearts, and cut off their pointed tips.  Stretch the middle.  With the help of knitting needles we wrap beautifully the edges.  We pack the candy in the resulting petals.  We lay one on top of another to make a rose. </li><li>  We cut one long and several short pieces of wire.  We fix on the end of each sweets.  We wrap our future ‚Äúberry‚Äù with red foil, and below we fix and decorate the whole branch with green tape.  We connect all the components. </li><li>  We make a cone-shaped frame from wire or take it ready-made. </li><li>  From the middle to the edges on the inside, we lay live leaves and fix them. </li><li>  Add the stem to our buds, using wire and decorative tape. </li><li>  We collect the bouquet on the frame.  Add decorations. </li><li>  We attach colored pencils to the wire and insert them into the composition, among the flowers. </li><li>  We frame the frame with a shade of corrugated paper, similar to that which decorates living plants. </li><li>  Around the wrapper where the stems are located, glue the pencils on the double-sided tape. </li><li>  We beautifully bind the composition with a ribbon and the autumn bouquet of sweets is ready! </li></ol><p>  You can add whatever you want there.  Just stick to your chosen style and remember who this souvenir is for.  The advantages of such creativity is that you can cook it in advance for the holiday.  After all, a paper gift will not be able to deteriorate, even in the absence of water. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bouquet of sweets autumn waltz" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63487/2058880.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  For children </h2><p>  It is important to consider what sweets the child likes.  Naturally, it is better not to use treats with the addition of liquor or cognac.  All children love sweets, which means you need to put more sweets, chocolates and lollipops, but less paper and various fillers. </p><h2>  For men </h2><p>  Completely the opposite situation.  In the composition, which is intended for a man, it is worth using candies and dark chocolate, with cognac or liquor.  You can also decorate the bouquet with a miniature bottle of Jack Daniels.  If desired, you can make a combined bouquet, diluting sweets with banknotes. </p><h2>  Small bouquets </h2><p>  Small bouquets of sweets and other sweets will be appropriate for large-scale events in which many people participate: weddings, anniversaries, corporate parties, festivals, matinees at school and kindergarten, etc. Guests will certainly be pleased with such miniature compliments.  A universal option for congratulations with a small amount of cost. </p><h2>  Wedding </h2><p>  What could be more beautiful than an autumn wedding ?!  In order to organize a themed gala evening, you need to carefully consider the decor of the hall.  Naturally, preference should be given to shades of yellow, orange and brown.  Just do not forget that white should also be present.  ‚ÄúSweet‚Äù bouquets, the design of which should correspond to the general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe holiday, will be appropriate as a presentation or table decoration. </p><p>  These were the basics.  We hope that this information was useful to you, and you will definitely try to translate your ideas into reality.  Autumn bouquets of sweets are only the beginning on the path to creative success, but the start is the most important thing.  Try, fantasize and never give up, you will surely succeed. </p>
