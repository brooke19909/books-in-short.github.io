    <h2>  Description of the complex </h2><p>  What will be the LCD "Smorodina" (Yekaterinburg), whose address is the Shirokaya Rechka microdistrict?  This is one residential building, consisting of three sections, built on a monolithic-frame technology.  Storeys - 16-19 floors. </p><p>  The complex is being built under the People‚Äôs Meter program, under which part of the cost of residential real estate is subsidized by a specially formed fund.  This makes it possible to significantly reduce the cost of one square meter of living space and provide economy-class housing.  In addition, the apartments are rented out by the developer in fine finish, which significantly reduces the time for future owners to repair and relocate. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Apartments in the residential complex "Smorodina" (Yekaterinburg) will be presented in all its diversity: from one-room to four-room.  The smallest in area will be 33 square meters, the largest - more than 90 square meters.  Thus, everyone can find housing in the complex that fully meets his taste and budget. </p><h2>  Complex infrastructure: internal and external </h2><p>  A big plus, which may persuade those who are still deciding to purchase an apartment in this complex under construction, is the installation of an additional water treatment system.  The remaining new buildings not only in Yekaterinburg, but even other cities cannot boast of such a feature.  In addition, the developer will ennoble the courtyard, establish a playground and a playground.  Car owners will be pleased with ground and underground parking. </p><p>  LCD "Smorodina" (Yekaterinburg) is being built in the most promising area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city - the Broad River microdistrict.  Increasingly, developers are choosing this particular area for the location of their projects.  Near the complex, as already mentioned, is the Akademichesky microdistrict, which in the near future will be connected to the city by permanent transport links. </p><p>  Near the complex, within walking distance there is a kindergarten, a school, many shops and supermarkets.  The Lenta hypermarket is functioning.  There is also a children's clinic in the indicated microdistrict. </p><h2>  Ecological situation </h2><p>  For a reason, the developer for the construction of LCD "Smorodina" (Yekaterinburg) chose the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Broad River.  It is here, at a certain distance from the big city, surrounded by forests, lakes and rivers, you can feel yourself in the fresh air and enjoy it, breathing deeply.  There are no industrial enterprises in this area, which means that nothing violates the harmony of nature, which is created without human participation. </p><h2>  Apartments in the complex </h2><p>  As mentioned above, the developer designed all types of apartments in the complex.  To date, in the residential complex "Smorodina" (Yekaterinburg), ready-made 2 rooms.  the apartments are already all sold.  Only a few three-room options remained unsold.  The smallest studio apartment in the complex does not exceed 30 square meters.  And the largest is 90 m <sup>2</sup> . </p><p>  All apartments have double-glazed windows, entrance metal <span>safe-doors, interior doors.</span>  The developer finishes, which includes gluing wallpaper for painting, laying the laminate.  The project provides for two bathrooms in apartments (except for one-room) - main and guest.  Two-tariff electricity meters, water and heat meters are installed in apartments, heating pipes are routed and inputs for the Internet, telephone, and digital television are equipped. </p><p>  The cost of one square meter of housing in this residential complex starts from 41 thousand rubles.  The most expensive are traditionally one-room apartments. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  LCD "Smorodina" (Yekaterinburg) reviews of customers and those who are already lucky enough to move into finished apartments, has mostly only positive.  This is because the developer has correctly selected a promising developing area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city for the location of the complex.  There are already many objects of social infrastructure and they continue to be built, which is very pleasing to future residents.  In addition, many are attracted by the very affordable cost of housing, since it is being built in accordance with the People's Meter program. </p>

    <p>  Finishing houses with apartments in fine finish only adds positive reviews.  So, many buyers, having invested almost all of their money in the acquisition of real estate, do not leave anything for the repair.  And the developer provides the opportunity to enter immediately after the delivery of the keys to the apartments to the customers. </p><p>  Very satisfied with the buyers and transport accessibility of the complex.  In the future, when they connect the Akademichesky microdistrict with the Broad River, it will be even easier to get.  But even now, even for those who do not have their own car, this does not present a problem, since there is a public transport stop under the windows of the complex. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Of the minuses, it is worth noting that at such an active pace of development of the microdistrict, the fear of residents is caused by the presence of only one school, which today accepts small residents of all the nearest new buildings.  When constructing at least one more residential complex, places in the specified school may simply not be enough for everyone. </p>

    <p>  Some residents and buyers do not like the layout of apartments.  Yes, the developer designed some of them very unsuccessfully.  But there are few such plans, and they are cheaper.  This happened due to the design of the overall appearance of the complex.  It is built according to the angular type, so some angles in the apartments are oblique.  Balconies also cause dissatisfaction - they are sometimes very small.  But there are not too many such plans. </p>
