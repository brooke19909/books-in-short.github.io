    <p>  So, about 5 thousand years ago, people began to highlight the brightest night luminaries in the night sky and combine them into groups.  Now mankind uses modern technologies to study, which did not exist before.  Constellations called configurations that were formed from bright stars.  They served primarily for navigation, as well as for determining the <span>seasons, time of</span> day, for predictions and for astrological purposes. </p><h2>  What is a constellation? </h2>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the sense that is accepted now, this concept was formed in Ancient Greece a couple of centuries ago.  Then the visible sky was mentally divided into parts by groups of stars.  In order to make it easier to navigate in space, each site was given a name based on what a particular figure looked like.  Between the constellations are areas that the Greeks called "empty places."  However, there are also stars there, only they were not assigned to any group.  About them, for example, they said: "the area between the Swan and Lyra." </p><h2>  Modern concept </h2><p>  And if earlier any constellation of stars was called constellations, then in the modern world this designation is a little concretized.  Now this concept is defined as large sections of the celestial sphere, in each of which there are several bright luminaries visible to the naked eye.  These areas most often add up to a specific pattern that is easy to remember. </p><p>  It is also important to know what territories are called constellations into which the whole sky is divided without intersections and empty spaces.  Moreover, areas have certain boundaries.  Therefore, one should not confuse a simple <span>cluster of stars</span> with constellations. </p><p>  Currently, the celestial sphere is divided into 88 constellations, the names and boundaries of which were approved at the first congress of the International Astronomical Union in 1922. </p><h2>  Where do the names come from </h2>

    <p>  Since childhood, each of us has been interested in everything related to <span>celestial bodies.</span>  Why does this or that star bear such a name?  Why was the Big Dipper named a bucket figure?  How and who gives the name to the constellations? </p><p>  Seven bright stars, which are clearly visible to the naked eye in the night sky, are completely different from the shape of a bear.  Why is <span>this constellation</span> so called <span>?</span>  Maybe someone had an imagination, and the meaning of this is understandable and accessible only to people with good imagination? </p><p>  Let's try to figure this out. </p><p>  As we already know, clusters of stars were called constellations before.  They were called, guided by the shape of an educated figure.  Designers who created ancient atlases of stars tried to fit the contour of the animal to the shape of a figure in the sky and often depicted a bear with a long tail.  They had to do this so that people with less imagination could ‚Äúsee‚Äù this particular beast in the sky, and not another. </p><p>  The name "Ursa Major" constellation received from the <span>ancient Greeks.</span>  In ancient Greek, it sounded like "arctos megale."  From here came the name Arctic. </p><p>  According to one legend, Zeus was captured by the daughter of King Lacion, who accompanied the goddess Artemis on a hunt, and seduced the girl.  She became pregnant, and the goddess saw her while swimming and turned her into a bear.  The girl in the guise of an animal gave birth to a son, Arcade, who settled among people.  But once the hunters, led by Arkad, attacked the bear and wanted to kill her.  Then Zeus, remembering his connection with the daughter of Lacion, saved her by placing him in the sky among the constellations.  When in a hurry, he lifted the bear into the sky by the tail, he stretched out and became long. </p>
