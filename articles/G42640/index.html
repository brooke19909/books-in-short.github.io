Each of the princes considered it his duty to do something for Russia.  For example, in the nineteenth century the theological works of A.P. Lopukhin were widely known.  The Explanatory Bible, which includes explanations for the Old and New Testaments, has become one of Professor Lopukhin's most famous books.  But not only statesmen and brave warriors remembered ancient princely names in history.  Women of a noble family often became the favorites of Russian tsars and emperors, using their influence to solve various political issues.  A special place in this series of ambitious beauties is occupied by Anna Lopukhina, a favorite of Emperor Paul I, striving for quiet family happiness, but by the will of fate got into a real whirlpool of court passions and intrigues. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Anna Petrovna Lopukhina" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1729333.jpg" width="394"></div></h2><h2>  Childhood favorite of Paul I: family and features of education </h2><p>  On September 8, 1777, Anna Petrovna Lopukhina was born into the family of a senator.  The biography of this woman was not filled with a series of incredible events, but fate faithfully led her along her path, not allowing him to deviate from him even a centimeter. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The girl‚Äôs mother, Praskovya Levshina, loved her daughter very much and spoiled her in every way.  But when Anna was eight years old, her mother suddenly fell ill and died quickly.  Pyotr Lopukhin did not remain a widower for long, the stately and handsome man always received the attention of women, so soon after the death of his wife, he remarried.  His choice fell on Ekaterina Shetneva, who was supposed to replace the girl's mother.  But the character of the new wife was in no way suitable for raising a young person.  Shetneva preferred to lead a wild life, in society there were just legends about the princess‚Äôs numerous novels.  Even contemporaries did not speak highly of her moral qualities; according to rumors, the young woman had at least five lovers at the same time, some of whom she even actively supplied with money. </p><p>  In fairness, it‚Äôs worth saying that Pyotr Vasilievich didn‚Äôt disdain connections on the side.  Contemporaries wrote of him as a selfish, stingy, false and vindictive man.  But women with great pleasure made romance with him and forgave numerous betrayals. </p><p>  In this difficult situation for the child, Anna Petrovna Lopukhina grew up.  The father transferred the care of the daughter to his second wife, and she, in turn, did not find time for her upbringing.  The girl received a very mediocre education, and gaps in etiquette interfered with her subsequent life at court.  Many ladies noticed that the favorite of the emperor is often embarrassed and does not know how to behave properly in society.  At many official events, she made offensive mistakes, which caused a lot of ridicule from the court. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Until the age of twenty, Anna Petrovna Lopukhina practically did not go out and led a quiet life in the estate of her father, surrounded by servants.  But in 1798 her life suddenly changed. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lopukhina Anna Petrovna favorite" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1729335.jpg" width="301"></div></h2><h2>  Prerequisites for meeting the emperor </h2><p>  At the Russian court, it was quite customary to use the influence of the favorites to solve important state issues, to issue land and ranks, as well as various awards.  With the help of women close to the emperor, some princely groups could influence the country's domestic and foreign policy.  Therefore, the courtyard was in constant search of young beauties with whom it would be possible to replace already recognized favorites. </p><p>  By the time he met the young Anna, Paul I was already forty-four years old.  He was married for a long time to Maria Fedorovna, to whom he had tender feelings and had ten joint children.  The emperor himself considered his marriage extremely happy, but nevertheless, his former favorite, Ekaterina Nelidova, was at court.  Both women got along well and could even, by joint efforts, persuade the emperor to make a decision.  Prince Kutaisov did his best to quarrel Paul I and Nelidov, and then expel her from Petersburg.  But numerous attempts to remove the favorite did not bring results, it was at this time that the gaze of Prince Kutaisov suddenly fell on the young daughter of the Moscow senator. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Anna Petrovna Lopukhina portrait" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1729337.jpg" width="407"></div></h2><h2>  Appearance A.P. Lopukhina </h2><p>  Anna Petrovna Lopukhina, according to contemporaries, was not beautiful, but possessed incredible charm.  The girl was not tall, did not differ in grace and grace in order to be recognized as a recognized beauty.  But along with this, the princess had big dark eyes, pleasant features of her face, framed by thick curls, which she often wore loose, and meek character. </p><h2>  Acquaintance of Paul I with Anna Lopukhina </h2><p>  Arriving in Moscow, Paul I held a magnificent ball, at which he was introduced to young Lopukhina.  Surprisingly, the gentle girl made a very strong impression on the emperor.  In addition, the cunning Kutaisov, introducing the girl, clarified that she was madly in love with the emperor, which further disposed Paul I to a young creature. </p><p>  Just a month later, from an allegedly random acquaintance, the Lopukhins received an offer to come to St. Petersburg as a family.  This trip turned out to be very profitable for Pyotr Vasilyevich - he was immediately pleased by the post of prosecutor general and the title of prince.  His loving wife began to be called a state lady, and Anna Petrovna Lopukhina herself approached Maria Fedorovna, becoming her chamber-maid of honor.  This position allowed the emperor to constantly see his favorite in the palace and at all social events. </p><p>  In order for the Lopukhins to have their own dwelling in the capital, the monarch gave the family a large palace on Palace Embankment and showered them with expensive gifts in every possible way. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="A.P. Lopukhina" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1729334.jpg" width="334"></div></h2><h2>  The development of relations between the emperor and A.P. Lopukhina </h2><p>  Many contemporaries noted that Anna Petrovna Lopukhina did not have tender feelings for Paul I.  Undoubtedly, she was flattered by the attention of the monarch, which was all the more so beneficial for her family.  But the girl strove to keep the emperor at some distance, constantly being naughty and resentful. </p><p>  Every day Paul was more and more fascinated by the girl.  He was ready to fulfill any of her whims, if only she would smile and look favorably at him.  It is believed that in a given period of time, relations between the monarch and Lopukhina were platonic.  The emperor was afraid to compromise the girl and spoiled her in every possible way. </p><p>  For the sake of his new favorite, Paul I introduced the waltz dance, which was banned for quite some time.  Even court suits could be changed if Anna Petrovna requested it for the sake of convenience.  It is known that Mikhailovsky Castle acquired its color due to the fact that the burgundy color was Lopukhina's favorite shade.  The Emperor did his best to please the spoiled person, but often received in response a new portion of moods. </p>

    <p>  It is worth noting that the Kutaisov plan was a success.  Ekaterina Nelidova completely disappeared from the heart of Paul I, and after a while she left Petersburg after her beloved friend.  Maria Fedorovna lost a reliable ally, and her influence on her husband was very weak.  But the court did not receive any other opportunity to influence the emperor - Anna Petrovna did not experience a passion for power and intrigue.  She did not accept petitioners and did not even try to get something from the monarch to strengthen her position at court.  The girl whimsically sought appointments and money for her relatives, the other aspects of the palace life did not interest her at all. </p><p>  Contemporaries Lopukhina wrote that the girl was quite smart, but in communicating with the emperor used completely childish methods.  She could not speak with Paul I for several days if she received a refusal of his next request.  The courtiers were surprised by the fact that Anna Petrovna did not use female charms and did not use her flexible mind to get what she wanted.  Many believed that the girl, deprived in her childhood of love and attention, did her best to take them from the emperor. </p><h2>  Anna Petrovna Lopukhina: marriage </h2><p>  The tender feelings of Paul I to his wife‚Äôs chamber-maid of honor were visible to absolutely everyone.  In honor of his chosen one, he even called the ships and knocked out her name on the standard.  It seemed that the emperor completely lost his head, but once in a private conversation, the girl admitted to the monarch that she had a lover, to whom she had long had tender feelings.  Prince Pavel Gavrilovich Gagarin chose a military career for himself and during this period of time was on Italian soil. </p><p>  Surprisingly, the emperor was so in love with his favorite that he decided to arrange her marriage with a man coveted by her heart.  The prince was immediately summoned to the capital and treated kindly by the sovereign.  He received a promotion, awards and a good monetary reward for his service.  Naturally, Gagarin understood the need to marry a favorite of the emperor.  Maria Fedorovna gave permission for the marriage of her maids of honor on January 11, one thousand eight hundred, and on February 8, a wedding ceremony took place. </p><p>  Anna Petrovna Lopukhina-Gagarina acquired the position of State Lady after marriage and thereby strengthened her position at court.  Sadly, her relationship with her young husband did not work out.  Many spoke of the fact that Gagarin did not feel any feelings for his wife and married only by submitting to the will of the emperor.  The girl tried in every possible way to get her husband's favor, but he remained cold to her and spent very little time alone with his wife.  The courtiers were whispering about how much Anna Petrovna Lopukhina had changed after marriage.  The portrait of the princess by Jean Louis Voil√† refers specifically to this period of the life of a young woman.  She is depicted in an Amazon with a high headgear.  The talented artist managed to convey the flowing sadness from the girl‚Äôs big dark eyes and some timidity that shone through her appearance, despite the incredible femininity and charm.  Now this portrait is kept in the Hermitage and is part of its treasury. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Anna Petrovna Lopukhina Gagarina" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1729338.jpg" width="517"></div></h2><h2>  Continued Relations with the Emperor </h2><p>  The coldness of her husband pushed Lopukhin into the arms of Paul I. He was extremely pleased by the situation and loved the girl until his death.  Already being married, she received the order of St. <span>Catherine and</span> St. John of Jerusalem.  Prior to her, only one lady was awarded such an honor.  The Order of Catherine looked like a small bow with a medallion depicting Catherine.  He was worn on a corset, and it is known that A.P. Lopukhina greatly valued this award. </p><p>  In the Mikhailovsky Palace, the emperor‚Äôs chambers were connected with the rooms of Princess Lopukhina by a special hidden staircase, which once again confirms the fact of a love affair between Paul I and Anna Petrovna.  Contemporaries claimed that the monarch often spoke of Lopukhina as a quiet haven where you can relax after state labors.  The princess never learned to weave intrigues, staying away from any gossip.  She tried to create her own world with Paul I, reminiscent of a family, because it was Anna Petrovna who placed family values ‚Äã‚Äãabove all else. </p><h2>  The death of Paul I and the subsequent fate of Princess Lopukhina </h2><p>  The death of the emperor in his palace on the night of the twelfth of March 1801 put an end to a touching love story.  Lopukhina was very sad about the death of her high patron and remained with the widow of Maria Fedorovny.  She supported the woman in every possible way, but Alexander I appointed Prince Gagarin as ambassador to Sardinia, and Anna Petrovna was forced to follow her husband to Italy. </p><p>  Her family life never became happy.  The husband still did not pay attention to her, not particularly embarrassed, started novels on the side.  Exhausted by jealousy and resentment, the princess also plunged into a romantic relationship with Prince Chetvertinsky. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Anna Petrovna Lopukhina biography" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1729336.jpg" width="407"></div></h2><h2>  The death of A.P. Lopukhina </h2><p>  The life of the princess ended very early.  She died in a foreign land at the age of twenty-seven.  In 1805, Anna Petrovna gave birth to a son, whose father was considered her lover Chetvertinsky.  Soon the girl contracted consumption and burned down in just a few months.  On April 25 of that year, Princess Lopukhina died without regaining consciousness.  Her newborn baby survived the mother for only a few months. </p><p>  Surprisingly, the rival of Anna Petrovna Ekaterina Nelidova outlived her for thirty-five years and died already a rather elderly lady. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  No one knows how the fate of Anna Lopukhina would have happened if Paul I had survived.  Perhaps their love would go on for many more years, illuminating the life of the monarch with light.  But it is likely, as historians say, that the emperor would be carried away by a new favorite.  Who knows? </p>
