  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to save money on nutrition</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Not every person knows how to be frugal and spend money rationally.  The problem of lack of money is familiar to almost everyone, and the question of how to save money arises in many families, regardless of what the family income is.  How familiar this is - it seems that the earnings are considerable, but the money goes like water in the sand!  <span>Unforeseen expenses,</span> unplanned purchases, the desire to ‚Äúlive no worse than others,‚Äù instead of living within our means, are often plunged into a financial crisis.  <span>The family budget,</span> alas, is bursting at all seams. </p><p>  What to do in this situation?  There is only one way out - a rational attitude to money.  For an ordinary average family, methods of saving also affect such an expense item as food, because in grocery stores and supermarkets more than half of the family budget remains.  It would seem, how can you save on food?  But to learn healthy nutrition and at the same time save up to 30% of family money per month is quite realistic. </p><p>  <strong>How to save money on food?</strong> </p><p>  <strong>1</strong> .  Which of us didn‚Äôt happen when going to the store for certain foods to buy a mountain of ‚Äúgoodies‚Äù while forgetting the necessary things?  Most often this happens if a person is hungry, so you should not go shopping on an empty stomach.  It is not recommended to pay by credit card, as it is more difficult to control the amount spent on products.  It is better to have a limited amount of cash with you, which you have to keep within without spending too much. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>2.</strong> Buying semi-finished products is not only unprofitable, but also harmful to health.  Often they are prepared in their own workshops from far from fresh products.  You can cook semi-finished products for a whole week at home, having allocated a little time for this on a day off.  Having stuck dumplings, cutlets, dumplings and freezing them for future use, you can ensure yourself quick cooking on weekdays and not splurge on sausages and instant convenience foods. </p><p>  <strong>3.</strong> Saving the family budget can increase significantly if you plan the menu for the week and buy products strictly according to the list.  In this case, it is easy to use all of them completely, nothing will disappear without application.  By the way, about the leftovers - we need to learn how to process them too.  It is easy to find a lot of recipes on the Internet or in magazines, such as, for example, cooking a new dish from the remnants of dinner in the morning, using stale bread, or making a wonderful casserole from boring pasta. </p><p>  <strong>4.</strong> Caring about <span>how to save</span> money, you can not help but think about preparations for the winter.  When there are a lot of cheap fruits and vegetables on the market, you can make jam, preserve vegetables, make soup dressings for the future - it is good for your health, and beneficial for your wallet.  Do not forget about this method of preserving vegetables, berries and fruits, like freezing. </p><p>  <strong>5.</strong> Good savings come from bulk purchases of potatoes, cereals, sugar, flour and other products.  From wholesale suppliers all this can be bought much cheaper.  In addition, the availability of stocks will reduce the number of trips to the store, and hence the likelihood of succumbing to the temptation to buy something extra. </p><p>  <strong>6.</strong> Reflections on how to save money lead to the conclusion that it is more profitable to make ordinary purchases in a store that declares low prices, even if it is not located as close as we would like.  Nevertheless, competitors with higher prices have sales and promotions, using which you can please your budget with good savings. </p><p>  <strong>7.</strong> In any store among the goods you can almost always find an alternative with a lower price.  Typically, these products are located on the lower shelves, and at eye level, cunning sellers have the most expensive products to attract attention. </p><p>  Today there are not many people who have the opportunity to waste money.  Many are forced to think about <span>how to save money,</span> avoid unnecessary costs and at the same time not infringe on their interests.  If you try, you will definitely be able to live economically and with great pleasure. </p>
