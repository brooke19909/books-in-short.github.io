The administrative center is Nizhny Novgorod - one of the largest cities in the <span>federal Volga region.</span>  Its history goes back more than one century.  Its foundation is associated with the need to protect against raids of the Volga Bulgars.  Since then, Nizhny Novgorod has always played an important role in the life of the state.  Despite the development of trade and industry, there remained places protected by the state.  It has on its territory the <span>Nizhny Novgorod region</span> reserves that are known not only in Russia but also beyond its borders.  They are a national treasure of the country.  This Kerzhensky reserve, Ichalkovsky reserve, Lakes Svetloyar and Vadskoe.  All of them have a unique flora and fauna. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nizhny Novgorod region reserves" class="if" height="457" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11391/455103.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Kerzhensky Reserve - a brief history </h2><p>  The territory of the reserve from the moment of the occurrence of settlements and until 1993 was an array of taiga and areas of swamps.  About some kind of protection from felling, or at least control, it was not discussed before.  And only in 1993 was the Kerzhensky Reserve created.  This made it possible to take control of a territory with unique ecosystems, flora and fauna and protect them from extinction. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This object is located on the territory of the <span>river Kerzhenets,</span> in the Borsky and Semenovsky districts of the region under very tight control.  Actually, all nature reserves and sanctuaries of the Nizhny Novgorod region are protected, but in Kerzhensky special permission is required even for those who live in settlements on its territory.  Just go and enjoy the beauty of nature will not work. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kerzhensky reserve" class="if" height="215" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11391/455104.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <p>  Thanks to state control, it was possible to stop the extinction of many plant and animal species.  Moreover, in the reserve, experiments are being conducted on breeding species that did not live here, such as the white partridge.  True, while the experiment was not successful. </p><h2>  Flora and fauna of the Kerzhensky reserve </h2><p>  The reserve covers the taiga and wetlands.  Coniferous species prevail among the trees.  However, there are areas occupied by a mixed forest - spruce, pine and large-leaved trees.  The main pine forest was preserved only on the banks of the Kerzhenets river.  Alder, birch, oak grow on the banks of taiga streams and streams.  There are practically no meadows in the reserve.  All this is associated with uncontrolled deforestation and a large number of fires - nature is engaged in self-healing of the ecosystem. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nature reserves and wildlife sanctuary of the Nizhny Novgorod region" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11391/455107.jpg" width="338"></div>

You can find a wide variety of birds, including hawk, kestrel, harrier, gray crane, buzzard, kite, owl, owl, owl, kingfisher, quail and others.  Many of them are listed in the Red Book.  The world of reptiles and amphibians is represented by such animals as a lizard, spindle whale, viper, copperfish, toad, newt, frog.  In rivulets, lakes and streams you can find such fish as roach, pike, rudd, bleak, tench, catfish, ruff, perch, burbot and others. </p><h2>  A unique natural monument - Ichalkovsky Reserve </h2><p>  If Kerzhensky Reserve has a very small and short history, then another natural object has existed for about 50 years.  The protected area includes several sites that have unique characteristics.  So the reserve Ichalkovsky was formed in 1971.  He combined Ichalkovsky pine forest, plots in the floodplain of the Pyana River and adjacent territories of fields and copses. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reserves in the Nizhny Novgorod region" class="if" height="457" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11391/455108.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  First of all, the territory was taken under protection because of the relict vegetation of the late glacial period.  There are also karst caves on the territory of Ichalkovsky Bor.  This is the second reason for the protection and protection of this region.  Not only pine trees grow on the territory, but also oaks, ash, birch and other hardwoods.  Shrubby undergrowth is very developed - it is filled with buckthorn, currants, bird cherry, honeysuckle, hazel. </p><h2>  <span>Karst Dips of</span> Ichalkovsky Bor </h2><p>  Karst dips fill most of the reserve.  Many of them form lakes, and some are entire caves.  They even have their own names and trodden roads.  The first one is the Ice Cave.  It has two rooms, the temperature does not rise above -3 -C even in summer.  Hoarfrost and ice in it do not melt.  About a hundred meters from Ledyanaya is the Startseva Pit, which has three grottoes.  According to legend, hermits lived in it.  Not far from their haven there is an Unnamed cave with a grotto and a lake with ice water.  It is so transparent that in the darkness it is simply impossible to notice the border of the water.  But the favorite place for the climbers' training - the Kuleva Pit - stores a terrible legend about the corpses of criminals and suicides who were dumped into it. </p>

    <p>  Access to the reserve is more free, therefore, admiring the beauties of nature and landscape will not be difficult.  The main thing is not to violate the regime common to all protected areas. </p><h2>  Nizhny Novgorod Region.  Nature reserves </h2><p>  Not only the above reserves are famous for Nizhny Novgorod and the territory of its region.  About 28 nature reserves, natural and historical protected areas, 102 natural monuments totals the Nizhny Novgorod region.  Reserves have different conditions, purposes and the degree of admission to them.  So, to study the sphagnum bogs, the Rdeisky State Nature Reserve was created.  To preserve the lake-forest complex of the <span>Valdai Upland</span> , the <span>Valdai National Park</span> was created <span>.</span>  The nature reserves include such reserves in the Nizhny Novgorod region as Lake Vadskoe (Mordovskoe) and Svetloyar. </p><h2>  Lakes as natural monuments and not only </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Svetloyar Lake" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11391/455116.jpg" width="500"></div></h2><p>  Lake Wad is formed by karst springs and is located at the mouth of the Wadok River.  The lake is heavily overgrown with grass and algae, but this does not prevent it from occupying an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 56 hectares and continuing to expand.  The lake serves as a place of entertainment for diving enthusiasts.  Many of them are trying to find the entrance to the caving cave, through which water enters the reservoir. </p><p>  Another glory descended Lake Svetloyar.  According to legend, there was Kitezh-grad, which during the invasion of the Tatar-Mongol horde went under water.  This territory serves as a place of pilgrimage for adherents of the Orthodox faith.  In addition, unexplained phenomena often occur in Svetloyar, which also attracts scientists from various branches of science.  These are the unique places Nizhny Novgorod region has.  Reserves are protected by both regional and federal state programs. </p>
