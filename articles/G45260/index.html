  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Solnechnogorsk: population, history, attractions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The population of Solnechnogorsk, a city of military prowess, is just over 50 thousand people.  Located near Moscow with millions of people (44 kilometers from MKAD), it has not lost its historical roots. </p><h2>  Why Solnechnogorsk? </h2><p>  Previously, in the territory of the modern city there was no settlement of the same name, 12 villages and villages were located in these places.  Among them were Spasskoye-Teleshovo, and Nikolskoye-Gushchino, and Gomzino.  It is the last village that is considered the founder of the city of Solnechnogorsk.  What did residents in these places do, except for farming?  Hint in the name of the settlement.  It was located on the way from Moscow to Veliky Novgorod, and ‚Äúgomza‚Äù means a wallet.  When St. Petersburg was built, a highway connecting the two great cities passed through Gomzino.  Presumably, the main activity of the village is trade.  Also, residents were engaged in Yamskoy carriage, crafts, and brick-making. </p><p>  Later, for no apparent reason, the village became known as the Solar Mountain.  The most acceptable explanation for this fact is given only by the local legend.  In 1767, very early in the morning, Catherine the Great arrived at the village.  The rising sun illuminated the surrounding beauties, the admirable empress exclaimed: ‚ÄúAh, what a wonderful sunny mountain!‚Äù  The population of Solnechnogorsk unconditionally believes in this beautiful legend. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sunflower Station" class="if uuid-2923017" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/2923017.jpg"></div><p>  A traveling palace and a hotel were erected here, and a second postal station between the two capitals appeared.  After the construction of the Nikolaev railway on the outskirts of the village, the "Sunflower" station arose, and the palace building lost its original purpose.  Built in 1810 and a monument of architecture, it adorns the city today.  It houses the historical and cultural center "Solnechnogorye". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The emergence of Lake Senezh </h2><p>  It is impossible to imagine a modern city without this attraction.  And once he was not here. </p><p>  It was decided to build the Cathedral of Christ the Savior in Moscow.  Solnechnogorsk here was in the middle of the way to deliver materials from the upper Volga.  Only the path was water.  And in 1825, they began the construction of a shipping channel through the rivers Dubna, Sestra and Istra.  To regulate the water level in the canal, a dam was built that formed Lake Senezh.  The length of the dam was two kilometers. </p><p>  Construction lasted 25 years, and the hydraulic system worked only 10. The new railway, which opened traffic in 1851, turned out to be more cost-effective and fast. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mygola.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake Senezh" class="if uuid-2923015" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/2923015.jpg"></div><p>  In memory of this project, the townspeople left a wonderful lake Senezh with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã7 km <sup>2</sup> .  It is the largest in the Moscow region.  Not only locals, but also Muscovites come to relax in this pond, admire its beauties, swim, go in for sports or fishing.  10 km from the lake (in Shakhmatovo) is the estate of A. Blok. </p><h2>  Soviet Square </h2><p>  The main square of Solnechnogorsk has been very transformed in recent years.  This is a place for celebrations and events, a place for meetings and walks of citizens. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="tropki.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Soviet Square" class="if uuid-2923014" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/2923014.jpg"></div><p>  In summer, there is a fountain, beautifully illuminated in the evening.  But this place is not only joy, but also sorrow.  It is here that many of the monuments dedicated to the defenders of the Fatherland are erected.  Monuments were erected in different years to participants in various military operations. </p><h2>  Monuments on Sovetskaya Square </h2><p>  Immediately after the Great Patriotic War, in 1947, a monument was erected here to those who died in battles for the city, and in 2007 the memorial "Solnechnogorsk - defenders of the Fatherland" was opened.  The gratitude of people does not diminish over the years.  In the same year, a monument was opened to "Solnechnogorsk, who fell in local wars."  These are not all the commemorative signs installed here. </p><p>  The war came to the city of the sun in November 1941.  For 24 days he was in the power of the Nazis.  The surrounding villages were destroyed, people were killed.  But the city itself did not suffer significant damage, the German invaders were knocked out during the offensive operation near Moscow. </p><p>  At the 40th kilometer of the Leningradskoye Highway, a monument of Glory rises.  Three steles and three bayonets in honor of the three arms of service are mounted on a high mound.  This is a mass grave, and it was from here in 1966 that the remains of the Unknown Soldier were seized, which were buried near the walls of the Moscow Kremlin. </p><div class="photo" data-original="photogoroda.com" data-author=": Dim@Ar, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument on Sovetskaya Square" class="if uuid-2923018" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/2923018.jpg"></div><p>  And although the population of the city of Solnechnogorsk is small compared with Moscow, but their inhabitants are firmly connected by the memory of December 1941, which marked the beginning of the great feat of heroes-liberators. </p><h2>  City surroundings </h2><p>  The population of Solnechnogorsk lovingly refers not only to their city, but also to its surroundings.  On the territory of the Solnechnogorsk district is the manor complex "Serednikovo".  This beautiful place near Moscow has its own interesting history, which began in 1775.  Vsevolod Alekseevich, a valid state adviser, makes the decision to build a large house with outbuildings, a park, and ponds.  Over the years, the building was rebuilt, improved, but the buildings always remained snow-white and symmetrical, resembling a flying gull. </p><div class="photo" data-original="trymoscow.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Manor Serednikovo" class="if uuid-2923013" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/2923013.jpg"></div><p>  In 1825 the estate was bought by the brother of grandmother M. Lermontov - Dmitry Stolypin.  From 1829 to 1831 a young poet spends the summer months here.  Famous dramas, poems and poems written by him in these places. </p><p>  Later, the estate will be sold to the Firsanov family.  Vera Ivanovna, with her own money, is building a nearby railway station, which is still called Firsanovka.  Being a big admirer of M. Lermontov‚Äôs talent, she orders the sculptor A. Golubkina a bust of the poet, and paints the ceiling of the oval hall with illustrations for the poem ‚ÄúDemon‚Äù. </p><p>  In Soviet times, there was a sanatorium, then the buildings for a long time stood abandoned.  And finally, since 1993, the "National Lermontov Center" has been opened here. </p><h2>  How to get to Solnechnogorsk from Moscow? </h2><p>  By car, you can drive along the Leningradskoye Shosse.  The M10 highway passes through the city.  Travel time - no more than an hour, provided that there are no traffic jams.  And they are almost always there in this direction, so it‚Äôs more convenient to use a toll highway. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="56.1852039" data-lng="36.977617099999975" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/0/6/9/7/10697.png"></div><p>  Bus No. 437 Moscow-Klin leaves from the Vodny Stadion metro station every half an hour and follows Leningradskoye Shosse.  Necessary stop: Solnechnogorsk, there is the same traffic jam problem. </p><p>  The most convenient option is the railway.  All trains coming from the Leningrad station in this direction with a stop in Solnechnogorsk will do.  Time spent: 1 hour 20 minutes.  And if you choose the train "Moscow - Tver", then save 20 minutes. </p>
