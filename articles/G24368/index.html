  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Art from the distant past: cross stitch for beginners</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the XIX century, folk embroidery became widespread, which was associated with the traditions and customs of that time.  So, preparing for the wedding, the girl had to embroider a dowry (tablecloth, towel, scarf, etc.).  In this case, cross stitch was used.  For beginner needlewomen, linen or <span>woolen fabrics</span> were selected <span>,</span> on which they had to embroider.  The skill and experience of the craftswomen was passed down from generation to generation, thereby preserving the culture of the nation. </p><p>  Cross-stitch is one of the most common types of needlework, which originates from ancient times.  It is interesting that a variety of ornaments and colors, as well as cross-stitch techniques, were individual for each state.  For example, in India plant motifs were popular, as well as images of animals and birds. </p><p>  To date, this craft has not lost its popularity.  <span>For cross-stitching</span> , cotton or linen canvases are used, as well as canvas, which is a fabric marked with cells.  Canvas can be ordinary, laid on, and also water-soluble.  There are special kits, for example, ‚Äúcross stitch for beginners, <strong>‚Äù</strong> which include a canvas with a pattern printed on it, threads and needles.  In this case, it is necessary to be able to decode embroidery patterns that show the required number of squares of canvas and shades of colors.  Such patterns are of two types: with the image of different symbols and with the image of multi-colored squares, each of which designates one stitch.  The color scheme is most often used when there are a small number of colors in the picture.  For a multi-color drawing, a character scheme is used. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It should be noted that in order to learn how to embroider a cross, it is necessary not only to be able to read patterns correctly, but also to master embroidery techniques. </p><p>  Cross-stitch can be of several types: </p><ol><li>  A simple cross - the upper stitches should have one direction, the stitch itself is embroidered first with the lower stitches in the required quantity and ends with the embroidery of the upper stitches (in the opposite direction). </li><li>  Elongated cross - the cross fills several canvas cells located vertically. </li><li>  Straight cross - consists of a vertical line, the embroidery of which begins from left to right, and a horizontal line. </li><li>  Asterisk - An oblique cross is made over the stitches of the straight cross, that is, diagonal stitches of the same size. </li><li>  Leviathan - a straight cross is made over the stitches of the oblique cross. </li></ol><p>  Thus, cross-stitch for beginners is not very difficult.  To master this technique is simple, although it must be said right away that it requires a significant amount of time. </p><p>  Summing up, it should be noted that the formation of a cross occurs as a result of the intersection of two stitches, performed throughout the work in the same order.  First, the bottom stitch is made, then the upper one, while the stitches of one cross are embroidered in one square of the canvas. </p><p>  Before starting work, it is recommended to apply the drawing with a special marker on the canvas using markings in increments of ten cells.  If the embroidery is small, it starts to be executed from the middle of the canvas, determining the center of the canvas and patterns, respectively.  In some cases, the diagram shows an image of a triangle in the center.  If the pattern is voluminous, they begin to embroider it from the bottom corner, depending on the direction of the cross.  The edges of the embroidered fabric can be <span>sewn</span> with a <span>buttonhole stitch.</span> </p><p>  Thus, such a technique as cross stitch for beginners will seem easy enough for many, but some efforts should be made to achieve a high result.  And you should always remember that experience comes with time. </p>
