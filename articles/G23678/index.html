To cut such a bird as in the photo below, draw a template on cardboard and use it as a stencil.  You will also need the following materials: </p><ol><li>  Bright cotton fabric with a fine pattern for the wing. </li><li>  A piece of beige suede for the beak. </li><li>  Cardboard tight twine for paws. </li><li>  Two pink buttons for the image of the peephole. </li><li>  Thin satin ribbon for hanging on a spruce branch. </li><li>  Sintepon for filling. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="denim bird" class="if uuid-3080594" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3080594.jpg"></div><p>  First, the same parts of the bird‚Äôs body are made of denim and wings of thin fabric according to the template.  If desired, the seam can be made inside, but do not forget to leave a small hole in order to fill the inside with synthetic winterizer.  From the bottom, twine is inserted into the body, tying strong knots on both sides of each foot, and a loop of satin ribbon on top.  At the end, the beak triangle is attached and the hole is sutured.  On one and the other side of the body, wings and buttons of the eyes are sewn with a decorative seam over the edge. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Little Christmas trees </h2><p>  You can sew cute New Year trees decorated with buttons as denim Christmas tree decorations on a bright red ribbon.  They perform work from two identical triangles with carved edges sewn along the contours and filled with cotton or synthetic winterizer.  A loop for hanging on a tree branch is sewn from a red ribbon folded in half. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Christmas decorations" class="if uuid-3080593" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3080593.jpg"></div><p>  Different sizes of buttons are sewn onto the front side of the craft.  At this stage, you can realize any creative ideas, for example, pick up small parts of different colors or stick half a bead or rhinestone, sequins or pebbles in a frame with a glue gun.  At the top, a small bow made of red or yellow satin ribbon or a plastic star will look spectacular.  You can decorate the tree with the same toys, or you can decorate everything in different ways. </p><h2>  Hearts from old jeans </h2><p>  Small hearts can be used not only as Christmas tree decorations, it will be interesting to see the craft as a pendant on a woman's bag, a child's satchel or wallet.  You can sew a voluminous heart on Valentine's Day or just give it to a loved one as a gift.  Such a gift will not leave indifferent either a guy or a girl.  However, if the heart for a young man can be left in the form shown in the photo below, then for a gift to a beloved, it is advisable to supplement it with many decorative elements.  Do-it-yourself denim jewelry made with your own hands.  After cutting the fabric according to the pattern of the heart, sew both halves with a beautiful seam, and put a loop for hanging from a thin ribbon or edging in the recess.  To make the craft look voluminous, put a synthetic winterizer or a piece of cotton wool inside. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hearts for the holiday" class="if uuid-3080576" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3080576.jpg"></div><p>  To decorate the craft, any jewelry is used - beads and flowers made of fabric or satin ribbons, bows and buttons, rhinestones and beads, wooden pendants and metal chains.  Choose a decor depending on the preferences of the lady, take into account her interests and character.  Stitch embroidery looks beautiful on denim.  Around the seam effectively leave a small fringe of fabric threads. </p><h2>  Fabric flower </h2><p>  Let's look at how to make a denim jewelry in the shape of a brooch with your own hands.  Let's start with the simplest flower, the manufacture of which any novice craftswoman will cope with.  4 circles with a diameter of 8 cm are cut from the fabric. It is desirable to cut the edges with curly scissors, then the flower will resemble a real clove.  For the base, take a circle of felt to match the fabric.  Denim blanks are folded four times, and two petals are collected face up, and two back - so that the denim color is lighter. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="denim flower" class="if uuid-3080572" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3080572.jpg"></div><p>  On the felt circle, the petals can be sewn at the center points or glued with hot glue.  The middle is decorated with a beautiful button on the loop.  So that a brooch can be worn on any outfit, attach a safety pin on the back.  It can either be sewn on or glued with a glue gun.  Optionally, you can supplement the craft with a layer of white lace. </p><h2>  Roses </h2><p>  It is easy to make jewelry from old jeans in the form of roses on a skirt or blouse.  A strip of fabric folded in half is twisted around the first turn in a spiral, periodically grabbing the lower edges with stitches. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="denim roses" class="if uuid-3080569" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3080569.jpg"></div><p>  A crochet strapping made of a contrasting color of yarn threads looks spectacular.  If you do not know how to knit, then you can collect the lace ribbon with stitches along the edge and tighten it in the center.  The resulting lush bow will be a great base for attaching a rose. </p><h2>  Denim pendant </h2><p>  Flowers can be made in many ways.  The petals twisted by cones from circles of fabric look interesting.  Finished crafts organically fit into jewelry in the form of beads. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beads with jeans flowers" class="if uuid-3080592" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3080592.jpg"></div><p>  To make the composition look harmonious, attach several beads of the same color to the center point of the flowers. </p><p>  Self-made denim beads also look original.  From two long strips with narrowed edges sewn together, a spiral bead is assembled using hot glue. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="denim beads" class="if uuid-3080585" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3080585.jpg"></div><p>  Twisting is done on a thin tube so that the thread can easily be threaded later.  Combine denim with silver beads.  All that remains is to attach the chain and pull in the rings of fasteners on both sides. </p><h2>  Earrings </h2><p>  You can make beautiful jeans jewelry with your own hands in the form of earrings.  From a metal fastener - ‚Äúzippers‚Äù cut off the fabric and sew on a denim fabric cut in the shape of a heart, creating an interesting curl pattern.  The voids are pasted over with white felt and rhinestones.  The back side with seams is hidden under a layer of felt or the same denim.  Metal fasteners are attached at the end and you can go showing off to your girlfriends. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="denim earrings" class="if uuid-3080565" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3080565.jpg"></div><p>  As you can see, throwing away old jeans is by no means possible, since you can sew a lot of useful and unique gizmos from the remaining good quality fabric that will please the owner for a long time.
