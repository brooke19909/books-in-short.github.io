  <section class="page js-page"><h1>EGP of Japan</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The economic and geographical characteristics of Japan directly depend on the geographical position of this state.  Despite the relatively large number of islands (6852), its area is measured 378 square kilometers.  The largest islands in Japan are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu.  They are located along the eastern coast of Eurasia. </p><p>  This state has no land neighbors, and the closest sea neighbors are Russia, China, and <span>North Korea.</span>  EGP of Japan allows it to have a leading position in the global economy.  This state is separated from the mainland by the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãOkhotsk, Japan and East China.  The water expanses of the Pacific Ocean surround Japan from the east and south-east.  These seas and oceans washing the country are very important for her.  They are a source of energy, mineral and biological resources.  EGP of Japan, which has the longest coastlines in the world, opens up the possibility of participation of this state in trade, construction and recreational purposes.  All countries are linked by sea. </p><p>  Due to the fact that the <span>Japanese islands</span> were formed at the intersection of some volcanic arcs, frequent earthquakes occur in the country.  Each year there are about one and a half thousand, however, the surface of the earth affects their fourth part.  Every ten to thirty years, the most severe earthquakes are repeated.  With the same frequency, tsunamis occur in this country - destructive waves, reaching a height of up to ten meters.  Due to movements of the earth's crust, the islands are subject to intense volcanic activity.  This is another feature of EGP in Japan.  There are approximately two hundred volcanoes, of which about forty are active. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The natural resource potential of this country is extremely poor.  Its relief, which is seventy-nine percent mountainous, is not adapted for the development of land transport systems.  It is also unsuitable for construction.  The plains account for twenty-one percent.  The soils here are diverse - red soils, yellow soils, brown forest soils, however, all of them are poor and unproductive.  The state has a meager amount of minerals.  It possesses only non-industrial reserves of copper, coal, iron ore, and natural gas.  Therefore, all the necessary country is forced to import, in particular, ninety-nine percent of all ores consumed, combustible minerals - ninety-six percent and the wood used by it, seventy percent. </p><p>  Based on the acquisition of the most advanced technologies and equipment, industry is actively developing, where the professionalism of the workforce plays an important role.  At present, the industrial complex of this country is its pride.  A powerful energy industry is developing on imported gas and oil.  Metallurgy is also one of the main industries.  Own metallurgical base allows you to actively develop transport, electrical, machine-tool and instrument-making machinery.  In the manufacture of ships, Japan ranks first.  One of the leading places belongs to the export of cars and trucks, motorcycles.  A significant role in the global economy is played by the production of office equipment, optical equipment, and <span>industrial robots.</span> </p><p>  The traditional development of light industry, represented by the manufacture of silk, cotton, wool and synthetic fabrics, does not stop. </p><p>  <span>Japanese agriculture</span> plays a minor role in the overall profile of this country.  Therefore, it is forced to import these products.  The population completely provides itself only with rice, and the nearest mainland supplies fruits, vegetables, teas.  The livestock industry is represented by fish farming and fishing, in terms of consumption and volume of which Japan has no competitors in the global economy. </p><p>  If we take into account the amount spent on imports, they are several hundred times less than the amount that the state receives from the export of manufactured goods.  Japan sells its products to the whole world, ranging from ships and automobiles, office and household appliances, machine tools, to light industry products.  Therefore, Japan's EGP allows it to maintain a leading position in the <span>global market</span> and maintain the image of the most economically developed country. </p>
