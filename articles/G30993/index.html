This is the kind of question you can most often hear from Lenovo device owners.  In fact, there is nothing complicated in this task.  There are several very simple and at the same time effective methods that allow you to literally take a screenshot from the screen in just a few seconds.  But what are these methods and how to use them - we’ll talk about this in more detail. </p><h2>  Universal way </h2><p>  The easiest and most universal way to make a screen on a Lenovo tablet is to use a keyboard shortcut.  This method is suitable for absolutely any device, it does not matter if it is a tablet or just a smartphone.  All you need to do is hold down the volume button and the power / lock key.  You must press them at the same time, otherwise nothing will work.  In general, a little training - and everything will work out. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tabletowo.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="screen by pressing buttons" class="if uuid-2527475" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2527475.jpg"></div><p>  A successful signal that the screen shot is taken is the characteristic sound with which pictures are taken through the camera.  The finished screenshot will be saved in the device’s gallery. </p><h2>  Screenshot through the "curtain" </h2><p>  The second way to make a screen on the Lenovo tablet is to use the status bar.  For those who don’t know, the status bar is a drop-down menu that appears on the screen if you drag your finger down from the top of the screen or vice versa, it all depends on the tablet model.  Also, the status bar is often called a quick access panel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="community.starhub.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="screen on the tablet using the status bar" class="if uuid-2527478" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2527478.jpg"></div><p>  So, in order to take a screenshot, you need to “stretch” the status bar and among the icons located there, find the one that is signed as a Screenshot or “Screenshot”.  As a rule, it depicts scissors or a frame, so it will be difficult to make a mistake.  All that remains to be done is to click on the icon, and the picture will be taken automatically, after which it will immediately be saved to the gallery. </p><p>  If suddenly there is no “Screenshot” icon in the quick access panel, then it may not be displayed and you need to enable it.  To do this, go to the settings and find there the item that is responsible for the status bar.  Just in this section there will be a list of available “quick tools”, among which is the “Screenshot”. </p><h2>  Extra menu </h2><p>  The third way to make a screen screen on a Lenovo tablet is to use the additional menu.  It’s worth mentioning right away that, depending on the firmware version, this method may not work on all devices. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidauthority.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="screen through a special menu" class="if uuid-2527477" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2527477.jpg"></div><p>  Here's what you need to do: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Press the on / lock button and do not release until the device shutdown menu appears. </li><li>  If the firmware is not the most “ancient” one, then the “Screenshot” item will be in this menu.  Usually it is located at the bottom of the list. </li><li>  The last thing to do is click on the appropriate button.  A screenshot will be taken and automatically saved to the device’s gallery. </li></ol><p>  That, in general, is all.  Following! </p><h2>  Quick gestures </h2><p>  Another very interesting and effective way to make a screen on a Lenovo tablet is to use special quick gestures.  As with the previous method, gestures do not work on all tablets, but only on more modern ones, with an operating system of at least Android 5.0. </p><p>  So, in order to use quick gestures, you first need to activate them.  It is easy to do.  First you need to go into the device settings and find the “Actions” item there.  It can be in the form of a separate submenu or can be found in the "Accessibility" section.  Next, go to this point and, according to the instructions in the tablet, set up the desired gesture with which you will make a screen from the screen on the Lenovo tablet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="forums.lenovo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="screen on the tablet using gestures" class="if uuid-2527476" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2527476.jpg"></div><p>  After all the settings are completed, you can safely start using a quick gesture and take as many pictures as your heart desires.  All screenshots will also be saved to the gallery, in a separate folder. </p><p>  The only negative of this method is that the gesture can be made involuntarily, which will result in random screenshots. </p><h2>  3rd party applications </h2><p>  Well, the last way that will help to make a screen on the Lenovo tablet is third-party applications.  In the application store, there are many different programs that are designed for one task - to take screenshots.  The most popular applications are Easy Screenshot, Screenshot, Screenshot touch, Lightshot, Mobizen, etc. </p><div class="photo" data-original="app4smart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="screen on tablet lenovo" class="if uuid-2527474" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2527474.jpg"></div><p>  All these programs are distributed free of charge, have a simple and intuitive interface, and also have different functionality.  Some applications simply take screenshots, and some allow you to immediately edit screenshots, add notes, text, stickers and much more to them. </p><p>  That, in fact, is all about screenshots on Lenovo tablets. </p>
