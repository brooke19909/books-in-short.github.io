Photos and reviews of tourists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The sunniest and perhaps the most beautiful on the Crimean peninsula is the city of Sudak.  The Bastion Hotel, located in an unusually convenient location near the sea, at the foot of the mountain, on top of which the ancient Genoese fortress, who lived here 500 years ago, towers, is truly a local attraction.  The point here is not so much in the originality of the design of buildings and territory, but in the regalia of this wonderful institution.  So, since 2006, in various competitions organized in the spa industry, for example, ‚ÄúCrimean Pearl‚Äù, ‚ÄúResort and Tourism‚Äù, ‚ÄúPublic Recognition‚Äù, ‚ÄúBest of Hotel Complexes‚Äù, the venue of which was Crimea, Sudak, Hotel ‚Äú Bastion ‚Äùhas always received awards and diplomas as one of the best in the city and to all of us on the peninsula. </p><p>  All these high achievements were made possible thanks to the professional work of each hotel employee - from the manager to the maid.  Let's take a look at this modern Bastion and see for yourself how good it is. </p>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Hotel "Bastion" (Sudak) is located in Sudak Bay at the very foot of the Fortress Mountain (height - about 160 m).  To the sea from the gates of the hotel is 150 meters.  Nearby there is a local bazaar, shops, a museum, a marina where you can rent a boat, cafes, bars and, very importantly, a bus stop.  Just a few steps from the hotel is a comprehensive medical center where you can get medical advice and medical procedures.  Distances to large settlements in the Crimea from the hotel are: to Simferopol - 107 km, to Yalta - 131, to Feodosia - 55, to Alushta - 93, to the <span>Old Crimea,</span> famous for its historical and architectural sights, - 36, to Dzhankoy - 148 km, to Kerch - 153 and to Sevastopol - 180 km.  Closest to all, at 7 km (this is a distance many hotel guests walk on foot as a walk), is the New World, a resort village famous for its champagne wines (there is a factory, a tasting room). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Important!  The resort hotel "Bastion" (Sudak) is not located in the very center of the city, so neither loud music of discos nor the noise that usually occurs in resorts does not interfere with people sleeping at night.  All that can be heard at night by opening a window is the <span>singing of cicadas</span> and the whisper of sea waves. </p>

    <p>  The mailing address of the hotel is: st.  Ushakova, building number 3. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  An important advantage is the convenient location relative to the traffic intersection, which has a "Bastion" (hotel).  Sudak is connected with all large settlements of the peninsula by a good asphalt road.  To get to this hotel is simple, the main thing is to get to Simferopol.  This is the most convenient starting point, as passenger and fast trains arrive here from all over Russia, and airplanes arrive from many regional centers of the country.  Then you can go to the hotel by taxi or by bus.  In the summer they go every 15-20 minutes.  Tickets are always available at the ticket office of the Kurortnaya bus station, which is a stone's throw from the railway station.  Looking for it is simple, the McDonald's restaurant serves as a guide.  Travel time is a little over 2 hours.  It costs up to 400 rubles per person.  A taxi will leave about 2000 rubles per car. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  By buses you can reach the hotel from other cities of Crimea, Feodosia, Yevpatoriya, Yalta, Alushta. </p><p>  Those who wish can book a transfer from the airport or from the railway station of Simferopol. </p><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  In less than a hectare, the designers managed to set up a beautiful garden with flower beds, cypresses and other evergreens, and add a fountain colorful between them, build a decent pool with a bridge and a stone island in the center, arrange five buildings, a sauna, a bar, a restaurant, teahouse, cozy gazebos and parking.  Here it is from the outside, the Bastion Hotel (Sudak).  Photos of tourists demonstrate how good the area is. </p>

    <p>  Following the theme of the name, the designers diversified the appearance of the territory by placing a gun there and decorating some corners with antique chains.  Plus, the whole territory is guarded 24 hours a day, and in the evening it is beautifully illuminated.  The only nuance that not everyone likes: vacationers from the neighboring Lyon hotel can walk and use the pool on the territory. </p><p>  As noted in the reviews, Wi-Fi decently works almost throughout the hotel. </p><h2>  Enclosures </h2><p>  "Bastion" is a hotel (Sudak) in which beauty was created year after year.  All buildings here, although made in the same style, are different in internal content, as they surrendered at different periods.  In 2000, building number 2 appeared, which on many sites is declared as summer houses.  In fact, this building is a decommissioned and converted car, which now offers economy class housing. </p><p>  In 2001, a stone three-story building No. 4 was put into operation.  Here the rooms of the categories ‚Äústandard‚Äù and ‚Äúeconomy‚Äù are one-room for 2 people and two-room for 3 people.  It is also possible to install additional space in the form of a folding bed.  A distinctive feature of this building is the very small area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe rooms (in some two-bedroom apartments the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe bedroom is only 6.5 squares, which should be taken into account for those who wish to settle here). </p><p>  Cases No. 2 and 4 work only in the summer season.  Subsequently, the Bastion (hotel) expanded its capabilities.  Sudak has such a climate that you can relax here all year round.  Therefore, the following buildings in the hotel were built for reasons of taking tourists in both winter and summer. </p>

    <p>  In 2002, building number 5 was opened, where standard and luxury rooms are offered.  In 2003, building No. 1 was commissioned, and in 2006, building No. 3.  These buildings are last in good repair, have underfloor heating or a split system, excellent views from the sea and the fortress on the mountain, some rooms have balconies or terraces (this must be specified when booking). </p><h2>  Non Economy and Standard </h2><p>  Bastion Resort Hotel (Sudak) offers rooms of various categories and prices.  The current price list can be found on the hotel website.  The rooms also differ in design, equipment, quality of repair, area and views.  That is, when booking, you need to carefully study all the information about the desired room.  Moreover, the above characteristics even differ numbers of the same category, but located in different buildings. </p><p>  Let's start our acquaintance with the categories ‚Äúeconomy‚Äù and ‚Äústandard‚Äù, which the Bastion Hotel (Sudak) offers its guests in the summer.  Reviews of this accommodation, let's say, are not enthusiastic.  These numbers are located in buildings No. 2 and 4. Among them there are one-room apartments with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãup to 12 squares for 2 people (plus third place if necessary) and two-room apartments, respectively, for 3 people and an extra bed.  There are no air conditioners, the view from the windows is to the mountains (foot) or to the courtyard, the TV, if there is one, in extreme cases with 1 channel.  Room facilities - standard furniture, hygiene room (toilet, wash basin and shower). </p>
