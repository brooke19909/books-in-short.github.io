It is impossible to live without him, since he adds to people's health, gives the brain and body a rest.  People who suffer from insomnia due to extraneous sounds often wonder how to make earplugs with their own hands, because they are not always at hand.  For this, only improvised means are necessary, therefore the whole process is carried out at home without visiting stores and pharmacies. </p><h2>  What are ear plugs for? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="news.thomasnet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ear plugs yourself" class="if uuid-3143802" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116178/3143802.jpg"></div><p>  Earplugs have been known to the world for decades.  They are very popular, as they well help to drown out all extraneous sounds.  Even the name itself speaks of the effectiveness of the device - ‚Äútake care‚Äù and ‚Äúears‚Äù.  The tool is known not only as a good "sleeping pill", but also as an assistant while bathing in the bathroom or pool.  They do not allow excess moisture to get into the ear canals.  As you know, moisture or dirt in the ears does not lead to rainbow consequences.  Everything can even reach deafness or damage to the eardrum. </p><p>  Earplugs are created on the basis of special materials that are elastic in nature.  This makes it easy to place the device in the auricle.  It completely fills the entire space and prevents excess sounds or water from leaking out.  A huge plus is versatility.  The product has no sizes, and any option will suit absolutely everyone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to make earplugs with your own hands? </h2><p>  To create such a thing on your own, you need a foundation that will not be a conductor for sound.  This will help drown out all the excess noise around. </p><p>  Today, many are thinking about how to make earplugs with your own hands for sleep?  This is because when a person reaches a peak during another insomnia, he is unlikely to want to go to the store and look for a device there.  He will find the material familiar to everyone, roll it up as needed and place it in the ear canal.  But this is not enough, since certain safety rules must be observed in order not to harm yourself. </p><h2>  Cotton ear plugs </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.reddit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cotton ear plugs" class="if uuid-3143803" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116178/3143803.jpg"></div><p>  How to make earplugs from wool with your own hands?  This option comes to mind first.  After all, the named material is always in every house.  Special cotton balls are also suitable, with which this procedure will be even easier to do.  It does not matter if the cotton wool is sterile, as it is coated with polyethylene before use. </p><p>  Two small pieces of it are needed, which will correspond to the coin in size.  Circles are formed from them, so that it is more convenient to place the product in the auricle.  Polyethylene is necessary so that small wool fibers do not remain in the ear after application, as this will lead to contamination.  The cotton wool needs to be wrinkled tightly and wrapped with polyethylene, but a small oblong piece should be left ‚Äúfree" so that you can easily remove the earplugs. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After the option is tested, it is necessary to wrap the product with thread or elastic so that the cotton wool does not fall out of polyethylene.  It is recommended to use such earplugs for a maximum of a week, since cotton wool quickly gets dirty and loses its shape.  Wearing it too long will cause bacteria to grow in the ear. </p><h2>  Plasticine to create </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.simon-safety.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Improvised ear plugs" class="if uuid-3143808" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116178/3143808.jpg"></div><p>  Knowing the algorithm for creating the previous view, the question of how to make ear plugs with your own hands so as not to hear the noise will disappear by itself.  After all, a device made of plasticine is made by the same method.  The main rule is not to forget to wrap plasticine.  In the case of cotton wool, this is probably not as dangerous as in this version.  Particles of matter when they enter the ear provoke not only the growth of bacteria, but also inflammatory processes. </p><h2>  Do you have old headphones? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.funkidslive.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Broken ear plugs" class="if uuid-3143805" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116178/3143805.jpg"></div><p>  If the old, broken headphones are at home, then the person is already halfway to find out what you can make ear plugs with your own hands.  The optimal basis will be vacuum devices. </p><p>  First, remove the silicone tips from the headphones using scissors or a knife.  Sometimes, they can simply be pulled and removed.  Then in the tip of the accessory you need to make a small hole that will be identical in diameter to the base of the silicone inserts.  The hole is made with a pen without paste, or with tweezers.  The base of nozzles is pushed into the resulting cavity.  It is important that everything holds tight and snug against each other. </p><p>  Such earplugs will last more than one year.  They have the disadvantage that they do not completely muffle all the noise.  A person ceases to react so sharply to them, but he still hears.  Therefore, if the hearing is very sharp, and the mind is susceptible to volume fluctuations, then this option will not work. </p><h2>  Special sets </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.yourbestdigs.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Special Ear Plugs" class="if uuid-3143806" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116178/3143806.jpg"></div><p>  Having learned how to make earplugs with your own hands at home, some will change their mind about creating them.  In this case, there are special kits for creating ear plugs that make the process much easier.  The composition of such devices, as a rule, includes two bases, which are in different containers or bags.  The material of each type must be divided in half, and then mix one with the other. </p><p>  The resulting mass must be well crushed to get a homogeneous consistency.  After the tool is inserted into the ear, where it should take the appropriate shape.  It is enough to hold for 10 minutes, and then you can already take it out if necessary or leave it. </p><h2>  From toilet paper </h2><div class="photo" data-original="unicorncafe.co.za" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Toilet paper ear plugs" class="if uuid-3143807" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116178/3143807.jpg"></div><p>  Few people today know how to make earplugs yourself from toilet paper, and this is an effective way to muffle all the surrounding sounds.  You need to take two small pieces of paper and roll them until you get a round shape.  After they are moistened with water and squeezed so that they are slightly moist.  This procedure is necessary, as dry pieces will remain in the ear canal and cause irritation and inflammation. </p><p>  The funds received will be placed in the ear.  If the size fits, then it makes no sense to add or remove pieces.  The main rule in this method is that use is limited to once.  Repeated use is strictly prohibited, as it causes the development of infections in the auricles. </p><h2>  Operation tips </h2><p>  Knowing how to make earplugs with your own hands, do not limit yourself to this information only.  There are certain rules that are very important when using any ear plugs: </p><ol><li>  Before starting the procedure, wash your hands thoroughly.  This is best done with special antibacterial agents. </li><li>  During the placement of the ear plug, you need to place them at the beginning of the auditory canal. </li><li>  Keep materials and ready-made ear plugs, if their composition allows, in a clean place, protected from dust and dirt. </li><li>  To create funds, you can use all of these materials.  But, of course, the best way is real earplugs or kits for constructing them.  This is the safest way that does not require effort. </li></ol><p>  If, nevertheless, there is a need to make an adaptation on your own, you need to approach the procedure with all responsibility.  Indeed, the health of the ears depends on the quality of the finished products. </p>
