In order to plunge into the amazing tranquility of this locality, thousands of tourists from all over the world come here every year.  However, many still have the question: "Where is Goa?"  The answer to it does not cause any difficulties.  Goa occupies the territory in the central part of the west coast of India.  Unlike other provinces of the country, life here proceeds calmly and measuredly, as if in tact with the natural rhythm of nature. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is goa" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/88646.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  There are no big cities in Goa, and this is the smallest state in the country.  Perhaps this is one of the reasons that not everyone knows where Goa is.  Here, mainly small villages are located, which are lined up along the picturesque coast of the bay.  It is in these settlements that you can relax from the bustling Indian metropolitan areas.  Even in the many tourist routes in India that are offered to travelers, Goa is the end point of the path. </p><p>  Now that you already know where Goa is, it's time to get acquainted with the attractions of this province.  Of course, the main pride of the state is the beaches.  They extend a long white stripe along the entire coast.  Once at least once on such a beach, you involuntarily admit the existence of paradise, which is located on Indian soil.  The only thing that maybe not everyone will like is that the beaches are crowded.  After all, not only tourists from Asian countries come here, but also many tourists from European countries.  Due to climatic conditions and the natural area, the beach season here lasts throughout the year. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="holidays in india goa" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/88648.jpg" width="600"></div>

For a long time, the province was a <span>colony of Portugal,</span> so the life and disposition of local residents are slightly different from life in the rest of the Indian territory.  The entire territory of Goa can be conditionally divided into two parts, one of which is considered the New World, and the second the Old World.  The old Goa district is a calm rural area, where the spirit of the colonial era is still preserved.  Here you can hide from the bustling city in a small wooden hut, located among the rainforest.  A completely different characteristic can be given to New Goa.  This part of the state consists of chic beach villages equipped to the highest standard. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tour to goa" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/88647.jpg" width="350"></div>

That in one thing, in another resort village there are quite a lot of hotels for every taste, restaurants, clubs, but the latter has cleaner beaches.  The most popular tourist destination is Paloy Beach, which occupies the territory in the southern part of Goa.  Here the coast is in perfect cleanliness, surrounded by picturesque nature.  There are many attractions for little vacationers.  Especially popular among young people is the resort of Anjou, which is famous for its continuous beach parties, carnivals and competitions. </p><p>  However, just knowing where Goa is is not enough.  All this you need to see with your own eyes.  In addition to a beach holiday, there is something to see.  So, in the administrative center of Mapusa, the Hanuman Temple deserves attention.  No less attractive is the church of Milagres.  You can visit the temple of Sateri in the village of Seolim.  Here stands the church of St. Anthony.  And in order to describe the beauty of nature there will not be enough time or words.  In a word, to feel all the charm of Goa, you must visit here. </p>
