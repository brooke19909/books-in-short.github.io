  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Chechen War</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Chechen war is an armed confrontation between the Armed forces of Russia and the unrecognized Chechen Republic of Ichkeria.  These events are one of the darkest in the recent history of Russia.  Events unfolded in two campaigns, sometimes there are two Chechen wars: the first - from 1994 to 1996, the second - from 1999 to 2009. </p><p>  In the fall of 1991, during the coup, the parliament of the Chechen-Ingush Republic was removed from power.  At the same time, the Chechen-Ingush Republic was divided into the Chechen and Ingush.  Elections were held in Chechnya that were declared illegal by the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR, as they were more a representation than an election.  Thus, separatists led by Dzhokhar Dudaev broke into power in Chechnya.  On October 27, Dudayev was declared president, <span>and on</span> November <span>1</span> , independence of Chechnya was proclaimed.  Chechnya is called the <span>Chechen Republic of</span> Ichkeria.  In the spring of 1992, the constitution of the republic was adopted.  This state has not been recognized by any state in the world. </p><p>  Chechnya was in an economic and political crisis: during 1991-1994, the criminal economy flourished (kidnapping and trafficking, arms trafficking, drug trafficking), there was an armed confrontation between Dudaev and the opposition, ethnic purges against the non-Chechen population, primarily against the Russians.  The Russian leadership tried to introduce a state of emergency in <span>Chechnya</span> , but to no avail.  Several rounds of negotiations also led to nothing.  Chechen leaders wanted the central authorities to recognize independent Chechnya.  Meanwhile, Chechen fighters carried out the seizure of weapons and military depots, and this took place with the consent of the Russian Minister of Defense Grachev. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On December 11, 1994, Russian troops entered the territory of Chechnya.  <span>The first Chechen war</span> began.  The army marched from three directions and was aimed at Grozny.  On New Year's Eve, troops began to storm Grozny.  February 22, 1995 the city was taken, the movement of Russian troops deep into Chechnya began.  By the summer of 1995, Dudaev‚Äôs troops were in a very difficult position.  On June 14, hostage taking took place in Budenovsk (Stavropol Territory), which led to the start of negotiations between the Russian authorities and separatists and the delay in hostilities on the part of Russia.  In April 1996, the leader of the Chechen rebels, Dudaev, was eliminated.  In August 1996, the separatists managed to capture Grozny.  On August 31, 1996, the parties signed an agreement called the Khasavyurt Accords.  Under the terms of the agreement, a truce was announced, the withdrawal of Russian troops from Chechnya, the question of independence was postponed until 2001. </p><p>  After the completion of the first campaign, a regime was established in Chechnya, characterized by a criminal economy <span>(kidnapping,</span> drug trafficking, arms trafficking), officially authorized by blood feud, genocide of people of non-Chechen nationality.  The ideas of Islamic extremists spread throughout the republic; Chechen fighters carry out terrorist acts outside the territory of Chechnya in Russia.  In August 1999, separatist troops led by Basayev and Khattab invade Dagestan.  Russian troops repel the attack and enter Chechnya. <br>  The second Chechen war begins with the battles with Basayev and Khattab.  On September 30, 1999, troops were brought into Chechnya.  The end of this war is considered to be April 16, 2009, when the CTO regime was canceled in Chechnya.  It is sometimes said that the Chechen war is still ongoing. </p><p>  The war brought enormous damage to the Russian people.  This, first of all, is expressed in the loss of life of Russian soldiers and officers, as well as civilians.  Losses cannot be calculated accurately.  The data vary from 10 to 26 thousand killed soldiers.  In any case, the Russian-Chechen war became a personal tragedy for a huge number of people. </p>
