    <h2>  Geography </h2><p>  Foros is the most extreme settlement on the Crimean coast.  Dozens of kilometers separate it from the nearest settlements: 40 from Sevastopol, 120 from Simferopol and 50 from Yalta.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe village is small - about 1.5 thousand hectares.  The relief of Foros is determined by the main ridge of the Crimean mountains, which separates the coastline from the rest of the land.  The height of the coast above sea level is 32 meters.  The soil in Foros is rocky, the coast is indented with rocky bays.  Therefore, the beaches of Foros are mostly pebble, and the entrance to the water in places is very sharp and steep. </p>

    <h2>  Climate and weather </h2><p>  The climate on the Crimean coast is subtropical, Mediterranean.  This means that there are long and hot summers and mild, short winters.  The Crimean mountains do not allow cold weather masses to enter the region, and in summer precipitation is delayed.  Therefore, there are much smaller temperature differences between seasons than in most of the peninsula, only about 20 degrees.  Summer begins in Foros in May and lasts until mid-October, with an average summer thermometer rising to 22 degrees.  In winter, there is practically no snow cover, the average temperature is 6 degrees Celsius.  In the low season, there is a lot of rainfall, mainly in the form of rain, but still winter in Foros is significantly drier than on the rest of <span>the Crimean coast.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The number of hours of sunshine per year is about 2300, as, for example, in <span>Nice.</span>  Foros <span>beaches are</span> best visited in September, when the weather is pleasant with mild warmth and minimal rainfall.  The region as a whole is characterized by great aridity in summer, with precipitation at this time of the year 2-3 days a month. </p>

    <h2>  Features of rest on Foros </h2><p>  In recent years, Crimea has broken all records for tourist attendance, and Foros was no exception.  Several thousand vacationers come here every year, and this figure is growing steadily.  The main difference of this settlement is the unique wellness conditions.  The air here is saturated with beneficial phytoncides that emit cypresses, junipers, pines and cedars, and sea iodine.  In total, this cocktail brings a lot of benefits to a person, not without reason even in tsarist times it was customary to be treated for tuberculosis.  The local places are distinguished by special chamberness, although it can be very crowded on a city beach in high season.  But the surroundings provide great opportunities for walking and sightseeing.  In addition, the beaches of Foros are washed by the clear sea, which also distinguishes this village from many places in Crimea.  It is not in vain that it was in Foros that the authorities of the country always liked to rest.  Due to the fact that the village is quite small in size, there are not very many beaches here, and they are very different from each other. </p><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Public beaches </h2><p>  All state beaches in Foros are free.  The main beach of the village is open, settlement, covered with small pebbles, sometimes quite large boulders are found on the coast, and part of the surface consists of concrete slabs.  At the entrance to the water you need to be careful, as you can step on sharp stones.  This is the widest coastline in the village.  This beach is popularly called "Green Beach" (Foros), it is equipped with changing rooms.  Here you can rent sunbeds, umbrellas and swimming equipment.  There are several cafes, <span>cotton candy,</span> coffee, pasties are on sale, a rescue station works.  There are always a lot of people here, since getting to the Green Beach is the easiest way.  The ‚Äúpink‚Äù beach got its name for decorating the coast with pink gravel, from which today there is nothing left.  The sea washed away the gravel and partially broke it into the usual pebbles.  This small piece of the coastline is famous for its clear water and a very convenient descent for divers, so here you can often see people with scuba gear.  The ‚Äúcold‚Äù beach is named after several springs that make the water off the coast a little colder than other beaches.  This site is divided into two parts: one with large pebbles, the other with small ones.  Of the equipment on the beach there are only changing rooms, everything else needs to be brought with you. </p><p>  Wild beaches that have no signs of civilization can be attributed to public beaches, but they are very beautiful and there are not many people on them.  The most famous of them is Derevyashka - a <span>nudist beach.</span>  It is located in a very beautiful bay and is worthy of at least one visit.  Also, many ‚Äúownerless‚Äù sections of the coastline with comfortable boulders, which are many under Foros, are used for beach needs. </p>

    <h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Foros beaches, reviews of which tell about the good and bad experiences of travelers, are distinguished by a large degree of ‚Äúsavagery‚Äù.  Vacationers say that the charm of Foros lies in the fact that you can find a small piece of the coast and stay there in solitude.  And for everyday relaxation, you can choose a beach within the village line.  Tourists note that the price in Foros is higher than in large cities of the Crimea, but the people here are much smaller and the rest is better. </p><h2>  What to do in Foros </h2><p>  The beach (Foros, Crimea) is the main bait for tourists.  But besides sunbathing, there is something to do.  The first is walking.  Foros is famous for its nature, and you need to inspect it, walking along the rocky shores and coniferous groves.  The best place for walking is Forsos Park.  For those who crave city life, there is always the opportunity to go to Yalta or Sevastopol, where you can get the most entertainment and excursions.  Curious tourists can visit the Kuznetsov Palace of the 19th century, the Museum of Julian Semenov, the Church of the Resurrection of Christ of the 19th century. </p>
