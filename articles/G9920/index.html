The most dangerous in the diseases that they provoke are complications, so your task is to protect yourself and your family.  The easiest and cheapest way to protect yourself is with a cotton-gauze dressing.  It will also be useful if there is already a patient in the house, and the remaining residents need to be protected.  There are several more cases when this remedy is useful, we'll talk about this below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="board.vtomske.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="set of cotton gauze dressings" class="if uuid-2497855" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2497855.jpg"></div><p>  A gauze dressing is used: </p><ul><li>  for the prevention of whooping cough, flu and other infections that are transmitted through the air; </li><li>  the medical staff puts on a protective equipment in the operating room, and dentists during the rehabilitation of the oral cavity; </li><li>  when there is a lot of dust and smog on the street, in this case the product needs to be moistened; </li><li>  when ignited, it will protect for a while from smoke and toxins that enter the air; </li><li>  in case of bacteriological attack; </li><li>  a protective measure is simply necessary in case of an accident at a nuclear power plant (it is also better to moisten it, a cotton-gauze dressing picks up particles of radioactive dust); </li><li>  a medical device will help if fumes of ammonia and chlorine get into the air. </li></ul><p>  It is important to remember that in the latter case, after 3 hours, the bandage needs to be burned! </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Material requirements.  Quality cotton wool </h2><p>  Choose cotton wool that is 100% cotton.  In no case should there be synthetics, otherwise the product will do more harm than good.  It also should not be bleached with chlorine!  Pay attention to the structure of cotton wool.  The content of small fibers that can be inhaled is prohibited. </p><p>  Do a little test.  Shake the cotton wool opposite the window or the lit table lamp.  If you see fine dust in the air that has risen from the material, then it is better not to use it for such purposes. </p><h2>  Gauze </h2><p>  What are the requirements for gauze?  It should be tight.  Only this will protect against infection or toxic substances from the air.  Experts recommend purchasing a bandage made according to GOST for sewing a cotton-gauze dressing with your own hands.  Again, in no case do not buy raw materials from synthetic materials.  It can cause an allergic reaction in the form of severe irritation to the skin, and also make breathing difficult.  In people with asthma, synthetics can cause an asthma attack. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vitalitymedical.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gauze for dressings" class="if uuid-2497840" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2497840.jpg"></div><h2>  Standard </h2><p>  Ready-made cotton-gauze dressing can consist of 4-8 layers.  For dressings that are sewn for chemical protection or medical facilities, there is a standard.  The product should be 15 high and 90 cm wide.  From the figures of the last parameter, 35 cm should be taken from both sides for making ties. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Instruction manual </h2><p>  Today in pharmacies you can find factory masks in sufficient quantities, but a self-made cotton-gauze dressing will better protect during the epidemic.  In addition, this is a good cost savings, since pharmacy remedies need to be thrown out after 3-4 hours of socks.  Gauze dressings can be stretched and ironed, and then used again.  We recommend sewing several sets at once for the whole family so that the protective equipment can be changed. </p><h2>  How to sew a cotton-gauze dressing </h2><p>  To work, you need to have the following components: </p><ul><li>  high-quality cotton wool; </li><li>  gauze or bandage; </li><li>  needle; </li><li>  sewing threads; </li><li>  tailor scissors; </li><li>  tape measure. </li></ul><p>  Take a pack of cotton wool weighing 100 g and 2 cuts of bandage, measuring 14 cm by 7 meters.  On the edge of the fabric, place the cotton wool on a square of 14 x 14 cm. Cut the second section of the bandage in half lengthwise.  Each of the parts is twisted for ties that need to be knocked on top and bottom.  At the next stage of operation, the products are sutured.  A batch of 14 pieces leaves this volume of material. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.metod-kopilka.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a cotton gauze dressing" class="if uuid-2497849" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2497849.jpg"></div><h2>  How to use </h2><p>  We figured out how to make a cotton-gauze bandage.  Now let's talk about how to use it correctly.  Make sure that the product is properly worn.  The bandage should cover the chin, nose and mouth.  Do not tie it tight, otherwise it will be difficult to breathe, however, it should sit tight enough.  The dressing needs to be replaced every 4 hours, otherwise bacteria or toxic substances will accumulate, that is, they will inevitably enter the body. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vseopomoschi.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="civil defense lesson" class="if uuid-2497861" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2497861.jpg"></div><p>  If you are in contact with the patient, then the bandage should be primarily on him, and optionally on you.  The product will also help people who suffer from severe allergies in the spring during the flowering period of trees and in June, when there is a lot of poplar fluff.  Especially dangerous are such allergens for asthma sufferers.  A gauze and cotton dressing is a salvation for such patients.  Take care of yourself in the cold season and be healthy! </p>
