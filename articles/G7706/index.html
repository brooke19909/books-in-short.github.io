    <p>  For guests there are restaurants and cafes, among which there is a classic beer institution, a lounge bar.  And the wellness center offers relaxing body and face treatments.  There is also a fitness center and a fifteen-meter indoor pool.  The hotel is no less attractive for business guests, as it has a conference room of a modern level, renovated in a modern style.  Due to the favorable location of the institution, you can get to some attractions from it in just five minutes.  Also within walking distance there are numerous shops, cafes, restaurants and bars. </p><p>  Despite the fact that this hotel in the center of Vienna is incredibly beautiful and good, staying in it is not as cloudless as it should be.  The hotel complex has its advantages and disadvantages.  According to tourists, the institution has an amazingly convenient location, excellent rooms.  As for the service, it is precisely it that sometimes fails.  So, for example, in a restaurant you can wait for an order for a long time or repeatedly ask for troubleshooting in the room.  In general, such moments are not particularly spoiled by the impression of such a wonderful establishment, but still it is not appropriate for a hotel of this level to allow such oversights in service. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Vienna Senator </h2><p>  Vienna Senator is a 4-star hotel in the center of Vienna.

    <p>  "Pension New Mark" just refers to such institutions.  It is located in an old building above a large supermarket.  St. Stephen's Cathedral and the famous Vienna Opera are within walking distance.  Cozy clean rooms and good staff of the establishment - all this will be offered by a hotel located in the heart of Vienna. </p><p>  City Rooms Hotel Vienna is another affordable hotel in the center of Vienna.  From the hotel the central town hall can be reached in just fifteen minutes by walking.  The hotel is located on an old street, away from the hustle and bustle, but at the same time within walking distance from key places.  The hotel has Russian-speaking staff, so there are no communication problems.  The only not very convenient moment is the fact that the hotel reception is only open until five in the evening, therefore, tourists recommend that you agree in advance with the receptionists who will tell you where and how to get the room keys if you plan a later settlement.  Otherwise, you run the risk of standing behind closed doors for a long time.  Otherwise, the hotel is good enough for a short stay. </p><p>  Another three-star hotel in Vienna's city center is the Van Vienna Staatsoper.  If you want to live near the opera, then you will surely like this institution.  In addition, next to the hotel is the famous shopping street - a favorite place for walking of all tourists.  The hotel offers beautiful new rooms with fresh renovation.  According to tourists, the complex is incredibly convenient because of its location.  In addition, breakfast is included in the price.  Of course, the set of dishes is not very diverse, but the meal is quite satisfying. </p><p>  ‚ÄúAustria Classic Hotel Vienna‚Äù is one of the three-star hotels in the city that is worth recommending to tourists.  It is located not quite in the center, but a little away, but next to the metro stop.  Two stops - and you are already on the main square of the capital.  The Prater Park and the Johann Strauss Museum are located next to the hotel.  The hotel is located in a building that is more than 250 years old in the historical district.  The number of rooms is not very new, but quite good for a short stay. </p><h2>  Hi-tech hotel </h2><p>  Vienna has a completely unusual high-tech hotel called Ruby Marie Vienna.  A three-star establishment is very different from the usual hotels for us.  The second such hotel (3 stars) in the center of Vienna is simply not to be found.  There is no reception desk and registrars, you are offered the possibility of electronic self-registration. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vienna City Center Hotels 3 stars" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2117979.jpg"></div>

    <p>  And you will receive all payment documents automatically by mail.  Hotel rooms are designed in a very unusual way.  So, for example, the washbasin is in the hallway, and the shower is more like a transparent cube.  In general, the entire hotel is decorated in high-tech style.  Some rooms have romantic terraces.  Even food in a hotel is served not in the usual way, but in basins.  The institution is more focused on youth.  Tourists strongly recommend visiting such an unusual hotel with beautiful interiors and modern equipment.  All visitors are completely delighted with living in such a place.  Moreover, the hotel is very conveniently located relative to the sights, which means you can walk around the city on foot. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Vienna is a magical and beautiful city with beautiful parks and stunning architecture.  The city is so beautiful that it is certainly worth seeing with your own eyes.  Once in the capital, you will love it forever, you will want to return to this amazing place more than once.  Choosing the right hotel for your trip, you can relax in the heart of Austria, and it does not matter what time of year you come here.  Vienna is always beautiful. </p>
