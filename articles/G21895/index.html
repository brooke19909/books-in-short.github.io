There are plenty of reasons.  For example, the first four of the above tourists come in large numbers to get acquainted with local attractions, but residents of the capital, especially on warm, warm days, adore Tsaritsyno Park (the metro station located here has the same name). </p><p>  We’ll talk about the last metro station in the capital today.  What is her story?  Does she have any unique features that make her unlike everyone else? </p><h2>  Section 1. Location Features </h2>

Nowadays, few people remember that this opening ceremony fell into the plots of New Year’s television shows.  Everything was festive and pathos.

    <p>  However, already on January 1, the station was temporarily suspended.  The fact is that in the segment “Tsaritsyno” - “Orekhovo” there was flooding, which had to be eliminated immediately.  On an early festive morning, the train driver noticed the tunnel wall cracking in front of him.  Fortunately, there were no victims, but the repair dragged on for almost a month.  Again the trains went on this section only on February 9th.  In general, it should be noted that various rumors are associated with a section of the metro line near Tsaritsyno station, since the number of emergencies in this area is much larger than others. </p><p>  The current name of the station was planned initially, at the design stage.  It simply could not be otherwise, because the cozy Tsaritsyno Park and the historically amazing museum of the same name are amazingly close by. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Nevertheless, since in the 80s of the past century, a huge residential area called Lenin-Dachnoe was rapidly developing nearby, the stations were given the name “Lenino”. </p><p>  The current name was given to the station on November 5, 1990. In the process of renaming, we decided to use some letters of the old inscription, and if you look closely, you will notice that the letters “I”, “H” and “O” located above the main entrance are slightly different from others. </p><h2>  Section 3.

    <p>  All this is observed thanks <span>to architectural monuments</span> located on the surface.  One of the attractions, which, incidentally, the station owes its present name, is the Tsaritsyno palace complex, which was laid down even under Empress Catherine II.  However, its construction was completed only at the beginning of the XIX century. </p><p>  In general, it should be noted that the park of the complex is located between Tsaritsyno and Orekhovo metro stations, but still the main, or, as it is called here, central, entrance is located just near the first. </p><p>  Muscovites and guests of the capital like to visit the famous arbor, which is called the "Golden Sheaf" or "Temple of Ceres."  By the way, in the revolutionary years it was half destroyed and restored only after a large-scale restoration. </p><p>  The alleys also had to be reconstructed.  After completing all the repairs, it was decided to install several sculptures in the park. </p><p>  The Tsaritsyno station is an unusual metro.  It can introduce everyone to the remnants of the distant past.  Although the ruins of the tower are the only partially preserved structures, they can be considered as quite original examples of park architecture of the complex. </p><p>  Behind the grape gates is a building that is decorated with double-headed imperial eagles.  This is the middle palace, still called the opera house.  By the way, in our days concerts are often held in it. </p><h2>  Section 4. Useful information and interesting facts. </h2>

The metro station Tsaritsyno is no exception.  Moscow, it seems, is doing everything possible and impossible so that the passenger gets to his destination with maximum comfort.

    <p>  For visitors, the building opens at 5:30 in the morning.  The work ends at 1 am. </p><p>  The station has mobile communications.  Operators MTS, Beeline and Megafon are supported. </p><p>  The entire Tsaritsyno area, in which the station of the same name is located, is located in <span>the geopathogenic</span> anomaly <span>zone</span> .  For unexplained reasons, it is precisely in this area that malfunctions are most often associated with power supply and flooding. </p><p>  According to some researchers, this is a geopathic zone of natural origin, and all the so-called mysterious events occur due to the movement of water flows through zones of discontinuous disturbances and once buried channels.  Employees of the complex of gardens and parks note that during working hours, being on the territory, they feel as if in another world. </p><h2>  Section 5. Development Prospects </h2><p>  In the passage behind the turnstiles there is a glass translucent door that leads to the currently inactive east exit.  Outside, a stepped descent is visible.  It is covered with an iron plate on top.  Information came from some sources that it was planned to organize a <span>bus stop there,</span> final for flights to Biryulyovo.  The project was later canceled, but there is a chance that they will return to this idea. </p>
