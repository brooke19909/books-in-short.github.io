At one time, he continued to preach Christianity, despite the fact that the Roman authorities forbade him to do this.  In the church you can feel the spirit of that time.  Here the sarcophagus is stored, in which the relics of the saint were originally located.  Later they were transported to another place.  There is a legend about this event.  It says that when the sarcophagus was printed, it was full of peace.  Since then, it is believed that he has miraculous power.  The city of Peace has become a holy place.  Pilgrims from all over the world come here to receive a blessing.  With the help of the sarcophagus, many religious attributes are sanctified, for example, crosses and icons.  This is a unique place.  It is both a Christian and a Muslim shrine.  In the church there have been many cases of miraculous healing of believers.  Most of the frescoes are well preserved.  Guests can take a close look at the altar and touch the sarcophagus.  A small market is located very close to the temple.  Here you can purchase various wood and silver products.  They are all consecrated. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="demre world kekova Price" class="if" height="269" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/477348.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Historical information </h2><p>  <span>St. Nicholas is</span> commonly known as Santa Claus.  He was born in Patara.  Nikolai was a preacher of the city of Mira.  Historical sources have preserved information that he showed extraordinary mercy in relation to the poor and children.  So the prototype of Santa Claus appeared.  Nicholas was considered the patron saint of children.  The central city square is named after this saint.  Here is a very funny monument.  The whole space is lit by the sun's rays, camels are resting nearby, and in the center of the square is Santa Claus, dressed in a fur coat. </p><h2>  Ancient greek cemetery </h2><p>  A visit to the necropolis is also included in the tour program for the cities of Demre, Mira, Kekova.  Photos taken during the trip will remind you of these amazing places.  The entrances to the cemetery are located in a huge rock.  They are decorated with columns.  The tombs of the poor are located at the very bottom.  At the foot of the cliff is an amphitheater.  It was built for the burial of wealthy masters.  In ancient times, it was believed that man continues to live in the afterlife.  He needs to have fun and have his own home.  On the first floor of the building the lord himself will settle, and on the second his servants will be housed.  Currently, work is underway to restore the amphitheater. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="excursion turkey demre world kekova" class="if" height="262" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/477349.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Tour end </h2><p>  After lunch, a trip to the cities of Demre, Mira, Kekova ends with a boat trip.  Guests will go to the bay above Simen.  It is a city that was also destroyed by an earthquake during the Lycian era.  The boat is equipped with a partially transparent bottom.  When the engines are turned off, the excursion participants will be able to see the Lycian sarcophagus in depth.  It represents the destroyed foundation of an ancient fortress.  The fortification was located on the Kekova Peninsula.  Here you can see the fragments of various utensils and ancient amphoras.  Water has an unusual color.  Through it, you can see the outlines of preserved houses and palaces, baths and other buildings.  Views of the <span>flooded city</span> can impress everyone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Demre Kekova on the map" class="if" height="280" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/477351.jpg" width="360"></div>

    <h2>  Additional Information </h2><p>  In the documentary "Odyssey," the unreal beauty of Kekova‚Äôs underwater world is sung.  The sunken city inspired journalists to create a television report about him.  The coast of the peninsula is replete with numerous fishing restaurants, which are always open for tourists.  Here you can enjoy fresh seafood dishes.  During the tour, guests will be asked to buy various icons with images of saints. </p><p>  Currently, more and more incompetent guides are working here.  They provide tour participants with false information.  The fact is that some copies do not quite correspond to the original icons.  It is not recommended to buy them if there is no confidence in the authenticity of the image. </p><p>  The tour "Demre-Mira-Kekova" (the map shows that these places are located close to each other) lasts only one day.  Departure from the hotel is carried out in the early morning, at about 5:00.  Often the bus leaves from the travel agency or hotel where the tour was ordered.  However, this information should be clarified with the operator in advance. </p>

    <p>  Most likely, guests will want to sleep on the road.  Therefore, it is worth purchasing a special inflatable pillow under your head.  The road ahead is quite long.  It takes about four hours to drive from Antalya.  It is better to stock up on <span>dry rations</span> at the hotel.  You must have a large bottle of water with you. </p><p>  Lunch, as a rule, is already included in the price of the tour.  It includes a meat dish and a vegetable side dish.  Drinks are provided for a fee.  Moreover, their cost is quite high.  For a half-liter bottle of water you will have to pay about two dollars.  There are also higher rates. </p><p>  The places that tourists will get to know for excursions are incredibly picturesque.  Many will probably want to capture them.  It is recommended that you take a camera or camcorder with care.  All the trip participants will be accompanied by the scorching Turkish sun.  Tourists will have the opportunity to swim in the sea during a long journey.  For this reason, it is recommended to take a bathing suit on a trip. </p>
