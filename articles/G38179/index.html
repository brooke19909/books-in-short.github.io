Want to give them a second chance?  If, once again, sorting through the bins, you again begin to doubt whether it is worth leaving them or better to get rid of them, reject doubts and pay attention to the ideas of remaking things with your own hands.  Now it will be easier for you to decide what exactly needs to be thrown away, and what else you can give a second life.  We will consider the options for remaking old things with our own hands, creative ideas and ways of creating unusual objects in this article. </p><h2>  Designer furniture from old t-shirts </h2><p>  What materials do not create furniture from!  Crates, pallets, old refrigerators are used.  But German designer Tobias Dzuretsek decided to create furniture from simple worn clothes.  He processes old T-shirts with resin and makes chairs and armchairs from ‚Äúthings with history‚Äù.  Each chair is made of 13 kilograms of clothing, which is impregnated with resin, and then pressed into a mold, resulting in its final appearance.  The designer plays on the element of nostalgia, collecting clothes from friends, from second-hand clothes and even from his own wardrobe. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tobiasjuretzek.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY remodeling creative ideas" class="if uuid-2825450" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/2825450.jpg"></div><p>  That which often lies forgotten in cabinets and boxes for a long time now comes to light again.  Worn out clothing, still preserved for emotional reasons, turns into a special message from the past.  As a kind of message in a bottle, the furniture contains memory and feelings, reviving them for life stories.  Even if such an idea seems too complicated for you, creating and transforming old furniture with worn T-shirts and dresses is one of the common ideas for remaking things with your own hands. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.tobiasjuretzek.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY remodeling things" class="if uuid-2825451" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/2825451.jpg"></div><h2>  How to decorate an old chair </h2><p>  An old chair with peeling paint or simply battered with life can be used again as an interior decoration if you work on it a little.  You can see the idea for remaking things with your own hands in the photo below.  Repair stool if necessary.  Then the old furniture needs to be sanded, removing the paint, if any.  Make a paint of the color you like and a t-shirt to match.  In addition, you will need a synthetic winterizer to create a soft substrate, and furniture nails or a special industrial stapler. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.buzzfeed.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY do-it-yourself things" class="if uuid-2825447" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/2825447.jpg"></div><p>  From the same t-shirt that you take for decoration, you can make additional decor in the form of roses and place it around the perimeter of the seat.  Paint the chair first, except for the top.  Then, using ordinary scissors, cut a circle from the synthetic winterizer a little more than the seat itself - about 10 cm. So it will be more convenient for you to attach it.  After that, cut out a larger circle from the old thing.  Put the padding pad on the seat, cover with a cloth and pull it on.  Now you need to fix the material with nails or a furniture stapler.  Additionally, we create decor from the remains of the material.  To do this, cut off long strips of fabric, twist the bundles out of them, and then fold them with roses, just folding the strips in a spiral.  To fix the decorative elements, glue may be necessary, since they are quite voluminous and can turn around.  It is more convenient to use a glue gun.  Just work with it carefully - this tool heats up quickly. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Remaking old things with your own hands </h2><p>  Acrylic paint and brushes, sandpaper and a little imagination - all that is needed for the second life of antique chests of drawers, tables and drawers.  Antique furniture is durable and made of natural wood.  Therefore, most often it is environmentally friendly and able to serve for a long time with proper care and a caring attitude of the owners.  If your house has such furniture, but you do not want to give it to the restorer for some reason, try to give it a second life yourself.  Before remaking old things for the house with their own hands, it is advisable to take them out into the fresh air. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself knitwear" class="if uuid-2825439" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/2825439.jpg"></div><h2>  Tools for processing old furniture </h2><p>  Since a lot of dust forms during the removal of old paint, it can negatively affect the respiratory system and cause the disease.  For large furniture, it will be difficult to do with one emery paper, you will need special tools that will facilitate the process of removing old varnish and paint.  Buying a special grinder may not be justified for a small chair or drawer, but for large pieces of furniture it will become an indispensable tool.  Sometimes a grinder with special interchangeable nozzles is used, but it can damage the structure of the tree.  Before cabinets and drawers, you will have to unscrew the handles before processing with an emery or machine.  Sometimes loops are also removed to make it more convenient to work.  It is necessary to observe safety rules when protecting eyes, respiratory organs and hands with special protective glasses, gloves and a mask. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself remake of second-hand things" class="if uuid-2825443" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/2825443.jpg"></div><h2>  Wood coloring process </h2><p>  It is undesirable to use various chemicals to remove the varnish, especially indoors.  This can lead to poisoning, and an unpleasant odor will last for a long time and cause uncomfortable sensations.  The mechanical method is quite laborious, but the most effective, as it helps to further level the surface for painting.  When you coped with this task, decided on a color scheme and acquired paints of the desired shades, proceed to apply them to the surface.  Often before painting the surface is primed so that the coating adheres better.  It also allows you to further level the surface. </p><p>  Use brushes of the appropriate size to get to hard-to-reach spots and paint over all corners.  Specific ideas for remaking old things with your own hands, for example, only chests of drawers or cabinets, can be found in this article.  Then the surface is thoroughly dried.  You can use a spray paint, but then it is better to varnish the surface, as it quickly erases and can burn out.  Do not check whether the paint has dried by touching the furniture - fingerprints may remain on it.  It is best to use the instructions for the paint, in which should be written the time for which the surface dries.  Now it remains only to return the handles to place or attach the doors, and the updated piece of furniture will delight for a long time with its unusual and attractive appearance. </p><h2>  Using decoupage to decorate furniture </h2><p>  One of the most popular and creative ideas for remaking old things with your own hands is decoupage.  It consists in decorating surfaces with thin paper using PVA glue or special mixtures for decoupage.  The so-called craquelure is very common - artificial aging of the surface.  For decoupage, the usual three-layer napkins are most often used.  The top layer with a pattern is removed from them, a motif is cut out of it, and then glued to the surface.  The surface must be cleaned and primed before applying the drawing; usually, white acrylic paint is used for this. </p><p>  For products like whiteboards, this procedure is repeated several times until the wood becomes perfectly flat.  Ornaments may be different.  Vegetable is especially popular, but it all depends on the imagination of the author.  Napkins are sometimes replaced with special thin paper, which is easily torn.  Therefore, you need to smooth the folds very carefully.  If wrinkles appear, they are treated with sandpaper, and before the final coating, an image is drawn to hide the flaws.  Then the surface is dried and protected, varnishing it in several layers.  Often, yacht varnish is used for this purpose, which is resistant to damage.  Furniture decorated using decoupage technique is often used in Provence style interiors and looks like an antique thing. </p><h2>  DIY alteration of knitwear </h2><p>  The items that take up the most space are usually in the wardrobe.  There you can find many old T-shirts and jeans, which are stored just in case.  Some of them are already completely unfit to wear, but for some reason they continue to take their place.  One of the popular ways to remake knitted things with your own hands is to create floor mats.  Such products are often sold in hardware stores and are popular due to their unpretentiousness in care and attractive appearance.  Some people buy second-hand items specially for such a do-it-yourself remake.  This is a fairly economical and quick way to create a beautiful and practical thing from almost nothing.  Rugs can be created in many ways.  One of them is suitable for those who know how to crochet. </p><h2>  Crochet T-Mats </h2><p>  For this idea of ‚Äã‚Äãremaking things with your own hands, you will need directly unnecessary knitted t-shirts.  Many needlewomen use knitted yarn for their products.  But it is quite expensive and most often used for knitting bags and toys.  You can make such yarn yourself if you collect a sufficient number of t-shirts of the same color.  In another case, if things are colorful, you can create an unusual designer thing by picking a pattern for knitting.  Usually, the craftswomen simply cut all the old T-shirts found into equal strips, tying or stitching them together.  An important note - clothes should be clean.  Knit along the seam.  If you move in a circle, then the edges of the resulting strips will be tiled and ruin the appearance of the rug.  Of course, you can use not only t-shirts, but also other knitwear.  But t-shirts are usually the same density, because the product is smooth.  Depending on this indicator, strips are also cut.  For a denser fabric, 1.5 cm wide is usually sufficient.  The united strips are wound into balls to make it more convenient to work. </p><p>  For crocheting, the following pattern is used.  First, several air loops are typed, usually 5. Then they need to be looped using a connecting column.  The next row is needed for tying single crochet columns.  It will take about 8 columns.  On each loop of this row you will need to knit 2 SC.  Then again, from one loop, you need to knit 2 single crochet, and on the next ordinary crochet.  There they knit in a circle, alternating loops with one and two columns.  On the next row, you need to increase the number of regular columns between double.  Thus, the mat will begin to expand.  This option is suitable for remaking things with your own hands in the style of boho.  You can crochet from knitted yarn unusual bright bags, clutches and other accessories. </p><h2>  Weaving floor mats </h2><p>  Not everyone knows how to crochet, so other methods can be used to create unusual rugs.  One of the ideas for remaking things with your own hands is creating a knitted fabric on the frame.  This is an ancient method of carpet weaving, in which strips of fabric or thread are stretched vertically on a wooden frame at an equal distance from each other.  Then their ends are tied, and weaving begins.  To do this, take the same strips of matter and thread them first under the first vertical strip, and then over the next. </p><p>  Continuing to alternate steps so, they reach the end of the canvas, after which they take a new strip of fabric and weave it between the vertical ones.  When the frame area is completely full, the mat is ready.  Some needlewomen use a regular gymnastic hoop instead of a wooden fixture.  The strips of fabric are fixed in diameter, intersecting in the center.  The only inconvenience is that they only weave rugs of a round shape.  Instead of knitted yarn, satin ribbons, threads and other materials are used. </p><h2>  Floor mats for embroidery </h2><p>  For weaving carpets from wool, you can purchase a special large canvas.  Suitable for this and the usual building grid, which is used for painting.  From the grid, you can cut out any necessary shape for the rug.  Such creative ideas for remaking old things with your own hands are in demand, as the resulting rugs are indistinguishable from purchased ones and look very impressive.  In this case, the strips of fabric into which to cut t-shirts and other unnecessary clothes should be small.  They are threaded through holes in the grid, fixed there, and as a result will be the pile of the carpet. </p><p>  There are sets for embroidery carpets, which include special hooks.  With the help of them, it is convenient to tie knots, fixing the pile on the grid.  But you can do without such a device, if you act carefully and make nodules of the same density, as well as monitor the height of the pile, aligning the strips of fabric in height.  It‚Äôs easy to take care of finished t-shirt rugs - you can even wash them in the washing machine, like regular clothes.  But it‚Äôs best to use delicate mode.  But you need to dry homespun products on a horizontal surface so that they do not stretch. </p><h2>  How to remake clothes if it is small or large </h2><p>  The problem with volume changes is familiar to every woman.  Often, good things remain in the wardrobe, waiting for those times when the mistress will fit.  But there is a way to give skirts, trousers and blouses a second life.  Remaking old things with your own hands for the full usually consists of adding inserts on the sides or in the center.  To do this, the clothes are opened at the seam or cut in half.  The inserts are usually made of contrasting materials or fabric with an unusual texture.  For example, a regular T-shirt can be transformed by cutting it in half and making a lace insert in the center.  Too short a blouse can be easily extended if you select a fabric with a beautiful print and add it to the central part or make flounces below.  Remaking knitted things into fashionable ones with their own hands seems a little more complicated, but in fact they often use a similar method for them, combining parts of different products.  The main thing when working with them is to ensure that the loops do not open. </p><p>  After losing weight, the opposite situation arises.  Things are getting too big.  Do-it-yourself conversion of knitted things into fashionable ones can happen exactly the same as in the previous case, only by making inserts, they will need to be reduced.  But another option is to cut off the excess.  For example, a full-length dress can be sewn from a wide long skirt.  You can create various decorative elements from shreds, for example flowers, and decorate your new clothes with them.  Combining several different dresses into one, you can create unusual designer things in the style of boho.  It will not only save your finances.  Recycling old things, you take care of nature, as you reduce the percentage of environmental pollution. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dnainfo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY do-it-yourself boho styling" class="if uuid-2825445" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/2825445.jpg"></div><h2>  How to remake children's things </h2><p>  Children's things become small very quickly, and many parents try to get rid of them.  But not always there is a familiar kid, which they fit.  Therefore, the ideas of remaking children's things with their own hands are always relevant.  Blouses that have become short can be lengthened by sewing on a flounce skirt.  Children's body is often turned into shirts or dresses, cutting off the lower part and adding decorative elements.  The ideas of remaking children's things with their own hands, like clothing for adults, are not limited to adding or decreasing material.  Sometimes, for example, if a stain appears on a good shirt or pants, you can simply add a decorative element that will hide the defect underneath.  Another option is to dye the fabric in a different color or create a designer print and transfer it to the material using special paints on the fabric. </p><h2>  What to do with old jeans </h2><p>  DIY remodeling is a very popular type of hobby.  Denim is very durable, it can be reused for things that should not wear out quickly.  The most popular option is bags and backpacks.  Schemes for them can be copied from your favorite bags.  But denim is so practical and attractive that it is not only suitable for remaking clothes and creating accessories.  It can be useful for creating jewelry and making unusual interior details.  For example, it draws up dressers and stationery stands, makes flower pots, dog beds and even rugs.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Denim is used to create various crafts that can be used as jewelry or as a present to a loved one. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Interior toys, panels in patchwork technique look elegant and stylish. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But not everyone can create such gizmos.</font></font></p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dnainfo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself old things remodeling" class="if uuid-2825446" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/2825446.jpg"></div><p>       ‚Äî  .       .     .      ,     . ,   ,     ,    .      .         ,    ,  ,        .         .     ,          .            . </p>
