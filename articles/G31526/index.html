Chinese coins are distinguished by their round shape, in the center of which is a square hole.  The circle represents the sky, and the square represents the earth.  When such coins are in use, they form a triad of luck from three components: heaven – man – earth.  On each of them there is a Yang side, which can be distinguished by four Chinese characters, and Yin with two characters.  Numismatists and simply curious people can find a catalog of Chinese coins on the net and examine them in more detail.

This explains the fact that Chinese coins have become powerful symbols of prosperity, endless happiness and wealth.  They are also often used as a powerful amulet to protect against evil forces.  Original Chinese coins are very rare, and it is very difficult to get them, and therefore in practice Feng Shui mainly use duplicated samples. </p><p>  <strong>How to use Chinese coins</strong> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="catalog of chinese coins" class="if" height="279" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7400/149804.jpg" width="539"></div>

    <p>  To attract money to their business, they should be located in those places that are designed to make a profit.  For example, if you are working at a computer, hang one or more connected coins on it or simply put a coin in the pocket of your wallet.  Sometimes they are walled up in the foundation of a new building, thereby laying in advance thereby the financial prosperity of the owners.  There is one important point here - when hanging coins in the house, the rule should be observed - the yang side should be pointing up, and the yin side should be pointing down.  As an amulet, Chinese coins are often hung over the front door or placed under a rug.  To enhance the effect, quite often they tie several pieces with a red thread.  And in this case, there is also a nuance - depending on the quantity, there will be one or another result.  So, two coins are a symbol of accumulation of funds, and therefore they are often used by businessmen and business people.  They are also used to <span>harmonize relations</span> between spouses - in this case, the coins are placed under the pillow.  Three - the unity of heaven, earth and man, as well as three sources of income: earned money, unexpected wealth and profit from outside. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="antique chinese coins" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7400/149803.jpg" width="438"></div>  Connecting four or seven is not worth it - such an amulet absolutely will not bring any benefit.  For trading use 5 pieces, for heavenly luck, helpers and mentors - 6. A bunch of 8 Chinese coins is designed to cause an influx of wealth from almost all possible sources.  Sometimes a ninth coin is included in such an amulet in order for cash flows to accumulate in the center.  Experts say that it is best to use the Qin dynasty banknotes - they are considered the most powerful.  Pick your number and put the Chinese coins in the most suitable place according to the recommendations of Feng Shui.  There cash flows can always find you.
