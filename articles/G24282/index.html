Which baby monitor is better - all the advantages and disadvantages</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  After the birth of a child, family life makes a sharp turn, parents now have old responsibilities, and new ones are added to them.  Do not be afraid that at first it will be difficult.  However, all these hardships instantly break into the smile of a new family member, filling the house with joyful expectations, happy laughter, first hugs and words. </p><p>  Nowadays, progress helps parents a lot, numerous “assistant” devices are born.  One such device is a baby monitor.  Customer reviews indicate that this device provides significant assistance in <span>caring for the baby,</span> ensuring its safety.  At the same time, parents have a little free time that they can spend at their discretion. </p><h2>  What is it for? </h2><p>  Comparing the current time with the period of the seventies and nineties, we see that modern mothers have a much larger number of “helpers”.  The baby in the first years of life requires constant attention to himself.  However, Mom's usual duties, such as timely cleaning, ironing, cooking, do not go anywhere.  Of course, many household chores today are much simpler to perform, for example, washing in an automatic machine is a much less time-consuming process compared to manual washing. </p>

    <p>  We must not forget that the modern young mother is, first of all, a woman.  And she needs to devote some time to herself: “clean the feathers”, soak in the bath, watch her favorite TV show and, finally, just relax.  However, how to do this, because the baby can not be left alone even for a few minutes? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Many babies often arrange a “check” for their parents: they burst into tears - the mother responded, after which they continue to sleep or play.  It happens that the poor mother does not have enough time even to normally visit the bathroom.  In these cases, a home “lifesaver” - a baby monitor, will come to the rescue.  User reviews confirm that this device greatly facilitates the process of looking after your favorite child. </p><h2>  How it works? </h2><p>  The principle of operation of this device is somewhat reminiscent of a walkie-talkie: one of the tubes is constantly near the child, the second is near you, so even at a considerable distance you can hear your baby.  Give parents the ability to control the situation - for this device is the main function.  The baby monitor in such cases is a kind of "lifesaver." </p>

    <p>  Of course, all this gives mothers peace of mind.  Imagine an ordinary situation: the child fell asleep, but you need to cook dinner.  You have to constantly listen, the baby is sleeping or waking up, constantly running to check the child.  To cope with the situation is much easier when there is a baby monitor in the house.  User reviews confirm this.  Mom calmly cooks or goes about her business while the beloved baby is sleeping, and when he wakes up, this will allow the baby monitor to be heard, and one of <span>the family members will</span> hurry to the baby. </p><h2>  Key features of the baby monitor </h2><p>  Before deciding on this important purchase for the family, you should find out some characteristics of this product.  This will help make the right choice.  There are several such positions: </p><p>  - radius of action; </p><p>  - source of power; </p><p>  - operating principle; </p><p>  - <span>type of communication</span> (two-way or one-way); </p><p>  - number of blocks; </p><p>  - notification system; </p><p>  - additional functions. </p><h2>  Source of power </h2><p>  Baby monitors can be powered by batteries or accumulators, as well as by mains.  The latter is not very convenient, as there is a constant attachment to the outlet.  Batteries are a cheap, affordable option, but often they run out when it is not possible to purchase a replacement.  The best option is batteries.  Although they will cost (along with charging) a little more expensive, but later you will save on the purchase of fresh batteries. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Range radius </h2><p>  By radius of action is meant that maximum distance at which the baby monitor can work.  Customer reviews say that the walls of an apartment or house are a serious obstacle to the radio signal.  When buying such a device in an ordinary apartment, focus on a range of 30-50 m. If you have a private house, you should look at models of greater power.  This will allow you not only to be in the house at a time when the baby is asleep, but also to go about his business in the garden or in the yard. </p><h2>  Operating principle </h2><p>  Which baby monitor is better?  Customer reviews vary.  Depending on the principle of operation, baby monitors are available in analog and digital versions.  The former work better in open spaces, because a significant drawback of such devices is their poor immunity to interference.  It happens that two analog devices are simultaneously working in neighboring rooms.  Sometimes the signal of one is intercepted by a “stranger”, and the mother hears the <span>crying of the</span> neighbors' <span>child</span> .  In this case, it is recommended to purchase an analog baby monitor with several channels, allowing you to select the optimal frequency. </p>

    <p>  If you are thinking of purchasing a digital device, such problems will not arise - these devices are protected from listening and interference.  The digital baby monitor, which works in interactive mode, practically does not distort the voice, allowing the baby to hear you as if you are in close proximity. </p><h2>  Type of communication </h2><p>  There are one-way baby monitors with an intercom system.  In the first version, you can hear your baby, but he is not you.  If there is feedback in your device, you can get rid of excessive running around to the child.  Many babies, having heard their mother upon incomplete awakening, continue to sleep peacefully further.  And if they don’t hear their mother’s voice, they get nervous and finally wake up.  Such a two-way system will be especially relevant in many cases, for example, when you are in the shower.  Models of many brands are equipped with similar functions.  For example, Motorola MBP-16 has a two-way communication. </p><h2>  Number of blocks </h2><p>  You can purchase a baby monitor with two blocks - for mom and baby.  However, it’s joyful to say: “What a good baby monitor!”  - You can, if the family will have three or more “adult” blocks, for example, for dad and grandmother.  In this case, loved ones will always be able to replace mom, who was too busy. </p><h2>  Notification system </h2><p>  It can be in the form of an audio or visual (light) signal.  Many baby monitors are equipped with a vibration signal.  This is especially convenient if you want to take a nap or other family members, such as a second child, are resting nearby. </p><h2>  Which is better - baby monitor or baby monitor? </h2><p>  Many are confused by the significant price difference between these devices.  However, if you consider it important not only to hear, but also to see, despite the distance, what your child is doing, it is worth looking for a suitable video model for the cost.  Moreover, progress does not stand still - production is getting better, goods are getting cheaper.  And now a baby monitor is being put up on store shelves, the price of which is much lower than a year or two ago.  So, today you can find a device whose cost is slightly more than 1,500 rubles.  This means that video nannies will gradually begin to fall in price. </p>

    <p>  You can not only control your child, but also replenish your home video library with interesting videos from the life of the baby.  Moreover, they will be removed absolutely imperceptibly for him, so to speak, in “natural conditions”.  Many parents acquire not one, but several cameras for these purposes, placing them in such a way as to obtain a multifaceted image. </p><p>  If necessary, the baby monitor can turn off the sound, leaving only the image.  If necessary, you can, on the contrary, remove the picture, leaving a sound.  If the children's room is quiet, the device will be in standby mode.  When any sounds appear, the camera automatically turns on, starting to broadcast the image and the sound itself to the parent unit. </p><h2>  Additional functions </h2><p>  Do not forget about some useful little things that will help you easier care for your beloved child.  Many manufacturers equip baby monitors with additional features. </p><ol><li>  The night light, which turns on with the sounds made by the child, and turns off if the baby is quiet. </li><li>  <span>A music box</span> that turns on from any voice of the child.  Often the baby becomes silent when he heard the sounds of nature, which means that mom does not need to rush to the nursery. </li><li>  Night projector, which projects various interesting images on the ceiling to the child. </li><li>  A thermometer that allows you to monitor the temperature in the children's room. </li><li>  Clock, alarm clock, timer. </li></ol>
