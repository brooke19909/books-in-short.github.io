This can happen with table lamps, chandeliers and floor lamps.  But to buy new ones is to allocate substantial funds from the family budget.  At this event, you can easily save money if you make a new lampshade with your own hands.  For these purposes anything can come in handy.  And how to do this, we will analyze further in the article. </p><h2>  Updating the old </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY fabric lampshade" class="if uuid-2403614" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2403614.jpg"></div><p>  Let's say that you have a lamp with a lampshade, but it does not quite fit the interior.  This problem can be solved by cutting off the fabric or wallpaper that was used during the repair. </p><p>  In order to make a <span>lampshade for the lamp</span> with your own hands, measure the old product and cut out the necessary piece of new decorative material for it.  After that, just stick it to the old lampshade.  This can be done in minutes, but the effect will exceed all expectations.  The main thing is to do all the work carefully so that unnecessary creases and traces of glue do not appear. </p><h2>  To the room for travel lovers </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself lampshade from the card" class="if uuid-2403649" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2403649.jpg"></div><p>  A person who likes to travel to different cities and countries will always find a couple of old tourist maps.  They can be used in room decor.  To do this, creating a <span>lampshade for a table lamp with your own hands is</span> perfect <span>.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The process will be the same as in the previous case.  You need to cut the card to the size of the lampshade and stick it.  But you can do a little creativity.  Cut several cards into pieces and make an application of them.  This will create not only an original detail of the interior, but also become a good reminder of the days when you were happy in a particular city. </p><h2>  Waste tinsel in the house </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do it yourself lampshade" class="if uuid-2403602" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2403602.jpg"></div><p>  In the sewing box of each housewife there is always a handful of unnecessary buttons that lie in reserve in case of "what if it comes in handy."  And this moment just came. </p><p>  Take hot melt glue and all your buttons and start creating.  It is necessary to glue them to the lampshade randomly in order to give the impression of slight negligence, as if they were scattered on its surface and so remained hanging for many years. </p><p>  If you are a perfectionist, then you can do differently.  Come up with some kind of pattern in advance and follow it in the lamp update.  It also looks pretty stylish and unusual.  Such a lampshade, made with your own hands, will definitely give you a lot of positive emotions. </p><p>  There is one more option how to use buttons.  From them you can create a picture.  The most obvious option is the flowers.  From round multi-colored elements of different diameters it will be easy to catch a flowering meadow.  And if you want to further diversify the picture, you can lay out any shapes on it: animals, clouds and the sun, river, trees, fruits.  If the drawing requires it, make additional elements with acrylic paints: they do not fade from light and do not flow from wet cleaning. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  For creative people </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY lampshade made of pencils" class="if uuid-2403595" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2403595.jpg"></div><p>  If creativity is the second Self for you, then express it in your interior.  For example, take long pencils and glue them to the lampshade of a table lamp.  But in this case, you need to consider several nuances: </p><ol><li>  If you glue sharpened pencils, there is always a small chance of getting hurt about them.  Therefore, consider this, especially if the house has small children. </li><li>  Such a lampshade will poorly transmit light, which means that it can be used exclusively for additional lighting.  Turning it on to read a book is not worth it, since there is a high probability of a lot of eye strain. </li><li>  Pencils need to be arranged depending on the artistic idea.  This may be a random sequence or repetition of the color spectrum of the rays of daylight. </li></ol><p>  Now you already know how to make a lampshade with your own hands, but these are not all options.  We continue. </p><h2>  For winter evenings </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY lampshade from an old sweater" class="if uuid-2403619" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2403619.jpg"></div><p>  You should have a knitted sweater in your closet that has already lost its appearance and you don‚Äôt wear it.  So why not "warm" them with an old lamp.  Select the desired part on it and cut it according to the size of the lampshade.  Free edges need to be sewn. </p><p>  Now we take the hot glue and glue the "new clothes" on the old lampshade.  The edges must be tucked and glued on the back.  If a piece with an elastic band is used for work, then one of the edges can be left without turning.  In the same style you can make a vase, which next to the lamp will be a winter bouquet. </p><p>  If you don‚Äôt have a suitable sweater, but you can knit and find yarn leftovers, you can easily make the necessary ‚Äúcover‚Äù yourself to update this interior detail.  You can also create your own lampshade for a floor lamp. </p><h2>  Forest mood </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself lampshade" class="if uuid-2403659" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2403659.jpg"></div><p>  This idea will appeal to those who seek to use as much natural materials as possible in their home.  It is better to decorate a lamp with a frame under the lampshade in this way, but it is better to remove the old cover.  So you get interesting shadows on the walls and furniture. </p><p>  When going to a forest or park, measure the length between the upper and lower rings of the frame in advance.  This will allow you to prepare the desired number of sticks of the required length.  Their diameter may be slightly different, as well as the length is not ideal.  You will only benefit from this in a decorative effect. </p><p>  When all the material has been prepared, take a hot glue and start laying sticks on the frame.  Make sure that you do not have any kind of system, because any symmetry is tiring.  In this way, you can make a lampshade for a table lamp with your own hands in 30-40 minutes, except for the time to search for material.  But you didn‚Äôt go to the park on purpose, but simply got out for a walk and simultaneously prepared the necessary sticks. </p><p>  If at the end of the work you still have materials left, make an interesting vase out of them.  You can take any cylinder as a template.  Cut them into small pieces and lay out in a circle in a checkerboard pattern or with a slight offset.  In such a vase, fresh flowers will live for a couple of minutes, but a winter composition or an artificial bouquet, for example, of autumn leaves, will stand for a rather long time.  If you want water to stay in the product, then paste a regular vase over with sticks. </p><h2>  Putting napkins in motion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself lampshade from napkins" class="if uuid-2403647" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2403647.jpg"></div><p>  This is a rather original and unusual idea for those who have a lot of grandmother's crocheted napkins at home or craftswomen who can make them.  For work, we need just a few of these products.  And the more different they are, the more interesting the final result will be. </p><p>  Dilute the PVA glue with a small amount of water and dip our napkins into it, they should be well saturated with the composition.  Then inflate a large balloon and lightly grease it with vegetable oil or petroleum jelly.  It will act as the basis for the lampshade, so napkins should not stick to it. </p><p>  Now lay out our decorative elements on the ball.  The order is determined by yourself.  The main thing here is that they lie one on one.  This will add the construction of the fortress.  When the work is finished, leave it for a day in a warm, dry place.  She should grab and take the shape of a ball. </p><p>  At the last stage, you need to remove the workpiece from the base.  Some workshops recommend immediately breaking the ball.  But this is not worth doing, as the fabric could still adhere to it in some places.  If the ball is blown off sharply, the product may become deformed.  To get started, go over the entire plane of the glued surface and, with simple indentations, check how securely the napkins grasped the ball.  If this happened somewhere, then first tear off the fabric from the rubber with the same pressure.  Now gently blow the air out of the ball and you will see how you managed to create the lampshade with your own hands.  You can hang it instead of a chandelier in your room. </p><h2>  Plastic bottle light </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY lampshade from bottles" class="if uuid-2403656" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2403656.jpg"></div><p>  You have noticed that the bottom of a bottle of sweet water or mineral water resembles a flower.  From these elements you can create beautiful decorative elements.  Cut the bottoms out of the bottles and fasten them together.  For these purposes, it is better to use a stapler, since hot melt adhesive does not always reliably grasp plastic. </p><p>  You should get a ball-like design.  Do not forget to leave a small hole in it so that you can put on the lamp this work of art.  But remember that the light bulb for such a do-it-yourself lampshade for a table lamp needs to choose the one that does not heat up.  Otherwise, the structure will melt, and the likelihood of a fire will rise significantly. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Now you know how to create a lampshade with your own hands.  These are far from all methods.  You can come up with something of your own by reading this material.  But always remember that the lamp can be a source of additional heat.  And so that there is no fire in the house, always follow safety rules and keep prudence even in the implementation of the most unusual ideas. </p>
