The main attraction of the city is the Trinity-Sergius Lavra - the most status monastery of the Russian Federation.  The proximity of the city to Moscow allows residents and guests of the capital to visit it in one day.  Today we will talk about the history and main attractions of Zagorsk. </p><h2>  Foundation of the city </h2><p>  The history of Zagorsk begins back in 1337, when Sergius (then Bartholomew) of Radonezh, together with his brother Stefan settled on a hill, where the largest monastery in Russia will later operate.  In 1340, a wooden church was built here.  Soon, Stefan went to Moscow, and the monks began to populate the hill.  1335 is considered the year of adoption of the charter of the monastery.  Mitrofan became hegumen, who tonsured Sergius as a monk and bequeathed his dignity to him. </p><p>  The monastery was rapidly expanding and increasing its influence.  Even during the life of Sergius, and he died in 1392, this monastery became the main one in Russia.  In 1380, Dmitry Donskoy came to Sergius for a blessing, who was to fight the Tatars.  In 1408, as a result of the Tatar raid, the monastery was burned.  This did not affect the high status of the monastery, and soon it was restored. </p>

    <p>  In the period from the XV to the XVII century, this place was a major cultural and political center of Russia.  Chronicles were written here and iconography was taught.  The largest painters of that time - Daniil Cherny and Andrei Rublev - came to the monastery to paint the new Trinity Cathedral.  The Moscow princes visited the Lavra with enviable constancy and sponsored it.  In 1442, during the internecine wars, it was in this monastery that Vasily the Dark reconciled with Dmitry Shemyaka.  In 1530, Ivan the Terrible was baptized in the Lavra.  By that time, the monastery owned quite a lot of land throughout the state.  In the period from 1608 to 1610, the Lavra was under siege by the Polish army of Alexander Lisovsky and Jan Sapieha.  Soon a terrible epidemic came to the monastery, killing about two thousand people.  Then, not only monks lived here, but also peasants from nearby villages.  Despite all the hardships, the Poles failed to conquer the monastery.  After the restoration of the monastery from the siege, it acquired the appearance in which it has survived to the present time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the eighteenth century, due to the policy of subordinating the church to the emperor and transferring the capital to St. Petersburg, the importance of the monastery in the spiritual life of Russia somewhat decreased.  Despite this, in 1742 a seminary began to operate in the monastery, and two years later the monastery received the status of Lavra.  The Moscow Metropolitan was appointed its head.  The monastery was one of the largest landowners of the empire and owned about a hundred thousand serfs. </p><p>  In addition to agricultural activities, trade flourished on the territory of the Lavra.  In 1814, the <span>Moscow Theological Academy</span> was transferred here <span>.</span>  By that time, the monastery was already one of the largest pilgrimage centers in the country.  Around it formed a large settlement called Sergiev Posad.  In 1919 it was renamed Sergiev and endowed with the status of a city. </p><h2>  Sergiev Posad in the 20th century </h2><p>  In 1919, the Lavra, as well as other monasteries in Russia, was closed, and the Theological Academy was dissolved.  The following year, a historical and architectural museum began to operate in the monastery.  Thanks to him, in the Soviet years, the monastery was practically not affected.  The main loss for the monastery was the remelting of the main number of bells. </p><p>  In 1930, Sergiev was renamed Zagorsk, in honor of the Bolshevik Zagorsky.  The city bore this name until 1991, until the old name was returned to it.  The people still call this settlement in different ways.  In the 1940s, the scientific restoration of the Lavra began, which lasted until the 1980s.  As a result, part of the buildings was reconstructed, and another part was rebuilt.  Moreover, already in 1946, the monastery was again opened to all comers.  In the same year, the residence of the patriarch was moved here.  Until the early 2000s, the monastery coexisted with the museum. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  During the Soviet era, large industrial enterprises began to be built in Zagorsk.  Fortunately, railway (1862) and an automobile road (1845) to the capital had already been made.  So, in 1934, the Zagorsk Optical and Mechanical Plant (ZOMZ) began its activities.  An enterprise engaged in the development and manufacture of optical-mechanical as well as optical-electronic devices is still operating.  In 1938, the Zagorsk Electromechanical Plant Zvezda appeared.  This enterprise manufactured a wide range of products, including for the defense industry.  Like <span>ZOMZ (Zagorsk Optical and Mechanical Plant),</span> it is still afloat. </p><p>  In 1993, the patriarch‚Äôs residence was transferred to the Danilov Monastery in Moscow, and the Trinity-Sergius Lavra was included in the UNESCO heritage list. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Of course, the main attraction of the city of Zagorsk in the Moscow region is the Lavra, to which pilgrims come from all over the world.  Churches in the city are located everywhere, and even outside the monastery.  So, the Chernigov monastery is located 3 kilometers from the Lavra.  In addition, in Zagorsk there are many interesting museums that are not dedicated to church subjects.  Now let's talk more about this and much more.  Let's start with the sights of the monastery, thanks to which the city appeared. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius </h2><p>  Lavra is located right in the city center.  This is the largest monastery in Russia, which played a significant role in the history of the state.  In Russia, only two monasteries have the status of Lavra, and this is one of them.  Entrance to the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius is free.  For tourists, it is open throughout the daylight hours. </p><h2>  Assumption Cathedral </h2><p>  The largest and most visible building of the Lavra is the Assumption Cathedral, which is located in the central part of the monastery.  It was built in the period from 1559 to 1585, on the model of the Assumption Cathedral in Moscow, which at that time was about a hundred years old.  The result was a large five-domed temple, the central dome of which is covered with gilding, and the rest are painted blue with stars.  Inside the cathedral there is an iconostasis, some of the icons of which were made in the 16th century, and the lion's share of the rest - at the end of the 17th.  It is known that Simon Ushakov took part in the creation of the iconostasis.  The entire cathedral, including the dome, is painted with frescoes.  They were executed in 1684 by masters from Yaroslavl, under the leadership of D. Plekhanov.  In the Assumption Cathedral rest Makarii Nevsky and Innocent of Moscow (the first bishop of Alaska and Kamchatka). </p>

    <p>  Outside, at the western corner of the cathedral, there is the Assumption fount and the chapel, which resembles a miniature church with paintings and carvings.  On the opposite side of the cathedral is the tomb of Godunov, in which, in particular, Boris Godunov is buried. </p><h2>  Trinity Cathedral </h2><p>  It is the main temple of the laurels and its oldest building.  It was built in the years 1422-1423 on the site of a wooden church.  It is a four-pillar single-domed temple made of white stone.  Trinity Cathedral is one of the few buildings of the early architecture of the Moscow Principality that have survived to this day, and one of the best examples of style.  The height of the cathedral is only 30 meters, but thanks to the good proportions it does not seem low.  Initially, the temple was painted by <span>Daniil Cherny</span> and Andrei Rublev.  In the seventeenth century, new ones were painted based on their frescoes.  The iconostasis of the cathedral was created at the beginning of the 15th century and was replenished until the end of the 17th century.  In the cathedral lies Sergius of Radonezh - the founder of the Lavra. </p><h2>  Nikon Church </h2><p>  The church adjoins the Trinity Cathedral on the south side.  It was built in the years 1623-1624, on the site of an old church.  Its dimensions are calculated in such a way that the height together with the cross corresponds to the height of the main volume of the cathedral.  The exterior is decorated quite unusual, but the interior in its original form has not been preserved.  Here lies the dead Nikon of Radonezh, who died in 1426. </p><h2>  Spirit Church </h2><p>  A small church is located between two cathedrals - the Assumption and the Trinity.  It is the second oldest building of the Lavra, preserved to the present time.  The construction of the church was entrusted to the Pskov masters and unfolded in 1476-1477.  Pskov handwriting can be recognized by belfries that are integrated with the main volume of the building.  The brick church has rich decor.  Internal paintings date back to 1665.  The iconostasis was assembled in the nineteenth century, therefore it is considered new.  Several saints are buried here, including Maxim the Greek. </p>

    <h2>  Church of Zosima and Savvatiy of Solovetsky </h2><p>  The hipped church, located in the northwestern corner of the monastery, was built in 1635-1637, as part of the restoration of the Lavra.  The construction was coordinated by Kelar Alexander, who was a native of the Solovetsky Monastery.  Apparently, this is where the consecration of the church comes from.  Its exterior is made at that time quite sophisticated.  The iconostasis is modern, comparatively, of course. </p><h2>  Church of the Nativity of John the Baptist </h2><p>  The church was built at the end of the 17th century.  It is noteworthy that under it there is an arch, which means that once the building was a gate.  The construction of the church was sponsored by Grigory Stroganov.  Like other <span>Stroganov churches,</span> it has an exceptionally rich exterior decor.  The building is a quadrangle set on a cube and is the basis for five small chapters.  Inside is an iconostasis, assembled at the beginning of the 19th century. </p><h2>  Refectory church </h2><p>  This name was given to the church of Sergei Rodonezhsky, which was combined with the refectory and became one of the largest buildings of the monastery.  The exterior color of the building creates a relief effect, which, along with rich decor, stairs, porches and columns, looks very impressive.  The church was built in 1686-92 and became one of the main examples of the Naryshkin baroque.  The rich interior decoration dates from the late 17th century, as does the iconostasis.  The refectory chamber adjacent to the church is the largest historical single-vault building in Russia. </p>

    <h2>  Bell tower </h2><p>  The bell tower was built in the period from 1741 to 1770.  The construction was started by the architect I. Michurin, and completed by his colleague - D. Ukhtomsky.  The bell tower has a height of 88 meters, which exceeds the height of the bell tower of Ivan the Great, located in the Moscow Kremlin.  It consists of four tiers that stand on a cubic base.  The oldest bell was cast in 1420. </p><h2>  Royal palace </h2><p>  The entire north side of the monastery is occupied by an elegant two-story building of the Royal Chambers (1686-1692).  Its decoration is dominated by white stone and polychrome tiles.  At this place once stood the wooden palace of Ivan the Terrible.  The stucco decoration of the mid-18th century has been preserved on the western wall of the halls.  Inside, you can see two <span>tiled stoves of the</span> 17th century and an outstanding painting of the vaults of the mid-18th century.  Today in this room is the church and archaeological office, which houses books, icons and church utensils. </p><h2>  Walls and Towers </h2><p>  The monastery is surrounded by a wall with 10 towers and the Holy Gate.  It is noteworthy that the towers are made in different styles, as they were built from the 16th to the 18th century.  Each of them is interesting in its own way. </p><p>  It's time to get acquainted with the sights of Zagorsk in the Moscow region, which are located outside the Lavra. </p><h2>  Krasnogorskaya Square </h2><p>  In front of the monastery is quite a large area.  Around it are the shopping arcades (1902), the hotel complex (1890), and the Krasnogorsk Chapel (18th century).  The area is decorated with several monuments, including S. Radonezhsky. </p><h2>  Pyatnitsky Compound </h2><p>  The first attempt to expand the Lavra outside the wall was Pyatnitsky Compound.  Today there are two <span>churches here: Vvedenskaya</span> and Pyatnitskaya.  A tented bell tower and a refectory were attached to the latter.  Both churches are richly decorated and are a prime example of typical 16th-century Russian architecture. </p><h2>  Observation Decks </h2><p>  In Zagorsk in the <span>Moscow region</span> there are two viewing platforms.  The first is located near the Lavra and offers a view of it.  The second platform is located near the Museum of Toys, on a hill called Pancake Hill.  Before the revolution, two houses of the artist Malyshev, who was the sole owner of a beautiful view of the Lavra, stood on this hill. </p>

    <h2>  Monument to Zagorsky </h2><p>  Not far from the Ascension Church is the only reminder of the former name of the city - a monument to Vladimir Zagorsky, who died in 1919 from a bomb explosion.  The monument itself is quite ordinary, especially in comparison with the neighboring beauties, but it is not valued for its beauty. </p><h2>  Chernihiv monastery </h2><p>  Three kilometers east of the Lavra there is a monastery, which was founded in 1843-44 for those monks who needed privacy.  The historic buildings of the monastery are made of red brick.  The most interesting building of the complex is the Chernihiv church, built in the pseudo-Russian style.  About once an hour, bus number 38 runs from the railway station. </p><h2>  Churches </h2><p>  Churches in Zagorsk are located literally everywhere, and even outside the Lavra.  The main ones are: </p><ol><li>  Ilyinskaya.  It was built in the period from 1765 to 1773.  The only church in the city that did not close during the Soviet era. </li><li>  Ascension.  Built in the years 1766-1779.  By the standards of Sergiev Posad is a standard example of the genre. </li><li>  Assumption.  Built in the village of Klementiev in 1769.  In the 18th century, the village joined the city. </li><li>  Church of Mary Magdalene.  It is located five kilometers from the city center, in the village of Loza.  It was built in 1901 and for a long time was used for other purposes.  Today it houses <span>a convent</span> and boarding school for orphans.  The only thing that attracts tourists to the church is the exterior. </li></ol><h2>  Museums and Exhibitions </h2><p>  In the city of Sergiev Posad (Zagorsk) there are many fascinating institutions.  Here are just the main ones: </p><ol><li>  Historical and Art Museum-Reserve.  The museum was created in 1920 on the basis of an accumulated collection of historical and artistic values ‚Äã‚Äãof the Trinity-Sergey Lavra.  In 1992, when the museum was classified as a particularly valuable cultural heritage of the Russian Federation, it was almost completely moved outside the monastery and located in several ancient mansions, right in the center of the city.  The exception was the exposition ‚ÄúSacristy‚Äù.  In the museum you can get acquainted with a unique collection of Russian art of the 14-19th centuries: sewing, icon painting, jewelry, painting and carving (wood, stone and bone) and much more. </li><li>  Toy Museum.  It was founded in 1918 by collector, artist and museum figure N. D. Bartram.  In the museum you can get acquainted with one of the largest collections of toys in the whole Russian Federation.  Over 30 thousand exhibits from around the world are presented here, which are divided into collections, depending on the place of their origin. </li><li>  Museum of the God-made toys.  27 kilometers from Sergiev Posad (formerly Zagorsk), is the village of Bogorodskoye, which has long been famous for its wood products, and especially toys.  In 1960, a factory was opened here, the products of which are sold in the vicinity of Lavra and outside the city.  Anyone can go to a small enterprise as part of the tour.  Tours are arranged on weekdays, by appointment. </li></ol>
