The appearance of the HD50 is really impressive.  The sound does not attract professional reproduction, but for the average listener it is at a high level.  The price is very affordable - it does not exceed $ 59.  The article describes the characteristics, as well as all the nuances of this device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meizu headphones" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1522267.jpg" width="551"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The Chinese manufacturer managed to create the perfect design.  The exterior of the HD50 model can compete with any device that falls into a completely different price category.  The logo fits perfectly into the design.  The design is not without charm: the design is made of aluminum.  There are chrome inserts and a radial pattern. </p><p>  The cable is replaceable, single-sided.  It looks pretty decent and inspires confidence.  The headset is made in one stylistic direction. </p><h2>  Sound in headphones Meizu HD50 </h2><p>  It is advisable to warm up the headphones before the first listening.  This should be done about 2 days.  These headphones only benefit from this procedure.  It is worth playing not classical "noise", but heavier music, at least alternative rock.  This will affect the tonality of the headphones, they will change it a little. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The pitch is somewhat dimmed, the bass is audible well.  The emphasis on the latter does not cross the line.  It is enough to listen to really powerful songs, but it does not spoil pop songs.  Mid frequencies are heard well. </p><p>  If you do not pay attention to the price, then distortions are very striking.  They change the tone of the reproduction of wind instruments.  In addition, there is a slight muffling of sound.  It allows you to play tunes without straining your ears.  In general, for its price the sound is at the highest level, and all kinds of nit-picking are superfluous. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="headphones meizu hd50" class="if" height="458" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1522265.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  According to reviews, this model has boosted Meizu's reputation by 100%.  Headphones are designed to listen to music from phones or tablets.  This is logical and quite expected.  The impedance is 32 ohms, which is ideally compatible with any cellular device.  The microphone works fine, the interlocutor hears well. </p><p>  In general, Meizu proved to be excellent.  Headphones were successful and quickly dispersed from the shelves.  The device is stylish, and most importantly - reliable.  In their price range they can really be called almost the best. </p><p>  These headphones can be recommended to anyone who prefers to listen to music in their free time, but for audiophiles it is not the best option.  If in the future the manufacturer from the Middle Kingdom decides to improve the sound quality, the device will be able to claim even greater success. </p>
