But it is far away, and it is expensive to get to it by plane.  A great alternative to flights was a train trip to Paris. </p><p>  In general, trains to the capital of France began to run back in the 19th century, and communication continued until 1994.  At that time there was simply no need for regular transportation, and had to get to Paris with transfers.  Later, in 2007, a trailer car was launched.  When he gained popularity, it was decided to launch a whole train.  It was launched on December 12, 2011, and has been walking regularly since then. </p>

    <h2>  A train </h2><p>  On the route to France, train number 23 runs.  <span>The Moscow-Paris train is</span> strikingly different from ordinary <span>Russian trains.</span>  It is much more comfortable, cleaner and neater.  Moreover, he travels almost without noise and shaking, which sometimes interferes with travelers. </p><p>  A train from the Russian capital to France travels 3 times a week in the winter and 5 times in the summer.  If you are taking the <span>Moscow-Paris train,</span> departure will take place at 07:35 from Belorussky Train Station, and scheduled arrival at your destination at 20:31 local time to Paris East Station, however, please note that delays often occur.  This is due to the fact that passengers undergo several checks at the borders, and the time of searches depends on the circumstances.  The calculated travel time is 37 hours 39 minutes to Paris and 37 hours 36 minutes to Moscow. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At this structure wheels are replaced at the entrance to the territory of the European Union.  This is due to different rail standards on railways.  Passport checks and random baggage screening are also held here, so it‚Äôs best not to bring prohibited items with you. </p><p>  This train is also interesting because the railway route is the longest in Europe, although it is only 3217 km. </p>

    <h2>  Classes </h2><p>  The <span>Moscow-Paris train</span> has a special system of coupe classes <span>.</span>  The ticket price depends on it.  There are 3 classes: VIP, 1 class and 2 class. </p><p>  The VIP provides all the amenities for traveling by train "Moscow-Paris".  Firstly, these coupes are double, and all amenities are located in the room itself.  Passengers can use their personal dry closet, sink, shower, wardrobe, TV, DVD and air conditioning.  There are only four compartments and a bar in the car. </p><p>  Coupes in class 1 and 2 cars are essentially the same.  The only difference is that in the 1st class the compartment is designed for 2 people, and in the second, as usual, for 4. Each carriage has a shower and dry closets, and in the compartment there are washbasins.  Note that a shared shower is even larger than the booths that are installed in the VIP compartment, but only one for the entire car. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There is also a restaurant car on the train, and between Brest and Warsaw they are being replaced.  It serves Russian and European cuisines.  Conveniently, you can call the waiter in the compartment and order him a meal, and not go on your own.  As practice shows, passengers basically do just that. </p>

    <h2>  Conditions </h2><p>  When traveling <span>by the Moscow-Paris train,</span> you immediately realize that he travels to Europe, because everything in it is thought out to the smallest detail.  So, for example, washbasins are turned on using the touch panel, and the tap has not only cold, but also warm water.  It also allows you to take a shower calmly.  The toilet always has toilet paper and paper towels. </p><p>  There are conductors in each carriage; they are ready to provide you with tea, coffee or boiling water if necessary.  Near each compartment, regardless of class, there are various switches that allow you to reduce or add light, as well as call a guide or a waiter.  Moreover, all coupes are equipped with locks and sets of keys. </p><p>  As all passengers have access to showers, in addition to bedding, sets of bathrobes and large towels for the shower are distributed.  This state of affairs may well be compared to living in a good hotel. </p>

So, the compartment is really clean, and the conductors are very attentive.  According to travelers, mostly people go to Germany, and to Paris the train is almost empty.  On the way back, the same thing is observed - they sit down mainly in Germany. </p><p>  One of the most unpleasant moments in the operation of this train is frequent delays, so be sure to consider this fact when planning your time.
