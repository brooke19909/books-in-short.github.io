Today, St. Petersburg is being built up in accordance with the concept of integrated construction of houses, so developers are not offering single residential buildings on the market, but entire neighborhoods.  One of such projects is the Novoorlovsky residential complex.  It is located next to the forest park of the same name, not far from Suzdal Lakes, and it will occupy a rather impressive territory of 46 hectares. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ZhK Novoorlovsky" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1287501.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  About the complex </h2><p>  LCD "Novoorlovsky" (St. Petersburg) is characterized by a number of interesting features.  First of all, the project is interesting in that its creators are the "daughter" of the Finnish construction company YIT - the Russian branch of Yit Dom.  As for the <span>architectural concept,</span> the creators chose the neoclassical style, and the very appearance of the complex itself was developed in the Spanish bureau Taller de Arquitectura. </p><p>  On the outer perimeter of the complex, <span>multi-storey tower houses</span> will be erected <span>, the</span> interior space will be occupied by a wide street, closed to traffic, with infrastructure facilities, and 7-storey buildings will be located in the middle zone.  Those who are interested in the Novorlovskiy LCD address should go to the Suzdal highway and look for sections 1 and 12 there. Subsequently, upon completion of construction, numbers will be assigned to all buildings. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The complex is located almost at the exit from the city, and residents of Nizhniy Suzdal Lake can walk from the doorstep of the house in ten minutes.  Life almost in nature, combined with the presence of all the benefits of civilization in the form of a developed social and commercial infrastructure of the Primorsky region, make the offer of the developer more than tempting.  Do not lose sight of the Finnish quality of construction, which is also a definite plus.  In total, about ten thousand apartments will be put up for sale. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lc novoorlovsky unit house prices" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1287502.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  LCD "Novoorlovsky": the progress of construction </h2><p>  As mentioned above, work began in 2013.  A phased construction is expected.  In parallel with the houses, objects of social and trade infrastructure will be built.  First of all, the construction of six towers in 25 floors and four 7-storey houses, as well as schools and kindergartens (at this stage it is planned to put into operation three such institutions).  In addition, the first floors will be given for commercial real estate, so the residents of the new building will be immediately provided with all the necessary services. </p><p>  Houses will surrender in stages.  The first phase of construction involves the delivery of two high-rise towers, in which there are 444 apartments.  To date, no lag has been registered in terms of time, work has been mastered by 88%.  Objects will be commissioned at the end of 2016. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd novoorlovsky reviews" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1287503.jpg" width="600"></div>

To this end, as well as to attract customers, the company organizes excursions to sites where the construction of objects of the new microdistrict is in progress.  During the inspection, specialists will not only talk about their project, but also answer all questions of future buyers.  You can book an excursion by calling +7 (812) 703-44-44.  Buses depart from the Komendantsky Prospekt and Ozerki metro stations, the departure time must be specified when recording. </p><h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  Primorsky district is considered one of the most favorable regions of the Northern capital.  There are no industrial production, but there are many forest zones.  Large transportation lines are also located at a considerable distance from the complex, so that residents of the Novoorlovsky residential complex will not interfere with enjoying the peace and purity of the air.  The proximity of the Lower <span>Suzdal Lake,</span> which has long been considered the favorite vacation spot of many citizens, is also an integral advantage in favor of the project. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD novoorlovsky prices and layouts" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1287504.jpg" width="600"></div>

Not far from the complex there are two metro stations - Ozerki and Komendantsky Prospekt.  You can get to them in just ten minutes by bus or taxi.  <span>Public transport is</span> equipped near the houses.  As for motorists, they can use the roads of Parachute Street and Vyborg Highway to quickly get to the city center.  The distance to the roundabout is no more than ten kilometers, which makes trips to places in the Leningrad Region quite convenient and affordable. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Primorsky district has an excellent shopping, social and entertainment infrastructure.  Residents of the residential complex "Novoorlovsky" will not experience a lack of services of its facilities.  Near the complex there are many small shops as well as huge supermarkets, there are cafes and restaurants, several branches of large banks, a beauty salon, and dry cleaning. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD novoorlovsky spb" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1287509.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Not far from the residential complex is the Primorets stadium, whose fans can enjoy the sports lifestyle.  Three schools and a kindergarten operating in the area can be reached on foot in five to ten minutes. </p><p>  In addition, as mentioned above, the developer intends to provide all necessary residents and inside the complex.  He is going, in fact, to create his own mini-infrastructure, the main objects of which will be pharmacies, a supermarket, two schools, five d / s, shops, a restaurant and several cafes.  The developer intends to carefully monitor the process of renting commercial real estate and rent them out only to those entities that provide services to the public. </p><p>  Below we will highlight two of the most important issues that concern potential buyers of real estate in the residential complex "Novoorlovsky": prices and layouts of apartments. </p><h2>  Finnish housing </h2><p>  The apartments in the residential complex ‚ÄúNovoorlovsky‚Äù are positioned by the developer as housing of the comfort class.  In this regard, those who wish to buy a studio of such premises will not find here.  Only one, two, three and four-room apartments are offered.  Their area is from 40 to 90 "squares". </p><p>  As for the layouts, the buyer will find plenty to choose from.  Regardless of the format of the apartment, the developer offers a sufficiently large number of layouts of each type.  For example, you can buy a three-ruble note, in which a sauna is equipped.  Or a 3-room apartment with two bathrooms.  Both European-style apartments with a kitchen and a living room are offered, as well as a more traditional domestic option, when all rooms are separate.  However, regardless of the type of apartments, the kitchens are spacious everywhere.  If desired, you can purchase and species apartments. </p><p>  All living quarters are equipped with loggias, which, according to Finnish standards, are so spacious that you can easily place furniture for rest on them.  In addition, they are all glazed. </p><p>  Each of the apartments has a place for arranging the dressing room, moreover, all apartment owners will have spacious storage rooms at their disposal in the basement. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Novo Orlovsky construction progress" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1287510.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Ceiling height is 2 m 70 cm. </p><h2>  Finish options </h2><p>  They are offered two types - basic and turnkey.  In the second case, all work is carried out only after their full agreement with the customer.  That is, the future owner of the apartment chooses the finishing materials and the design of the room, and after putting the house into operation, he can celebrate a housewarming party literally on the day of settlement. </p><p>  As for the basic finish, here the client will find: all the necessary <span>engineering communications,</span> laid in a hidden way;  metering devices;  smoke traps installed;  everything you need to connect a television, telephone network and the Internet;  entrance metal door;  double-glazed windows in the windows;  smooth walls, floor and ceiling, fully prepared for finishing.  Further, the owner of the apartment can either make repairs on his own, or use the services of company specialists.  For an additional fee, of course. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Novoorlovsky St. Petersburg" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1287509.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Prices </h2><p>  So, what does the developer offer clients?  What is the cost of apartments in the residential complex "Novoorlovsky"?  ‚ÄúYit House‚Äù has set prices for its real estate in accordance with the class of housing.  As we have said, it refers to the comfort segment.  As evidenced by the reviews available from buyers of apartments in the residential complex ‚ÄúNovoorlovsky‚Äù, the price of apartments can‚Äôt be sky-high, however, not everyone can afford such a property. </p><p>  So, for ‚Äúodnushka‚Äù you will have to pay from 3,700,000 to 4,200,000 rubles, for ‚Äúodnushka‚Äù - from five to seven million, a three-room apartment will draw 6,400,000-7,000,000 rubles, and a four-room apartment will cost 11 million. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  What do the residents say about the proposed housing in the residential complex "Novoorlovsky"?  As for the decoration and layouts, here there are no dissatisfied.  However, the Finnish quality speaks for itself, the company "Yuit" has proven itself in the real estate market, all of its houses are rented on time and without any imperfections. </p><p>  Many, of course, reviews regarding the cost of housing.  Here opinions are divided.  Some argue that prices are unreasonably high, while others say that they are still comfort class apartments, so their price is appropriate.  However, housing is still being sold out, and more than a sufficient number of comers are recorded on the above-mentioned excursions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ZhK Novoorlovsky address" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1287511.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  There are no questions from people about transport links.  All, of course, are pleased with the presence of green areas and a lake near the complex.  As for infrastructure facilities, some believe that at first they will not be enough, they will have to wait until the construction is completed in order to feel comfortable.  But this, however, is the trouble of all new buildings, you can only choose an apartment in the house, opposite which there is an entrance to a huge supermarket, on the secondary housing market. </p><p>  And everyone is very happy that the developer pays a lot of attention to the safety of residents.  So, in the territory of the complex not only cameras will be installed everywhere, but also a checkpoint will be equipped and a local police station will be organized.  In addition, it is assumed that professional security guards will constantly be on the streets of the complex. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  What can be said in the end?  LCD "Novoorlovsky" is a very suitable place to consider it as an option for buying an apartment.  True, unfortunately, not everyone will be able to take advantage of this proposal due to the rather high cost of housing. </p>
