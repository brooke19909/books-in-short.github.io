    <p>  When looking at the night sky, everyone thought about what was behind him and what riddles were hidden in outer space.  By themselves, the night luminaries evoke imagination and make you think about creating a world.  Over time, mankind received new information and opportunities, and this knowledge helped him partially gain power over nature and carry out a flight into outer space. </p>

    <h2>  School knowledge </h2><p>  What does the study of the universe mean by scientists?  Geography (Grade 5) gives a detailed description of the formation of knowledge about space and the world from ancient times to the present day. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  People‚Äôs perceptions of the universe have changed.  People watched the movement of the sun, moon and other bodies.  Ancient people considered the Earth to be the center of the Universe and did not know what shape it was and what could be beyond it.  In ancient India, there was an opinion about flat land, which is located on the backs of huge elephants, and those stand on a turtle.  In Ancient Mesopotamia, people believed that the earth is a mountain surrounded by water expanses, and that from above is a dome along which celestial bodies move.  For the first time, the ancient Greeks spoke of a spherical Earth.  It was they who suggested that the center of the universe is the sun. </p>

    <h2>  Space exploration </h2><p>  The importance of studying the Universe for humans cannot be underestimated.  The space age and the rapid development of space exploration served as a kind of accelerator of science and technology.  The development of engineering, electronics, energy and other industries has also intensified. </p><p>  What is the significance of scientists studying the universe and outer space?  In unexplored galaxies, humanity seeks to receive answers to questions about the appearance of life in the Universe, its structure.  Initially, these were simple assumptions about planets and space, and over time, people switched to a thorough study of celestial bodies and developed a whole system of technologies. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  So what is the significance of studying the universe of celestial bodies for a person?  Initially, satellites and space shuttles were sent into orbits, installing entire orbital stations.  The data from these studies were used to study and analyze the solar system and planets.  Soon, scientists managed to take their research far beyond the boundaries of the solar system and explore galactic space.  In general, this was a huge breakthrough in the study of the universe. </p><h2>  Value </h2><p>  What is the significance of the study by scientists of the universe, celestial bodies and bodies for the whole of humanity? </p><p>  1. Forecasting.  Through study, a person can predict the movements of celestial bodies: their fall, movement, and their collision with the Earth.  This makes it possible to explore the possibility of life on other planets, the search for other forms of life and minerals. </p><p>  2. Knowledge.  Obtaining a wide arsenal of knowledge opens up new possibilities for studying other sciences and putting the acquired knowledge into practice. </p>

    <h2>  Main characteristics </h2><p>  What is the significance of studying the Universe, and how do its main characteristics affect the world around it?  Firstly, it is infinite not only in space, but also in time.  But in turn, it consists of many particles and elements that have their origin in time and space.  Under the influence of itself, the Universe is constantly in motion and is changing.  Its constituent elements can be of various sizes, masses and shapes - from the smallest atoms to entire stellar systems.  The Universe is all that exists. </p><h2>  Science </h2><p>  Therefore, it is not surprising that, in one way or another, every science is faced with the elements and components of outer space.  What does the study of the universe mean by scientists?  For example, physics studies atoms and elementary particles, biology studies wildlife, and chemistry studies the molecular characteristics of objects. </p><p>  They also single out a separate discipline that studies the Universe as a whole.  A special area in astronomy is called cosmology.  She studies not only the visible, but also the invisible parts. </p><h2>  Modeling </h2><p>  What does the study of the universe mean by scientists?  The rapid development of cybernetics and the application of its knowledge to all areas of scientific research have made it possible to use modeling techniques.  The basis of this method is the study of the model of the object.  For this, special models are created that allow the most accurate study of the features and properties of the elements of the universe.  This technique allows scientists and ordinary people to more deeply understand the world and visualize original objects inaccessible to the eyes. </p><p>  Although this technique is the most popular and affordable, it cannot take into account the diverse factors that may have an impact on the environment.  After all, each model is not the phenomenon itself, but only a more or less exact copy or image of reality. </p><p>  Therefore, any result obtained in the process of research using models must necessarily be verified with reality.  The phenomenon itself cannot be equated with a model.  There is no need to do a thorough check and not always a natural phenomenon has the same properties as even the most accurate model. </p><p>  The current prospects for the study of the universe are multifaceted.  The experiments and new information of all the scientists of the world‚Äôs minds help to track the laws of the development of the Universe, processes and mechanisms of influence on the surrounding world. </p>
