It was concluded by the Lithuanian prince Vitovt and the <span>Polish king</span> Jagiello on October 2, 1413 in the city of Gorodlo, which was located on the Bug River (today the territory of Poland).  In order to determine the true causes of the Union of Gorodly, it is necessary to look at the beginning of relations between these states and their further development. </p><h2>  Krevsky Union </h2><p>  In 1835, the Krevo Union was concluded in the Krevo castle between Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.  According to this document, the Lithuanian prince Jagiello was proclaimed Polish, while he married the Polish queen Jadwig.  This agreement allowed an end to conflicts and the struggle between countries over the southwestern Russian territories.  The document also served to expand the land to the shores of the Black Sea. </p>

    <h2>  Battle of the Vorskla River </h2><p>  The subsequent rapprochement of states was compelled.  In 1399, Grand Duke Vytautas was the head of a strong state.  He provided patronage to the Tatar <span>Khan Tokhtamysh.</span>  The prince of Lithuania helped him in the struggle for power in the Golden Horde.  Khan turned to him for military help, and in return promised to give Vitovt labels (agreements issued by the Crimean Khan, which allow collecting tribute in this territory) to Moscow.  The sovereign of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania accepted the offer and in 1399 went on a campaign against the Tatar army.  On the banks <span>of the Vorskla River</span> in August 1399, a battle broke out between the two armies. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The army of the Principality of Lithuania was defeated, and Vitovt miraculously survived.  He managed to get to Kiev and take refuge in the walls of the city.  However, the battle greatly undermined the military forces of the state.  For the principality, the battle played a sad role: the land was lost, and attacks on the <span>territory of</span> the Teutonic Order and Prince Oleg began on the <span>territory of Lithuania</span> .  Robberies and raids of enemy countries led to the fact that Prince Vitovt was again forced to sign a union with the Kingdom of Poland. </p>

    <h2>  Vilnius-Radom Union </h2><p>  This document was concluded in January 1401 between the sovereigns in the city of Vilna.  He specified the conditions that were presented in the first, Krevsoy Union.  Forty seals of magnates (boyars, bishops and princes) of the Principality of Lithuania were attached to it.  By this act, Vitovt was a vassal of the supreme ruler of Lithuania.  At the same time, Jagiello gave the right to the Lithuanian prince to own his state to death and recognized the title of Grand Duke of Lithuania.  After the death of Vytautas, the entire territory of the state should pass to the rule of Jagiello or his successors.  A few months later, in March, in Radom, the Polish magnates also signed a union.  In this connection, the agreement was named Vilensko-Radomsky Union. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Obligations of the parties </h2><p>  The military-political union provided mutual assistance to the countries in the attack on one of them of the Teutonic Order.  In addition, the representative of the Polish authorities pledged not to choose a new king (at the death of Jagiello) without coordinating this with the magnates ON.  One of the points stipulated that the Principality of Lithuania did not lose sovereignty, and Vitovt remained his rulers for life.  However, he lost the right to transfer the throne to his heirs.  Poland insisted on the collection of tribute from Lithuania, but this provision was not included in the document. </p><p>  In defense of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Jagiello turned to Pope Boniface IX and got him to sign a bull, which forbade the Teutonic Order to organize campaigns against the Principality of Lithuania. </p>

    <h2>  Change of political roles </h2><p>  One of the main events that influenced the relations of the two countries with each other, as well as the political arena of Europe, was the Battle of Grunwald, which took place in 1410.  She became the cause of the growth of influence and power of the Principality of Lithuania.  The battle allowed the country to become a strong power among existing countries.  The army of the Teutonic Order was completely destroyed as a result of this battle, and many generals were killed thanks to the joint efforts of Poland and Lithuania. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The signing of the City Union </h2><p>  This whole chain of relationships, which lasted for 30 years, led, in the end, to the signing of the Gorodelsky Union between the states.  It was signed on October 2, 1413.  The meeting of the heads of countries was held in the village of Gorodle, which was located on the <span>Western Bug.</span>  This document annulled the terms of the Union of Krev, but at the same time new demands were put forward, which also caused discontent among the inhabitants of the Principality of Lithuania. </p>

    <h2>  The essence of the document </h2><p>  The signed document confirmed the union of the two states and the promise of mutual assistance in the event of an attack by an enemy country.  Moreover, each of them had sovereignty.  The union spoke about the recognition of the independence of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.  For the first time it was clearly indicated that in the event of the death of Prince Vitovt, the state would not cease to exist.  The title of Grand Duke of Lithuania can now be inherited.  This automatically abolished the position of the Union of Vilnius-Radom.  However, the ruler could not be chosen without coordination with the tycoons of Poland.  And the Poles promised in return not to choose a new king after the death of Jagiello, without first submitting the candidacy to the Lithuanian prince. </p><h2>  Gorodelsky privilege </h2><p>  The Gorodel Union of 1413 consisted of three parts (the last was written in two copies - for each ruler - it talked about the choice of rulers in states).  The other two parts were Gorodelsky privilege.  According to the first act of the document, the Polish magnates allowed the Lithuanian princes to use certain emblems.  In view of which, the privileged rights of the <span>Polish gentry</span> were also transferred to them <span>.</span>  In response, the Lithuanian princes also exchanged emblems with the Polish magnates.  These acts were applicable only to Catholics.  All this contributed to a greater rapprochement between Poland and the ON. </p>

    <h2>  Restriction of the rights of Orthodox </h2><p>  Representatives of the elite, Catholics, exchanged emblems, could be elected to public office.  They were allowed to freely use property within their holdings.  They also received certain benefits or other assistance from the state.  These actions severely limited the rights of the Orthodox.  They were not allowed to participate in the Grand Duchy Council.  Paragraph 9 of the Gorodel Union explained it this way: "a difference in faith produces a difference in opinion." </p>

    <h2>  Territorial changes </h2><p>  The signing of the Union of Vilnius and Radom and Gorodel privilege had a number of consequences.  One of them concerned the change of territories.  Administrative reform was one of the first after the adoption of the contract.  In the Principality of Lithuania, the land was divided according to the same principle as in Poland: Vilnius and Trok voivodships.  The history of Belarus was not affected by the City Union.  Vitebsk, Smolensk, and Polotsk lands remained autonomous territories in the state. </p><p>  On the ground, new managerial positions were determined that only Catholicism could profess.  In the remaining parts of the state governors of the prince continued to rule.  They controlled the territories under their rule according to the principle: do not crush old things, do not introduce new ones. </p>

    <h2>  Change hierarchy </h2><p>  In connection with the Gorodel Unity, the causes and consequences of which became the subject of our review, hierarchical ladders also changed.  The old rich Orthodox clans were relegated to the background.  In their place came the new Catholic magnates, on whom Vytautas relied.  It was they who occupied the dominant position of governor.  Now the gentry determined the political life of the country, and representatives of the Gedeminovichi and other ancient noble families were deprived of such an opportunity. </p><h2>  Ambiguity of consequences </h2><p>  Gorodelsky union had twofold consequences.  On the one hand, Lithuania strengthened its independence from Poland, found a trusted ally to counter the aggression of neighboring countries and canceled the conditions of the Krevo Union.  On the other hand, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was divided according to the principle of religiosity.  Catholics held leading positions in the country, while the Orthodox could not influence political power.  As a result, the number of people dissatisfied with the current system grew. </p>
