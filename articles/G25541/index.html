As a rule, such devices are installed in the dark.  The sensor is triggered when a moving object appears in the set zone.  The operation zone is set using a special control device.  The motion sensor with a lamp is a completely new and economical equipment.  It also serves to improve the level of lighting not only on the streets, but also indoors. </p><h2>  General information </h2><p>  In this equipment, you can use not only standard incandescent lamps, but also almost any other kind.  In some cases, a motion sensor with a lamp should not be installed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="motion sensor with lamp" class="if" height="404" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1154218.jpg" width="600"></div>  For example, it is not mounted in front of the fan, as it will trigger from the movement of the blades or on the carriageway, where automobile vehicles passing by will be an irritant.  For more accurate work, there should not be any building structures, trees, engineering devices for heating and ventilation near it.

    <h2>  <span>LED lamp</span> with motion sensor </h2><p>  It is one of the most economical sources of lighting.  This has been proven thanks to many studies.  This lamp with a motion sensor is a profitable union.  Today, there are many devices that serve to illuminate the street or premises when a person appears.  The system turns on in the dark and is able to control the lighting power.  LED lamps are equipped with a dimmer.  This device is used to create comfort indoors.  That is, energy saving is not its advantage.  A significant amount of energy is required for functioning.  Another thing is the combination of a lamp with a sensor. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  A LED lamp with a motion sensor consumes much less electricity, as it turns on and off for a certain time.  The main place of application is large industrial enterprises.  The device is also installed in the entrances of apartment buildings, since one motion sensor can be connected to a large number of lamps.  In addition, the installation of such equipment is quite simple.  Many studies have proven that the use of a motion sensor with LED lamps is the best option. </p><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  Among the positive aspects, it is worth highlighting lower energy consumption than other lamps, as well as small overall dimensions.  I must say that the power of the LED element is an order of magnitude higher than incandescent lamps almost 7 times.  Many users note the high cost of LED devices.  That is why they are not very profitable to use.  But this drawback is not significant. </p><h2>  Energy-saving lamps with motion sensor </h2><p>  This type of device got its name due to the competent combination of power consumption and light flux.  Similar elements are designed to conserve electricity.  In addition, their service life is much higher than that of other lamps.  They are used in large industrial enterprises, where it is necessary to achieve less electricity consumption.  But this does not end its scope.  An energy-saving lamp with a motion sensor is used to illuminate streets, porches and other rooms. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages of energy-saving lamps </h2><p>  Key benefits include: </p><ul><li>  uniform distribution of light; </li><li>  smooth on and off; </li><li>  various color executions; </li><li>  the main part of the lamp does not heat up. </li></ul>

    <p>  The only drawback is the failure with frequent on or off.  Therefore, before using the device with the sensor, it is necessary to select the appropriate energy saving. </p><h2>  Connection </h2><p>  A motion sensor with a <span>lamp is connected</span> to a conventional network, like a switch.  That is, the network closes automatically.  Sometimes an additional switch is mounted in the circuit.  This is done if it is necessary to ensure the inclusion of light for a certain time.  The principle of operation is the parallel operation of the sensor. </p><p>  If it is necessary to provide light to a large room, then several motion controllers are used.  At the same time, they should be on opposite sides of the room, but ensure that all lamps work.  In order not to cause a short circuit, it is necessary to work from one phase.  A magnetic switch can be included in this circuit.  It serves to illuminate long streets.  That is, the operation of the entire street depends on one sensor. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Devices with halogen lamps </h2><p>  The advantages of such lamps is the high brightness of the light with the directional movement of the light flux.  They are not energy efficient.  The only thing you can save on is on their replacement, since they are characterized by durability.  Halogen elements are produced in various designs.  The most popular model is a linear <span>halogen lamp.</span>  To install it requires a lot of space. </p>

    <p>  As a rule, the installation of such devices is carried out under the ceiling.  They are not subject to mechanical stress.  The main scope is street.  They can not be installed indoors, as high brightness will interfere with any action. </p><h2>  How to connect? </h2><p>  Connecting a lamp with a motion sensor does not take much time and money.  The devices are connected to a regular household electrical network with a voltage of 220 V. There are also battery-powered models.  The serial connection diagram is indicated on the box or on the device itself.  So, there are two connection sockets on the sensor - phase and zero, which are indicated by the letters L and N, respectively.  The luminaire with the lamp itself is connected to L. For the device to turn on, it is necessary to supply current to these connectors.  The wires are interconnected by terminals. </p>

    <p>  If you make a mistake in connecting, the motion sensor will not break.  It just won't function.  The wire should be so long that it reaches the nearest power source.  If there is no outlet nearby, you can use the carry, while the performance of the device will not change. </p><h2>  Device check </h2><p>  Modern appliances have a special indicator.  It lights up when the sensor is powered by the mains.  If the indicator does not work after applying voltage, then this indicates a breakdown of the sensor or supply socket.  There are models that begin to function after 30 seconds.  During this time, you can check the health of the equipment without fully connecting it to the mains. </p><h2>  Customization </h2><p>  The regulation of the movement of the motion sensor with a lamp occurs using a special toggle switch, which is located on the body.  Depending on the model, there may be a different number of them.  For ease of adjustment, the setting symbols are located near the toggle switch.  As a rule, these are letter indicators.  On the case there is an arrow showing the direction of rotation of the toggle switch. </p>

    <p>  A parameter such as lighting power must be selected before installation.  This is because the sensor is installed under the ceiling, and it is rather difficult to carry out further changes in the indicators of illumination.  You should also set the minimum light threshold at which the sensor will not respond.  LUX is responsible for this. </p><p>  When connected to the mains, all values ‚Äã‚Äãare set to maximum to check the device.  To configure the motion sensor, use the Time function.  It is she who is responsible for the time the light is turned on and off.  As a rule, time is set to the maximum value.  More modern models come with features such as Sens and Mic.  The first is responsible for sensitivity and is set to maximum, the second is for voice messages (set to minimum).  Such sensors are very rare. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Many users have <span>a Led lamp with a motion sensor.</span>  This is an excellent device that will help to illuminate not only the street path, but also various rooms.  It is chosen because of the ease of installation and configuration.  As a rule, a <span>diode lamp</span> with a motion sensor is used to illuminate industrial enterprises.  In addition, it significantly saves electricity. </p>

    <p>  Such devices are sold in construction stores, and their cost ranges from 1000 to 5000 rubles.  The price depends on the technical characteristics, place of application and type of lamp used. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Lamps with motion sensors have long been included in our lives.  Thanks to them, the streets are illuminated in the dark, as well as most production workshops.  If you use LED lamps, it significantly saves electricity.  The only drawback is the high cost.  But this minus is insignificant, since in return there are a sufficient number of positive aspects: easy installation, ease of regulation, as well as a large lighting power compared to other types. </p>
