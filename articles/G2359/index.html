    <h2>  Resort Primorsko </h2><p>  This is one of the most amazing places in the south of the country.  It is located on a cape that protrudes far into the sea, and everything is covered with sand dunes.  There is a unique nature here - clean air, many exotic plants, untouched places.  Picturesque cliffs, ruins of mysterious civilizations and at the same time comfort and convenience - this is what a person who decides to rest in Primorsko will get. </p><p>  For tourists, this area has opened relatively recently.  After all, there were favorite places for holidays of the highest Bulgarian party bonzes in the communist era.  But now there are many youth and children's camps, private hotels and such "monsters" as our "Grand".  In the town there are many parks planted with oaks, beeches, hornbeams, and citrus fruits are also grown here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Primorsko Hotels </h2><p>  Now in the territory of this resort there are many different hotels of various price categories.

    <h2>  How to get, where is the territory </h2><p>  Since Primorsko is located quite far from the main airports of the country, the transfer here will be quite long.

It is quite far from the center, so you will not be awakened at night by cheerful young people and the noise of discos.  Nevertheless, there are many cheap cafes nearby. </p><p>  The hotel consists of a main seven-story multi-level building and four additional six-story buildings.  The hotel has a very beautiful lounge; chic carpets hang everywhere, which gives the impression of a palace.  Near the hotel there is an excellent water park, so that children will be happy.  The hotel has swimming pools, two restaurants, three bars (on the beach, by the pool and in the lobby), free parking, shops.  Nearby is a golf course, a large supermarket.
