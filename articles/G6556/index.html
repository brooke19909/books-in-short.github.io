  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sony HDR AS50: reviews, specs and photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you are actively involved in extreme sports, then you were definitely thinking about acquiring such a useful thing as an action camera.  But she still needs to be able to choose.  Of course, there are recognized masterpieces such as GoPro that need neither introduction nor verification, but these things are very expensive.  And in the budget segment, the devil will break his leg.  Therefore, we decided to help you and introduce one very good camera.  It's about the Sony HDR AS50.  Reviews about it, as well as technical specifications, we will consider in this material.  And let's start with the package. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sony.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sony hdr as50 reviews" class="if uuid-3240394" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3240394.jpg"></div><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Let's start with what package the camera has.  It is worth mentioning that it comes in a small box (which is more like packaging from a smartphone) in black with the Sony logo on board.  The box is made of high-quality thick cardboard.  There is very little information on the packaging itself.  Only the most important.  But we are interested in what is located in the box itself.  You can find such things there. </p><ul><li>  The Sony HDR AS50 camera itself. </li><li>  Micro USB cable for connecting to a computer and charging. </li><li>  Standard power charger unit. </li><li>  Waterproof case. </li><li>  Set of different information booklets. </li><li>  The instruction manual is in Russian. </li><li>  Warranty card. </li></ul><p>  That's all.  Of course, the kit is not very generous, but for a camera for such a price, this is quite enough.  The Sony HDR AS50 action camera, reviews of which we will discuss a little later, is a pretty good device for shooting high-quality videos.  And you will see this after we talk about the technical characteristics of the camera.  But first, let's talk about design. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sony hdr camera as50 reviews" class="if uuid-3240395" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3240395.jpg"></div><h2>  Design and dimensions </h2><p>  To begin with, the Sony HDR AS50 camcorder, reviews of which we will consider in the next section, is distinguished by its miniature size and low weight.  And this is understandable, because it should be easily attached to the helmet of a cyclist, for example, or to the steering wheel of a vehicle.  On the right side of the device is a small monochrome LCD display.  It shows information about the selected quality of the clip, the remaining battery charge, the location on the memory card and other information necessary for using the camera.  There are also buttons for configuring the features of the device. </p><p>  The left side of the device is almost completely empty.  On the front is a lens.  A little further - the image stabilization button (unfortunately, it is exclusively software here).  On the bottom of the camera is a battery compartment, a slot for a memory card and a screw hole for mounting the camera on a tripod.  This hole itself has standard sizes and is compatible with various accessories.  In general, the design of the camera is strict and classic.  If I may say so.  The body color is always black.  There are no compromises. </p><h2>  User feedback on design </h2><p>  So, we examined the appearance of the action camera Sony HDR AS50 (black).  User reviews about the appearance are mixed.  Both positive and negative are present.  But we will start with the positive.  Almost all those who purchased a camera claim that its design is very successful.  The black color of the case is the best suited for this device, since the case is less dirty and does not distract the user from shooting.  Also, users note that the miniature size of the camera is also a big advantage.  It is thanks to them that you can take it with you wherever you go.  Light weight also plays a positive role.  The hand does not get tired during long shooting.  And this cannot but rejoice.  At the same time, some users say that ‚ÄúSony‚Äù could install a better display, since this one can not even be used as a viewfinder.  But this is the only reason for complaints about the design and construction of this camera. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.sony.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="action camera sony hdr as50 reviews" class="if uuid-3240396" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3240396.jpg"></div><h2>  Camera specifications </h2><p>  So we got to the most interesting.  Now it's time to talk about the characteristics of the action camera Sony HDR AS50, reviews of which we will consider a little later.  So, the camera is equipped with a high-quality f / 2.8 ZEISS Tessar lens, which allows you to shoot even at dusk.  The resolution of the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äã11.1 megapixels, which is not so much.  It is clear that the video in 4K camera will not pull.  And indeed it is.  The maximum video resolution is Full HD (1920 by 1080 pixels) at a speed of 60 frames per second.  With HD resolution (1280 by 720 pixels), the speed can reach 120 frames per second.  There is image stabilization.  But only software.  The camera supports micro SD memory cards, but it requires cards with a speed of class 10. Otherwise, the device‚Äôs performance will not be up to standard. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ephotozine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="camcorder sony hdr as50 reviews" class="if uuid-3240397" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3240397.jpg"></div><h2>  Battery life and more </h2><p>  The camera is also equipped with a Li-Pol battery, which provides the device for 2 hours.  But it is not exactly.  The fact is that the battery life entirely depends on what resolution of the video is selected for recording, and if it is high, then the camera‚Äôs life time is significantly reduced.  Nevertheless, even what remains is quite enough to record a high-quality video.  The camera also has a very clear menu, although there is no Russian language in it.  For the inclusion of software stabilization meets a separate button on the case.  Implemented this option is very convenient and high quality.  Although classical optical stabilization is sorely lacking, because software does not always do its job well. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.trustedreviews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sony hdr as50 bc reviews" class="if uuid-3240398" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3240398.jpg"></div><h2>  The quality of the videos shot by the camera </h2><p>  Now let's talk about how Sony HDR AS50 shoots.  Customer reviews on this subject will be discussed in the next chapter.  It should be noted right away that it is better not to wait for special miracles from the camera.  It uses a budget matrix and a completely ordinary lens.  In Full HD, this camera shoots decently.  But only in good light.  As twilight thickens, a heap of soap and noise appears.  Of course, about this we expected, but not in such quantity.  It was somehow strange to see such artifacts in the camera from Sony.  The inclusion of software stabilization also did not really fix the situation.  In general, the aperture ratio of the lens is very lacking.  But underwater shooting is simply amazing.  It's all about a complete underwater case.  It is equipped with a flat lens, which allows you to not distort the picture when shooting.  A very useful thing.  The good news is that the camera produces an honest 60 frames per second when shooting in Full HD.  Although they did it right. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trustedreviews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="action camera sony hdr as50 reviews" class="if uuid-3240399" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3240399.jpg"></div><h2>  User reviews about the camera </h2><p>  So, we examined the characteristics of the camera.  And what do all those who have already purchased Sony HDR AS50 BC think about this?  Reviews are different.  Both positive and negative.  And the latter for some reason more.  So let's start with them.  Almost all users note that the picture quality when shooting is good only during the day.  In the evening, no matter how hard you try, you cannot get rid of soap.  And people really don't like it.  Still, this is Sony.  Such a large and respected brand should have at least some obligations to customers.  But no.  The company continues to produce just such cameras.  By the way, some users compare this model with the AS200 from the same manufacturer, which is already five years old.  And they are surprised to see that the picture is almost the same.  There is nothing surprising here.  The "filling" of the cameras is almost identical.  Moreover, in the AS50, the image camera is also programmatically trimmed.  Well, not disgusted by the "Sony"?  But the manufacturer can also be understood.  He needs to sell more expensive cameras.  In general, in this camera, users only praise the image quality in daylight. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bestbuy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="action camera sony hdr as50 bc reviews" class="if uuid-3240402" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3240402.jpg"></div><h2>  A bit about the underwater case </h2><p>  We have already talked about the characteristics of the Sony HDR AS50, reviews of which it is recommended to study before buying, and the design.  Now it's time to consider this interesting accessory that comes with the camera.  This is a special case for underwater shooting.  It is made of transparent soft plastic and has a sealed structure.  He completely does not let in neither air nor water.  There are duplicate camera settings controls on the case.  They are located exactly where the corresponding buttons are located on the camera body.  But the most interesting is the lens.  It is completely flat.  And this is good, since a lens of this design helps to avoid distortion when shooting.  If it were of a different shape, the picture would be with a fish-eye effect.  And this can be considered a distortion.  And even a defect.  In general, the protective cover is made with high quality.  There is no doubt in its reliability.  He will serve faithfully for a long time. </p><h2>  User reviews about the case </h2><p>  Now let's talk about what users think of the underwater camera cover for the Sony HDR AS50.  Owner reviews on this subject are favorable.  They think this is a very nice bonus from Sony.  Previously, only the company's top products were equipped with such a cover.  Users claim that the cover does its job perfectly.  With it, you can shoot stunning videos of the underwater world.  And some users use it as protection when shooting in extreme conditions.  Of course, he will not protect much from shock and fall.  But here from the rain, spray of dirt and other things will even help.  In general, users are satisfied with this bonus.  Some even claim that it eliminates the shortcomings of the camera itself.  And it was worth spending money on her, if only because I got such a cool case with her. </p><h2>  Should I buy this camera? </h2><p>  The question is not simple.  And to answer it you will have to remember everything that we talked about a little higher.  If you are constrained on a budget and are looking for a camera to simply take your bike ride in the daylight, you can safely purchase the Sony HDR AS50 BC action camera.  User reviews suggest that in good lighting it shoots excellently.  And as a nice bonus, you will get a great case with a flat lens for underwater shooting.  If your goal is shooting adventures with a lack of light, then it is better to save up money and spend money on something more impressive.  Since with a lack of light this camera does a poor job of its duties.  However, for the most part, the final choice depends entirely on your personal preferences.  We can only recommend this or that product.  And conclusions are already your prerogative. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Now let's summarize and summarize all the information written above.  We examined in detail the interesting action camera Sony HDR AS50.  User reviews about this product tell us that for the most part this is a good device with some flaws.  However, even it is capable of shooting video in decent quality.  And there is no need for this to go broke on the expensive GoPro and others like them.  But the most important thing is that this product belongs to the budget category.  And for an entry-level device, it has very good characteristics.  Not to mention the wonderful underwater camera case that comes with the kit. </p>
