Responsibilities, Activities</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The state is a holistic mechanism, the main engine of which is people.  For a long time, scientists argued about the role of man and his activities in the affairs of the country.  However, the mere fact that states were developed by society leaves no doubt about its dominant position.  But initially, people united in small social structures that functioned on the basis of kinship and common goals.  Later, such social groups became ineffective, because the number of people participating in them constantly increased.  The bottom line is that the control and coordination of a huge human stream can be carried out only within the framework of large associations, which states have become.  However, each country is not only a collection of people.  Its functioning also requires certain resources, the main of which are economic.  The financial stock of any state is replenished thanks to its population.  In this matter, the Russian Federation is no exception to the rule.  Its stability depends on taxes that the population pays without fail.  But it is not these special payments that cause greater interest, but the activity of the bodies that are engaged in their direct collection. </p><h2>  What are taxes? </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, the state operates on the basis of the resource base.  One of the sources of its filling is taxes.  In general, this category is complex.  She describes two phenomena.  Firstly, a tax is a <span>mandatory payment that</span> is levied by the state on legal entities and individuals.  That is, the category, in fact, ensures the financial well-being of the country.  Secondly, the tax can also be attributed to the form of specific activity, in which special state bodies forcibly recover funds directly from the company.  Of course, there are other category definitions.  After all, it was studied by representatives of jurisprudence and the sphere of financial sciences for many centuries, since taxes existed in ancient times. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tax authorities are" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1539321.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Tax authorities: concept </h2><p>  The Russian Federation has a large number of government departments, which are known for the performance of the country's functions.  In turn, tax authorities are the official structure of special units that directly implement the state‚Äôs tax policy.  Their existence is due to the need for the forced collection of funds from individuals and legal entities for the stable functioning of the Russian Federation.  The system of tax authorities is centralized and indivisible.  It consists of several executive bodies that control the replenishment of the budget through taxes and fees. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tax accounting" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1539318.jpg" width="547"></div>

In the structure of the ministry there are many different departments, each of which is engaged in its own functional areas.

In its work, the Federal Tax Service is an independent agency, the partial coordination of which is carried out by the Ministry of Finance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tax authorities are required" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26556/1539263.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Activities of tax authorities - key areas </h2><p>  Any government agency is created to achieve any goals.  This subsequently becomes the key factor on the basis of which the formation of the lines of activity of all departments without exception occurs.  The Federal Tax Service in this case is no exception to the rule.  It has a number of interrelated tasks, the implementation of which is the primary goal.  To date, there are several main areas of activity of the Federal Tax Service. </p><ol><li>  First of all, the tax service monitors the implementation of legislation in the field of collection of taxes and fees.  In essence, the body is the key executor of the compulsory collection of mandatory payments. </li><li>  Another important area of ‚Äã‚Äãactivity of the Federal Tax Service is the development and implementation of policies that ensure the prompt and efficient flow of funds to the state budget. </li><li>  The third main goal of the body can be called financial control, carried out within its competence. </li></ol><p>  Thus, the activities of the tax authorities is purposeful and regulatory.  The functions of the Federal Tax Service are relevant and, most importantly, quite real when taking into account the current situation in the Russian Federation.  For their implementation, the body is vested with a number of exclusive powers, which have no analogues in other government departments. </p><h2>  What powers are assigned to the Federal Tax Service? </h2><p>  The previously presented normative acts provide an opportunity to analyze not only the <span>main areas of activity,</span> but also the exceptional opportunities that tax authorities have.  This allows you to fully understand all, without exception, aspects of the work of the government department.  It should be noted that the Federal Tax Service exercises the following powers, namely: </p><ul><li>  supervision and control in the field of mandatory taxes and fees; </li><li>  registration in the tax authority of individuals as individual entrepreneurs; </li><li>  registration of legal entities; </li><li>  accounting of all taxpayers without exception; </li><li>  creation of special information systems for automation and ease of accounting; </li><li>  informing taxpayers about existing and newly introduced taxes and fees; </li><li>  collection of compulsory official payments; </li><li>  periodic audits of the activities of legal entities, individuals, and business entities; </li><li>  the creation of special settlement forms for taxes and fees, etc. </li></ul><p>  Bodies of the Federal Tax Service may also require documents and information necessary for conducting any supervisory measures, as well as explain their subjects, their rights, obligations, etc. </p><h2>  Responsibilities of the tax authorities </h2><p>  The legal regime of any department is complex.  If we take into account specifically the Federal Tax Service, then in addition to the powers presented, the body has certain responsibilities.  According to the provisions of special regulations, tax authorities are required to: </p><ul><li>  carry out its activities within the framework of Russian legislation; </li><li>  monitor the implementation of legislation adopted in the field of taxes and fees; </li><li>  keep special records of individuals and legal entities; </li><li>  obey, in certain matters of its activity, the Ministry of Finance of Russia; </li><li>  comply with the principle of tax secrecy, etc. </li></ul><p>  It should be noted that the legislation may impose other obligations on tax authorities.  Their implementation is a necessary part of the work of the Federal Tax Service.  Ignoring the agency of its obligations entails the responsibility of the tax authorities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tax system" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26556/1538168.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Federal Tax Service - the subject of control </h2><p>  It should be noted that tax accounting in tax authorities is not the only task of such departments, as was already indicated earlier.  A sufficiently important manifestation of the work of the Federal Tax Service is the control of its own structure.  That is, the body actually organizes the work of its units to more effectively and efficiently achieve their developed goals. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we found out that the <span>Federal Tax Service</span> and the Ministry of Finance are the key tax authorities in Russia.  Today, their activities are quite effective.  But this fact is not a reason to stop the development of these organs. </p>
