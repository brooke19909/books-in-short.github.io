    <p>  A long-livers among the human race is considered to be one whose age is significantly greater than the average norm.  Each country has its own age.  For example, in the USA this indicator is 85 years old, in Russia - 90 years.  The global <span>average age of a</span> long-liver is 90 years. </p><p>  If you rely on the official data of the Book of Records, the longest-lived man in the world among women is Jeanne-Louise Kalman from France, who has reached 122 years, and among men - Jiroemon Kimura from Japan, who has lived to 116 years.  Get to know them a little closer. </p><p>  The longest-living person in the world: Jeanne Kalman </p><p>  In her life, this venerable lady has never encountered a job, which, in her opinion, is the secret of longevity.  Instead of wasting time sitting in the office, Kelman trained.  Her program included a wide variety of sports - from tennis to fencing.  The Frenchwoman associated her long life with the fact that she ate a lot of vegetables and practically did not eat meat products.  It is worth noting that Jeanne Kelman smoked even in her one hundred seventeen years.  The reason for quitting smoking was not her health condition at all, but the fact that she had to ask someone to light a cigarette, since she herself almost lost her sight.  Jeanne Kelman died in August 1997. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  He was born in the city of Ketango, before retiring he worked at the post office.  But instead of a well-deserved rest, he decided to engage in agriculture.  Kimura celebrated his 116th birthday in a circle of a huge number of relatives: 15 grandchildren, 24 great-grandchildren and 14 great-great-grandchildren.  The mayor of Ketango came to him personally for his birthday.  In order to survive at least a hundred years, you must eat fish.  This is the secret of longevity from the point of view of this centenarian.  The Japanese did not drink alcohol, did not overeat, but smoked.  Jiroemon Kimura died on June 12, 2013. </p><p>  If we take the historical data, then the title of "The most adult in the world" deserves the Chinese Lee Ching-yun.  He died in 1933 at the age of 256 years.  In his entire life he had 23 wives and 180 heirs.  Physically, Lee Ching-yun was strong: at the age of 70 he taught martial arts in the Chinese army.  To strengthen his health, the man used infusions of medicinal herbs, which he himself collected.  Performing exercises from early childhood, peace of mind, eating rice and wine - this is the secret of Li Ching-yong's longevity.  According to the archives of China, the longest-lived person in the world received congratulations from the Imperial Government of China on its 150th anniversary and 200th anniversary. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the oldest person in the world" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15252/221090.jpg" width="560"></div>

    <p>  The most famous country in terms of the number of centenarians is Japan, the second place belongs to Sweden, and the third is Great Britain.  The secret of longevity of the inhabitants of these countries can be considered eating a large amount of seafood, soy, green tea.  According to modern scientists, the most long-lived people have a certain genetic combination that allows them to live long.  Worldwide, such unique people are only about 5%.  Of course, not only this factor, but also much more influences the life expectancy: our lifestyle, various diseases, stresses, ecology, nutrition. </p>
