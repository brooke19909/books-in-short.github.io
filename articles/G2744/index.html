Here, skilled chefs serve a buffet consisting of a variety of well-prepared dishes.  In addition, there are three √† la carte restaurants on site.  In them you can order from the menu. </p><h2>  Al Nabila Grand Bay Makadi Resort: Russian traveler reviews </h2><p>  Today, most tourists pay great attention to the issue of choosing a hotel for vacation in a particular country.  So, modern travelers no longer trust solely the recommendations of managers from travel agencies and the official description offered by hotels.  In addition to this, people planning a vacation try to study as many reviews as possible from those who have already managed to visit this or that place.  This helps to identify the real pros and cons of the hotel, and thereby get a more complete and close to reality impression.  After all, no one wants to experience unpleasant surprise, going on a long-awaited vacation.  Taking into account all of the above, we decided to make your task a bit easier and save time.  So, we suggest you familiarize yourself with the generalized comments of our compatriots regarding their stay in Al Nabila Grand Bay Makadi 5 *.  Reviews, it should be noted, for the most part were positive.  So, almost all tourists were satisfied with the choice of hotel.  But we offer to understand everything in more detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="al nabila grand bay makadi 5" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/981574.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel itself </h2><p>  In general, most of the guests were satisfied with the rooms provided.  By the way, as travelers say, since the hotel is not new, some apartments require repairs.  Renovation has already been carried out in some buildings, but there is a possibility that you will be accommodated in a room without new repairs.  Experienced tourists recommend that if you are not satisfied with the conditions of accommodation, ask to relocate you.  And it is best to contact the hotel‚Äôs customer service manager right away, and not the reception administrator.  In most cases, guests were provided with satisfying apartments.  The rooms, according to our compatriots, have everything you need.  Even if the furniture and appliances are not new, everything will be in good working condition.  In case of any problems, contact the reception, and all malfunctions will be fixed as soon as possible.  As for the cleaning at Al Nabila Grand Bay Makadi Hotel, the guests did not have any particular complaints about its quality. </p><p>  A small drawback, some tourists considered the hotel to have only paid Internet.  Moreover, he catches far from everywhere.  Therefore, many of our compatriots preferred to purchase SIM cards of local mobile operators with a package of mobile Internet.  It came out cheaper, and access to the World Wide Web was everywhere. </p><h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  In this matter, the opinions of the guests were divided.  So, someone was not very pleased with the fact that there was very little green in the hotel complex.  However, many tourists in their reviews note that the design of the territory is consistent with the Egyptian spirit.  However, in any case, all guests agree that it is very clean.  The territory, according to hotel guests, is planned very competently. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="al nabila grand bay makadi resort 5" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/981558.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Kitchen </h2><p>  As is the case with the vast majority of hotels in different countries of the world, the opinions of tourists regarding food in Al Nabila Grand Bay Makadi, reviews of which we are currently studying, differ.  So, some tourists believe that in a five-star hotel complex this moment should be organized at a higher level.  However, most guests claim that everything is not so bad.  So, according to them, the choice of dishes here is very large.  In addition, you can always pick up something for lovers of spicy food, and for those who prefer to do without seasoning.  The guests also praised a variety of snacks, salads, fruits and, of course, sweets.  However, our compatriots expressed some complaints about cereals, since they are prepared here quite unusual for Russians.  In this regard, some guests experienced some difficulties in finding their children suitable food for breakfast. </p><p>  As for the √† la carte restaurants, many guests were satisfied with the quality of food and the level of service in them.  Most of all, tourists praise the Arabian restaurant.  According to them, the cooks in it are excellent, and you will certainly be satisfied with the meal. </p><p>  Tourists leave a lot of comments about the bars in the hotel.  So, the guests as a whole were satisfied with the service and quality of the drinks.  In addition, in snack bars there was always the opportunity to eat pizza, hot dog, hamburger or other similar food throughout the day.  Some of our compatriots considered a small minus the fact that beer in bars was poured into small plastic glasses.  As a result, guests have to come back much more often for a new portion of the drink. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="al nabila grand bay makadi reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/981557.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  According to the vast majority of tourists, the Al Nabila Grand Bay Makadi Resort 5 * hotel is a great place for those who dream of a great beach holiday.  So, our compatriots enthusiastically describe the large lagoon in their reviews, in which their own sandy beach of the hotel complex is located.  According to them, the water here is very clean.  Near the coast there is a densely populated reef.  So lovers of watching the life of bright and amazing marine life will love it here.  By the way, experienced travelers are advised not to forget to take a mask for snorkeling from home or already in Egypt.  Also, flippers will not be superfluous.  As for the wind and the waves it causes, since the beach is in the lagoon, here this phenomenon is not as frequent as on most of the Red Sea coast.  Therefore, nothing will interfere with your vacation. </p><p>  The beach itself, judging by the comments of most tourists, is quite large.  It is often cleaned, there are many bins.  However, our compatriots advise all vacationers to behave more culturally.  Indeed, despite the fact that there are litter bins a few meters from the sunbeds, some tourists simply throw cigarette butts or glasses into the sand, which often negates the efforts of beach workers to clean up the area.  As for the sunbeds, they are wooden here, very comfortable.  There are enough sun loungers for everyone who wants to relax on the beach.  So there is no need to occupy them in the morning.  There is also a bar serving drinks and snacks on the yarn.  Here you can ride a camel and a donkey and take pictures with them. </p>

    <p>  Nor did our compatriots complain about the fact that the beach is located at a certain distance from the hotel.  So, according to tourists, you can reach it in five minutes.  Moreover, the road goes downhill, so it‚Äôs rather nice to go to the coast.  On the contrary, almost everyone returned using the transfer.  So, a bus between the hotel and the beach runs all day.  This fact was especially welcomed by older tourists and vacationers with young children. </p><h2>  Entertainment at the hotel </h2><p>  Of course, many guests consider a beach holiday to be the main entertainment in the Al Nabila Grand Bay Makadi 5 * hotel complex.  However, you can have a good time on site.  So, there are several pools, spacious sunbathing terraces with comfortable sun loungers, bars with a large selection of drinks for every taste, water slides and much more.  In addition, the hotel has an animation team all day.  They will offer you to do water aerobics, yoga, play volleyball, darts.  In the evening, a disco is held for both the youngest tourists and adult vacationers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="al nabila grand bay makadi 5 reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/981554.jpg" width="600"></div>
