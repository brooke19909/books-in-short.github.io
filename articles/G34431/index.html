    <h2>  Land wealth </h2><p>  Kaali meteorite crater is one of the attractions that attracts increased attention of tourists.  The landscape is mostly flat in nature.  The highest point is a hill called Raunam√§gi (54 m), which is near Kihelkonn, in its western part.  In 1957, the Viidum√§e Nature Reserve was founded here. </p><p>  There is also a large number of woodlands (about forty percent of the territory occupied by the island of Saaremaa).  The largest lakes here are Suur-Laht, Karuj√§rv, as well as Mullutu-Laht, which is near Karl.  Geologists are extremely interested in dolomite mined in local quarries.  During the late ice age there was a vast ice layer that pressed against the crust of the earth.  It is for this reason that the territory described today is characterized by depression. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  When the Moonsund Archipelago was subject to melting, the surface began to rise.  In a year it reaches two millimeters.  Above sea level, the island rises by an average of 15 meters. </p>

    <h2>  Architecture </h2><p>  Holidays in the Baltic States are a great way to get rid of stress and saturate the soul with vivid impressions.  It will not be superfluous to visit the local town hall, the beginning of construction of which is dated 1654.  This building was created on the initiative of Count Delagardi. </p><p>  The architecture of the building is simple and rigorous.  It can be attributed to the northern baroque.  The impression from the inspection of the town hall is quite strong.  A majestic detail is the portal on which the date 1670 is printed, as well as an inscription in Latin in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe cornice.  Once inside, you can see the largest painting on the ceiling in all of Estonia.  Walking along the first floor, visitors get to the tourist information center, as well as to the gallery of the town hall.  It is also possible to look into the City Council. </p><p>  Tours to Estonia are bought up quite quickly thanks to the many local attractions.  Without moving too far from the town hall, you can stumble upon another interesting point - the tower, which was previously used as a fire station.  It was erected in 1911, the hoses were dried in the building, starting in 1958.  Subsequently, a new depot was created near the bus station.  Then the old point was leased.  Now they own it on a private basis.  Today you can visit here to eat in the restaurant "Squats grill and bar." </p>

    <h2>  Interesting places </h2><p>  No less remarkable point is the Kurzal, which was created according to the project of a local pharmacist.  The building was built over 8 months.  Opened in June 1989. </p><p>  A restaurant complex was located in the central white room, and offices and a kitchen block were located on the territory of the right wing.  The theater hall served as a stage for performances by Estonian artists. </p><p>  Often there were troupes from Germany.  This building functioned only during bathing, that is, in the summer.  In 1989, the building was awarded the title of the best architectural composition created in 1988 in Estonia. </p><p>  It‚Äôs nice to go to the tavern called Veski, which is a <span>windmill</span> .  There are only two more such buildings, which are located in the city limits and are still functioning. </p><p>  Another institution is no less popular.  It is located on the territory of the former mill.  Previously, this place was called Trey, as such was the name of its owner and creator.  This item was founded in 1899 and successfully functioned until the Second World War.  In 1972, restoration was carried out here, so that already in 1974 it was possible to get to the local cafe.  The state assigned the mill the status of an important architectural monument.  Its height is 24 m taking into account the blades. </p><h2>  Curious to visit </h2><p>  The tower of the city of Kuressaare was built in accordance with the plan of the Swedish tycoon Count Delagardi, who was the ruler of these lands from 1648 to 1654.  In 1663, all construction work on this project was completed. </p>
