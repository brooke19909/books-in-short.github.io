What to buy to protect against four-legged aggressors?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Modern man is exposed to many dangers every day, and aggressive animals are not the last of them.  Dog attacks happen too often, agile, quick dogs are serious opponents for humans.  Will a self-defense device like electroshock help a dog? </p><h2>  Will the shocker handle the animal? </h2><p>  Modern electric shocks are a very powerful weapon.  Are applied <noindex>  <span>self-defense shockers</span> </noindex>  , as well as to deter aggressors.  Given a sufficiently high voltage, they can easily cope with people. </p><p>  How is the canine organism different from the human?  In terms of electricity, nothing but size and mass.  If you manage to squeeze a device of class I power to the body of the animal and hold the discharge for at least 3 seconds - you can completely deprive the enemy of consciousness. </p><p>  However, the difficulty lies precisely in approaching the dog, but not becoming a victim of his teeth.  A skirmish with a dog is almost always accompanied by wounds and other unpleasant moments.  Therefore, if the attack did not happen unexpectedly, it is better to try to scare away the animal first. </p><h2>  The scaring effect of a stun gun </h2><p>  It is widely known that spark gaps have a certain psychological effect. <noindex>  <span>In Yekaterinburg to buy a stun gun</span> </noindex>  maybe everyone, however, statistics tell us that dog attacks happen almost daily, and sometimes even these devices do not save them.  Why is this happening? </p><p>  The thing is that not all shockers are equally good repellers.  Their effect depends on several factors: </p><ul><li>  The frequency of sparking.  Low-frequency devices operating in the range of 50‚Äì100 Hz emit a distinct crack, and the sound of shockers with a frequency of more than 100 Hz is similar to a buzzing sound.  Dogs are much more afraid of high-frequency sounds. </li><li>  Volume.  Sound volume depends on power.  The most powerful paralyzers crack at a level of 90-100 dB.  The human pain threshold is 120 decibels, in dogs it is lower because their hearing is more sensitive. </li><li>  Voltage.  High-voltage devices give a more distinct, bright arc that scares animals, and more ozone is released from the discharge into the air - gas, the smell of which is unpleasant to all animals without exception! </li></ul><p>  And do not forget that you can scare away a dog only from a certain distance - usually it is 10-15 meters.  If you are holding a device of class I power in your hands - the likelihood that the dog will be scared and retire is very high! </p></div></article>
