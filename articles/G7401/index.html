    <p>  If you came to rest in Cuba with your family, visit the Blau Marina Varadero hotel - reviews of it as a clean, comfortable and conveniently located hotel with cheerful and friendly staff cannot but please against the background of the general, not very funny picture of the Cuban life. </p><p>  Many tourists with pleasure noted precisely the good location of the local staff to the Russian guests, perhaps the unity of spirit and brotherly love have developed historically.  Be that as it may, all the guests noted the excellent service in the rooms and on the territory, the work of the animation team was also liked by many. </p><p>  All the hotel guests were delighted with the wonderful nature of the park area, and, of course, the large beach with white, clean, gentle sand did not leave anyone indifferent.  Tourists traveling with children noted that children were especially pleased to delve into it and build castles and canals. </p><p>  But this hotel did not appeal to any youth company or those who came to Cuba for vivid impressions of a noisy life.  Young people should choose hotels that are closer to the center of Varadero, and the remoteness of the Blau Marina hotel can be an advantage for those who value peace and relaxation from the hustle and bustle.  Therefore, for tourists who love a measured vacation, the hotel staff is ready to hospitably open the doors, meet and serve at the highest level. </p>
