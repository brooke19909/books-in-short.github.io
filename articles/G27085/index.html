Sentido Blue Sea Beach 5 * (Crete) is no exception.  Guest reviews contain the following information: </p><ul><li>  already at the booking stage there is a mess with payment (although it must be made upon arrival, a large amount is blocked on the credit card when making a reservation); </li><li>  even if you agreed in advance with the hotel about early check-in, this does not mean that you will be able to check into your room immediately upon arrival; </li><li>  for most guests, the complete surprise is the fact that only those guests who have a rest on the all-inclusive system can use the beach for free, and everyone else must pay an entrance fee of 4 euros; </li><li>  on the road to the sea you need to cross a busy highway; </li><li>  there are no amenities on the beach like showers or changing rooms; </li><li>  quite often, guests are accommodated in rooms that do not correspond to the reserved category (do not be shy to raise this issue and make a complaint); </li><li>  the hotel has no elevators or ramps; </li><li>  the descent to the beach is very steep and, as a result, traumatic; </li><li>  a very small pool in which there is not enough space if all guests decide to swim in it; </li><li>  the restaurants are very slow waiters, who are also not very welcoming with guests; </li><li>  in the dining room the same music is constantly spinning in a circle; </li><li>  despite the fact that the hotel is located almost on the seashore, fish dishes in the buffet menu are practically absent; </li><li>  due to shower problems and the absence of a special partition, water flows throughout the bathroom; </li><li>  the entire bathroom is covered with black mold and other types of fungus; </li><li>  bath towels are old, washed, and also have holes; </li><li>  bedding is changed very rarely; </li><li>  for beach towels you have to pay a deposit of 10 euros, which can be collected only the next day; </li><li>  rather cramped rooms with modest equipment; </li><li>  on the territory, as well as in all areas of the hotel, there are a lot of mosquitoes that they do not fight with; </li><li>  on the door to the bathroom there is no lock, no hook, or anything else that can be locked; </li><li>  no matter how many people occupy the room, only one key is given per room. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Sentido Blue Sea Beach 5 * travelers leave a certain impression on themselves.  The hotel has simply luxurious territory, which is completely planted with greenery.  Especially guests like the fact that fruit trees grow here.  Therefore, if you come to rest during the harvest season, you can enjoy fresh fruits right from the tree.  Nevertheless, if you want to take a walk, you should be prepared for the fact that there are practically no special paths and benches in the territory.  Apparently, everything is designed for vacationers to sunbathe on the beach for days. </p><p>  Choosing for your vacation hotel Sentido Blue Sea Beach 5 * (Greece), be prepared for the surprises that begin at the booking stage.  Even if you carry out this procedure directly through the official website, and not through third-party resources, this does not mean that you will end up in the exact number that you ordered.  That is why take the appropriate printouts with you to be able to prove your case.  Well, of course, it may come as a complete surprise to you that for such basic services as, for example, using the beach, you will have to pay separately if you are not resting on an all-inclusive basis. </p><p>  Many experienced travelers who previously had time to relax at the Sentido Blue Sea Beach 5 * Stalida hotel note the fact that it does not correspond in any way to its high status.  Someone considers him a weak "four", someone - a good "three", but not a "five".  If you intend to choose this particular vacation option, tune in to the clear sea, delicious food and beautiful landscapes.  At the same time, be prepared for possible flaws and shortcomings and try not to pay special attention to them.  In this case, your Greek holiday will bring you only positive emotions and an unforgettable experience. </p>
