    <h2>  Entertainment Comments </h2><p>  Since Egypt attracts most tourists because of its magnificent beach holidays, travelers are very interested in choosing a hotel, how close the sea is, what is the entry into the water, is there a reef, etc. As for the ‚ÄúTitanic Beach Spa Waterpark 5 *‚Äù (Hurghada ), then here you can enjoy a beach holiday to the fullest.  So, the hotel is located on the first line.  You can walk to the sea in a couple of minutes.  The beach at the hotel is quite large and clean.  According to tourists, there is a sufficient number of sunbeds and umbrellas for everyone.  You can also rent water sports equipment.  Guests note that if you go into the water directly from the shore, then you will have to go quite a long time to the depths.  And it is recommended to do this in special shoes so as not to injure your legs.  Many tourists preferred to swim from the pier.  Here it is wide and long.  So, to the depth on it you need to walk about 500 meters.  Most travelers did not embarrass this fact, but if desired, it was possible to get to the bathing place on a special minibus.  Near the hotel there is a live reef with a lot of interesting inhabitants.  So it makes sense to grab a snorkeling mask from home or buy it already in place. </p><p>  In their reviews, our compatriots note that you can have a great rest not only on the beach, but also on the hotel premises.

So, during the day, people are invited to do water aerobics, gymnastics, yoga, take part in sporting events and fun contests.  In the evening, entertainment is offered on site.
