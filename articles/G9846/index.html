    <h2>  Preparation of materials </h2><p>  All elements of natural origin must be collected in dry weather.  It is advisable to let them lie down a bit in the room until completely dry.  After a while, a moist, fresh spruce cone will turn from a thin to a large one that has opened.  This must be taken into account.  If it is necessary to keep the form, coating is applied with an aqueous solution of <span>wood glue.</span>  In a few days, modeling will begin.  Everything that you find in nature should not have visible damage: holes, dents, mold, rot.  High-quality materials will allow the craft to maintain an attractive appearance for a long time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Cones, acorns and everything else is better to sort and sort right away.  Smooth, neat should be used in its entirety, and those where there are not enough scales, hats, can be disassembled into parts and used separately.  If you need a bear made of cones, acorn caps or pine scales will work as ears. </p><h2>  Material combination </h2><p>  In any artwork, the technique of contrast looks spectacular: color, texture, shape, size.  This is one of the methods of composition with which harmony is achieved.  A bear from cones and plasticine, threads, balls, grains, nuts will look good.  You can use chestnuts, acorns, sticks, matches as additional elements.  Good combination of natural textures and artificial.  For example, you buy eyes or a nose in a handicraft store ready-made plastic, designed for soft toys.  They will give your little animal a certain facial expression and facial expressions.  Although they can be made from plasticine, peppercorns, pebbles.  In a word, you need to show imagination, and then your bear from the cones will turn out magnificent. </p><h2>  Fir cones </h2><p>  Tips common to all the works were said above, now specific options and methods for their manufacture will be considered: how to make a bear out of cones of spruce, pine, their combinations.  You can make a beast of large size or in the form of a miniature desktop souvenir.  Very simple samples will be offered, which even a small child will cope on his own, others will require joint efforts with an adult. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Any work begins with the preparation of everything necessary.

    <p>  Such a bear can be obtained in several ways.  Option 1 includes the following steps: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  Build a body of several large elements. </li><li>  Attach a head from one bump to it. </li><li>  Ears are made of pre-separated flakes. </li><li>  For paws, take also two elements. </li><li>  You make pompons from white threads: round for the muzzle and cut in shape for the feet and ears.  They are obtained by winding yarn on a cardboard blank in the form of a ring, then cutting along the perimeter and pulling it into a ball.  This method can be obtained in any form. </li><li>  Attach pompons with glue or wire to the right places. </li><li>  Set eyes, nose.  Decorate with a scarf. </li></ol><p>  Option 2 is made using a completely different technology.  Such a bear is done very easily from cones with his own hands.  Take an old soft toy and glue it with pine scales, leaving fluffy paws, the inside of the ears and the muzzle. </p><p>  The following is the simplest of cones.  Photo clearly demonstrates this.  Such a craft can build even a baby.  The cardboard form can be cut as a whole or in separate elements.  In the first case, two bumps are used for the body on both sides of the workpiece.  In the second embodiment, the legs and head are inserted between the scales and glued. </p>

    <ol><li>  Take a good big fir cone for the body. </li><li>  You attach to it a pine, which has opened in a flat form, as a head. </li><li>  Muzzle and ears get from the caps of acorns. </li><li>  Eyes and nose are made of peppercorns. </li><li>  Four small pine cones are used for paws.  Try to strengthen them so that the craft is stable. </li></ol><h2>  Bear made of cones and plasticine </h2><p>  In the previous examples, the elements were connected using glue or wire.  The same can be done with plasticine.  The most important thing is to use the appropriate color so that it is as invisible as possible among brown scales.  Try to press the elements tightly against each other and take a sufficient amount of clay. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cone bear" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/628376.jpg" width="360"></div>

    <p>  By the way, it can also be used as a decor.  Then choose any color.  From it make a muzzle, eyes, ears, jewelry. </p><h2>  Big bear made of cones </h2><p>  If you need a monumental decoration of the interior, use the following sample.  This figure is assembled from a huge number of elements.  You will have to spend a lot of time in the spruce forest.  This option is suitable as a collective work. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="big bear made of cones" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/628373.jpg" width="205"></div>  To build such a sculpture, you will need to perform the following steps: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <ol><li>  Make a frame.  If you do it using the papier-m√¢ch√© method, you can use the finished solid form of sculpture.  Then it will turn out hollow.  Newspapers and paper are stuffed inside.  In the lower legs it is worth putting something heavier, for example, bars for the stability of the structure.  If there is no ready-made wooden bear, it makes sense to create a form yourself from a mass of paper mixed with gypsum, starch or glue.  Large forms are also created from polyurethane foam. </li><li>  At the second stage, an outer layer of cones is made.  Of course, you can completely build a sculpture of them, but in this case they will need much more.  Choose for yourself.  In any case, all the elements are connected with glue.  You can use a thermal gun.  In it, under the influence of temperature, special glue sticks melt and the composition enters the nozzle, from which it is squeezed out to the joint.  Work with this tool must be carried out under the supervision of adults. </li><li>  When the main form is made, decorative elements are performed: the muzzle, the inner parts of the ears in the form of pompons from threads, as well as a scarf from any material, natural or artificial. </li></ol><p>  Now you will get the same magnificent bear from cones.  A master class will certainly help in creating a sculptural masterpiece. </p><h2>  Fashion teddy bear </h2><p>  If you have already decided to go in for creativity and are going to make souvenirs for your pleasure or as gifts to relatives and friends, try dressing your hero in bright things.  Items in his wardrobe can be crocheted or knitted, sewn, or even used clothes for dolls. </p>

    <p>  Ideas for decorating are very different.  Let it be a bear made of cones, dressed as Santa Claus or Snow Maiden.  Great gift for the New Year.  It is not necessary to dress the souvenir from head to toe.  It is important not to overdo it and preserve the beauty of natural material.  It will be enough cap of Santa Claus or the crown of the Snow Maiden. </p><p>  If you want to make a gift to one of your friends or relatives, decorate the bear with the element of clothing that is most characteristic of this person.  An original hat, scarf or bow will be quite enough. </p><h2>  Polar bear </h2><p>  In addition to decorating with additional things, it is worth using the magic of color.  Take plasticine in bright shades or even paint to create a specific image of your hero.  If you paint a bump in white color from the crafts presented in the photo, you get a polar bear. </p>
