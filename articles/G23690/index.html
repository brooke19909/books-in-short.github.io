    <p>  It's better to start a story with the simplest options.  So, what do you need to know when understanding how to sew an apron?  Grade 5 is still that time, the girls are not very good at mastering any skill, so product patterns should be as simple as possible.  For this method, you will need two main details: one is square (this will be the chest area), the second is rectangular (cut along the waist).  You will also need two long narrow strips - one will be worn around the neck (harness), the second is the apron belt.  So, it‚Äôs better to start the work from the upper - chest part.  It is necessary to cut out a square or rectangle from the fabric, wrap it around all the edges, and start the line.  Next, you need to calculate the length of the part of the apron that will be worn on the neck, cut the fabric, fold in half, bending the fabric inward at the edges.  You also need to give a fastener along this part.  The next and final stage of work on the upper part is the connection of two finished parts.  To do this, attach the harness to the chest part and sew in a few lines.  Now you can proceed to the larger, main part.  Here you also need to cut a rectangle of fabric of the desired length.  As for the width, it can be different, because the apron will be in warehouses (the larger the width of the fabric, the more magnificent the apron will be in the final version).  We go further, understanding how to sew an apron (Grade 5).  Now you need to create warehouses or make an assembly (optional).  Warehouses need to be secured with pins (they can be oncoming or sequential).  To make the assembly, you just need to put on the typewriter the widest line and, pulling the lower thread, pick up the fabric to the desired width.  Having completely prepared the lower part of the apron, you need to make a belt.  It is done according to the principle of the harness on the neck: you need a piece of fabric that will bend strictly in half, the ends will be wrapped inward, everything will be fixed with a line on the machine.  All parts are ready, you can form an apron.  To do this, you need to fasten the upper and lower parts with the help of a belt, letting one line on the top, theft on the bottom.  The apron is ready! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sew an apron pattern" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/434250.jpg" width="400"></div></h2><h2>  Method 2. One-piece </h2><p>  There is another fairly easy way to sew an apron (Grade 5).  However, in this embodiment, the product will not be stitched, but whole, from one piece of fabric.  To do this, you will need to prepare a fairly large section of fabric, a slanting inlay that will form the edges, as well as a harness and ribbon ties. </p><h2>  Pattern </h2><p>  However, before embarking on sewing, you need to prepare a pattern.  There are several ways to do this.  The first and simplest: as a pattern, a ready-made favorite mother‚Äôs apron can serve, according to its principle, the fabric should be cut out.  However, experienced seamstresses will say that this is wrong.  It is necessary to understand how to sew an apron correctly and in accordance with all the rules.  The pattern in this case must be created manually, according to certain calculations.  So, the width of the apron will be approximately 50 cm, the length is 55. The upper part of the chest (length) is 20 cm, the lower part is 35 cm. You will also need to make a smooth transition from the chest part to the main part, having drawn the semi-manually.  That's all the calculations.  And in order for the apron to turn out to be symmetrical, the product must be cut in folded form. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="stitch apron white" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/434248.jpg" width="375"></div></h2><h2>  Sewing </h2><p>  So, what else does it take to get an apron?  Do it yourself with your own hands or buy a slanting trim.  To prepare it yourself, you need to cut a strip of fabric along the oblique, fold it in half lengthwise, bending inward with the ends (this will be much more beautiful).  Since the product is one-piece, there should be a lot of oblique collar.  First, we sheathe the sides and bottom of the apron (it is as if slanting on the fabric, fitting around its edges): first there is a basting, only then the line starts on the machine.  Second approach: the upper part of the apron is sheathed.  Here you need to correctly calculate the length of the <span>slanting inline,</span> taking into account the ties on both sides, as well as the harness on the neck.  Everything is sewn in one line as if in a circle.  A simple apron is ready! </p>

    <h2>  Jewelry </h2><p>  It is worth considering how the apron can be decorated.  So, for this you can make a pocket or simply dress up the item with lace.  To create a pocket, you just need to cut out the fabric of the desired shape (the pocket can be square, semicircular, rectangular, etc.), tuck the edges (the top can either be tucked inside or decorated with the same oblique trim).  A pocket is sewn onto the product on the front side.  That's all done!  Lace can also be put on the bottom of the product, as well as affordable, just by sewing them with a line. </p><h2>  Simple rules </h2><p>  If you want to sew an apron, remember a few simple rules: </p><ol><li>  If you need to sew an apron (white, green or red), the threads can be selected both in tone and in a contrasting color, this is allowed. </li><li>  All edges of the product must be overlocked (you can not do this if the edge is completely wrapped inward). </li><li>  If the bias is done manually, you need to grind it at an angle, and not directly. </li><li>  After work, the product must be ironed. </li></ol>
