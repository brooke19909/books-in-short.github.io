    <h2>  Azure, rest </h2><p>  Misfora is located in the village, which deservedly got its name for the amazing color of sea water.  There are many offers for sea holidays.  There are boarding houses and recreation centers that have been functioning since Soviet times.  But a huge part has been built in recent years.  Good competition are mini-hotels and the private sector.  The number of resort housing is increasing, because more and more vacationers are coming here. </p><p>  The village is located a hundred kilometers from Kherson at the base of the protected spit Dzharylgach.  The air here is healing, especially for children, cures asthma and other diseases of the respiratory tract.  The eastern beaches of the village are interesting in that you can swim here both in the open sea and in the Dzharylgach Bay.  It happens that jellyfish come here, and after storms a lot of algae swims in the water.  But it pays off with a wonderful climate, warm sea and amazing landscapes.  The Dzharylgach spit is separated from the Cote d'Azur by a shallow strait, which at low water levels you can even wade. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Azure Boarding House Misfora" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1609910.jpg" width="300"></div>
