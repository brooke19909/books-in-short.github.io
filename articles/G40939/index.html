About 100 years ago, it was an industrial center.  Plants and factories were concentrated here, as well as several sawmills.  Today, the appearance of the district has changed significantly.  The central part is occupied by the city market, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich is over 4.6 thousand km <sup>2</sup> .

Sun Yat-sen Garden is unique.  It is the only <span>Chinese garden</span> that is located outside of China.  It was built quite quickly.  Construction lasted from 1985 to 1986.  The Chinese garden was named after the founder of the Kuomintang party, Sun Yat-sen, who was posthumously named the father of the nation. </p><p>  Over the creation of the park zone, Canadian specialists and two craftsmen from China worked.  The garden is made in the classical style of the Ming Dynasty.  Designs do not contain such fasteners as glue, nails and screws. </p><div class="photo" data-original="paperlief.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sun Yat-sen - Chinese Garden" class="if uuid-2593509" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32232/2593509.jpg"></div><p>  The garden is divided into two zones: paid, where tours for tourists are held, and free.

In Canada, it is considered the longest.  Its length is 136 m, and its height reaches 70 m. The bridge is spread over the seething river Capilano and received the same name.  The very name of the river is associated with the name of one of the Indian leaders who headed the tribes that once lived on these lands. </p><p>  The bridge was built in 1889 according to the project of Grant Mackay - a civil engineer from Scotland.  As materials for construction, cedar boards and hemp ropes were used.  In 1903, reconstruction was made: the ropes were replaced with metal cables.  In 1956, the bridge was rebuilt anew.  Interestingly, this attraction is privately owned, so to walk along the bridge, you need to buy a ticket: an adult will cost $ 38 excluding taxes, and a child - $ 12.  Up to 800 thousand tourists come here every year. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="suspension bridge" class="if uuid-2593561" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32232/2593561.jpg"></div><h2>  Mount graus </h2><p>  Be sure to visit Mount Graus if you decide to visit the city of Vancouver in Canada.
