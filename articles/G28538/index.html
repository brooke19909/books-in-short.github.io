There is everything that the soul of a whimsical tourist can only wish for: the sea and the sun, a cultural day program and a rich evening, turning into night life.  You can spend several days on this extraordinary island, visiting flamenco shows, numerous casinos and exotic shows, or you can spend a relaxing vacation as Tenerife hotels offer - relaxed, lazy and with pleasure. </p><p>  Holidays on the Spanish island </p><p>  The island of Tenerife is a place of amazing exotic that invites tourists to go on a fabulous journey - through water parks and amusement parks, to hunt for sharks and to stunning shows in which dolphins, parrots and seals participate.  A separate advantage that can be obtained in Tenerife is clean <span>beaches, the gentle</span> sea ‚Äã‚Äãand the generous sun.  You can‚Äôt come here only on weekends - this time will not be enough to appreciate a unique magical vacation.  The best thing is to get to this <span>Spanish island</span> for a couple of weeks, evaluate Tenerife hotels and choose one that is most comfortable and inexpensive, after which you should devote your entire vacation to the most sophisticated form of relaxation - blissful idleness. </p><p>  Places for a perfect life </p><p>  If you want to leave your review of hotels in Tenerife, then, for sure, it will concern, first of all, the high quality of service in them.  This island - a piece of Europe in the endless sea - differs from many of its ‚Äúcolleagues‚Äù in the comfort of staying in hotels and the high-class level of <span>customer service.</span>  Like any European <span>hotels,</span> Tenerife <span>hotels</span> differ in the number of stars in several categories.  Staying for a few days in many hotels is not too expensive - unless, of course, there is an influx of tourists, because in the midst of the tourist season prices may rise several times.  However, not a single trip to the island of entertainment and pleasures of Tenerife will be too expensive - according to many travelers. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  An excellent vacation is guaranteed by visitors from different countries at the Sol Tenerife 4 * hotel, located on the coast, a few meters from the cleanest and most well-kept beach.  From here you can start the journey around the island - stop, go for a walk on the sea boulevard, and then go to the resort and entertainment area, since it starts right next to the hotel.  Gaming lounges and discos, restaurants and bars - this is what awaits the guests of this hotel.  Perhaps, only pet owners who are accustomed to rest with their pets will be dissatisfied: this animal, as well as many other Tenerife hotels, is strictly prohibited. </p><p>  For those who do not like to be in a crowd and appreciate a quiet seclusion, the H10 Las Palmeras 4 * hotel is perfect.  Here you can spend your vacation by the large pools, play tennis or billiards, and also take unique walks in the huge subtropical park, which occupies a huge territory around the hotel (more than 14,000 m2). </p><p>  Many Tenerife hotels offer visitors services such as babysitting, which allows parents to devote some time to themselves.  The Guayarmina Princess 4 * hotel is notable for its low prices and a wide range of services provided to foreign guests, which include the provision <span>of babysitting services.</span>  It has a wonderful calm beach, children's pools and spacious rooms, from whose windows an indescribably beautiful view of the ocean opens.  In addition, there is an excellent evening program for adults and a well-equipped playground.  In general, there is everything you need for the common relaxation of parents and children. </p>
