Until recently, this company singled out excellent and fast Internet rather than mobile communications as its dominant area.  More recently, she nevertheless announced the launch of a cellular signal throughout the state. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider five different modems that differ in form, configuration and dimensions.  It should be noted that their maximum speed is the same for everyone.  This review will help you understand which option is best for the consumer. </p><h2>  Yota USB Modem for PC </h2><p>  This model is the simplest of all that the manufacturer produces.  This modem does not perform any additional functions, it only provides a signal when connected through the corresponding port. </p><p>  This keychain has a standard design and configuration.  The case is assembled from plastic.  Painted in metal color.  The weight is small, therefore, throwing it in a pocket or bag, the owner does not even feel the modem.  When connected to a computer, the model logo glows blue, which indicates a successful connection. </p><p>  How to connect the Yota router?  The USB port that is installed in the modem has a swivel design.  Thus, using the device with a computer, it can be placed vertically.  This action allows you to make special clamps.  The port itself is small in size, it is narrow, therefore quite compact.  It has no protection.  Not far from it is a lot for inserting a SIM card. </p><p>  Due to the fact that the modem did not receive additional options, the manufacturer made it so that it did not have to be constantly configured.  Customer reviews indicate that it is enough to insert the modem into the port, as soon as the Internet appears.  The connection process can last no more than 15 seconds.  Drivers and software are redundant.  The modem is compatible with any existing operating system.  The average cost of the device is 2 thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iota router" class="if" height="346" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1812527.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  USB / Wi-Fi modem Yota </h2><p>  Not only a laptop and computer need the Internet.  Do not forget about your phone.  The next modem - the Yota mobile router - will easily provide access to any social networks and resources.  Unlike the previous version, this device works with a wireless network module, which allows you to distribute the Internet by connecting the model to a computer. </p><p>  This version has become a little wider.  She still gained weight, but not critically.  The Wi-Fi logo of the Yota router glows exactly the same, and the case is no different from the previous model.  Connecting to a computer is similar.  The connector is flip type, not only USB, but also a SIM card slot is hidden under it.  On the back side you can find a modification - there is a micro-USB connector.  Thanks to this, it is allowed to work with any power source.  In this case, the Internet will be distributed independently. </p><p>  This Yota modem router is a plug-in type, so there is no battery here.  In order for it to work, you need to find a power source.  Drivers, again, are not needed, the network is configured independently within the first 20 seconds.  If you need to change the password or, conversely, set it, you can go to the computer‚Äôs browser, having previously connected the module, and go to the control panel website. </p><p>  This model is quite economical and versatile.  It can work simultaneously with 8 devices.  The average cost is 3 thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="wifi router iota" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1812528.jpg" width="600"></div>

Without such accessories, few people imagine their life.  The router works quite interestingly: it is autonomous, so you don‚Äôt have to look for a network source during the day to connect and get an access point. </p><p>  Such a device has appeared on the market recently.  The case is made of plastic, the coating is matte, not glossy.  The dominant color is white.  On the front panel you can see indicators that are lit in blue.  They notify about the status of the network connection and power. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iota router" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1812529.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  There is nothing on the rear panel.  It is quite difficult to remove the cover, and an ordinary user will not have to do this.  Underneath is a battery.  If you believe the passport provided by the manufacturer, the Yota router lasts up to 4 days with active use.  The battery can be charged via the micro-USB port.  It is located on one of the side surfaces.  The thickness of the device is small, it weighs only 86 grams.  The Internet is created automatically, as is the connection to it.  What needs to be done for the connection?  Take your mobile phone, find the necessary networks in the list of available networks and confirm the work with it.  If you need to charge the device and use the Internet, you can use the micro-USB cable.  The modem allows you to connect at the same time no more than 5 devices. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Router "Iota" easy, simple, understandable.  Always come to the rescue.  It is inexpensive - 5 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Yota many </h2><p>  The modem works with both phones and laptops.  It is versatile and retractable.  During recharging, which can be carried out from any power source, the wireless access point does not stop functioning and the speed does not decrease.  The system of connecting unauthorized persons to the network has been simplified.  It is enough to press the button and the signal will not be password protected.  So this router works.  For Yota, such a data provision is quite profitable. </p><p>  The battery can withstand about 16 hours of continuous use.  The average cost is 5 thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="modem router iota" class="if" height="434" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1812638.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Internet center </h2><p>  Of course, the company produces a router that is capable of working with phones, tablets, and computers.  All this is carried out simultaneously.  Such a device can be used both at home and in offices.  The tariff costs about 2700 rubles per month for the maximum network speed.  This is pretty cheap, which is why the modem is so popular. </p><p>  Unpacking the device is easy.  The box contains instructions, a cable for connecting a wired Internet, a power cord and the device itself.  It should be noted that Ethernet is flat and not thick, as manufacturers usually do. </p><p>  The router "Iota" has the shape of a triangle, so you can install it only in an upright position.  The case is made of glossy plastic.  There are no buttons on the device.  On the rear panel there are only ports for connection. </p><p>  Connectors for IP-telephony come in handy in small offices.  Under the plug you can see the slot for a memory card.  The device does not have a battery, so it only works on the network. </p><p>  This Internet center is slightly different from the mobile modem in size and on-time.  In practice, this process takes no more than two minutes, according to the passport - 5 minutes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iota mobile router" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1812531.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Signal and connection </h2><p>  Due to the fact that the router is stationary, you need to properly protect its signal.  When creating an access point, the device immediately selects a unique password, which consists of 8 digits.  You can always change it if you wish.  After the first attempt to open a site in a browser, it redirects to the page with the settings of the Yota router. </p><p>  If a modem is needed to work at home or in the office, then it is perfect.  Recall that it connects well with both PC and phones.  Due to the internal antenna, the signal is distributed 30 meters.  At the same time, no more than 15 people can connect to the router.  The approximate cost is 5 thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect iota router" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42023/1323422.jpg" width="478"></div>

    <h2>  Different modems, one speed </h2><p>  The article describes the positioning of models and their design above.  The question is closed about this.  Some might wonder where the performance of these devices are.  The reason for this separation lies in the fact that all models operate with 20 Mbit per second.  Actual power depends only on the tariff and the device that receives the signal. </p><p>  It should be noted that the Internet from Iota can be used for free.  But then the company will simply limit the speed to 64 Kbps per second.  If you need a connection faster, you will have to replenish the account.  By the way, money is withdrawn exactly on the day when the owner used it.  The amount depends on the speed of the network.  That is, you can independently slow down or increase the resulting Internet.  It was the flexible plan that made the Iota famous. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iota router setup" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1812533.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Signal </h2><p>  Within the MKAD, the Internet operates at a speed of up to 20 Mbit per second.  This will be enough to watch YouTube videos of the highest quality.  The company also has a policy that focuses on unlimited traffic.  That is why you should not be afraid that after some time the speed will be reduced. </p><p>  If you are not sure that the provider‚Äôs signal covers specifically the home of a person, then you can go to the official website, where all areas with available access are indicated.  It is immediately allowed to take any modem for testing.  If it does not fit, then within a week it can be returned with a 100% refund. </p>
