With the advent of the Internet, it became possible to plan your vacation, choose a destination and a hotel.  Of course, these opportunities only increase the quality of leisure and help tourists get tremendous pleasure from it, prepare in advance for all the ‚Äúsurprises‚Äù that this or that option is preparing for them and compare their number with the cost of the tour.  Someone wants to finally be on the coast, enjoy the sun, sea, gorgeous views.  Others, on the contrary, as part of their short trip want to get acquainted with the resort, its history, so they plan a rich excursion program.  But if you want to combine business with pleasure, pay attention to Greece. </p>

    <p>  Crete is perhaps the most popular Greek island with hospitable and radiant locals, amazing cuisine, chic beaches and a rich excursion program.  Before you go to the nearest travel agency and book a hotel, you need to decide in which area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe island you want to live, and also what kind of vacation you expect.  It should be said that the most luxurious and fashionable hotels are located in the northern part of the island.  But if you are counting on a beach holiday, this place is not suitable for you, since the coast is not suitable here: huge boulders, uncomfortable and rocky entry into the water.  That is why we recommend staying in the central part of the island, for example, the resort of Rethymnon, ideal for a beach holiday and a vacation with children.  We offer you to pay attention to Limas Hotel 3 * - a middle-class hotel that managed to win the hearts of many tourists.  We hope that the reviews of real vacationers will help to make an objective assessment of this option and determine how suitable it is for relaxation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  Hotel Limas Hotel 3 * (Crete) is located, perhaps, in one of the most beautiful and picturesque areas of the island, near the famous village of Pigi, only 70 meters from the coast.  The nearest village Rethymno is a resort town with developed infrastructure, you can get to it by regular bus, which regularly runs along the route.  Travel time is 30-40 minutes.  Very often, this hotel is chosen by families with young children who prioritize proximity to the airport.  By local standards, the hotel is small - only 20 rooms.  All tourists note that the owners of this mini-hotel are very welcoming and friendly people. </p>

    <p>  The hotel rooms are bright and spacious - this was noted by all tourists who preferred Limas Hotel 3 *.  Reviews confirm the presence of a separate bathroom with a hairdryer and a set of necessary bath accessories.  All vacationers, counting on freshness and coolness in the room, of course, will see air conditioning here, and quite effective and powerful.  But its operation is carried out only at an additional cost.  For a surcharge, you can use the safe for storing valuables and documents, as well as a minibar.  Their technical equipment in the rooms there is a refrigerator, TV with satellite channels.  You can spend evenings on an excellent balcony, which offers stunning views of the local beauty, and there are many of them. </p><p>  Traces of fresh renovation are felt in the rooms: the walls are painted, the furniture is new and modern - everything is quite modest, budget, but at the same time clean and comfortable.  There is not much furniture, but there is everything that is really needed on vacation: wide beds with comfortable mattresses, bedside tables, a table with a mirror, a chair.  All those who choose apartments will get not only a full bed and a bathroom, but also a small kitchen equipped with necessary appliances.  There is also a dining table with chairs and comfortable sofas where you can sit watching TV.  Apartments are an excellent choice for tourists who are planning a vacation with their family or a large company: there are enough beds, space and light. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Among the shortcomings of the hotel, first of all, I would like to note the failure of the sewage system.  Namely, in the season when the hotel is ‚Äúcrammed‚Äù by vacationers, private blockages occur.  To do this, it is quite enough to get paper or sand in the sewer.  In general, the hotel is quite quiet, soundproofing at a decent level: nothing will interfere with your relaxation and disturb your peace. </p><h2>  Room service </h2><p>  Rooms are cleaned daily during the absence of vacationers.  Towels and bed linen are changed only a few times during the entire stay.  Do not forget that this is a 3 * hotel, so it is stupid to expect anything supernatural from it. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Meals according to the "breakfast" and "half board" in the own restaurant can be offered to all vacationers by the Limas Hotel 3 * (Crete, Rethymnon).  Rethymno is a place with amazing cuisine, so you should not refuse to visit local restaurants and cafes, even if breakfast and dinner are included in the price. </p><p>  Now for the food in the hotel.  It does not differ in variety.  For breakfast you can see eggs, yoghurts, dry cereal with milk, several types of meat and cheese slices, some vegetables, drinks.  Dinners are more varied: you can see meat, sometimes fish.  tourists complain about the lack of seafood, fresh vegetables, herbs and even seasonal fruits.  If you do not take a room with a kitchen, it is better to refuse food and eat at local restaurants - the prices are reasonable, they cook very tasty.  Moreover, on the beach you can always buy soft drinks, ice cream, as well as a snack of boiled corn - a favorite treat of children. </p>

    <h2>  Service </h2><p>  Limas Hotel 3 * has a bicycle rental service: in fact, many vacationers rent this type of transport and go on a trip around the island.  The places here are really beautiful, picturesque, so not only adults, but also the youngest tourists will enjoy the trip. </p><p>  Wireless high-speed internet is available throughout the hotel.  Tourists note that even in the rooms the speed is excellent: it is enough to communicate on social networks, view news and search for important information.  A car rental point is located across the street from the hotel - it is very convenient for those who want to go around the whole island and visit its most beautiful places, for example, coves and coves surrounded by greenery. </p><h2>  Entertainment on site </h2><p>  The presence of a swimming pool on the territory of the Limas Hotel 3 * is an excellent addition to its main advantages.  Of course, it‚Äôs stupid to expect that if there is a gorgeous sea within walking distance, someone will splash around in the pool, but sometimes vacationers have a good time here.  Sun beds and umbrellas are free for all hotel guests. </p>

    <p>  All lovers of outdoor games can go to the tennis court, fight with their room in beach volleyball or football - there are a lot of vacationers here in the season, so there is how to organize your leisure time with benefits for body and health.  The hotel administration also took care of the children - an excellent playground is intended for them.  Children are happy to frolic here, and parents can not worry about the organization of their leisure. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The beach is just a few minutes away from the Limas Hotel 3 * (Crete).  Photos of tourists who are attached to almost every review confirm that the beach here is not the best.  Yes, the coast is wide, the sand is fine, the sea is clean, but entering the water can be difficult.  If you want to see really gorgeous beaches, which are described by many guidebooks in Greece, go to Rethymnon - it is only 8 km away - here you will really find snow-white sand, a gentle slope into the water and a quiet calm sea - a paradise for lovers of beach holidays and kids. </p>

    <p>  The beach is well-maintained: for a fee you can use sun loungers and umbrellas, rent water activities, go fishing or diving on the open sea - there are plenty of entertainments here.  And one more thing: in season the sun is quite active here, so you should not neglect the use of products with a high protection factor, as well as be sure to cover your head. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Limas Hotel 3 * is an excellent hotel for a relaxing family vacation, including with young children.  If you are accustomed to a vibrant nightlife, planning to visit bars, restaurants and noisy discos with incendiary music, this place is definitely not suitable for you.  If you want to enjoy the peace, tranquility and measured relaxation, to stay away from the bustle of noisy cities, feel free to book a room here and start packing your bags. </p><p>  This option will surely appeal to all those tourists who are looking for a budget option, but at the same time rely on comfortable living conditions and good service. </p>
