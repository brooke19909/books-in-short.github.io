There are legends about the beauty of the medieval architecture of a hospitable country.  However, there are modern attractions that amaze with their diversity and have no analogues in the world. </p><h2>  Modern architectural monument </h2><p>  Rotterdam is the second largest city in the Netherlands, in stark contrast to Amsterdam.  Famous for its bizarre architectural monuments, it makes a lasting impression.  An unusual residential complex, which appeared in the mid-80s of the last century, is recognized as the hallmark of the city of the future. </p><div class="photo" data-original="photo-vision.blogspot.com" data-author=": Mahdi SHADKAR, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Innovative Blaak Forest Complex" class="if uuid-2585605" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2585605.jpg"></div><p>  In the world there are many different designs of houses, but not every one of them attracts attention with a curious design.  The cubic houses in Rotterdam, whose photos make you want to see them with your own eyes, are a unique attraction, which is simply impossible not to notice. </p><h2>  The history of the residential complex </h2><p>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating an unusual object belongs to the Dutch architect Pete Blom.  The cubic houses in Rotterdam (Netherlands) resemble trees, making the prestigious residential area similar to a forest.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe new complex comes to the architect back in the 70s, but then he could not bring it to life.  It is known that Blom, who prefers a bright palette and turns geometric shapes upside down, turned the model of a regular hexagon by 45 degrees.  Immediately, the talented author placed a pencil on the bottom cube, and a figure resembling a tree turned out.  Adoring experiments, he immediately thought about what would be nice to create at home on this principle. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.kitchenagenda.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Artificial forest grown in a metropolis" class="if uuid-2585610" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2585610.jpg"></div><p>  However, only ten years later, Pete receives an order from the city administration.  Local officials instructed to develop a project that would go beyond the usual architecture.  Blom‚Äôs master plan, which made accurate mathematical calculations, is recognized as the most original.  Soon, on the site of the old port, destroyed during the Second World War, the innovative Blaak Forest complex appears, consisting of 40 houses interconnected. </p><p>  In 2009, a radical redevelopment of the ‚Äúcubes‚Äù was carried out.  Several of them are now hosting hostels for tourists who want to stay here for a few days and experience the charm of being in cubic houses in Rotterdam. </p><h2>  Architecture features </h2><p>  To be completely accurate, the form of a real miracle of engineering is more like a box.  However, outside the dwellings look like cubes in contact with each other with their faces.  Due to the slope, their usable area is much smaller than the actual. </p><p>  Built cubic houses in Rotterdam, whose frame is a vertical hexagon, look as if they are painted.  Carefully crafted colors are perfect for bizarre architecture.  The main material used is wood fiber frames and cement.  The base of the isolated houses with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãapproximately 100 m <sup>2</sup> is a high pillar-pillar, inside of which there is a metal spiral staircase leading to the premises. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is curious that each dwelling set on one corner consists of several floors, and on the first, in the spaces between the pedestals, there are offices and shops.  All the cubic houses in Rotterdam (Netherlands) are three-level: the lower ones have a living room and kitchen, the second has bathrooms and bedrooms, the third - the so-called atrium (cabinet illuminated by the sun's rays).  Thanks to windows oriented to all directions of the world, from which a wonderful panorama of the city opens, there is always a lot of light inside. </p><h2>  Unexpected problems </h2><p>  The interior of the cubic houses in Rotterdam is quite interesting, because inside all the walls are sloping, not straight.  In addition, the windows are in the most unexpected places, and the ceiling is supported by a powerful column.  Inhabitants of amazing homes suffer from inconvenience, since it is impossible to hang pictures on the walls or nail the shelves, as well as put furniture on them.  And all the cabinets, chairs, sofas have to be ordered from designers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lifebeyondbordersblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The interior of the cubic houses in Rotterdam" class="if uuid-2585615" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2585615.jpg"></div><p>  Despite the rather large room, the inside is quite crowded.  Perhaps for these reasons, most apartment owners changed their place of residence, and organizations settled in the ‚Äúcubes‚Äù. </p><h2>  A unique opportunity to get acquainted with a curious object </h2><p>  Tourists coming to the city must visit the cubic houses in Rotterdam and examine them.  They admit that no photographs can convey the beauty of an extraordinary sight.  Many even become speechless.  From the side, the houses resemble an artificial forest that has grown in a metropolis. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.idesignarch.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The real miracle of engineering" class="if uuid-2585609" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2585609.jpg"></div><p>  Some residents take advantage of the hype that has arisen and create unique museums from their homes.  For a small fee (approximately 2.5 euros / 184 rubles), tourists will be able to go inside the strange-looking houses from 11 to 17 hours daily.  Visitors are surprised at how unusual everything is here, and even catch themselves thinking that it would be nice to stay here for a week. </p><p>  Some stay at Stayokay Rotterdam Hostel, which is located in the cabins.  Visitors are offered double, four and six-bed rooms, as well as places in a common room for 4, 6 and 8 people.  The price of accommodation (from 30 euros / 2200 rubles per day) includes breakfast, toilet and shower - common.  Settlement occurs around the clock, even at night. </p><h2>  The most famous and unusual complex </h2><p>  An innovative residential complex occupies a whole block.  Holland's most famous architectural site is located next to the Blaak metro station.  To get to the cubic houses in Rotterdam, whose address is: Overblaak Street 70 (Overblaak Street), you can also by tram (No. 21, 24) or bus (No. 32, 47), which follow to the desired stop. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gly-lowe.squarespace.com" data-author=": Glyn Lowe, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Innovative residential complex" class="if uuid-2585617" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2585617.jpg"></div><p>  One of the most unusual sights of the city, a visit to which will give a lot of pleasant emotions, and now causes a lot of controversy among architects.  The original buildings are remembered at first sight, but travelers who visited the houses would not want to live here all their lives. </p>
