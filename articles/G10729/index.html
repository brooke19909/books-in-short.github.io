Simply put, through this agreement a list of persistent organic pollutants was established. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.m.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Members of the convention." class="if uuid-3008045" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/114310/3008045.jpg"></div><h2>  Essence </h2><p>  Since then, international organizations and UN affiliated committees have compiled a list of the 12 worst substances known as the "dirty dozen."  This was the main list of persistent organic pollutants. </p><h2>  Results of the negotiations </h2><p>  The negotiations were completed on May 23, 2001 in Stockholm.  The Convention entered into force on May 17, 2004.  Then it was decided to ban the production of dioxins and furans. </p><p>  Parties to the Convention agreed on a process by which persistent toxic compounds can be reviewed and added to the list.  This happened in Geneva on May 8, 2009. </p><p>  As of June 2018, there were 182 parties to the Convention (181 states and the European Union).  Famous States that have not ratified the Convention include the United States, Israel, Malaysia, and Italy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Stockholm Convention was adopted by EU law as Act No. 850/2004. </p><div class="photo" data-original="enb.iisd.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Convention meeting." class="if uuid-3008046" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/114310/3008046.jpg"></div><h2>  Structure </h2><p>  The Committee is composed of a 31-member expert panel appointed by the United Nations that analyzes the chemicals in three steps.  The Committee will first determine whether the substance meets the POP screening criteria detailed in Annex D of the Convention in terms of its persistence, bioaccumulation, long-distance transport potential (LRET) and toxicity.  If it is believed that the substance meets these requirements, the Committee then develops a risk profile based on the provisions and charter of the document, analyzing whether this substance can lead to significant adverse effects on human health and / or the environment, and therefore whether it is necessary to introduce it into list of pollutants. </p><p>  Also in this convention, they often discuss the emergence of new hazardous substances and the issues of their prohibition, which is very important and relevant in our difficult time for the environment.  The convention is going to, the experts present their opinions, after which these opinions are discussed by the delegates.  After discussion, a decision is made to ban a substance that all countries parties to the treaty are required to comply with. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="enb.iisd.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Parties to the convention." class="if uuid-3008047" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/114310/3008047.jpg"></div><h2>  Recent meetings </h2><p>  In 2011, the committee for this treaty considered three proposals for listing the following substances in annexes A, B and / or C: chlorinated naphthalenes (CN), hexachlorobutadiene (HCBD) and pentachlorophenol (PCP), its salts and esters.  Various proposals for the analysis and evaluation of substances require POPRC to determine whether the proposed chemical meets the criteria specified in Annex D to the Convention.  She also banned various sources of persistent organic pollutants.  POPRC-8 proposed listing hexabromocyclododecane, which is often used in construction.  This proposal was agreed at the sixth conference, which took place 5 years ago. </p><p>  POPRC-9 proposed di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, hexa-, hepta- and octachlorinated naphthalenes and hexachlorobutadiene for inclusion in Annexes A and C. He also created further work on pentachlorophenol, its salts and esters, and decabromodiphenyl. ether, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, its salts and perfluorooctane sulfonyl chloride. </p><h2>  The ban on "mosquito" chemicals </h2><p>  According to skeptical experts, this contract is responsible for the ongoing death from malaria.  In fact, the agreement allows the use of DDT in public health for mosquito control (the carrier of malaria).  There are also ways to prevent the large amount of insecticide consumed using other malaria vectors, such as window screens. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  While specific measures are being taken, such as the use of DDT indoors, then a limited amount of insecticides can be used in a controlled manner.  The lack of objective data on the level of POPs emissions in some countries impedes negotiations on specific compounds and their inclusion in the list of hazardous substances, and also indicates the need for further research. </p><h2>  Other disagreements </h2><p>  Another controversy might be certain POPs (which are constantly active, especially in the Arctic biota), which were mentioned in the Stockholm Convention, but were not part of the ‚Äúdirty dozen,‚Äù such as perfluorooctone sulfonates (PFOs).  PFOs have many common uses, because there are stain removers among them, but these substances have many properties that can make it dangerous due to the fact that PFOs can be very resistant to environmental degradation.  PFOs can be toxic in terms of increasing neonatal pathologies and fetal deformities, weight loss, and impaired neurological systems. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.kisspng.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Emblem of the Rotterdam Convention." class="if uuid-3008048" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/114310/3008048.jpg"></div><h2>  Basel Convention </h2><p>  The logical continuation of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants is the well-known Basel Convention. </p><p>  The main priority of this treaty is the fight against the spread of various dangerous and toxic substances in poor countries.  There, as you know, this problem still exists and is very relevant.  This is due to the low level of culture, poorly developed medicine, poor production support and other serious factors that strongly influence the spread of harmful, outdated and environmentally unsafe means.  In underdeveloped countries, they are still used as medicines, insecticides (especially malaria mosquitoes), detergents for cleaning clothes, fuels, etc. In this regard, this agreement is an addition to the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. </p><p>  However, the effectiveness of the fight against the spread of such substances is very doubtful precisely because of their irreplaceability and importance for the economies of poor states, especially African ones. </p><p>  Nevertheless, the activities of the parties to the convention in no way relate to the management of radioactive waste.  The Convention also aims to minimize the amount and toxicity of waste generated, to ensure that it is regulated and to help LDCs manage the environmentally sound management of the hazardous waste that they generate.  Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) also belong to them. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  One of the reasons that led to the creation of the Basel Convention was the incident related to waste disposal.  A ship containing ash from burning Philadelphia city waste in the United States dumped half of its cargo near Haiti Beach.  It went through many more months, changing its name several times.  Unable to ship their cargo at any port, the crew was believed to drop most of the dangerous luggage at sea. </p><h2>  "Poison Colonialism" </h2><p>  Another 1988 incident occurred in Coco.  At that time, five vessels transported 18,000 barrels of hazardous waste from Italy to the small town of Coco in Nigeria in exchange for a monthly rent of $ 100, which was paid to Nigerians for the use of their agricultural land. </p><p>  Many developing countries consider this practice "poisonous colonialism." </p><h2>  Rotterdam Convention </h2><p>  The Rotterdam Convention, as another logical extension of the Stockholm Convention, promotes an open exchange of information and encourages exporters of hazardous chemicals to use proper labeling, which includes the drafting of safe handling instructions and informing buyers of any known restrictions or prohibitions.  Signatory countries can decide whether to allow or prohibit the import of chemicals listed in the contract, and exporting countries must ensure that manufacturers comply with the contract within their jurisdiction. </p><div class="photo" data-original="enb.iisd.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Work on the convention." class="if uuid-3008049" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/114310/3008049.jpg"></div><h2>  Integration of the three conventions </h2><p>  In 2012, the secretariats of the three aforementioned conventions merged into a single Secretariat with a matrix structure serving the three conventions.  They are currently considered to be a kind of unified decentralized structure.  In fact, this structure was not only remarkable for the largest list of persistent organic pollutants in history, but also effective methods to combat their spread. </p><h2>  Members </h2><p>  The seventh meeting of the Rotterdam Conference was held from May 4 to May 15, 2015 in Geneva, Switzerland. </p><p>  As of October 2018, the Convention has 161 members, which includes 158 UN member states, including the Cook Islands, Palestine and the European Union.  Non-member states are currently represented only by the United States. </p><h2>  Conflict with Canada </h2><p>  At a meeting of the Rotterdam Convention 7 years ago, the Canadian delegation surprised many by refusing to allow the addition of chrysotile asbestos fibers to the list of substances prohibited by the convention.  In the near future, hearings are planned in the EU to assess Canada‚Äôs position and reach a compromise with it. </p><p>  Continuing its objection, Canada is the only G8 country to oppose listing this substance.  Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan and Ukraine supported the position of Canada.  Vietnam also raised an objection, but missed a follow-up meeting on this issue.  In defending its position, the Canadian government came into conflict with India, which withdrew its long-standing objection to adding chrysotile to the list immediately before the 2011 conference. </p><p>  Numerous non-governmental organizations have publicly criticized Canada‚Äôs decision to block this addition to the treaty. </p><p>  In September 2012, Canadian Industry Secretary Christian Parady announced that the Canadian government would no longer oppose the inclusion of chrysotile in the convention. </p><p>  Eight of the largest producing and exporting countries of chrysotile opposed such a move at the Rotterdam Conference in 2015: Russia, Kazakhstan, India, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Cuba and Zimbabwe. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cn.undp.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Caricature of organic pollutants." class="if uuid-3008050" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/114310/3008050.jpg"></div><h2>  Air problem </h2><p>  The Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution is intended to protect the environment from air pollution, as well as to gradually reduce and prevent this process.  It is implemented by the European Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMEP), conducted by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.  The main goal of such agreements is to combat the spread of organic environmental pollutants. </p><p>  This agreement was signed on 11/13/1979 and entered into force on 03/16/1983. </p><p>  At present, 51 parties are involved in the agreement on the prevention of air pollution, and the Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Europe is defined as its secretariat. </p><p>  The Convention is implemented by the European Air Pollutant Monitoring and Assessment Program.  The results of the EMEP program in the form of an updated list of organic air pollutants (as well as methods for controlling their spread) are regularly published on the EMEP website. </p><p>  Since 1979, the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution has addressed some of the key environmental issues of the <span>UNECE</span> region through scientific cooperation and policy negotiations.  It is second in importance after the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. </p><p>  The objective of the Convention is for the parties to strive to limit and, as far as possible, gradually reduce and prevent air pollution, including transboundary pollution over long distances.  Parties shall develop policies and strategies to combat emissions of air pollutants through the exchange of information, advice, research and monitoring. </p><p>  Together, the three conventions mentioned above put the issue of combating organic water pollutants on the agenda. </p><div class="photo" data-original="phys.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Organically polluted water." class="if uuid-3008051" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/114310/3008051.jpg"></div><p>  Parties meet annually at Executive Body sessions to review ongoing work and plan future activities, including a work plan for the coming year.  The three main subsidiary bodies - the Working Group on Effects, the Steering Body for EMEP and the Working Group on Strategies and Review, and the Committee for the Implementation of the Convention report to the Executive Body each year. </p><p>  Currently, the priority activities of all three treaties are the review and possible revision of their latest protocols.  The integral among these treaties is, of course, the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. </p><h2>  Criticism </h2><p>  Many politicians in developed countries are strongly opposed to such international covenants, considering them an obstacle to economic development.  Against such conventions (including Stockholm) are, for example, US President Donald Trump and the Republican Party circles close to him.  Also, many other right-wing politicians are opposed to "environmental" treaties, pacts and conventions, for example, the newly elected president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaru.  The European right is inclined to at least be skeptical or indifferent to such initiatives, believing that there are problems far more important than concern for abstract environmental threats. </p><p>  Despite its participation in all such initiatives, China is the most environmentally disadvantaged country.  Perhaps this is due to the fact that the effectiveness of the Stockholm Convention and other treaties is still too low to help some countries cope with the problems of environmental pollution. </p><p>  Russia steadily participates in all such initiatives, although the environmental situation in our country also leaves much to be desired.  This forces many (for example, Yulia Latynina) to say that environmental safety treaties are the result of either corruption of international organizations wishing to capitalize on the idealism of environmental fighters, or a hidden conspiracy that exists in the UN and the EU. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Such agreements are very important, because they ensure the safety of our ecology.  In importance, they are on par with the various conventions on climate protection.  The Stockholm Convention on POPs is a very progressive and important step in ensuring the cleanliness and preservation of our nature.  This is especially important given the fact that the modern world is moving in the direction of alternative energy sources and is gradually abandoning any toxic substances - both organic and inorganic.  The characterization of persistent organic pollutants provided by the above conventions in this regard serves the interests of the entire world community. </p>
