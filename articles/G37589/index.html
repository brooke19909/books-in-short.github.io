Europeans, as well as independent travelers from Russia, Ukraine and other countries of the former USSR, like it.  But lovers of package tours are often unhappy with it.  Let's see what are the pros and cons of this Turkish ‚Äútreshka‚Äù, located in one of the most interesting resorts, in the place where the Mediterranean and Aegean seas merge.  The hotel is not new, built in 1992, but the last major overhaul took place in 2013. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Myra Hotel 3 * (Marmaris)" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2113551.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Budget hotels in Marmaris </h2><p>  In this resort you can find accommodation that will suit both the capricious rich man and the picky backpacker.  Outside the city are five-star palaces and club hotels with huge parks and gardens, as well as their own marinas and yachts.  But the hotels closer to the center are mostly inexpensive.  Either young people who have fun on Bar Street until the morning, or travelers who spend days on excursions and various walks often live there.  As a rule, these are small hotels, with almost no territory.  Most often they are located not on the shore, but two or three streets from the beach.  Typical local "three rubles" include "Emre Beach", "Ochaktan", "Adler", "Siesta", "Egean Park".  They offer a minimal set of services and are most often very loved by young people from different countries.  Mira is included in the list of the best economical hotels in the resort.  And the description of Myra Hotel 3 * (Marmaris) we will begin with its location. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Myra Hotel 3 * (Marmaris) reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2113535.jpg"></div>

Near the hotel there are two large supermarkets.  These are Migros and Kipa.  Therefore, guests of the Myra Hotel 3 * (Marmaris) do not even need to think about where to exchange currency.  It is enough to buy something in such supermarkets, and you will be given change in lire, moreover, at the rate of the National Bank.  And this is much more profitable than in exchangers.  To the city center, Marina port and the square with the singing fountains - about half an hour leisurely step.  Not far from the bazaar, where you can buy different things cheaper than in shops on the street. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Myra Hotel 3 * Standard (Marmaris)" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2113541.jpg"></div>
