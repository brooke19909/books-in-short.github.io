An operation can also be performed in two ways: through a card or through a service point. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  Online payment is carried out through the website or the official application ‚ÄúRepayment of loans‚Äù.  No documents are required for the operation, just enter the account number, card or contract. </li><li>  Some credit organizations will also need to provide the full name of the borrower. </li><li>  It is necessary to indicate the active phone number, an SMS code will be sent to it to confirm the action. </li><li>  After checking the information you will need to enter the card details: number, expiration date, CVC / CVV code, then click on the "Pay" button. </li><li>  If all fields are filled in correctly and the card is active, a one-time password will come to the specified number, it must be entered in a special field. </li><li>  To receive an electronic receipt, you must enter the mail address and click on "Send receipt." </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="cabinetno.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="repayment of loans online" class="if uuid-3218927" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/3218927.jpg"></div><p>  The term for crediting funds to a credit account takes up to 3 business days, although most often this happens instantly.  In any case, it is recommended to make a payment in advance of the date specified in the contract. </p><p>  The exact amount of commission may vary, as it depends on the bank that issued the card.  In this case, when repaying a loan, money transfer is possible only in rubles, since the operation is carried out only in Russia. </p><p>  To make subsequent payments, a bank card can be saved, then you do not need to enter its data each time.  To do this, you need to log in to the site (you will need to enter the phone number to which the confirmation code will come).  Also, after entering your personal account, you can set up a reminder for the following payments.  The system will send a notice a few days before the specified date. </p><h2>  Cash loan repayment </h2><p>  If there is no bank card or a person for other reasons does not want to make an online payment, he can deposit money in cash through the cash desk of the Golden Crown.  Addresses can be specified on the official website of the system.  These are any banks of the Russian Federation, salons of leading mobile operators, a network of stores "Svyaznoy", "Euroset", "Kari".  Also, the "Golden Crown" accepts "Russian Post." </p><p>  For payment through the branch, in addition to the account details, you will need a passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation.  You can make a payment not only for your loan, but also pay off the debt of another person.  It is also possible to deposit money into an account even while in another city, because the system operates throughout the country. </p><p>  Money is credited to the credit account within 1-3 days, most often they arrive on the next business day.  The commission depends on the issuing bank and the service point, usually it is 1% of the amount, but not less than 50 rubles. </p><p>  There is no minimum limit on the amount of transfer, but there are restrictions on the maximum limit.  It depends on the facility.

You can do this without leaving your home: </p><ol><li>  To carry out an operation, the card must have dollars or euros.  The system converts them online in real time.  For operations in dollars there is a limit of 9 thousand, for euros - 8 thousand. </li><li>  In the empty field you must enter the desired amount for the exchange. </li><li>  After that you will need to indicate your full name, as in your passport, and your current phone number. </li><li>  A confirmation code will come to the indicated number, it must be entered in the window that appears. </li><li>  Next, the card details are indicated: number, owner name, expiration date, CVC code.  An important point: currency exchange can be made only with your own card. </li><li>  As soon as the money is written off, an SMS with the operation number will come.  It must be retained before being presented at the Golden Crown service point.  There are banks participating in the system in different cities of the Russian Federation.  For example, Russian Standard Bank CJSC and Otkritie FC Bank OJSC in Moscow, Promsotsbank in Vladivostok, Krona Bank LLC in Yekaterinburg, Donkombank OJSC in Rostov-on-Don, etc. <table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"></table><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"></table><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"></table></li><li>  The bank should ask for a transfer using the Golden Crown system.  The employee will ask for the transaction number, passport and card with which the conversion was carried out. </li><li>  Funds are transferred instantly, the payment is kept for 3 years. <div class="photo" data-original="medium.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Online currency exchange" class="if uuid-3218901" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81634/3218901.jpg"></div></li></ol><h2>  Transfer from card to card </h2><p>  Through the system, you can also make a simple transfer from card to card.  The operation is possible between any banks in Russia.  The recipient then does not have to go to the service point, he will be able to immediately use the money. </p><p>  For the operation, you must enter all the data of the sender card: number, name, expiration date.  In another window, the card number of the recipient is entered.  The procedure is confirmed by SMS code, which will come to the addressee's number. </p><p>  Cash limits: from 1 ruble to 150 thousand rubles.  Transfer term: from 1 to 3 days, maybe more (depends on the bank that issued the sender card). </p><h2>  Tariffs </h2><p>  Zolotaya Korona money transfers have the lowest fees, in some cases it will be 0%.  When converting at the exchange rate of the system, when sending money in one currency and receiving the addressee in another, transfer commission is not charged. </p><div class="photo" data-original="volgaproject.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Golden Crown valid worldwide" class="if uuid-3218904" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81634/3218904.jpg"></div><p>  The commission of the Golden Crown will be 1% of the transfer amount, but not less than 50 rubles.  If customers wish to receive a notification via SMS about the status of the operation, the system will take an additional 49 rubles.  The same rates are valid for loan repayments.  An additional commission may be charged by the bank from whose card payment is made. </p><h2>  Reviews of the Golden Crown </h2><p>  Among the opinions of users of the system there are both positive and negative.  This suggests that the work of the payment aggregator has not yet been debugged to the end, the creators need to make adjustments. </p><p>  Among the positive reviews about the Golden Crown, the most frequent are: </p><ol><li>  The minimum amount of commission. </li><li>  Profitable currency conversion. </li><li>  The ability to make a payment directly from home. </li><li>  Convenient and intuitive interface of the site and application when working. </li><li>  The user can monitor the status of the transfer online. </li><li>  Money can be transferred at any time of the day; there is no need for the sender to adapt to the mode of service points. </li></ol><p>  But not only positive reviews about the ‚ÄúGolden Crown‚Äù are left by people who have experience in interacting with the system.  Among the negative, the most common are: </p><ol><li>  Delay in payments when repaying loans.  Often users note the fact that they have delayed due to the fault of this payment aggregator.  It is rather difficult to prove it later. </li><li>  Small towns have few service points. </li><li>  Employees of some partner banks have poor system skills. </li><li>  The lack of currency at the cash desk of small service points makes recipients wait for their transfer for several days. </li><li>  Frequent crashes in the software of partners of the Golden Crown system. </li></ol>
