    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The box in which the phone is delivered will impress any person.  It is small in size and visually resembles a box from the iPhone version 4 or 4S.  Inside, the buyer will find a charger, a cable for connecting to a computer, as well as a special SIM card extractor.  It has a Flyme logo. </p><p>  Most often, the device is sold without a protective glass, film and case.  As an optional accessory, there is an adapter for an outlet. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  In Russia and other countries, the phone is known as Meizu M3 mini.  In China, the prefix "mini" is missing.  Later in the article both options will be described, we are talking about the same phone. </p><p>  There is also a version of the M3 Note.  It has a 5.5 inch screen.  The difference from the usual model is in the size of the display. </p><p>  The phone in question in the article has a screen of 5 inches.  At the same time, the resolution compared to the Note modification has been reduced - to HD (1280 by 720).  The article will continue to compare with the older model.  The specifications of the Meizu M3 Mini 32/16 Gb are impressive.  More about them later. </p><p>  Appearance of the device seemed to buyers updated, more recent.  Now the case has no edging, which in previous devices bulged out.  Previously, it was made of plastic.  Safety glass also received an updated design.  It has become rounded.  The smartphone began to look more unique when compared with the range of Meizu.  But in general, it resembles the "iPhone" of the sixth version.  Their significant difference - the thickness of the "apple" is about 7 m, for M3 - 8.3 mm.  By the key they also differ.  At the Chinese device, it is plastic and oblong.  The camera does not protrude from the body. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The glass of the device has <span>an oleophobic coating.</span>  The quality is better than the previous model.  Now the gadget is protected from fingerprints to the maximum.  These features of the Meizu M3 Mini phone are popular with everyone. </p><p>  Under the screen, you can see the mBack key.  She's a touch type.  If you want to return to the desktop, then you need to click on it.  Touch returns to the previous menu.  When held, the voice assistant starts.  Thanks to this feature, you can configure the phone lock.  Unfortunately, the manufacturer does not directly advertise this, but you can finish this highlight yourself. </p><p>  All utilities running in the background quickly open with a swipe of your finger from the bottom to the top of the display.  The curtain opens.  It works instantly, no complaints. </p><p>  Built-in auto brightness and distance sensor.  They function well, but there are some flaws.  In the case, on the back, there is a camera.  It is easy to notice its dimensional peephole.  The manufacturer‚Äôs logo is a little lower, there is nothing more.  Shoppers love the minimalist features. </p><p>  The holes for the microphone and speaker are on the bottom and are symmetrical to each other.  The sound is of average quality.  The speaker in many previous models was terrible, another model was installed here, so many problems (but not all) were eliminated.  The playback volume is not very high, so in a noisy place you can easily miss a call.  Unfortunately, this feature in the Meizu M3 Mini 32 Gb is slightly modified. </p><p>  On the upper edge is a port for headphones and acoustics.  Its design, technology and handicap are no different from previous models. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  On the left is the port for the SIM card.  One of them is designed for a nano-number, and the second - for another mobile operator or an external drive.  This solution has long been used and is quite popular. </p><p>  The plastic used to create the case is the simplest.  It is easy to clean.  It is nice and non-slip.  The phone is easy to hold in your hand, it is pleasant to work with it even with one hand.  This indicator is important for most buyers, so it only adds to the popularity of the device.  In this, the characteristics of the Meizu M3 Mini are excellent. </p><p>  Four different body shades are available.  Each of the options is interesting and unique.  Colors are pleasing to the eye. </p><p>  The international version of the M3S mini device received a metal casing and a fingerprint scanner.  It costs $ 15 more. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meizu m3 mini 32gb specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2047083.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Display </h2><p>  The screen received almost no changes.  It has an IPS-type matrix, resolution - 1280 by 720 pixels.  The diagonal is five inches, so consumers did not expect the best performance.  Fonts are displayed clearly and smoothly.  Excess pixels are not visible.  The picture does not ‚Äúeat up‚Äù a large amount of battery power, which is noted by the owners.  Many liked this budget device.  Other specifications of the Meizu M3 Mini can be read above. </p><p>  As expected, viewing angles are good.  This indicator is inherent in almost all screens created on the IPS-matrix.  However, with a strong lead to the side, you can see how the colors deteriorate.  They acquire yellow shades.  Unfortunately, this suggests that the panel is unsuccessful. </p><p>  If there is a desire, then in the settings you can easily adjust the warmth of the shades. </p><p>  The brightness has received a large supply, which pleases.  Thanks to this, even with direct sunlight, the best screen remains readable.  The display cover, which protects against the accumulation of fingerprints, also contributes to this effect. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="characteristics of the smartphone meizu m3 mini" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2047084.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Differences from Meizu M2 mini and Meizu M3S mini </h2><p>  The difference between the second and third models is palpable and quite noticeable.  But between the M3 and the characteristics of the Meizu M3 S mini there are much fewer differences.  The user will have to pay about $ 12 for the added scanner, metal and more battery power.  It's worth it. </p><p>  After the release of the new version of the third generation, the M3 became unavailable on the official website of the manufacturer.  This suggests that the device is most likely either discontinued or will no longer be sold in China. </p><p>  The device really, as the company claims, will work in a 4G-type network.  Owners notice that the device perfectly catches a signal.  There is no interference on the network.  Also, positive reviews are directed towards Wi-Fi. </p><p>  All this means that the device will work without problems in our 4G networks.  In general, the users did not have any complaints about the quality of communication.  Wi-Fi ‚Äúbeats‚Äù also not bad for long distances. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meizu m3 mini feature review" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2047085.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Performance </h2><p>  We continue the review of the characteristics of the Meizu M3 Mini with a description of the interface.  Users note that it is convenient and trouble-free.  The software does not make it clear during operation that the phone is a budget type.  The interface switches between applications as smoothly as possible, without lags and brakes.  Even with a full load of the device, there are no claims to work.  The only thing that buyers note is that launching utilities may take three to four seconds, but this does not cause any negative impressions.  Using the phone is fun. </p><p>  If we talk about the characteristics of the <span>Meizu</span> M3 Mini <span>smartphone</span> in games, then it is also at a good level.  Consider the example of the game in the famous "Asphalt 8".  Medium and high graphics settings are not available for the owner of this phone.  You can choose either low or even lower.  There is no particular comfort when playing, but there are no freezes and crashes.  However, smoothness at a terrible level. </p><p>  Unkilled game allows you to play at high settings.  Perhaps with the latest updates it just became less demanding, but the picture quality is excellent.  However, there is one thing - the FPS is weak.  Therefore, playing on such settings will be very difficult.  The owners note that you can comfortably spend time on average. </p><p>  The World of Tanks Blitz game produces at least 50 frames per second, so there are no problems. </p><h2>  Front-camera </h2><p>  The front camera according to the characteristics of the Meizu M3 Mini received a 5 megapixel sensor.  The lens has an excellent fast aperture.  However, there is nothing to highlight the camera.  Suitable for video calls, as well as selfies in good light. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meizu m3 mini specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2047086.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Main camera </h2><p>  At the back there is a 13 megapixel camera module.  This phone has similar <span>characteristics to the Meizu M3 S</span> mini.  Also, according to customers, the same sensor is installed as in the second generation model.  The quality of the picture that is obtained is good.  The frames of the architecture are not very impressive, but also not bad.  Pleased with the availability of the HDR option.  It allows you to make the photo more saturated and beautiful. </p><p>  At night and in low light, the quality of the picture decreases, but the owners note that with the ability to shoot, you can make a successful shot in three to five attempts. </p><p>  Given that the phone is budget, the cameras are normal.  In the general category, they are not very encouraging. </p><p>  It should also be said about the available shooting modes.  There is even a manual one, which is most often placed only on flagship and other expensive devices.  The function of removing GIF-animation is available, which is good news.  Its duration is no more than six seconds.  Resolution - 320 by 320 pixels. </p><h2>  Software shell </h2><p>  The question about the software characteristics of the Meizu M3 Mini 32Gb is quite relevant, so it should also be highlighted.  This indicator is directly related to cost.  It should be noted that the device fell into the budget segment by accident - it can hardly be attributed to this category. </p><p>  However, localization is absent.  To solve this problem, you must install the Russified firmware.  This can be done by the seller, if the owner feels some kind of difficulty. </p><p>  For the first entrance to the Google Market, it is recommended to use only the mobile Internet.  Then you can use Wi-Fi. </p><p>  If you need to download the application using a mobile network, you should go to the "Downloads" menu.  There will be a special setting that will allow you to do this. </p><p>  On top of the operating system is FlymeOS, which has distinguished itself by its stable operation and good optimization performance.  In recent updates, the interface has been improved.  Now it is more understandable for every person. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meizu m3 mini 32 gb specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2047087.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Sound quality </h2><p>  This phone will come in handy and appeal to all those who like to listen to music on their smartphone.  Playback has excellent characteristics.  The Meizu M3 Mini 32Gb sounds a lot more interesting than most expensive solutions on the market. </p><p>  A special player is built in, which has many settings.  Tracks can be sorted into categories.  There is also an equalizer for five bands. </p><p>  The interface is dark if there is no cover for the track, so not everyone likes it.  If you hold the phone in direct sunlight, then in this mode it will be difficult to make out anything on the screen. </p><h2>  Battery life </h2><p>  The Meizu M3 Mini is not impressive in its battery life.  According to reviews, if you use it actively, it will not last even until the evening.  In the average operating mode, it can work until the middle of the night, but this indicator is maximum. </p><p>  Standby time consumes up to 20%.  Some users believe that this is due to the installed "Google" services, others blame the wireless signal.  Advanced users have noted that this is clearly not the problem.  Even when the power-saving mode is on and the checkmark is activated, which turns off the connection when the screen is locked, still a fifth of the charge disappears during the night. </p><p>  The device must be charged for almost the entire night, then in the morning you can have 100%. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  As it should have become clear, the Meizu M3 Mini, whose characteristics are good, is popular among buyers. </p><p>  Many praise the state of the firmware, its functionality and speed of work.  Applications switch seamlessly.  In games, graphics quality may not please, especially in heavy utilities.  However, most popular processes run perfectly. </p><p>  The above is a comparison with analogues produced by the same manufacturer.  Which option to prefer should be understood by each person independently.  Characteristics do not differ critically, but in some places one generation is inferior to another.  Owners recommend taking either this plastic version, or the next, improved, metal one. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  The manufacturer, when creating this phone, made sure that its low price did not display much on functionality and materials.  Even with a low cost, the device can do many things that are available only in flagships.  The difference is that the phone has an easy and understandable interface. </p><p>  Many may have a question about whether to purchase this device.  Of course, especially if you want to give a small amount, and get a successful adaptation in return. </p><p>  Choosing between plastic M3 and M3S, you should prefer the second.  It costs $ 12 more, but a fingerprint scanner and an improved battery become available to the user.  The average cost of the described model is up to $ 100 for a 16-GB version and 130 bucks for 32-GB. </p>
