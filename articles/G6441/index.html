The program is designed to encourage customers and increase loyalty.  According to official information, more than thirty million participants have joined the “Thank you”. </p><h2>  Why do I need the Sberbank Thank You bonus program? </h2><p>  The program is attractive for customers in that it is possible to accumulate bonuses for each purchase, regardless of whether it is made in Russia or abroad.  Sberbank is constantly expanding the number of partners who are ready to offer increased “Thank you” bonuses. </p><div class="photo" data-original="daskonto.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bonus program thank you sberbank" class="if uuid-2622894" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47310/2622894.jpg"></div><p>  To understand the scale, just add the fact that every 7 seconds a new participant joins the program.  Thanks campaign has repeatedly received the Loyalty Awards in several categories. </p><h2>  Members </h2><p>  Signing up for the Thank You program is incredibly easy.  You need to spend only a minute of time. </p><p>  Registration conditions are simple. </p><p>  Anyone with a Sberbank card can become a member of the Thank You program.  Moreover, if you have several of them, then everyone will be tied to a single bonus account, on which bonus points will be accumulated. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are three ways to register for the “Thank you” potential participant. </p><ol><li><p>  You can register at a Sberbank ATM using a bank card. </p></li><li><p>  In the Internet bank using a mobile phone. </p></li><li><p>  Through the Mobile Bank service by sending SMS. </p></li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="baikal24.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="program participants thanks from Sberbank" class="if uuid-2622113" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2622113.jpg"></div><p>  To check whether the “Thank you” service is activated or not, you need to send an SMS to 900 by writing “THANKS XXXXX” in the text and replacing XXXX with the last digits of your bank card.  If you have already become a participant in the “Thank you” program from Sberbank, the bonus balance will be indicated in the reply SMS.  Otherwise, a code will come allowing you to register. </p><h2>  Conditions </h2><p>  Now you know how to become a member of the “Thank you” program from Sberbank.  Before using the “Thank you” bonus program, it will be useful for each participant to familiarize themselves with its terms. </p><h2>  How to save? </h2><p>  All you need to do after registration is to make purchases using the Sberbank card.  Thank you bonuses will be credited automatically. </p><p>  The minimum bonus amount is 0.5% of the purchase amount.  However, this rate can be significantly higher if you pay with partners of the action.  In this case, the “Thank you” bonuses can be up to 20%.  The full list of stores of participants of the "Thank you" program from Sberbank is available on the official website. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Also, increased bonuses are available to those customers who use special Sberbank sites: </p><ul><li><p>  travel - up to 5%; </p></li><li><p>  events - up to 15%; </p></li><li><p>  coupons and certificates - up to 20%. </p></li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="progorodsamara.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to become a member of the program thanks" class="if uuid-2622117" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2622117.jpg"></div><p>  “Thank you” bonuses are awarded for every 100 rubles in a check.  If you pay for an amount that is not a multiple of 100, there is a rounding down. </p><p>  It will be useful to know that for each type of card there is a maximum amount for which "Thank you" bonuses can be awarded.  If the client exceeds the specified amount during the billing period, bonuses are not credited.  The number of cards does not affect the maximum amount. </p><p>  It will also be useful for the participant of the “Thank you” program from Sberbank to know the deadlines for accruing bonuses. </p><p>  There are 2 options: </p><ol><li><p>  If the amount is 15,000 rubles, crediting occurs within 5 business days. </p></li><li><p>  For any operation over 15,000 rubles - within 40 business days. </p></li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.retail-loyalty.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="shops program participants thank you" class="if uuid-2622115" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2622115.jpg"></div><p>  When the client pays the bill with a Sberbank card, the outlet transmits the MCC code assigned earlier.  This information allows the bank to determine how many bonuses you need to accrue.  The size of the “Thank you” points depends on the category of paid services. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  Auto / taxi - 10%. </li><li>  Cafes / restaurants - 5%. </li><li>  Supermarkets - 1.5%. </li><li>  In other categories - 0.5%. </li></ul><p>  Bonuses are not awarded in the following situations: </p><ul><li>  cash withdrawal from a card; </li><li>  currency conversion; </li><li>  payment of gambling and betting bets; </li><li>  transfer to your or someone else's card; </li><li>  payment in the Internet bank; </li><li>  payment of fines, public services, etc .; </li><li>  replenishment of the "Virtual wallet"; </li><li>  the sixth and subsequent payments made during the day at the same outlet. </li></ul><p>  Also, bonuses are not awarded when using corporate and co-branding cards, that is, issued together with partners - Aeroflot, MTS, etc. </p><h2>  How to spend </h2><p>  Each accrued “Thank you” bonus is equal to one ruble discount. </p><p>  You can spend in retail and online stores, the full list of participants of the program "Thank you" from Sberbank is listed on the site.  Depending on where the purchase is made, you need to tell the seller the number of points that you want to spend, or enter in the form of payment. </p><p>  Bonuses can also be spent on special portals launched by the bank: </p><ul><li><p>  "Travel" provides the opportunity to order an air or train ticket with a discount of up to 99%. </p></li><li><p>  “Impressions” give a chance to buy tickets for concerts, as well as events for up to 99% cheaper. </p></li><li><p>  “Online” allows you to exchange the accumulated points for certificates or spend on charity. </p></li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.seoalt.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="members of the bonus program thank you" class="if uuid-2622835" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47310/2622835.jpg"></div><p>  Participants of the “Thank you” bonus program from Sberbank should not only accumulate points, but also spend them on time.  Because unused bonuses for three years are canceled.  This happens monthly.  You can find out how many bonuses will be canceled in the coming month in the Internet bank. </p><p>  Sberbank Thank You members cannot transfer accumulated points to other members. </p><p>  If your card is lost or damaged, the “Thank you” bonuses will not disappear.  After recovery, the accumulated points will be available, and the client will be able to dispose of them at their discretion. </p><p>  Thanks to Sberbank participants in Moscow, as in other cities, there is a wide selection of partners who accept accumulated points for payment. </p><p>  The purchase can be partially paid for with accumulated bonuses, and the rest with rubles. </p><h2>  How to check the balance? </h2><p>  Tracking your bonus account is incredibly simple.  Sberbank has provided several options for its customers: </p><ul><li>  Internet bank; </li><li>  ATMs </li><li>  mobile app; </li><li>  SMS to number 900. </li></ul><p>  To use the latter method, you need to make sure that you are connected to the Mobile Bank service.  You also need to remember that SMS sent to 900 is paid.  Their cost depends on the tariff set by your service provider. </p><h2>  Nuances and features </h2><ul><li>  If you need to find out how many bonuses are accrued for a particular purchase, you need to know the history of completed transactions.  This can be done through the Internet bank or mobile application in the “Thanks from Sberbank” section, as well as at the ATM. </li><li>  If the “Thank you” bonuses were not accrued or the client does not agree with their size, you must contact the contact line at 8 800 555 55 50. Sberbank considers such situations on an individual basis. </li><li>  If you cannot open the “Thank you” page in your browser, you need to change your browser settings by canceling the pop-up blocker.  In this way, information about the bonus balance is displayed on the screen. </li><li>  If you notice that the history of operations on the card does not coincide with the list of bonus transactions, there is no mistake.  Not all expenses are awarded “Thank you” points.  For example, the bonus balance is not replenished when withdrawing cash, making transfers, paying taxes, etc. </li><li>  If you decide to return the purchase, accrued points will be deducted from your account.  If you paid using "Thank you", the expired bonuses will be returned to your balance. </li></ul><p>  The accumulated points cannot be exchanged for money, they can be spent when making payments in online and offline stores that accept bonuses from Sberbank for payment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sbankin.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bonus program" class="if uuid-2622110" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2622110.jpg"></div><p>  Against the background of a huge variety of discount and discount offers, it is difficult to understand how the Sberbank bonus program differs from its analogues.  Three advantages can be distinguished. </p><ol><li>  Benefit.  Discounts at major stores can be up to 99%. </li><li>  Convenience.  To receive bonuses you do not need to fulfill special conditions.  It is enough to register in the action and make purchases as usual, without forgetting to pay by card. </li><li>  Interesting.  The Thank You program is constantly evolving, increasing the number of partners and making new offers to our customers. </li></ol><h2>  Special conditions </h2><p>  Participants of the program “Thank you” bonuses from Sberbank, who own a Visa Platinum card, can receive increased points for each purchase.  Provided that the bank card is not included in the Premier package.  Otherwise, bonuses will be awarded at the standard rate of 0.5%. </p><p>  If you issue an additional card for Visa Platinum, increased bonuses will be accrued when expenses are made for both the main and additional cards on the same terms.  The points of one holder are summed up and cannot exceed the maximum amount of 5,000 per month.  After exceeding the limit, the rate will be 0.5%. </p><p>  There are also limits set by categories: </p><ul><li>  auto / taxi - 1,000; </li><li>  restaurants - 2,000. </li></ul><p>  Bonuses on the primary and secondary cards are credited to different accounts, for each of which the limit of 5,000 is considered separately. </p><div class="photo" data-original="s3bank.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="list of program participants thank you" class="if uuid-2622114" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2622114.jpg"></div><p>  The number of “Thank you” points can be checked in several ways: </p><ul><li>  by calling the CC of Sberbank; </li><li>  using your personal account; </li><li>  personally contacting the office. </li></ul><p>  If you forget the password required to call the contact center, you can restore it through an ATM, or check in your personal online account. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Participants of the “Thank you” program from Sberbank leave a lot of positive feedback.  To participate in the action you do not need to fulfill special conditions.  It is enough to make purchases by paying with a card, accumulate bonuses and spend them in partner stores or on special portals of Sberbank. </p><p>  The number of satisfied customers, as well as the number of participants in the “Thank you” campaign, is gradually growing.
