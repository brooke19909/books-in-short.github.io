However, not everyone will be able to explain for themselves the first time what exactly they want to see before their eyes every night.  On the Internet, there are a lot of tips on how to choose this technique correctly.  The range is so wide that anyone's eyes will run wide.  Most buyers focus on those devices that impress with their functionality and useful life.  Flat panel TVs have long been popular.

    <h2>  Types of Flat TVs </h2><p>  The most popular are plasma, LED and LCD TVs.  How do they differ among themselves? </p><p>  Plasma TV displays the picture due to the fact that it sends an electric discharge to the plasma, which fills the cells. </p><p>  Liquid crystal devices are distinguished by the fact that they consist of liquid-type crystals (hence the name).  They are located between two plates of glass.  The display is due to the fact that a discharge is supplied to the crystals and a fluorescent lamp illuminates them. </p><p>  LED flat-panel TVs are similar in design to the previous ones, however, instead of the light source described above, they use LEDs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="flat screen tv" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1936683.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Contrast comparison </h2><p>  Before buying, the consumer should see how well the TV is capable of showing bright and darkened pictures at the same time.  The higher the contrast level, the better the image quality.  If it is low, then in fairly bright / dark pictures a person will not be able to examine certain details.  For some buyers, this aspect is very important.  Often all flat-panel TVs have excellent contrast.  Plasma comes first, LED comes second, and liquid crystal comes third, respectively.  It should be noted that LED devices have a backlight.  If they have its lateral type, then together with LCD devices will be noticeably inferior in parameters. </p><p>  In most liquid crystal devices, the contrast starts at 600: 1, while in plasmas this figure is four times greater. </p><p>  You need to choose the flat-screen TV that shows black images best.  This question seems not serious, but many budget models give such a picture faded. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="flat tvs" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1936684.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Brand selection </h2><p>  To choose the right flat device, you need to pay attention to many parameters.  An important role is played by the brand.  Any specialist will say that you need to purchase such a device, starting from your own preferences.  In most cases, all large and small flat TVs are created using the same technology, regardless of manufacturer.  But many consumers think differently - therefore, the question of choosing a brand becomes quite relevant. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In order to understand which brand is guaranteed to give only a pleasant experience, you need to pay attention only to already popular brands.  Next, you should consider all the models you like and make the final choice.  Flat TVs from Samsung and Sony are considered the best in this category of technology.  Therefore, it will be incredibly difficult to choose a truly worthy among them - you will have to compare all the criteria. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="flat tv on the wall" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1936692.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Samsung </h2><p>  A popular brand produces a huge amount of technology.  The South Korean company is engaged in the production of various devices, including televisions.  Every year it increases its sales without slowing down the global market. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the company is South Korean, most of the equipment is produced on the territory of the Russian Federation, namely in the Kaluga region.  Thanks to this, all televisions are sold at a fairly reasonable price. </p><p>  It should be noted that it was this company that released the first TV with Smart TV.  Every year she introduces more smart options to her technology.  If the plans include the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhanging a flat TV on the wall, then you should pay attention to the availability of special fasteners when buying.  Often they are available in each model. </p><p>  Among the available options from the Samsung should be noted the 2016 model with a diagonal of 28 and 55 inches.  Due to the fact that the company was able to hold onto the market leaders even during a severe crisis, many buyers note the excellent reputation of the brand and its quality. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="flat tv samsung" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1936685.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Sony </h2><p>  Those who want to buy a 55-inch flat-panel TV for themselves need to pay attention to Sony.  This brand has long been known in the Russian market, at the moment it is considered the same leader as Samsung.  The company has recommended itself for a long time.  For all customers, it is associated with truly high-quality equipment.  Some flat models in 2016 could be bought at fairly low prices. </p><p>  The most popular model can be called KD-55XD8599.  She got a <span>resolution of 4K.</span>  Owner reviews will make it clear that the picture is as sharp and clear as possible.  The second most popular model is the KDL-40W705C.  It has 40 inches and a little unfinished menu "Smart TV", but is fully consistent with its price. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  Before buying, you need to pay attention to the brand, diagonal, display and resolution.  It must be remembered that in the store the TV will look completely different from a person‚Äôs house!  This nuance is completely dependent on the size of the device.  Functionality will fully appreciate already at home.  An excellent choice would be <span>a</span> 42-inch or 55-inch flat- <span>screen TV</span> .  Such a unit will fit into any spacious room. </p>
