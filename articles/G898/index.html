    <h2>  What </h2><p>  <span>What is the</span> "Cabbage" service?  A microloan, a loan, or simply borrowing money at a certain point in time on the network is now not a fairy tale, but a reality.  After all, our today's service just specializes in these services.  And completely online. </p><p>  That is, we are dealing with a service that allows you to take microloans and loans without unnecessary paperwork.  Yes, and at any time, day or night.  Quite a good offer, if you think carefully.  But what do users think of him?  Is it possible to believe him?  What key points should you pay attention to before taking a loan or a loan from this organization?  Numerous user opinions about the company will help to understand all this. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Recently </h2><p>  To begin with, ‚ÄúCabbage‚Äù (a microloan or a loan with it on the network is no longer a problem) is a fairly new service.  It was created in 2012, but operates to this day.  So, we can assume that this is not a lie.  After all, a scam, as a rule, opens quickly, the "bench" closes even faster. </p><p>  In addition, users note that, despite the short life of the project, it is in great demand.  Indeed, in the network you can find many positive reviews about the work of the company.  However, there is no substantial evidence of the veracity of the project.  Maybe we are facing a really good fraud or a fraudulent organization?  After all, it is difficult to believe that <span>a loan</span> or a loan can be processed directly online, at any time. </p><h2>  Conditions </h2><p>  To understand the reliability of the services offered, sometimes it is enough to look at the conditions for the provision thereof.  It is possible that this is where some kind of catch lies.  But only with the "e-Cabbage" service is it in no way connected. </p><p>  The thing is that this project offers favorable conditions for obtaining loans.  Moreover, they attract the audience quite strongly.  For example, restrictions on the issuance of a loan - from 100 to 15,000 rubles.  You can‚Äôt take more for one application.  In addition, loans are given for about a month, and the interest rate pleases - only 2.3%.  But this rule applies only to the first week of service.  After it is reduced to 1.7%.  Very profitable, right? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="e cabbage" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1240059.jpg"></div>

    <div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  "Cabbage" (a microloan is now easier to arrange on the network) helps with the help of an online service to calculate the amount that you will have to repay in the final transaction.  For this, there is a special calculator on the official page.  It helps to quickly solve problems with interest rate changes.  This fact pleases many. </p><p>  In principle, this is where all the conditions end.  However, keep in mind that you must be over 18 years old to get a loan or a loan.  That is, the service is initially available only to adults.  This is a normal occurrence that inspires public confidence.  But is it worth it to mess with the project?  Or is it better to bypass it? </p><p>  Just this question causes a lot of diverse opinions among users.  It can be difficult to decide here.  Someone says that you should not resort to loans and loans online, some say the opposite.  But to deal with the integrity of the project is still necessary. </p><h2>  Contacts and addresses </h2><p>  You can look at such moments as the address of the organization, as well as contacts.  The site has a telephone hotline on which you can always call and ask your questions.  In addition, there is also email in the form of contacts.  But the organization "e-Cabbage" has only an email address.  You cannot actually find on the site.  This phenomenon makes many wonder - is this company so safe?  Why doesn‚Äôt she have a single address where you can ask questions? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="e cabbage phone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1240057.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Honestly, this is a suspicious phenomenon.  But, on the other hand, we are dealing exclusively with a virtual project.  So, he may not have a legal address.  So, this is not a reason to refuse to work with the service.  The project "e-Cabbage" has a telephone for communication, mail too - no problem, and at any time you have the opportunity to call and talk with operators, ask all your questions.  This phenomenon is credible. </p><h2>  Website </h2><p>  True, not everything is so easy and simple.  After all, "Cabbage" does not receive the best reviews.  Rather, they are either neutral or indefinite.  And users pay special attention to the project site. </p><p>  He does not cause much confidence.  Why?  Outwardly, the service looks as if they would not issue a loan to you, but to sell some kind of product.  A lot of advertising, positive reviews, as well as a detailed description of the terms of use of services with advertising notes.  No significant specifics that could confirm the safety and integrity of the project. </p><p>  But here you can see what the e-Cabbage company has a hotline.  Moreover, at any time you have the right to check the performance thereof.  Call and find out the details of the service?  Easy!  It is this phenomenon that is able to somehow convince the organization in good faith, if based solely on the composition of the site.  Yes, here you can find written information about loans and credits, but it all looks stereotyped.  And, of course, presented in an advertising form. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="e cabbage hotline" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1240056.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Decor </h2><p>  Particular attention is paid to the direct design of services.  E-Cabbage can take out a loan or a microloan, as the creators of the project emphasize, at any time of the day or night.  In this case, in advance you will be aware of the full amount that will need to be paid.  As already mentioned, a special online calculator, which is available directly on the organization‚Äôs main page, will help in the calculation. </p><p>  In addition, the "e-Cabbage" application is filled out not just online.  She also checked automatically.  In this case, the funds are withdrawn to you when you require.  That is, immediately after the check, which usually takes no more than 1 hour.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter whether it is day or night - you will get a loan when you asked for it. </p><p>  The design itself happens without problems.  It is enough to indicate your contact details, as well as choose a method of withdrawing funds.  For this service "e-Cabbage" receives very good reviews.  After all, you can take a loan (loan) on a card, by bank transfer, withdraw money to an electronic wallet.  Nothing suspicious.  After you receive the details for debt repayment.  All this pleases customers - now you do not need to do extra paperwork!  Need money?  "Cabbage" will quickly give them to you on favorable terms! </p><p>  By the way, you don‚Äôt need any documents at all.  An application for the issuance of funds requires only information from the passport - personal data, registration, date of issue of the identity card.  And nothing more.  Easy and simple.  This is also why "Cabbage" (a microloan or a loan is no longer a problem) gets positive opinions. </p><h2>  Refund </h2><p>  But how to repay a debt?  What do users think about this process?  At e-Cabbage, paying a loan is not a problem.  You will be provided with all the details that may be required.  And you can repay the debt in any convenient way.  For example, through online banking or payment terminals. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="e cabbage reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1240055.jpg"></div>

    <p>  By the way, if you fail to return the money on time for one reason or another, you can agree on a short delay.  True, such options are extremely rare.  Why?  All due to the fact that the service initially provides all the calculations and shows how much and when you have to pay.  Moreover, this happens even at the stage of obtaining a loan.  So, you can only rejoice at the service.  But is he so good?  Are there really any negative aspects in the activity of a credit organization? </p><h2>  Delay </h2><p>  Not at all.  Paying attention is at a time such as late payment.  Even if you agree with the organization about it, it is not a fact that you will not have any problems.  Of course, this moment will not affect the credit history too much, but it‚Äôs completely on life. </p><p>  The thing is that often ‚Äúe-Cabbage‚Äù attracts collection companies to ‚Äúknock out‚Äù payments from debtors.  Moreover, the communication of users with these organizations begins immediately after the appearance of debt.  In most cases, it will not be possible to agree on a postponement without involving collectors.  They will still bother you.  Consider this moment.  After all, our today's organization is extremely serious about the issue of refunds.  Took - return.  Moreover, the overpayment, as a rule, is not too large. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="e cabbage loan" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1240054.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <h2>  Surprise Payment </h2><p>  "e-Cabbage" reviews the negative plan in some cases.  Especially from those who paid the loan on time.  Often there are situations when collectors begin to bother users after a full settlement with the company.  That is, you gave the money, paid off the loan, there is no debt, but they still demand it from you. </p><p>  This phenomenon has a serious impact on the popularity and success of "Cabbage".  In this situation, they will have to defend their rights in court.  Moreover, with a greater degree of probability, as some users say, you will not win the case.  After all, obtaining a loan or a loan on the Internet is an unreliable and risky business.  So, it is possible that you will have to pay twice.  The first time - legally, the second - by court order.  Occasionally, in such proceedings, it turns out to prove their innocence.  Especially given the quick and easy loan processing in automatic mode! </p><h2>  Praise </h2><p>  But where did the web get so many positive opinions about the organization?  Is all <span>this a hoax?</span>  Partially.  Yes, most of the good opinions that e-Cabbage receives are a hoax.  Purchased reviews aimed at attracting an audience.  At the same time, you should not think that we are facing a scam, not at all.  Cabbage is a truly functioning organization that issues microloans and loans.  Although with its own characteristics. </p><p>  Thus, it is necessary to distinguish between falsehood and truth.  Please note - purchased reviews look stereotyped and more paint the benefits of the company.  No significant and useful information can be extracted from them.  So, rather, you have to believe mixed opinions. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  What is the final picture?  Service "e-Cabbage" microloan and credit really gives.  Moreover, the company offers several options for obtaining funds.  So, we are faced with no non-fraudulent move.  However, it is recommended that you avoid this service. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="e cabbage application" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1240053.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Why?  As already mentioned, some surprises await you in the future.  For example, if it happens that defending one‚Äôs own rights in court will be difficult, sometimes impossible.  Anyway, getting a loan online is a risky activity.  No one can predict the consequences.  You can simply be deceived.  For example, money can‚Äôt be transferred, but the debt is ‚Äúknocked out‚Äù.  This happens with e-Cabbage. </p>
