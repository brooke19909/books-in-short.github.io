    <p>  Regardless of whether you make a microsim adapter at home or buy it, a preliminary familiarization with the specifics of use and types of adapters will allow you to use the same SIM card for all types of phones. </p><h2>  Types of Micro SIM Adapters </h2><p>  Currently, two types of micro-SIM adapters are available in almost any mobile accessories store.  The first type of adapter is a simple plastic design in the form of a standard SIM card with a micro-SIM-shaped hole.  This type of adapter is usually available with an <span>adhesive label</span> or thin fixation in the corners to keep the SIM card in place.  The second type of adapter is equipped with a cover.  It has a thin plastic coating on one side of the space where the micro-SIM should be installed.  This cover has a small round hole in the center. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  How to make a micro SIM card from a standard </h2><p>  The metal contacts of a standard SIM card, also called a mini-SIM, are the only working parts of the case.  Cut off the rest of the sim card to make it micro.  Thus, a micro SIM card has a less plastic shell than a traditional one.  To make micro without using a template, you must first measure a standard SIM card that is 25 mm high and 15 mm wide.  Then measure the distances around the metal contacts or the SIM card.  Micro SIM is 12 mm high and 15 mm wide.  Mark these measurements on the SIM card and cut them accordingly. </p><p>  The micro SIM card template provides accurate measurements.  To use it, use double-sided tape to attach it to the SIM card.  This is necessary so that the card does not move during cutting.  After the template is fixed in place, you must cut a "SIM" along it with sharp scissors. </p>

    <p>  The cutter can also be used to make a micro SIM card.  It works like a hole punch.  To apply it, place the standard SIM card in the tray, make a sharp press and pull out the smaller SIM card. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to make a microsim adapter? </h2><p>  It also will not be very difficult.  Buyers can make a micro SIM adapter with a cutter.  To do this, put the standard SIM card in the tray and pull out the micro SIM card.  Then use the rest of the standard SIM card as an adapter.  The micro card obtained during this process fits perfectly into this adapter. </p><p>  The second way to create an adapter for micro SIM is to use an old credit or other similar card.  First, measure the size of a regular ‚ÄúSIM card‚Äù on an old or invalid bank card and cut it out.  Then place it in the cutter tray and cut out a portion of the exact size of the micro SIM card.  The remainder will act as a micro SIM adapter. </p>

    <h2>  How to use a micro SIM adapter? </h2><p>  To use the microsim adapter, customers must place a micro SIM card in its hole and make sure that the card is flat on both sides so that it does not damage the smartphone after installing it in it.  Then slowly slide the SIM card adapter into the phone slot.  If the micro SIM card slides, it may get stuck in the slot and damage the metal contacts in the device.  Therefore, be careful when installing or removing the adapter from its slot. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How to buy a micro-SIM adapter? </h2><p>  We apply microsim adapters on sale in wide varieties and combinations, including in online stores.

    <h2>  Samdi Brand Sim Adapter </h2><p>  This is one of the best-selling SIM card adapters on offer.  There are several different colors of adapters, the cost of which is the same.  The device is equipped with both a micro and nano SIM adapter.  There is also an adapter designed for a micro microphone, which is compatible with any iPhone model.  There is an ejector SIM needle in this kit, since many modern devices (in particular, from Apple and OnePlus 3) are equipped with ejector trays.  You also get a folder for storing SIM cards, which will be useful if you have many SIM cards that you intend to store. </p><h2>  MediaDevil Simdevil 3-in-1 </h2><p>  This is also a good set for SIM cards, which can be bought everywhere.  The kit contains three different adapters.  There is an adapter with nano SIM to microsymbol, as well as nano and micro to standard.

Thanks to this, you can safely expect that your card will fit perfectly into the microsim adapter.  This is especially true for SIM cards that have been manually cropped earlier, as their size may not be entirely accurate.  This kit is a budget, and at the same time it guarantees full compatibility with almost all phone models. </p>
