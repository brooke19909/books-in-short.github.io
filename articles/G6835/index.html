This state is located in Southeast Asia and attracts many tourists, despite its significant geographical remoteness.  After all, the place is simply amazing, and the cost of recreation here is relatively low. </p><p>  The second largest island of Thailand after Phuket is Samui.  It is located in the Pacific Gulf of Thailand and covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãalmost 247 square meters.  kilometers.  The distance from this island to Bangkok (the capital of Thailand) is 565 km.  Anyone who decides to get from Koh Samui to the mainland will have to cross the Gulf of Thailand, having crossed a path of about 40 km. </p><h2>  Attractive destination </h2><p>  What can you hear the reviews of tourists about the rest on Koh Samui?  For many, this place is associated with snow-white beaches, coconut palms, amazingly beautiful cliffs, numerous islands and islands, waterfalls, fun parties and, of course, eternal summer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kohsamuisunset.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sea ‚Äã‚Äãview with gazebo" class="if uuid-3017474" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/3017474.jpg"></div><p>  Judging by the reviews of tourists, a holiday on Koh Samui is much better than at other resorts in Thailand.  There are no big waves on the island, and the rainy season is not so pronounced in comparison with the rest of the territory of this Asian state.  Many tourists call Samui a bounty resort.  Here you can almost endlessly enjoy beautiful views of the white sand, blue sea and pristine nature. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  History </h2><p>  According to researchers, people settled on Samui in the 6th century.  AD  These were the Chinese fishermen who built their village here.  However, the first mention of the island in the history of the Middle Kingdom can be found only 500 years ago.  These are documents proving the fact that trade flourished between China and Samui.  This is also confirmed by the Celestial ships found near the island with ceramic products. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kohsamuisunset.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="huts near palm trees" class="if uuid-3017472" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/3017472.jpg"></div><p>  Initially, only fishermen settled in Samui.  And the island was a continuous jungle, since the villages in which the local population lived were, as a rule, on the seashore.  People got to each other in boats, having traveled along the coast.  The development of the island was facilitated by Buddhist monks who called on the people to build earthen roads. </p><p>  For a considerable period of time, the inhabitants of the island earned fishing and collecting coconuts with the help of specially trained monkeys for this.  Buyers came for these goods not only from China, but also from mainland Thailand. </p><p>  The almost complete isolation of the island, which had the only connection with the outside world in the form of a ferry, which in 10 hours transported people to the nearest major city of Thailand - Surat Thani, came to its end only in the second half of the 20th century.  In 1967, the Governor of Samui made a proposal to the Thai government on the need for road construction.  This was the turning point that changed the history of the island.  Roads have been built here for 6 years.  The work was greatly complicated by the relief, in which impassable jungle and hills abounded. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The construction of the 52-kilometer ring road was completed in 1973. This moment was the beginning for Samui of its history as one of the best and most popular resorts in Thailand. </p><p>  The first tourists who came here in the early 70s settled in ordinary huts, standing on the numerous beaches of Samui.

Numerous hotels began to be erected here and the tourist infrastructure with entertainment facilities, restaurants and shops got its rapid development.  Migrant workers rushed to the cities of the island.  They came here from almost all over Thailand.  Together with tourists, they increased the population of the island several dozen times. </p><p>  Today, the basis of the economy of Samui is precisely the tourism business.  The development of this sphere was not prevented even by the disastrous tsunami of 2014 and the flood of 2011, which left most of the sights and beaches of the island under water. </p><h2>  origin of name </h2><p>  There is a version according to which ‚Äúmui‚Äù is nothing more than a species of trees growing on the island.  There is also an opinion that the name ‚ÄúSamui‚Äù comes from the Malay language, in which saboey means ‚Äúsafe marina‚Äù. </p><p>  Thais often call this resort Koh Samui.
