Here is a rich underwater world. </p><p>  There is a bar on the beach serving refreshing drinks and snacks. </p><h2>  A little bit about the resort ... </h2><p>  Okurcalar is considered one of the warmest resorts in Turkey.  The Mediterranean coast attracts many tourists due to its subtropical mild climate and clean pebble and sandy beach.  The resort is known as a relatively inexpensive but good holiday destination. </p><p>  The most attractive moment for vacationers are the good beaches of these places.  They have good gentle descents into the water and a rugged coastline, which makes it possible to hide from the waves in any of the many picturesque bays.  For this reason, divers love this place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Litore resort hotel spa 5 turkey alanya" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1460276.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  There are a lot of completely different hotels in Okurcalar.  However, the lack of any cultural attractions should be considered a disadvantage of the resort.  To see something interesting, you must go to at least Alanya.  But the local resort guarantees peace and quiet.  There are many restaurants, shops, shops.  And on Fridays and Tuesdays there is a market where you can buy local souvenirs. </p><h2>  Tours and attractions </h2><p>  As we have already mentioned, the Litore Resort Hotel &amp; Spa 5 * hotel is in a great place to relax.  However, to see local attractions, you will have to go to the famous Alanya, located only thirty kilometers away.  The city is one of the most beautiful and charming places in Turkey.  Of course, it can not be compared with the bustling Istanbul, but it is attractive in its own way as a resort. </p><p>  He deserves to break away from sea recreation and admire its beauties.  The main attraction of Alanya is the fortress.  It is perfectly preserved and is a historical value, because it stands out by its considerable size among similar ancient monuments in Turkey.  Once inside the fortress there was a mint, a church, a mosque and a monastery, a winter palace of the sultan himself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Litore resort hotel spa 5 turkey okurcalar" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1460278.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The Kyzyl-Kule tower located in the port of Alanya is no less interesting in historical terms.  Countless tourists visit her.  This structure appeared thanks to the famous Seljuk Sultan Aladdin Keykubat.  To appreciate the beauty and power of the tower, you need to climb to its very top in 85 steps.  She faithfully served for many centuries the inhabitants of the city, and therefore deservedly became its symbol. </p><p>  Fans of active and educational recreation should definitely visit the famous caves of Alanya.  Nature has created along the Mediterranean coast a huge number of grottoes and caves.  Three of them are most interesting for tourists: Dim Magarasy, Karain Magarasy, Damlatash Magarasy. </p><p>  <span>Damlatas Cave</span> is located in the very center of Alanya.  It was discovered during the construction of the port in 1948.  The cave is stunning with its beauty, it is almost completely covered with stalagmites and stalactites, whose age reaches 15 thousand years.  It is very useful to be for those people who suffer from respiratory diseases.  Strong humidity, stable air temperature, high carbon dioxide content have a beneficial effect on the human body. </p><h2>  Leisure </h2><p>  As a rule, they go to sea resorts as a whole family to relax, and therefore it is necessary to look for entertainment that will be interesting to absolutely everyone.  Such a place is Sealanya Park.  It can be spent all day.  To fully see it, you should ride on the "Slow River" (the so-called water attraction).  There is also a dolphinarium in the park.  Performances in it take place a couple of times a day.  Here, tourists can see sea lions, seals, dolphins, which show different tricks and tricks for appreciative spectators. </p><h2>  Litore Resort Hotel &amp; Spa 5 *: reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, I would definitely like to refer to the reviews of tourists who managed to visit it.  Of course, the complex is very new, it works a little over a year.  Nevertheless, a definite impression of him has already developed.  Should I plan my vacation at Litore Resort Hotel &amp; Spa 5 *?  Reviews of tourists in general are very good. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel litore resort hotel spa 5" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1460287.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  According to vacationers, the exterior beauty of the hotel and its territory is impressive.  No less interesting is the building from the inside.  The lobby is decorated quite nicely and pathos. </p><p>  As for the rooms, they are all new, beautiful and functional.  Each has a balcony or terrace, which is very convenient - there is where to dry things after the beach.  It is difficult to say which apartments are better: with sea or mountain views.  Here it‚Äôs a matter of taste. </p><p>  The rooms are cleaned daily and efficiently.  There are no complaints.  Maids change bedding once every three days without reminders.  The hotel staff is very nice.  If you arrive earlier than the estimated time (14.00), and as a rule, the way it turns out, they try to settle you at the reception immediately and not pickle before lunch.  As for eviction, in the event that the hotel is not crowded with guests, you may be allowed to stay a bit in your room and check out later than fourteen hours, if necessary.  The complex has a Russian-speaking staff.  Therefore, a language barrier does not arise.  In addition, all the service staff decently speaks English.  Service at the hotel is not intrusive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="litore resort hotel spa 5 okurcalar" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1460293.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The main issue when purchasing a tour is the quality of food.  The all-inclusive system popular for Turkey is also present in Litore Resort Hotel &amp; Spa 5 * (Turkey).  Reviews of vacationers regarding nutrition are only positive.  The main restaurant serves wonderful and varied dishes: a lot of meat, fish, excellent soups for every taste.  In the morning there is baby food (canned) for the smallest.  Once a week, a fish day is arranged, then a lot of seafood appears in the evening menu: squid, mussels, tiger prawns. </p><p>  As for alcohol, the hotel has both local and foreign.  Of course, bartenders try to pour more local drinks.  However, according to experienced tourists, small tips quickly resolve this issue.  And then at your service any drinks. </p><p>  The hotel works well with children's animation.  The mini-club is divided by age, there is a special room for the smallest (up to three years).  In addition, children have a well-equipped playground and a pool equipped like a mini-water park with small slides. </p><p>  The hotel also takes care of the leisure of adult guests.  Animators work on the territory of the complex, conducting daily classes in water aerobics and arranging games on the beach.  In the evenings, tourists are entertained (belly dance is always present).  Once a week, artists come with acrobatic performances. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Litore resort hotel spa 5 turkey" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1460289.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel is in a very beautiful place.  To the beach no more than fifty meters.  However, you will have to go along the sandy slope, although this is not necessary, since the transport constantly brings guests to the shore.  The sea is very warm and good.  The resort has received such great popularity because of the gentle sea slopes and the sandy coast, which are very convenient for children.  Near the beach there is a beautiful pine grove, which you should definitely visit. </p><p>  As for sightseeing, local guides offer many different excursions.  But here you need to be careful, because many of them do not quite honestly and conscientiously work.  Knowledgeable tourists prefer to visit interesting places on their own, it is much cheaper and easier, you do not depend on the group and you can devote as much time to sightseeing as you need. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  The new Litore Resort Hotel &amp; Spa 5 * can be recommended for a comfortable holiday for tourists.  The countryside complex is perfect for families with children, guaranteeing peace and tranquility surrounded by the sea coast and mountains. </p>
