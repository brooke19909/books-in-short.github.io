    <p>  Such a task will be more difficult, since the builder will have to perform the cutting of materials himself.  And such a process implies the presence of certain skills and additional equipment. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you are a beginner in shipbuilding, such a task will be quite complex and difficult to accomplish.  For its implementation it will be necessary to carefully prepare, study a large amount of information on how to build a wooden yacht with your own hands. </p><p>  So, first study as much special literature as possible.  Tune in immediately to create a small model so as not to risk large volumes of materials, which is quite expensive. </p><p>  Analyze the features of the process, how to build a yacht with your own hands, a photo with the study of step-by-step instructions.  Next, take care of the presence of a room in which construction work will directly take place.  It should be quite spacious, since the dimensions of the finished vessel are not small. </p><p>  The better the conditions for construction are organized, the more successful and faster the process of creating a yacht will be completed.  It is also important to stock up with the necessary tools to work. </p><h2>  Start building </h2><p>  The process of creating a yacht is called a boathouse.  Whatever model you choose, it is necessary to begin the implementation of the project after all the documentation and step-by-step instructions on how to build a yacht with your own hands are carefully studied.  This is a rather important stage, because mistakes at this stage can have serious consequences.  We recommend purchasing a ready-made set of parts made of wood so as not to risk the large volumes of natural wood.  This will save not only money, but also a lot of time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to build a yacht do-it-yourself book" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60199/2072077.jpg"></div>

Start by connecting the frames and the keel.  Ultimately, you should get a kind of one-piece connection. </p><p>  The following is the installation of springers on frames.  This ensures the fastening of the skin of the vessel.  For this, a special moisture-proof plywood is used. </p><p>  Such an assembly will require a traditional position.  Therefore, it will be necessary to install the yacht upwards with the keel, which makes it possible to accurately calculate the dimensions and ensure the creation of ideal contours of the vessel. </p><p>  The use of moisture-resistant plywood-type sheathing will make it possible to achieve high reliability indicators, which will distinguish the vessel in structure.  Do not forget to take care of the use of fiberglass to seal surfaces. </p><p>  It is necessary to mount fiberglass in areas where there is a special moisture-resistant epoxy composition.  It must be laid in several rows.  When they dry, a layer of a uniform waterproof surface is formed. </p><h2>  We care about the beauty of the ship </h2><p>  The book "How to build a yacht with your own hands" informs us that you can create an attractive model and additionally provide protection for finished surfaces using special varnish and paints that have a waterproof effect. </p><p>  You will need to paint inside the yacht using this type of paint.  Subsequently, it will be possible to do the deck. </p><h2>  The work is coming to an end </h2><p>  The final stage will be the final finishing of the case.  Next, a variety of necessary equipment and sailing equipment is installed. </p><p>  The most important step in the implementation of instructions on how to build a yacht with your own hands is to test the finished vessel and check the strength of the connection of all elements.  This provides the safety measures necessary for all water modes of transport. </p><p>  If there are some shortcomings and shortcomings that were noted during the design of the vessel, care must be taken to eliminate them as soon as possible.  After all, you risk your safety on the water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to build a yacht do-it-yourself instructions" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60199/2072090.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  If you choose a difficult path </h2><p>  <span>Building a vessel</span> without blanks and instructions requires an independent search for drawings.  It is necessary to accurately perform calculations so as not to make a mistake with the amount of wood. </p><p>  The first step will be the preparation of project documentation.  It is not up to beginners to compile it independently.  You will need an appeal to employees of specialized organizations or the help of Internet resources. </p><p>  The second stage is the preparation of a spacious room, the creation of a boathouse for construction work. </p><p>  The slipway is being assembled in accordance with the dimensions of the vessel.  The creation of the slipway consists in laying softwood beams on sections of a flat prepared surface. </p><p>  You will need to perform this procedure in two layers with a dressing structure to form a surface that will be exactly horizontal. </p><p>  The third stage is the harvesting of wood.  It should be of high quality, as this affects the strength and navigability of the vessel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to build a yacht with your own hands from wood" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60199/2075740.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The creation of the vessel implies the presence of two types of wood: boards made of needles without knots and harder wood species, for example, oak or ash. </p><p>  It is required to take into account the moisture parameters of the material, which should be in the range up to 20%.  This will protect the structure from possible deformation. </p><p>  The fourth stage is the assembly of all structural elements. </p><p>  It is necessary to assemble and glue the frame frames using a special template device.  Finding a working plaza should be located on plywood sheets from 10 to 12 mm thick. </p><p>  When installing the stem stock, take care to maintain an accurate tilt angle.  It should be clearly oriented to the horizon. </p><p>  All elements are fastened with screws or glue.  The next stage is the implementation of mandatory shallowing of the surfaces of the yacht in order to identify all discrepancies, eliminate defects.  Sheathe the vessel can be sheet plywood. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to build a yacht with your own hands step by step instructions" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60199/2072091.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The rigidity and tightness of the casing is provided by gluing it with fiberglass. </p><p>  Next, you need to turn the base of the vessel and pick up the deck in a longitudinal way. </p><p>  This is followed by the implementation of painting and testing of the vessel. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  We hope that this article on how to build a yacht with your own hands will help you achieve your desired goal and fulfill the dream of traveling on your own ship.  To do this, you need to be patient, take care of the availability of premises and tools.
