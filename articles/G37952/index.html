  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Unemployment and its types, types and forms</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Unemployment is a phenomenon that attracts the attention of politicians, economists and sociologists.  It is a very important indicator of the well-being of society, and the higher the unemployment rate, the worse the country's economic and social condition.  People who are unable to find work are called unemployed, and statistical reports of the number of these members of society determine its level, which is calculated from the number of able-bodied people. </p><p>  <strong>Unemployment and its types: voluntary and forced</strong> </p><p>  There are many types, types and <span>forms of unemployment,</span> and the first two main types - voluntary and forced. </p><p>  In the first case, the person himself refuses to work.  Various reasons contribute to this: low wages, lack of motivation to work or skills.  The frequency of voluntary unemployment increases during economic instability. </p><p>  Unemployment expectations occur when a person wants to work, his salary level suits him, but he cannot find a vacant place. </p><p>  <strong>Unemployment and its types: registered and marginal</strong> </p><p>  Registered unemployment is the number of people who do not work, but are registered with an official institution and are in the waiting line for a vacant place. </p><p>  Marginal - this is the number of unemployed people who are in the category of vulnerable groups.  These include women, youth and people with disabilities, as well as representatives of the lowest social stratum. </p><p>  <strong>Unemployment and its types: unstable and structural</strong> </p><p>  The first <span>type of unemployment</span> means dismissal, which is caused by temporary reasons: for example, <span>seasonal work</span> or voluntary transfer to another service. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>Structural unemployment</span> occurs when the qualifications of potential employees do not meet new requirements and standards.  This happens when a country undergoes economic restructuring, as it was in Russia in the 90s: the market for professions began to be updated sharply by unknown professions, but the society was not ready to make a sharp educational transition, which led to massive unemployment and the attraction of foreign specialists in the Russian labor market. </p><p>  <strong>Unemployment and its types: institutional, frictional and hidden</strong> </p><p>  Institutional unemployment occurs when the state limits the rates at a time when they could form in a natural way. </p><p>  Frictional unemployment is a normal phenomenon in a country with economic stability: for example, it means a temporary search by a worker for a more attractive job for him. </p><p>  Hidden unemployment is a form that involves hiding one's unemployed position from society. </p><p>  <strong>Unemployment and its types</strong> </p><p>  Some types of unemployment are divided into types.  Forced unemployment is divided into three types: </p><ul><li>  <strong>Cyclic.</strong>  If a country's systematically recession and resumption of a certain industry occurs, then cyclical unemployment will develop here. </li><li>  <strong>Seasonal</strong>  Some <span>sectors of the economy are</span> activated seasonally: for example, the agricultural region has many branches, and one of the work required in it - tillage, is carried out only in the warm seasons (spring, summer, autumn). </li><li>  <strong>Technological.</strong>  It is due to the fact that some professions become irrelevant over time due to the replacement of human labor with technology. </li></ul><p>  Hidden unemployment has two types: </p><ul><li>  <strong>Formal</strong>  It happens when production is partially stopped: people are formally registered in the staff of the enterprise, but actually do not work. </li><li>  <strong>Informal.</strong>  In this category, persons who have not registered their unemployment. </li></ul><p>  <strong>Unemployment and its forms</strong> </p><p>  There are two forms of unemployment, depending on the number of people: </p><ul><li>  <strong>Bulk.</strong>  It occurs when a country experiences an <span>economic downturn: the</span> massive closure of large enterprises, the lack of budget money to pay salaries, etc. Especially massive unemployment appears in small towns, where a large enterprise closes, which contributed to the employment of most of the inhabitants of this settlement. </li><li>  <strong>Partial</strong>  It arises when the demand for the company's products for some reason decreases. </li></ul><p>  Thus, unemployment is a clear indicator of the social and economic condition of a country; it can occur for many reasons and have a variety of forms and types. </p>
