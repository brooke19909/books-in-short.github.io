  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sights of Moscow: top best</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There are a great many cultural objects in Moscow - more than four hundred museums, about a thousand architectural monuments, one hundred and thirty theaters and dozens of exhibition halls.  All the main events of the country's cultural life take place precisely in the capital, where the domes of Orthodox churches and the monumental high-rises of the times of the ‚ÄúStalin Empire‚Äù are adjacent, and the estates of aristocrats are located next to fashionable clubs and restaurants. </p><p>  All positions from the top 30 sights of Moscow to visit in a few days in Belokamennaya will not work.  The capital of Russia has many faces, which allows tourists to discover thousands of different sides of this city each time.  But the list of Moscow sights (photos with names and a brief description) will help you navigate and choose the most interesting places. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.myguidemoscow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the Red Square" class="if uuid-2918807" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2918807.jpg"></div><h2>  Red Square and the Kremlin </h2><p>  The historical city center is included in the top 3 sights of Moscow according to any version.  Those who have never been to the capital should start dating from here.  Most excursions start from Red Square and many independent routes begin.  And all because the red towers of the Kremlin are an established brand.  For centuries, the Kremlin served as the main defensive structure, it was rebuilt several times, and the square became the site of events important not only for the state, but for the whole world.  In addition, various cultural events, public gatherings, parades and fairs have been held here for centuries. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  St. Basil's Cathedral </h2><p>  The list of the main attractions of Moscow invariably includes St. Basil's Cathedral with its colorful painted poppies.  It is the same symbol of Russia for foreigners as the Eiffel Tower for France or the Taj Mahal for India.  The sights of Moscow from the square in front of the Kremlin can be well seen.  The cathedral was founded by order of Tsar Ivan the Terrible after the capture of Kazan, which fell on the day of the Protection of the Holy Virgin.  At first, golden domes and red-white stone walls rose above Moscow, but later the temple was rebuilt several times.  The name of the unique architectural ensemble (the cathedral consists of eight churches) was given in honor of St. Basil, the holy fool who collected part of the funds for the construction of the cathedral. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.visitrussia.org.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Basil's Cathedral" class="if uuid-2918790" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2918790.jpg"></div><h2>  Futuristic Moscow City </h2><p>  Moscow‚Äôs top attractions include modern ‚Äúmonuments‚Äù.  The business quarter of the capital, which consists of modern futuristic design skyscrapers, is a unique project both for Russia and for the whole of Eastern Europe.  Federation Tower, the highest in the complex, reaches a height of 235 meters.  Other buildings also have their own names.  The quarter is called "Moscow Manhattan," because Moscow-City was originally conceived as a domestic analogue of New York or London business centers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Cathedral of Christ the Savior </h2><p>  The main temple of Russia cannot be missed even by those who are far from religion.  The dramatic fate of the temple attracts it, which made it not only a monument that practically disappeared in 1812, but also a witness to important events in the history of Russia of the last century, as well as a unique architectural ensemble.  The temple-monument was erected in honor of the victory and in memory of the victims of the war of 1812.  During the years of Stalin, the monument was blown up, and the Palace of Soviets was to appear in its place.  After the outbreak of the war, funds for this project were no longer found, and with the death of Stalin the idea completely lost its relevance from a political point of view.  During the rebuilding of the cathedral after the collapse of the <span>Soviet Union,</span> the interior was conceived as a chronicle of the war of 1812 in the plots of the Gospel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="youvictours.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cathedral of Christ the Savior" class="if uuid-2918810" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2918810.jpg"></div><h2>  Novodevichy Convent </h2><p>  Top 5 sights of Moscow, according to domestic and foreign tourists, are closed by the oldest convent in the capital.  At the place where the Novodevichy Convent now stands, during the time of the Golden Horde, young girls were collected for sending to forced labor.  The temple was founded by Vasily III in 1524.  Subsequently, many royal people, girls from boyar and princely families were accepted into the monastery, but many did not come here of their own free will.  Prisoners of the Novodevichy Convent at different times were Evrosyne Staritskaya, the wife of Prince Andrei, Tsarina Irina Fedorovna and Tsarevna Ksenia Borisovna Godunovs, the wife and daughter of Boris Godunov, the widow of Vasily Shuisky Maria Buinosova-Rostovskaya, Sofia, the sister of Peter I, Evdokia Petra Lopukhina, the first other. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Church of the Ascension in Kolomenskoye </h2><p>  The temple of the sixteenth century is located on the territory of the complex in Kolomenskoye.  Presumably, the construction was led by Italian architect Petroc Maly.  This church is one of the first examples of stone temples in Russia.  The architecture of the monument is considered unique.  In the Ascension Church, you can listen to the service (services are held only on major church holidays), admire the interior decoration, go to the museum and take a walk through the gallery. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="church of the ascension" class="if uuid-2918814" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2918814.jpg"></div><h2>  Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary </h2><p>  In the top 10 attractions of Moscow, according to tourists, includes a cathedral built in the Gothic style with the money of the Polish community.  This is the main Catholic cathedral of the Russian capital, the main buildings of which were erected at the beginning of the twentieth century according to the project of the architect Bogdanovich-Dvorzhetsky.  A typical example of architecture is worth a visit because cultural events are held here.  For example, you can go to a concert of organ music and at the same time inspect the cathedral. </p><h2>  Museum-Reserve Tsaritsyno </h2><p>  Museums adjoin the list of Moscow sights with the name of monasteries, cathedrals and temples.  One of the recommended places to visit is the museum reserve in Tsaritsyno.  The park ensemble occupies more than 100 hectares.  Previously, the architectural ensemble served as the residence of the king, but today the park houses concert halls, museums, exhibitions and greenhouses. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trover.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tsaritsyno Museum" class="if uuid-2918817" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2918817.jpg"></div><h2>  Kolomna Palace </h2><p>  The wooden palace, which belonged to Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich, opened its doors to visitors only in 2010.  The entire building was conceived in such a way as to emphasize the power of the Russian state and the power of the tsar, and the interior decoration is still amazing with luxury.  Under Empress Catherine II, the palace was dismantled, but, fortunately, preliminary detailed drawings were made.  According to these drawings, the Kolomna Palace was subsequently completely restored. </p><h2>  Kremlin in Izmailovo </h2><p>  Top-10 sights of Moscow are closed by the Kremlin, only Izmailovsky.  This is also the residence of Alexei Mikhailovich, which was built according to the drawings and sketches preserved from the past.  The Kremlin appeared near the Partizanskaya metro station in 2007.  On the territory today there are taverns, museums, artisan shops and a church. </p><h2>  Manor Kuskovo </h2><p>  A great place for walking and a unique cultural monument of the eighteenth century is the summer residence of the Counts Sheremetyevs, designed for magnificent receptions, theatrical performances and crowded festivities.  The estate received the status of the museum in 1919, and in 1938 it was merged with the Museum of Ceramics.  Visitors can admire the original decoration of interiors, works of art, curtains of Russian emperors and the owners of the estate for several generations.  Amusement pavilions in the park are called upon to entertain the public - the Dutch House, the Chinese Pavilion, the Pillar, the Italian Pond, the Annian Baroque church, the Museum of Ceramics.  From May to September, the concert season is open in the Ballroom, so every weekend a chamber orchestra plays in Kuskovo, a piano, organ and harp are played, arias from operettas are performed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="img-fotki.yandex.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="manor kuskovo" class="if uuid-2918825" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2918825.jpg"></div><h2>  Krutitsky Compound </h2><p>  Since 1991, an architectural monument of the seventeenth century serves as the patriarchal compound.  Here is also the department for youth affairs of the Russian Orthodox Church.  Krutitsky Compound allows us to imagine what Moscow looked like in past centuries.  At first there was a monastery, and then the residence of the higher clergy. </p><h2>  Bolshoi Theater in Moscow </h2><p>  One of the best theaters in the world could not enter the top sights of Moscow.  The large one was built in 1825, but the building burned down after a quarter of a century.  In the future, the theater was repeatedly rebuilt and restored.  The monumental building is decorated with massive columns, striking and the interior.  The attention of tourists is attracted by a crystal chandelier in the main hall. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bau-xi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Grand Theatre" class="if uuid-2918826" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2918826.jpg"></div><h2>  State Tretyakov Gallery </h2><p>  According to the opinion of domestic and foreign tourists, for some reason the Tretyakov Gallery was not included in the top 10 sights of Moscow that must be visited.  The museum, founded by the merchant family of the Tretyakovs, officially opened for visiting in 1893.  Here are collected more than 180 thousand exhibits - prints, Russian painting, icons. </p><h2>  "Bunker-42" on Taganka </h2><p>  Sights of the city of Moscow are not only temples and cathedrals with a rich history, although these monuments (as witnesses of important events) mainly attract tourists.  In second place are the monuments of the Stalin era.  One of these can be considered <span>the Cold War Museum,</span> which is located at a depth of more than 50 meters underground.  Initially, the bunker was conceived as a refuge for the party elite in the event of a nuclear strike.  Here was stored food stock for a long time.  During the tour, visitors have the opportunity to examine the atmosphere of the halls of the bunker. </p><div class="photo" data-original="soc-life.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bunker 42" class="if uuid-2918831" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2918831.jpg"></div><h2>  State Historical Museum </h2><p>  One of the main museums in the capital is located on Red Square.  This point from the top attractions of Moscow is definitely worth a visit to all history buffs.  The museum exhibits collections that cover all eras of Russian history until the twentieth century.  Expositions related to the history of other countries are presented.  The museum was founded by order of Tsar Alexander II at the end of the nineteenth century, and in 1990 the building was listed as a UNESCO heritage site. </p><h2>  Circus on Tsvetnoy Boulevard </h2><p>  Since its opening, the circus has become a platform only for the best groups.  The building was built in 1880, and in 1996 the circus was named after the artist Yuri Nikulin.  The auditorium is designed for two thousand people, and during the performances the most modern equipment is used.  Spectators are surely waiting for an exciting show. </p><h2>  Pushkin Museum of Art </h2><p>  The museum has been expanding steadily throughout the past century, so now the exposition contains more than 700 exhibits.  The halls host exhibitions of authors who are known throughout the world, and the collection is based on exhibits from the Cabinet of Fine Arts and Antiquities of Moscow State University. </p><h2>  Victory Park on Poklonnaya Hill </h2><p>  The park complex, dedicated to the victory of the courageous Soviet people in the war, officially opened only in 1995, although construction began in 1987.  The central monument is an obelisk crowned with a statue of the goddess of victory.  In 2009-2010, the Eternal Flame also burned here, which was transferred from the Alexander Garden for the entire period of reconstruction of the monument. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wikiway.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Victory Park" class="if uuid-2918828" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2918828.jpg"></div><h2>  Sparrow Hills </h2><p>  Closes the top 20 sights of Moscow, the main observation deck of the capital, which offers a beautiful view of the Stalinist skyscrapers, the skyscrapers of the Moscow City complex, the valley of the Moscow River, Luzhniki, nearby Moscow State University.  In the park area you can walk, ride on roller skates or a bicycle, and bikers have been gathering nearby for many years. </p><h2>  Other sights of Moscow </h2><p>  In the capital of Russia there are many more places that should not be ignored.  The top 30 sights of Moscow also include: </p><ol><li>  <span>VDNH (VVC).</span>  <span>The exhibition of achievements</span> will be more interesting to those people who visited these places in Soviet times.  Otherwise, VDNH is now a rather strange entity.  In part, it is a monument of architecture and history of the Soviet period.  The main symbol of VDNH is the Friendship of Peoples fountain.  Sixteen girls of gold symbolize the Soviet republics.  In part, it is still an exhibition center, although the largest exhibitions are held more and more at the Expocenter or Crocus Expo. </li><li>  Ostankino Tower.  From VDNH to the Ostanskinskaya tower can be reached by monorail.  In the "Telecentre" are located the studio "NTV", "Channel One", "MuzTV", "TVC" and other television channels.  Outside, the building is inconspicuous, but the tower offers stunning views of the capital.  On the other side of the monorail you can see the Ostankino estate.  The palace itself is closed for reconstruction, but you can take a walk in the park. </li><li>  Triumphal gate.  The gates on Kutuzovsky Prospekt, which were erected in honor of the victory in the war of 1812, are one of the most recognizable sights of Moscow.  The fate of the monument is restless: the arch was dismantled in 1936, the reconstructed gate reappeared in 1968. </li><li>  Stalin's skyscrapers.  High-rise buildings built in the last century in the style of the "Stalinist Empire" were to symbolize the greatness of Moscow and the power of the entire USSR.  The buildings include hotels, residential areas, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Moscow State University.  In Soviet times, housing in Stalin's skyscrapers was distributed only among prominent scientists, statesmen and military figures. </li><li>  State Department Store.  One of the main attractions of Red Square has a rich history.  It all started with the opening of several shopping malls, and during the last century GUM generally became the most famous store in the USSR - all the distributors sought to get to the State Department Store to purchase scarce goods. </li><li>  Street Old Arbat.  On Promenade Boulevard, surrounded by Moscow mansions, artists come on and on, street portraits draw portraits.  Arbat has many souvenir shops, cafes and restaurants, small exhibitions. </li><li>  Garden "Hermitage".  The park was founded by a philanthropist and entrepreneur Shchukin in the late nineteenth century.  On the territory there is a track for summer concerts and three theaters.  Festivals and other cultural events are held here. </li><li>  MUSEON art park.  The vast territory on the Crimean embankment is open exhibitions, fountains and landscape gardens, modern art objects and walking paths for walking. </li><li>  Art cluster "Red October".  Designers' studios, art workshops, exhibition halls and galleries are an obligatory item in the top attractions of Moscow for those who are interested in contemporary art.  The red brick building itself is an architectural monument of the early twentieth century. </li><li>  Gorky Park.  The park zone on the waterfront has recently changed.  Various events often take place here: skateboarding competitions, vegetarian festivals, city holidays.  An ice rink is located on site. </li></ol><p>  It is simply impossible to visit all the monuments, temples and museums of the capital in one trip.  Little of.  Some positions from the top of Moscow's sights are worth visiting twice in order to get to know them as best as possible. </p>
