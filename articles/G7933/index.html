    <h2>  Smartphone niche </h2><p>  Be that as it may, namely the niche of entry-level gadgets stands out from the rest of the market for this mobile product with an increased level of competition.  In addition to eminent manufacturers, in the economy class of smartphones you can also find completely unknown manufacturers of such equipment from China.  It is to the first group of devices that the hero of this review is referred to as reviews.  Alcatel One Touch Pop Star 5022D is an entry-level phone.  Such a positioning is primarily indicated by the model of the <span>central processor, the</span> capacity of RAM and built-in storage, camera parameters and the degree of autonomy.  Also, its value leaves no doubt.  But this does not mean that this is a bad mobile device.  Quite the contrary - this is one of the best representatives of eminent manufacturers of digital technology in the segment of entry-level smartphones. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The complete set of the device.  Its advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  A list of such components and, of course, accessories is included in the boxed version of the Alcatel One Touch Pop Star 5022D: </p><ul><li><p>  The manual (and immediately in several of the most common international languages, including Russian) and the warranty card with an expanded list of service centers are a complete set of documentation for this gadget. </p></li><li><p>  A smartphone and 2 additional covers for the back panel (somewhat reminiscent of the once successful touch-sensitive Corby phone from Samsung). </p></li><li><p>  A familiar dual-use interface cord for charging a battery or synchronizing a mobile device with any computer. </p></li><li><p>  A modest stereo headset of the initial class with headphones in the form of "tablets". </p></li><li><p>  Charger with 2A output. </p></li><li><p>  Battery with a nominal capacity of 2000 mAh. </p></li></ul><p>  On the one hand, it seems like a good bundle with this device.  But she also has significant disadvantages.  One of them is the lack of a protective film on the front panel.  The second minus is the lack of a memory card in the list given earlier in the text. </p>

    <h2>  Gadget design </h2><p>  In this case, reviews indicate very interesting and unusual design decisions.  Alcatel One Touch Pop Star 5022D is a familiar all-in-one candy bar.  Its dimensions are 141 mm by 71.5 mm with a thickness of 8.6 mm.  Well, the weight of this device is 145 g. As expected, the main element of the front panel in this case is the display.  The length of its diagonal is equal to the average by today's standards - 5 ". Unusual, as for the other devices of this brand, the control panel in this case. If before it consisted entirely of touch buttons, now it is combined. It consists of 2 touch buttons with and one mechanical one. This performance is somewhat reminiscent of Samsung's proprietary smartphone design. But the mechanical button itself is round on this gadget and due to this design solution it is more reminiscent of outdated mobile devices from Appl  Therefore, in terms of the front panel design in this device, the features of two famous and most famous manufacturers of such products were intertwined. on the edge of the smart phone there are: a micro-USB port and a miniature hole for the main talk microphone. On the opposite edge of the gadget is a 3.5 mm audio port and another miniature hole for an additional  th microphone.  The main task of the latter is to remove outside noise from the conversation.  On the left side of the device‚Äôs case there is a button for locking it, and on the right - a volume control system.  On the back cover are displayed: a loud main speaker, a touch element of the main camera and its backlight based on one LED. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  A typical central processor for entry-level devices is the Alcatel One Touch Pop Star 5022D.  The characteristics of its hardware are really modest.  The composition of its semiconductor crystal includes 4 cores with the architecture of A7.  Its undeniable advantage is energy efficiency, and productivity and speed in this case are fading into the background.  Its clock frequencies in the best case can reach 1.3 GHz.  The silicon crystal of this CPU itself is produced by a process technology with norms of 28 nm.  Of course, this is not the advanced technology for the production of semiconductor chips, but due to its use it turns out to reduce the cost of the CPU.  And this, in turn, in the niche of budget devices comes to the fore.  This central processor perfectly copes with the simplest and most common tasks - reading literature, playing audio recordings or videos, surfing various Internet resources.  Even the most simple and average in terms of requirements for the hardware resources of the gadget toys in this case will definitely go.  Smartphone <span>Alcatel One Touch</span> Pop Star 5022D just can not cope with the most complex and demanding 3D games.  Its performance in this case will certainly not be enough.  Another disadvantage of this processor product is the lack of support for 64-bit computing.  Now the transition to just such software is in full swing, and it certainly will not function on this phone.  But this is not a problem of this particular device alone, but of the entire niche of budget-level devices. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Mobile device graphics processor </h2><p>  A modest graphics accelerator model is installed in the Alcatel One Touch 5022D Pop Star Slate.  In this case, we are talking about the Mali-400 MP2.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãits semiconductor crystal is 4.7 mm <sup>2</sup> , and it is manufactured according to the standards of 28 nm.  In turn, the amount of graphics memory is 128 kb.  The number of geometric data processing units in this model is 1, and the pixel processors are 4. The clock speed of this product is 400 MHz.  Of course, this solution certainly does not stand out in terms of outstanding performance compared to similar products.  But its main task is to free the processor part of the smartphone from processing graphic information, and this is precisely what this accelerator simply copes with perfectly.  To perform demanding software tasks, its capabilities will certainly not be enough.  With the rest of the applied software, this semiconductor chip will cope without any problems. </p><h2>  Gadget screen.  Its characteristics </h2><p>  Not bad from the position of technical parameters, a screen is installed in this device.  The Alcatel One Touch Pop Star 5022D is based on a display based on an IPS matrix.  Her colors are bright and saturated, the quality of the displayed image is not satisfactory.  The picture in this case is displayed in HD format, or, as it is also called, 720p.  That is, the resolution in this case is 1280x720, and the length of the diagonal is exactly 5 ‚Äù.  If we calculate the pixel density in this case, it turns out that its value is 294ppi.  This is quite enough for the image displayed on the screen to be non-grainy. </p>

    <h2>  Local storage subsystem and application installation subsystem </h2><p>  Only 1 GB of RAM is available in the Alcatel One Touch Ot 5022D Pop Star.  About 600 MB of them, after the smartphone is finished loading, will be occupied by system software.  In this case, the user can count on 400 MB.  This is quite enough to run several undemanding programs or one resource-intensive task.  The total size of the integrated drive is 8 GB.  The system software for this device is 3.5 GB.  The remaining 4.5 GB the user can already use for his needs: either store files, or install application software.  Also in this device there is a separate slot for installing an additional drive.  The size of the latter can reach an impressive 32 GB. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  A typical situation with taking photos and recording videos, as for an entry-level mobile device, is in the Alcatel Touch Pop Star 5022D.  The camera on the back has an 8 megapixel touch element.  Also at the software level, technology such as autofocus is implemented here.  Its capabilities when shooting in the dark or at an insufficient level of illumination extends the backlight based on a single LED.  The photo quality of this camera is standard, as for a gadget of this class.  Video in this case is recorded in 1080p format.  The level of its quality, as in the case of photography, is average.  There is also a second camera in the Alcatel One Touch Pop Star 5022D.  Her photos are very, very good.  She has a standard 5MP sensor for today's standards and this is quite enough for a "selfie".  Well, for video communication this is generally more than enough. </p>

    <h2>  The situation with autonomy.  Battery </h2><p>  A removable 2000 mAh battery is equipped with Alcatel One Touch Pop Star 5022D.  The battery is probably one of the weaknesses of this well-balanced entry-level product.  The maximum operating time on a single charge with this device, even in the most economical mode, will not exceed 2 days.  This is influenced by a 4-core central processor and a large screen.  In reality, this gadget will have to be charged daily, with rare exceptions.  The best solution to this problem is to buy an external additional battery.  Now such accessories can be purchased at a very modest price.  The capacity of such a battery can reach a fantastic 10,000 mAh.  This will allow the owner of such a smartphone for 5-6 days not to think about the battery level of his phone to use it to the maximum. </p><h2>  Information Transfer Methods </h2><p>  All the most popular formats of information transfer methods are supported by Alcatel One Touch Pop Star 5022. Moreover, this applies to both wired and wireless interfaces.  This list includes the following: </p><ul><li><p>  Alas, this device cannot boast of support for cellular LTE networks (or as they are sometimes called 4G).  Therefore, the owner of such a smartphone has to forget about speeds of 150 Mbit / s right away.  But there is support for 3G networks.  At the same time, depending on the network of the mobile operator, the speed can vary significantly.  In a conventional 3G network with a single carrier, the speed can reach 7.2 Mbit / s.  If the number of carriers increases to two, then the speed will increase and amount to 42 Mb / s and this will already be a 3G + network.  Well, if you have 3 carriers, you can theoretically get 63 Mbps, and it will be the same 3G + cellular network.  Also, this gadget boasts the presence of 2G-networks or, as they are sometimes called, GSM.  With such coverage, a maximum of 500 kbit / s can be expected. </p></li><li><p>  An almost complete list of existing Wi-Fi standards is in the technical specifications of this gadget.  Only the freshest ace is missing from this list.  But due to backward compatibility, this device can even function normally with such a router. </p></li><li><p>  Another main method of wireless data transfer is Bluetooth.  It is perfect for those cases when you need to connect wireless headphones to a smartphone or share small photos with a friend. </p></li><li><p>  All the main and most popular navigation systems are in this smartphone.  This is GPS, this is A-GPS.  In the first case, both the American navigation system of the same name and its domestic counterpart in the person of GLONASS are immediately supported at the software level.  It should also be noted that in the case of navigation using A-GPS, you will need an Internet connection, without which this method will not be able to function at all. </p></li><li><p>  The main wired way to transfer data is micro-USB.  It allows you to connect this gadget to any computer and use it as a flash drive, multimedia device, or even a webcam. </p></li><li><p>  But the 3.5-audio port allows you to organize the output of an audio signal from this device to any wired speaker system. </p></li></ul>

    <h2>  Software component </h2><p>  System software in Alcatel One Touch Pop Star 5022D is Android.  Its current firmware has a version of 5.1 today.  It is also unknown that there are plans in the manufacturer to release more recent modifications of system software.  Most likely, the owner of such a gadget will have to use what is at the moment and do not have to expect any updates.  The rest of the set of pre-installed software is typical.  These are programs from the developer company, and software integrated into the operating system, and mini-applications for social networks. </p><h2>  Owner reviews </h2><p>  Only one significant drawback is noted by the owners of the Alcatel One Touch Pop Star 5022D.  Overview <strong> </strong>  Most reviews on the global web highlight the low autonomy of this mobile device.  Indeed, a 2000 mAh battery capacity very, very much limits the device's capabilities from this point of view.  Solving this problem is not so difficult.  Simply enough to purchase an additional external battery with increased capacity.  But the advantages of this smartphone against a background of competing devices are many.  Their list includes the following: </p><ul><li><p>  Low cost. </p></li><li><p>  Great display and good graphics accelerator. </p></li><li><p>  Reliable and energy efficient CPU. </p></li><li><p>  A well-organized memory subsystem, as for an entry-level gadget. </p></li><li><p>  A rich set of data exchange methods that allows you to solve almost any problem in this case. </p></li></ul><h2>  Smartphone cost now </h2><p>  Very affordable price for the Alcatel One Touch Pop Star 5022D.  A review of existing applications indicates that you can purchase such a gadget now in the online store at a cost of 6000-7000 rubles.  This device is slightly more expensive in electronics supermarkets.  In this case, the price will increase and will be in the range from 8000 to 9000 rubles.  In the first case, it is possible to save on the purchase of a new mobile phone.  But at the same time there is no way to be convinced of its full working capacity live.
