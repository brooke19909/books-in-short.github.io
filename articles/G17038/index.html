If you decide to purchase a smartphone, it will be difficult to find a new model that would not have such a screen.  Despite the fact that users can hardly switch to such devices, they are being produced more and more.  Especially for those who can not imagine their life without using a conventional <span>mechanical keyboard, they</span> produce smartphones equipped with a full keyboard below the screen or made in the form of a slider. </p><p>  Many people use touch devices without thinking about what types of technologies can be used to implement them.  There are resistive and <span>capacitive touch screens.</span>  These two types are the most popular and accurate.  Next, we will talk about the second form. </p><p>  <strong>Capacitive screen</strong> </p><p>  This type of display is based on the ability of the human body to conduct electric current.  Usually, the basis of such a screen is a glass substrate coated with a special material, and from above it is covered with a conductive film.  When a finger touches the screen, an electric current occurs, after which a special controller calculates the touch coordinates.  The capacitive screen is practically not inferior to the resistive in the accuracy of determining the coordinates, however, it transmits light much better.  Such displays have an order of magnitude higher durability, since they can withstand the number of clicks up to two hundred million.  Such screens are noticeably less exposed to the environment. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The capacitive screen also has drawbacks. Its operation is possible only if a conductive object is used.  If you decide to use a stylus or other object, then it just does not respond to your touch.  This problem is very pronounced in winter, when on a frosty day there is no possibility or desire to remove gloves when answering a call.  But some users also found an original way out of this situation.  They use clicking with their nose, not with their finger.  Sometimes it‚Äôs possible to control such a screen and fingers with gloves, but it depends on the material of the glove and the quality of the display itself.  Another disadvantage that a capacitive <span>touch screen has</span> is its high susceptibility to the degree of surface contamination.  In this case, the accuracy of clicks and sensitivity can be greatly reduced.  It can be noted that styluses with an <span>electric capacity</span> are already on sale <span>,</span> however, they have not received mass distribution because of the high cost - about $ 50.  Such models are available, for example, from HTC. </p><p>  We can also say that the cost of smartphones with a capacitive touch screen continues to decline, which allows you to choose a modern and functional model with this type of display.  We can distinguish such models as <span>Samsung Wave 525, Samsung</span> GT-S5620 Monte and some others in this segment. </p><p>  If you are interested in a more advanced model of a capacitive screen, then you should pay attention to the projection-capacitive screen, which supports the popular multi-touch technology.  This device is a bit more complicated, but it works based on the same principles as the previously created models.  Such screens are able to simultaneously track multiple clicks, which is used in gaming applications and mobile browsers.  The cost of screens using this technology is still high, so they are usually used on smartphones whose price exceeds $ 300.  The most famous models are Nokia N8, <span>HTC Desire S.</span> The disadvantages of this technology are similar to those described above for conventional capacitive screens. </p>
