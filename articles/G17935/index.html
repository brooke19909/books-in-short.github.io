    <p>  Nikita Khrushchev went down in the history of the USSR and Russia as the most ambiguous ruler, who influenced the development of new directions in the foreign and domestic policy of the USSR and carried out several reforms over the decade of his reign. </p><p>  Khrushchev's domestic policy </p><p>  The death of Stalin in 1953 entailed a behind-the-scenes struggle for a place on the "throne", but the post of first secretary of the <span>CPSU Central Committee</span> went to Khrushchev.  At the XXth Congress (1956), he delivered a report that received worldwide resonance.  The main theme was the exposure <span>of the</span> Stalin <span>personality cult</span> listing a number of crimes of the 30s ‚Äì 50s.  and harsh criticism of his repression.  The beginning of de-Stalinization and democratization. </p><p>  Khrushchev reforms </p><p>  De-Stalinization, however, had neither consistency nor integrity.  According to Khrushchev, it consisted in condemning the cult of Stalin and establishing party control over punitive bodies.  There was a restoration of the rule of law, the rule of law and the constitutional rights of citizens. </p><p>  Khrushchev's reforms were continued - the restructuring of the ruling party was carried out: democratization, changes in the conditions for admission to it, expansion of the rights of local organizations and union republics.  In 1957, the peoples deported by Stalin were restored in their rights.  New bodies of public self-government appear, etc. </p><p>  Management reform </p><p>  An attempt to switch to economic management methods has led to a more complicated management structure and an increase in the number of officials.  In 1962, the most unsuccessful reform was undertaken: the specialization of party organizations (industrial and rural).  The country was divided into 105 economic regions. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Agrarian reform </p><p>  Khrushchev's reforms began with agriculture.  Since 1953, the economic situation of collective farms has been strengthened, and the size of the agricultural tax has been reduced.  The farms were granted loans, new equipment was received.  In the mid-50s, their general enlargement began - conversion to state farms.  Then were created and economic councils. </p><p>  Peasants were given passports, they were assigned a pension. </p><p>  Corn saga has also become part of Khrushchev's image - following the example of the United States, this culture has been intensively planted everywhere, even where it cannot grow in principle (up to the Far North!). </p><p>  In 1954, a campaign began to develop <span>virgin lands.</span>  A sharp jump followed with unprecedented harvests, for the first time in the post-war years, the purchase price of grain rose.  But erosion destroyed the virgin soil.  Non-chernozem center fell into complete decline. </p><p>  Khrushchev's military reforms </p><p>  After coming to power, he took the direction of the rise of the defense and heavy industry.  The SA and the fleet received nuclear missile weapons.  By the ratio of the military power of the USSR, it reaches parity with the United States.  The article considers the direction <span>of policy development</span> towards the peaceful coexistence of states of different social systems. </p><p>  Social reform </p><p>  After the adoption of the law on the payment of pensions to peasants, it was decided to cancel the payment of tuition in <span>high school,</span> eight-year education becomes mandatory.  The <span>norms of working time are established,</span> in particular - a 6-hour working day for adolescents of 16 years. </p><p>  The housing stock is actively expanding.  Housing is based on industrial methods.  The country's housing stock is increasing by 40% per seven-year period!  True, the construction was carried out in a style that went down in history under the name of ‚ÄúKhrushchob‚Äù, but the housing crisis disappeared. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  School reform led to a single eight-year school.  Those wishing to receive full secondary education needed to continue their education at the secondary polytechnical school (in vocational schools, in evening or correspondence schools). </p><p>  Foreign policy of Khrushchev </p><p>  Foreign relations in those days developed in the style of politics traditional for the Bolsheviks.  The main focus of foreign policy was the strengthening of security systems across all borders. </p><p>  Contacts with foreign countries are actively resuming, and positive reviews about other countries appear in the press.  Trade relations are expanding.  This brings mutual benefits, because Western countries receive a vast <span>market</span> for their products. </p><p>  The launch of the first satellite in 1957 had a significant effect on the world situation; a new, space era begins.  Khrushchev, a supporter of the Queen, supports his idea of ‚Äã‚Äãovertaking the Americans in space exploration. </p><p>  This changed the alignment of priorities, now the West was under the gun of the USSR intercontinental missiles. </p><p>  In 1961  The ‚ÄúBerlin ultimatum‚Äù was staged, in which Khrushchev demanded the construction of a wall between western and eastern Berlin.  A huge resonance of the world community.  After the ‚ÄúBerlin crisis‚Äù another flares up, the so-called  "Caribbean," or "missile crisis."  Kennedy tried to capture Cuba, which the USSR provided economic, and now also military assistance, sending there military and technical advisers, various types of weapons.  Including missiles, which threatened the United States with a strike.  Kennedy demanded to prevent the unloading of missiles in Cuba, and Khrushchev accepted these requirements. </p><p>  Kennedy‚Äôs assassination led to the need to establish contact with President Johnson.  But charges against voluntarism were brought against Khrushchev, and he was dismissed.  Ruined him and an attempt to cut the benefits and privileges of civil servants.  Under Khrushchev, an authoritarian system developed in the USSR, however, the foundations of the command and administrative system were strengthened. </p>
