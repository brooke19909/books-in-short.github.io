In order to reduce their own expenses, a number of borrowers are looking for bank programs in which the lowest interest on the loan can be offered. </p><p>  Any customer request is considered by the bank individually.  In this case, the creditor evaluates everything: a person’s age, labor activity, marital status, income, the presence of a vehicle or property in his property, existing debts, etc.  All this is called scoring. </p><p>  We will figure out which bank has the smallest interest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="which bank has the smallest interest" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59178/2136022.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What does credit interest depend on? </h2><p>  The loan interest is determined by the influence of many conditions, for the most part it depends on the amount requested by the client and the time of return, on the availability of a guarantor or collateral.  If the latter are available, then the rate will decrease, and the first two points will directly increase it. </p><p>  How to choose a bank with the most favorable interest rates?  First you need to understand exactly what amount is required and for what time period.  If a client needs a small loan, from one hundred to one hundred and fifty thousand rubles, then almost every bank can issue it without problems.  It will only be necessary to confirm your income using a certificate in the form of 2-personal income tax. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Which bank gives the smallest percentage is interesting to many. </p><h2>  Additional documents </h2><p>  If the amount in the region of five hundred thousand rubles is required, then the client will need a copy of his work book and a number of additional documentation: it can be SNILS, passport, TIN, PTS, etc. </p><p>  When a person expects a large loan of five hundred thousand rubles or more, he must provide the bank with collateral in the form of a pledge of a car or real estate or by attracting a guarantor.  If such conditions are not met, then the organization will immediately refuse the client. </p><p>  It is important to find out in advance which bank has the smallest interest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the smallest percentage of the loan in which bank" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3663/2145949.jpg"></div>

    <p>  - salary or other card of the bank where the loan is issued; </p><p>  - the presence of a good credit history; </p><p>  - income statement with the receipt of large amounts over time. </p><p>  Banking sites are constantly updating information, including also interest on the loan.  If today they are low, then tomorrow they can grow, so you need to keep an eye on the relevance of the information on the websites of banks of interest to the client. </p><p>  Not everyone knows which bank has the lowest mortgage interest. </p><h2>  Refinancing </h2><p>  Recently, many borrowers have become interested in the issue of refinancing loans.  This is due to the fact that either the loan was taken on not the most favorable conditions, or the borrower has now changed the financial situation.  In this case, it is possible to refinance a loan. </p><p>  Here are five of the <span>best banks</span> where you can refinance: </p><ol><li>  <em>VTB Bank of Moscow.</em>  It is a state bank, and therefore has very favorable credit rates.  In addition, it offers the best conditions and small percentages not only to representatives of the public sector, but also to clients of other organizations that work in various fields.  Which bank has the lowest percentage of refinancing, they ask quite often. </li><li>  Some of the best conditions for refinancing are noted in <em>Alfa-Bank</em> .  This credit institution is accelerating development, and it seeks to get more customers, and therefore offers good conditions for refinancing.  It is worth noting that the minimum rate here starts at 11.99 percent per annum. </li><li>  A favorable loan program for Muscovites is available at <em>Interprombank</em> .  Moscow residents from eighteen to seventy-five years of age can leave a request.  Thus, the program extends, including to pensioners. </li><li>  <em>Tinkoff</em> Bank currently has a unique program, which is not found in any other Russian bank.  Its essence lies in the fact that when you draw up a card here and approve the required limit, you can completely repay the debt in another organization with a given amount (microloan, credit or credit card).  The undoubted advantage is that interest on the repayment of debt to another bank will not be accrued for four months. </li><li>  <em>SKB Bank</em> provides refinancing for all clients with a positive credit history, including also pensioners.  The advantage lies in the possibility of attracting a co-borrower, due to which the lending limit is increased. </li></ol><p>  We found out which bank has the smallest interest. </p>
