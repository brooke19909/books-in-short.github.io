His followers exist to this day.  The Order was named after its founder, St. Francis.  Franciscans played a huge role in world history, especially in the <span>Middle Ages.</span> </p><h2>  The goals of creating monastic orders </h2><p>  The emergence of religious orders was due to the need for the appearance of priests who would not be affected by secular affairs and were able to show the purity of faith by their own example.  The church needed dogmas to fight heresy in all its manifestations.  At first, the orders corresponded to their tasks, but gradually, over the years, everything began to change.  But first things first. </p><h2>  Background of the order </h2><p>  St. Francis of Assisi is the patron saint of Italy.  In the world, he was called Giovanni Bernardone.  St. Francis of Assisi is the founder of the Order of the Franciscans.  Giovanni Bernardone was born approximately from 1181 to 1182.  A more accurate date of its birth is unknown.  Initially, Francis was a womanizer, but after a series of events in his life he changed a lot. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Order of the Franciscans" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1637995.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  He became very pious, helped the poor, looked after the sick in a leper colony, was content with bad clothes, giving good things to those in need.  Gradually, a circle of followers gathered around Francis.  Between 1207 and 1208  Giovanni Bernardone founded the fraternity of the minority.  On its basis, the order of the Franciscans later arose. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Order Creation </h2><p>  The Brotherhood of Minority existed until 1209. The organization was new to the church.  Minorites tried to imitate Christ and the apostles, to reproduce their life.  The Charter of the fraternity was written.  In April 1209, it received verbal approval from Pope St. Innocent III, who welcomed the activities of the community.  As a result, the official founding of the Franciscan order was finally fixed.  Since that time, the ranks of minority groups began to replenish with women for whom a second brotherhood was established. </p><p>  The Third Order of the Franciscans was founded in 1212. <strong> </strong>  It was called the "brotherhood of the tertiary."  Its members had to observe the ascetic charter, but at the same time they could live among ordinary people and even have a family.  The monastic robe was worn by the tertiary at will. </p><p>  A written statement of the existence of the order took place in 1223 by Pope Honorius the Third.  At the time of the approval of the fraternity by St. <span>Innocent III,</span> only twelve people stood before him.  When St. died  Francis, the community totaled nearly 10 thousand followers.  Every year they became more and more. </p><h2>  Charter of the Order of St.  Francis </h2><p>  The charter of the Franciscan Order, approved in 1223, was divided into seven chapters.  The first called for gospel observance, obedience, and cleanliness.  The second explained the conditions that must be fulfilled by those wishing to join the order.  To do this, the new novices were obliged to sell property and distribute everything to the poor.  After this year, walk in a cassock, belted with a rope.  Subsequent clothing was allowed to be worn only old and simple.  Shoes were worn only when necessary. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Order of the Franciscans and Dominicans" class="if" height="288" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1637920.jpg" width="600"></div>

Before morning, the Franciscans read Our Father 24 times, after a few hours - 5. One out of four hours a day - 7 more times, in the evening - 12, at night - 7. The first fast was observed from the celebration of All Saints Day until Christmas .  Mandatory was a 40-day post and many others.  According to the Charter, condemnation, quarrels and verbal fights were prohibited.  Franciscans had to cultivate humility, humility, peacefulness, modesty and other positive qualities that do not detract from the dignity and rights of others. </p><p>  The fourth chapter dealt with money.  Members of the order were forbidden to take coins for themselves or others.  The fifth chapter talked about work.  All healthy members of the fraternity could work, but subject to the number of prayers read and the time that was clearly scheduled for this.  Instead of money, members of the order could take for work only what was necessary for their own or fraternal needs.  Moreover, she undertook to accept what she earned humbly and gratefully, even in the smallest quantities. </p><p>  The sixth chapter read about the prohibition of theft and the rules for collecting alms.  The members of the order were supposed to accept alms without embarrassment and shame, to help other members of the fraternity, especially the sick and weak. </p><p>  The seventh chapter spoke about the punishments that were applied to those who sinned.  For this relied penance. </p><p>  The eighth chapter described the dominant brothers who needed to be addressed in resolving serious issues.  Also obey the ministers of the order implicitly.  The succession procedure was described after the death of a senior brother or his re-election for serious reasons. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The ninth chapter described the prohibition of preaching in the diocese of a bishop (without his permission).  It was forbidden to do this without a preliminary exam, which surrendered in the order.  The sermons of the members of the fraternity were to be simple, understandable and thoughtful.  Phrases - short, but filled with deep content about vices and virtues, about fame and punishment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the mendicant order of the Franciscans" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1637996.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The tenth chapter explained how to correct and exhort brothers who violated the Charter.  Applying to higher monks should be at the slightest hesitation in faith, unclean conscience, etc. The brothers were urged to protect themselves from pride, vanity, envy, etc. Members of the order could not be taught to read and write, and the duty to meditate and to love enemies and pray for those who offend. </p><p>  A separate chapter (eleventh) was about visiting convents.  This was prohibited without special permission.  Franciscans did not have the right to be godfathers.  The last, twelfth chapter said about the permission that the brothers of the order had to get in order to try to convert the Saracens and infidels to the Christian faith. </p><p>  At the end of the Charter, it was separately noted that it is prohibited to cancel or change the established rules. </p><h2>  Franciscan Clothing </h2><p>  The clothing of the Franciscans also began with St.  Francis  According to legend, he deliberately exchanged with a poor robe.  Francis took his plain dress and, abandoning his sash, girded with a simple rope.  Since then, each monk of the Franciscan order began to dress in the same way. </p><h2>  Franciscan Names </h2><p>  In England they were called "gray brothers", by the color of the dresses.  In France, the members of the order had the name "cordeliers" because of the encircling simple rope.  In Germany, the Franciscans were called ‚Äúbarefoot‚Äù thanks to sandals worn on their bare legs.  In Italy, the followers of Francis were called "brothers." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="founder of the Order of the Franciscans" class="if" height="373" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1637915.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  The development of the Order of the Franciscans </h2><p>  The order of the Franciscans, the photo of the representatives of which is in this article, after the death of the founder, was first headed by John Parenti, then General Elijah of Corton, a student of St.  Francis  His connections and intimacy with the teacher during his life helped strengthen the position of the brotherhood.  Elijah created a clear management system, the division of the order into provinces.  Franciscan schools were opened, the construction of temples and monasteries was launched. </p><p>  The construction of the majestic Gothic basilica in Assisi, in honor of St.  Francis  Elijah's authority was strengthened every year.  Construction and other projects required large sums of money.  As a result, provincial contributions were increased.  Their resistance began.  This led to the fact that Elijah was removed from the leadership of the fraternity in 1239. </p><p>  Gradually, the order of the Franciscans instead of the wandering became more hierarchical, settled.  It still disgusted St.  Francis, and he not only refused the head of the fraternity, but also in 1220 completely abandoned the leadership of the community.  But since St.  Francis made a vow of obedience, then he did not resist the changes in the order.  St. Francis finally departed from the leadership of the fraternity after a trip to the East. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="characteristic of the order of the Franciscans" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1637997.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Transformation of the order into a monastic structure </h2><p>  During the reign of Corton, the mendicant order of the Franciscans began to differentiate into two main movements, in which the covenants of St.  Francis and his attitude towards compliance with the Charter and poverty were understood differently.  Some members of the fraternity tried to follow the rules of the founder of the order, living in poverty and humility.  Others began to interpret the Charter in their own way. </p><p>  In 1517, Pope Leo the Tenth officially designated two different groups in the Franciscan order.  Both directions have become independent.  The first group was called observants, that is, the Minorite brothers, who strictly observed all the rules of St.  Francis  The second group became known as the Conventuals.  They interpreted the Order of the Order in a slightly different way.  In 1525, a new branch was formed from the brotherhood of the Franciscans - the Capuchins.  They became a reformist trend among minority observants.  In 1528, by Clement the Fifth, the new branch was recognized as a separate fraternity.  At the end of the XIX century.  all groups of observers were combined into one, which became known as the Order of the Lesser Brothers.  Pope Leo the Eighth gave the name to this fraternity the ‚ÄúUnion of Leonians‚Äù. </p><p>  The church used the sermons of st.  Francis for his own purposes.  As a result, the brotherhood was supported by different segments of the population.  It turned out that the order was sent in the right direction of the church.  As a result, the organization that was initially founded turned into a monastic order.  Franciscans <strong> </strong>  received the right of the Inquisition over heretics.  In the political field, they began to fight the opponents of the popes. </p><h2>  Dominicans and Franciscans: Education </h2><p>  The orders of the Franciscans and Dominicans were beggars.  The brotherhoods were founded almost simultaneously.  But their goals were slightly different.  The main task of the <span>Dominican Order</span> was a deep study of theology.  The goal is to train competent preachers.  The second task is the fight against heresy, the bringing to the world of Divine truth. </p><p>  In 1256, Franciscans were granted the right to teach at universities.  As a result, the order created a whole system of theological education.  This gave rise to many thinkers during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.  During the New Age, missionary and research activities intensified.  Many Franciscans began to work in the possessions of the Spaniards and in the East. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the order of the Franciscans in our time" class="if" height="319" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1637916.jpg" width="479"></div>

    <p>  One of the areas of Franciscan philosophy was associated with the natural and exact sciences.  And even more so than with theology and mataphysics.  A new direction was presented at the University of Oxford.  The first professor from the Franciscans was Robert Grossetest.  He subsequently became bishop. </p><p>  Robert Grossetest was an outstanding scientist of that time.  He became one of the first who drew attention to the need for mathematics during the study of nature.  The most famous professor brought the concept of creating a world of light. </p><h2>  Franciscan Order in the 18th-19th Centuries </h2><p>  In the eighteenth century, the Franciscan order had approximately 1,700 monasteries and almost twenty-five thousand monks.  The brotherhood (and similar ones) was liquidated in many European countries during the Great and Bourgeois revolutions of the nineteenth century.  Towards its end, the order was restored in Spain, and then in Italy.  France followed their example, and then other countries. </p><h2>  Characterization of the Order of the Franciscans until 1220 </h2><p>  The Order followed all the rules of the Charter until 1220. During this period, the followers of Francis, dressed in brown woolen tunics and dressed in simple ropes, wandered around the world in sandals on their bare feet. </p><p>  The fraternity tried not only to spread Christian ideals, but also to observe them and put them into practice.  Preaching poverty, the Franciscans themselves ate the stalest bread, speaking of humility, dutifully listened to swearing, etc. The followers of the order themselves set a vivid example of keeping vows, were fanatically devoted to the Christian faith. </p><h2>  Franciscans in modern times </h2><p>  The Franciscan Order nowadays exists in many Russian and European cities.  Engaged in pastoral, publishing and charitable activities.  Franciscans teach in schools, go to prisons and nursing homes. </p><p>  In our time, priests and brothers of the order also have a special program of monastic training.  First, candidates undergo spiritual and scientific training.  It consists of several stages: </p><ol><li>  The first step is the Postulate.  This is one test year, during which there is a general acquaintance with the order.  For this, the candidates live in a monastic community. </li><li>  The second step is Novitiate.  This is the period of one year when the candidate is introduced into monastic life.  Preparations are being made for temporary vows. </li><li>  The third stage lasts six years.  During this period, candidates receive higher education in the field of philosophy and theology.  There is also daily spiritual preparation.  In the fifth year of study, eternal vows are made, in the sixth year, ordination. </li></ol><h2>  Branches of the Order in Modern Time </h2><p>  Initially, there was only the first Franciscan order, which included exclusively men.  <span>This fraternity</span> is now divided into three main branches: </p><ol><li>  Smaller brothers (in 2010 there were almost 15,000 monks). </li><li>  Conventional (4,231 monks of the Order of the Franciscans). </li><li>  Capuchins (the number of people in this branch is almost 11 thousand). </li></ol><h2>  Opinion on the activities of the Order of the Franciscans </h2><p>  The Franciscan Order has been around for eight centuries.  Over this rather long period, the brotherhood has made a huge contribution not only to church development, but also to world culture.  The contemplative side of the order goes well with vigorous activity.  The order, along with branches, has nearly 30,000 monks and thousands of lay tertiary people who live in Germany, Italy, the USA and many other countries. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="foundation of the order of the Franciscans" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1637918.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Franciscan monks from the very beginning sought asceticism.  During the existence of the order, they survived the separation and foundation of individual communities.  Many had stricter rules.  In the 19th century, the opposite trend occurred.  Disparate communities began to unite.  Pope Leo the Third contributed to this a lot.  It was he who united all the groups into one - the Order of the Lesser Brothers. </p>
