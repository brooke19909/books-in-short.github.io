Such a tempting bonus for many travelers is a decisive criterion for choosing where to stay on the Costa Dorada.

Only the most necessary pieces of furniture and electrical appliances are installed in the rooms.  But there are several rooms with a children's theme.  Their walls are decorated with cartoon illustrations.  These rooms have solid wooden beds, children's tables and highchairs.  Balconies are not available in every room, which must be specified when booking.  The view from the windows only on the territory and the garden. </p><p>  The category of all rooms is one - the standard, but there are some differences in their functionality.  One of them concerns capacity.  So, there are rooms designed to accommodate 2, 3 or 4 tourists.  They differ in size and a set of bedroom furniture.  There are also rooms called Woody &amp; Friends.  They include slippers and bathrobes, and certificates are issued for free access to the spa at the Caribe Port Aventura Hotel, 200 meters away. </p><p>  The equipment of all rooms includes a set of furniture, a refrigerator, an LCD TV (there are channels in Russian), air conditioning, a safe (for an additional fee), a hairdryer, and a telephone. </p><p>  The hygiene rooms have a bath with shower, sink with countertop, toilet.

The central port called Regatta serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Type of serving - "buffet".  Three other restaurants have the same serving format. </p><p>  Tours can be bought with the BB system (room and breakfast) and HB (room, breakfast and dinner).  Tourists in the reviews note that it is preferable to buy vouchers with meals "NV", and you can dine right in the amusement park, where restaurants and cafes work.  They are decorated thematically (according to the zone in which they are located). </p><p>  If in the process of rest it became necessary to buy dinner at the hotel, you will have to pay 24 euros a day (1750 rubles) per adult and 12 euros (875 rubles) per child. </p><p>  The opinions of tourists are different regarding the quality of food.  One liked everything, the other assortment seemed monotonous. </p><p>  However, all tourists are unanimous about the fact that the time is set for visiting the restaurant at the hotel, as indicated in the certificate.  It is issued at the front desk upon check-in.  This is not very convenient for those who came to rest in a large company, as they can be issued certificates for different times.  Also, certificates do not like those who do not want to come for breakfast on schedule. </p><p>  For many tourists, the rule of the hotel, according to which all drinks (including water) must be bought separately, is causing complaints, since only food is provided during meals. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.zoover.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel restaurant" class="if uuid-2575288" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/2575288.jpg"></div><h2>  Leisure </h2><p>  Despite the location in the amusement park, leisure activities at the Port Aventura Hotel are organized at a high level.  Adult guests are offered two outdoor pools with sunbeds and umbrellas installed around them.  A beach towel can be taken for a deposit of 15 euros (1092 rubles).  Everyone can visit the spa, where there is a heated pool, hot tub, fitness center, massage rooms, beauty salon, sauna, Turkish bath. </p><p>  For children, services are not very many.  There is no pool for small guests, but a playground has been built on the territory.  There is also a games room.  Parents can book a crib in the room.  For children and adults, the hotel hosts animation activities.  In the evening, a mini-disco is organized for kids, and a variety of shows for adults.  There are no special entertainment programs during the day, as the bulk of tourists are at that time in the park. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  In different sources you can read information that from the Hotel Port Aventura to the beach is 700 or 500 meters.
