Photos and reviews of tourists will complement our description.  Immediately it should be said that in the Vietnamese city of Nha Trang there are two hotels called "Golden Rain".  And both of them have three stars.  Their management was previously one, then the second hotel went to the owner‚Äôs son, and now he completely changed the owner ... </p><p>  So, when planning a trip to Nha Trang, you must immediately choose which hotel you prefer: Golden Rain 3 * or Golden Rain-2 3 *, since it is already impossible to change buildings when buying a tour.  In this article we will pay attention to this second hotel.  Moreover, many tourists managed to live in both and have the opportunity to compare. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Golden Rain - 3 * (Nha Trang, Vietnam). Description" class="if uuid-3268411" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3268411.jpg"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The hotelier tried to collect all the categories of vacationers.  For example, Golden Rain 3 * (Nha Trang, Vietnam) in the reviews, tourists call a country hotel.  It is located on the second line from the sea in the so-called resort area.  It can be found next to hotels such as Liberty, Vien Dong, and Si Legends.  To the beach from the hotel to go exactly three minutes (100 meters).  But if you want to find yourself in the center of Nha Trang, you have to take a bus ride, since Golden Rain 3 * (Vietnam, Nha Trang) is ten kilometers from the center. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  His namesake under the heading "2" is also located in the <span>European quarter of Nha Trang.</span>  The distance between the two hotels is only 150-200 meters.  The entire tourist infrastructure of the European quarter is within walking distance.  Near both hotels there are many cafes and eateries.  There is also no shortage of massage parlors, discos, supermarkets. </p><p>  Of the attractions of Nha Trang, the closest to both hotels is the Long Son Pagoda.  As for the minuses of the location of the Golden Rain 3 * hotel, this is a disco bar adjacent directly to the building.  In 2018, construction was carried out near the hotel.  The sea is visible only from the upper floors, because it is closed by hotels on the first line. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="12.2328501" data-lng="109.19538769999997" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/8/6/0/6/18606.png"></div><h2>  Golden Rain 3 * (Vietnam, Nha Trang): description of the hotel </h2><p>  The hotel was built in 2011.  It is a 12-story building.  Only the upper floors are equipped with balconies.  There is only one elevator in the narrow building, which can be inconvenient in the morning when guests leave for breakfast.  Externally, the building looks discreet.  In the basement there is a garage, and on the top floor there is a pool and a gym.  The reception, as well as the restaurant, are located in the basement.  The hotel has no surrounding area, as such.  It‚Äôs just a house on a city street. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The same situation is observed in Golden Rain - 2 3 * (Nha Trang, Vietnam).  The only difference is that this hotel is newer, built from modern materials and with an original design.  Its building consists of 18 floors.  In addition, the son‚Äôs legacy (which he already sold) is larger.  The building of "Golden Rain - 2" is not only higher, but also wider.  This means that it has two elevators, which, of course, is more convenient than one.  And all the rooms there have balconies. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.viamichelin.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Golden Rain -2 3 * (Vietnam, Nha Trang)" class="if uuid-3268423" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3268423.jpg"></div><h2>  Description of rooms </h2><p>  Tourists traveling as a couple, threesomes or a family of 4 can find the right accommodation at this hotel.  The room fund Golden Rain 3 * (Vietnam, Nha Trang) consists of rooms: </p><ul><li>  deluxe </li><li>  superior </li><li>  suite. </li></ul><p>  There are cheap rooms (with a balcony) on the upper floors, but they must be booked in advance.  All "deluxe" are at the lower levels and have only windows, which, according to reviews, makes it difficult to dry beach suits.  For the orientation of the windows towards the sea you need to pay extra.  However, this is not necessary if your rooms are located on floors 3-8, since it is still not visible due to the building opposite.  Some superiors and all suites have balconies.  The rooms also differ in area: 22, 24, 26 and 32 square meters.  Guest room equipment includes: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  - LCD TV (there are Russian-language channels), </li><li>  - a minibar where daily maids put 2 bottles of drinking water, </li><li>  - free safe </li><li>  - an electric kettle and replenished bags of coffee / tea / sugar, </li><li>  - air conditioning with individual remote control, </li><li>  - hair dryer. </li></ul><p>  The decor of the ‚Äúsuites‚Äù is complemented by slippers and an ironing board.  All rooms have free Wi-Fi.  The bathroom has a shower and replenished cosmetics in the dispensers.  Cleaning is done every day.  Towels are changed in a day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.goldenrain2hotel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Golden Rain -3 * - rooms" class="if uuid-3268425" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3268425.jpg"></div><h2>  Room Reviews </h2><p>  Those tourists who happened to be in both hotels praise more comfortable rooms in Golden Rain - 2 3 * (Nha Trang, Vietnam).  In the reviews, vacationers claim that there is new and beautiful furniture made of natural wood.  And the situation in the first Golden Rain is clearly in need of repair.  Some tourists complained that something was constantly breaking in their room: either a watering can in the shower or an electric kettle.  In the end, the servants repaired it, but the serenity of rest was broken.  Construction and a disco bar - these were two headaches of guests living in rooms oriented to the city. </p><p>  Sound insulation in Golden Rain - 2 is not an example better.  Of the advantages of the rooms, tourists note their spaciousness.  But on the quality of cleaning expressed repeated unsatisfactory responses.  Also, tourists were saddened by the old age and shabby towels.  Some of them were with holes and gray.  Tourists would recommend the hotelier to renovate the rooms and improve the decor of the rooms. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  When purchasing tours to Golden Rain 3 * (Vietnam, Nha Trang) for 15 days for 105 140 rubles from Moscow, rest assured that breakfast is included in this price.  They begin to feed them from the second day after arrival.  If you leave early, you are supposed to have a lunch box, which you need to order the day before.  The same breakfast can be obtained if you go on a morning excursion.  But it also needs to be ordered in advance.  Breakfast is served in the restaurant in buffet style.  Several types of soups are always brought out - the famous fo, pumpkin and 2-3 more varieties. </p><p>  There are dishes from the pan - scrambled eggs, scrambled eggs, pancakes.  For kids and people on a diet, cereals are prepared.  There was always meat and fish.  What tourists remembered was natural juices and a large selection of fruits.  Mangoes were given every day.  Also give a lot of vegetables and salads.  At other times of the day, tourists ate in cafes, which are full in the European Quarter.  For those who are nostalgic for their homeland, the Moscow restaurant is open.  You can have a drink and a snack in the hotel bar (in the lounge). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hotelesbaratos.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Golden Rain -3 * - restaurant" class="if uuid-3268424" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3268424.jpg"></div><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  Tourists liked the rich selection of dishes in Golden Rain 3 * (Vietnam, Nha Trang).  Everything is made from fresh quality products.  There has not been a single recall mentioning food poisoning.  Once a week they give seafood with delicious sauces.  Coffee, though from a machine, is natural, cereal, not instant.  Tourists with children claim that they had something to feed the kids.  Everyone liked the breakfast soups.  Enough time is allocated for meals so that both the ‚Äúlarks‚Äù and the ‚Äúowls‚Äù manage to eat. </p><p>  Of the minuses, tourists note the slowness of the staff.  Waiters are in no hurry to replace empty trays with new ones.  And if you compare both of the "Golden Rain", then the quality of food is still higher in the second.  There is a wider range of dishes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.goldenrain2hotel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Golden Rain -3 *: nutrition reviews" class="if uuid-3268429" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3268429.jpg"></div><h2>  Sea and beach </h2><p>  In this regard, both hotels are equal.  They are on the second lane from the sea, and guests will have to walk a maximum of three minutes to the beach.  The coast does not belong to the hotels, so the entire infrastructure of the rest here is paid.  The beach near the hotels is sandy, with a gentle entry into the sea.  It is equipped (rescuers are on duty, there is a shower room, toilet and a first-aid post). </p><p>  On this coast, low tides are weak.  If you do not have your own beach towel, with a deposit of 10 US dollars (750 rubles) you will be given it at the reception.  The entertainment infrastructure on the water is well developed.  You can ride scooters, bananas, and even parachutes.  For more sophisticated entertainment, head to Winpearl. </p><div class="photo" data-original="exclusives.webjet.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Golden Rain -3 * (Vietnam, Nha Trang) - tours" class="if uuid-3268434" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3268434.jpg"></div><h2>  Pool and gym </h2><p>  The last floors of the Golden Rain 3 * buildings (Vietnam, Nha Trang) and its namesake "Golden Rain - 2" are equipped with a solarium.  Those tourists who have visited both hotels praise the outdoor pool on the 18th floor of Golden Rain 2.  It is larger in area, very clean.  Sunbeds around him with mattresses, comfortable.  From the 18th floor offers a truly panoramic view. </p><p>  What kind of reviews do tourists leave about the pool at the first hotel?  Mostly negative.  They say that it looks more like a tub of chlorinated water, where an adult has waist-high water.  Sunbeds around this tank are broken.  It is better not to approach the railing enclosing the pool on the 12th floor for personal safety. </p><p>  There is also a gym on this site.  Tourists call it "a dirty back room where they put the broken sports equipment."  In the reviews, guests recommend that the administration remove the gym and expand the pool area due to the free space. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Golden Rain - 2 3 * (Nha Trang, Vietnam), reviews" class="if uuid-3268399" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3268399.jpg"></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Golden Rain Hotel 3 * (Vietnam, Nha Trang) has a garage - free for guests.  The elevator descends to the basement level, which is convenient for motorists.  At the reception you can change the currency, use photocopy and fax.  The hotel has a sauna, but rarely has anyone used it.  All tourists from the Russian Federation joyfully noted that the staff, like the owner of the hotel, speaks Russian well.  The employees will help you not only call a taxi, but also explain to the driver where you want to go and bargain about the price. </p><p>  There is also luggage storage at the reception.  Wireless internet is available throughout the hotel.  You can rent a bike, although driving along Nha Trang with its Brownian traffic on the roads is a dubious pleasure.  But you can ride along the promenade.  The hotel provides beach towels on deposit.  There is an inexpensive laundry service.  If something goes wrong in your room, the wizard will fix it quickly. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  So that music from the disco bar does not bother you, you need to relax very actively.  And many guests did just that, traveling around the vicinity of Nha Trang (Vietnam).  Golden Rain Hotel 3 * is located in the European Quarter, from it you can see the main attraction of the city - Vinpearl Island.  Even if you have planned a passive vacation on the beach, you should go there at least once.  At the reception you will be helped with the organization of a transfer (by ferry or cable car).  On the streets near the hotel there are many travel agencies where tours are even cheaper. </p><p>  Do not be afraid to go on a long excursion to the mountain resort of Dalat.  Most tourists were satisfied with this trip.  Breakfast (lunch box) with an early departure for the tour can be ordered the day before at the reception.  Near the hotel there is a bus stop with which you can visit all the attractions in the city. </p><h2>  Golden Rain 3 * (Nha Trang, Vietnam): reviews </h2><p>  Those tourists who were not in the "Golden Rain-2", were satisfied with the rest.  But you need not stint and book a room with a view of the sea and on the upper floors.  Then you will not be disturbed by either the construction site or the music from the disco bar.  Old furniture and careless cleaning are fully compensated by the cordial attitude of the staff towards you.  In this hotel, 90% of vacationers are Russian. </p><p>  Whether this is good or bad is up to you.  But no one experienced a language barrier here.  Especially a lot of meritorious reviews about nutrition.  Breakfast here is sumptuous, hearty, with a large selection of hot dishes, fruits and vegetables.  But the conditions for small guests are limited only to the children's menu and high chairs in the restaurant. </p><p>  But a too shallow pool is suitable for swimming guys.  But, tourists notice, it is better not to go here with children because of the constant noise.  Construction, a disco bar and Russian tourists create a not too favorable sound background for relaxing kids.  With children it is better to settle in the Golden Rain-2. </p>
