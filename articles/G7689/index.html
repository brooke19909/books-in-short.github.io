How to get from Kowloon to the airport?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many considered <span>this ghost town to</span> be some kind of kingdom of darkness and the approaching Apocalypse on the planet.  It is simply unbelievable that over an area of ‚Äã‚Äã2.6 hectares, which can be compared in size to two large football fields, more than thirty thousand people lived at one time.  The fortified city of Kowloon can be considered the champion in the number of people living per square meter and the most populated place on earth. </p><h2>  How did it all start? </h2><p>  In the mid-nineteenth century, an <span>opium war</span> broke <span>out</span> between the Chinese Empire and Great Britain <span>,</span> which resulted in Hong Kong becoming British territory.  Subsequently (in 1898), some changes took place, and this part of China was leased to Britain for 99 years, but with only one small condition: Kowloon fortress will remain Chinese.  This was done so that the government of the future PRC could observe how the British authorities and residents in Hong Kong behave.  Thus, a real enclave appeared. </p>

    <p>  During the Second World War and the Japanese occupation of the island, the fortified city of Kowloon lost its surrounding walls, and the officials who lived there were dispersed.  Nevertheless, the quarter continued to exist and grew not in breadth, but in height. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Fortress Transformations </h2><p>  In the postwar period, the city of Kowloon continued to be Chinese territory, surrounded by a <span>colony of Britain.</span>  For the reason that no laws and authorities were in force in this place, this quarter became a real refuge for Chinese refugees.  They rushed to its territory from the laws of revolutionary China and began a new life there. </p><p>  At that time, a massive, spontaneous construction unfolded at the site of the former construction, which the British authorities initially tried to prevent, but ran into a violent protest from the government of the Republic of China. </p><p>  In the 60s, the fortified city of Kowloon with its scanty square became a home for 20 thousand inhabitants.  Every millimeter of its territory was occupied by high-rise buildings.  There was only a small unoccupied place in the center of the district, which had once served as the residence of a Chinese official, which is still there today as a reminder of the history of this fortress. </p>

    <h2>  Features of urban life </h2><p>  The fortified city of Kowloon was a territory inhabited by a society that did not recognize any laws.  Complete anarchy reigned there, any pickpocket or thief who committed a crime became an inviolable person for law enforcement officers, crossing the line of this quarter. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The population of this city continued to grow, and in the nineties exceeded already 30 thousand people.  Perhaps there would be more inhabitants, but the height of the houses was limited and could not be more than 14 floors.  Such forced measures were taken due to the fact that Kai So Airport is located nearby, and the pilots were forced to make a dangerous turn to <span>land the plane</span> , being afraid to hook at home. </p><p>  But no one bothered to expand the fortified city of Kowloon.  Photos taken there in those days show that the corridors and the gaps between the high-rise buildings and the buildings here were only about seventy centimeters, or even less.  Citizens living in apartments of ten square meters, could assume that they are simply in the royal apartments of this place. </p><p>  Every year, new buildings continued to grow here, and complete anarchy reigned.  Old buildings fell into decay and collapsed, but there was no question of any major repairs.  This densely populated area was remembered and entered into the history of Hong Kong. </p>

    <h2>  The end of the rubber city </h2><p>  1987 was a decisive date for this quarter.  The governments of the Republic of China and Britain have finally come to a common agreement and decided to wipe out these dangerous mega-slums.  All residents of the city received monetary compensation and could purchase housing in Hong Kong homes. </p><p>  The demolition was scheduled for 1992, but was perceived by violent protests by the natives of these places, who did not want to lose the former foundations of their lives.  Nevertheless, the area was liquidated quite quickly, and during its devastation, it served as a film set for a film with Jackie Chan.  The process of destruction of houses even made it possible to shoot several successful and spectacular shots. </p>

    <h2>  The territory of the fortress today </h2><p>  And so, to the great relief of many <span>Hong Kong residents, the</span> fortified city of Kowloon ceased to exist.  Kowloon Walled City - a park with the same name - appeared in its place, in which, in principle, there is nothing special, but to many tourists it resembles a castle with its own history. </p><p>  The design is made in the style of the Qing Dynasty.  It was opened to the public in 1995.  The park is located on an area of ‚Äã‚Äã31,000 square meters and is divided into eight scenic zones different in style, but generalized by a single architecture.  The Hong Kong government has spent more than $ 76 million on this local attraction.  The Ministry of Leisure and Culture is responsible for the safety of the park. </p>

    <p>  Of course, little has been preserved from the previous city, but still some objects remained.  For example, there are some artifacts dating back to the times of the imperial dynasty of China.  The remnants of the south gate are officially declared a historical heritage of Hong Kong. </p><h2>  Route </h2><p>  A tourist who has arrived in Hong Kong will undoubtedly begin his tour with a former fortress called Kowloon.  All residents of the city know how to get there, but it is better to ask in advance. </p><p>  There are several ways to build your route.  The first one will tell you how to get from Kowloon to the airport and back.  You can take the Airport Express high-speed metro line, which makes just three stops on the way.  In order to get to the park, you need to go to the Kowloon Station. </p><p>  You can also take a bus.  From Cheklapkok International Airport to Kowloon Peninsula, route No. A21 runs, where stops are made only upon request.  Therefore, it is better to look in advance at the electronic scoreboard with a running line and the names of the stops. </p><h2>  Visitors reviews </h2><p>  All those who have previously seen or read about Kowloon Fortress say that once it was the most dangerous place in the middle of the city, and now there the locals simply relax and spend their leisure time calmly.  Many citizens recommend visiting this park, because only in it you can relax in peace and quiet from the frantic pace of life in Hong Kong. </p><p>  Tourists like that there are many beautiful Chinese gazebos, ponds and greenery, and especially how birds sing <span>beautifully</span> in this <span>place</span> . </p>
