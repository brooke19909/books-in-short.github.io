In the cool hours of the day, numerous tourists and local residents hurry to the equipped areas with a barbecue.  Comfortable white tables and trestle beds with pale blue umbrellas are located on all embankments. </p><p>  It is because of the cozy and relaxed atmosphere that this emirate was simply created for tourists to relax.  A huge number of the most beautiful hotels in the UAE have been built here, including the best hotel in the country - Kempinski.  The hotel, which will be discussed in the article, is located right in the central part of Ajman.  Ramada Hotel Suites Ajman 4 is located 500 meters from the beach area, where tourists are delivered free of charge by the hotel bus 6 times a day. </p>

    <p>  After intensive training, you can take a steam bath in the sauna absolutely free.  But there is a division by gender.  Sauna separately for men and women.  You can play billiards.  On the sand of the beach area there is a volleyball court where you can organize into teams and play this exciting game. </p><p>  Why will you have to part with the money, we will consider further.  For massage and spa treatments, of course, you have to pay.  Also paid are all water activities: water skiing, banana skiing, windsurfing. </p><h2>  Beach area </h2><p>  And here we got to the negative reviews of people about staying at the Ramada Hotel Suites Ajman 4 (UAE, Ajman).  Many are very happy with the hotel itself, but there are negative memories about the beach.  It is not near the hotel.  You need to get to it either by taxi or by a free bus.  For the first flight, the turn is like in the Lenin Mausoleum in Soviet times.  Very unpleasant situation.  The beach is small, and two hotels are located on it.  One can only imagine the number of people. </p>

    <p>  According to tourists, 95% of vacationers are Russian-speaking.  Children's cry, noise and crowd lying on top of each other.  Towels are provided at the entrance for free, only you need to name the hotel room.  On the way back they are thrown just into the basket at the exit.  Umbrellas and sunbeds are also free. </p><h2>  Additional amenities </h2><p>  There is a tour desk on site, but some reviews caution that there are occasional cases of cheating.  Situations are described when people were taken money, allegedly for an excursion, and then the agent disappeared, irrevocably taking away the contributions of inexperienced tourists. </p><p>  The hotel can rent a car, there is a free car park. </p><p>  About souvenir shops reviews are also negative.  The goods are cheap, Chinese, and prices are three times more expensive. </p><p>  The rooms are cleaned clean enough and everyday, but people say that the furniture is not the first freshness, and some bathtubs are cleaned to scuffs. </p><p>  Laundry or dry cleaning services are available for a fee, but shoes will be cleaned for you with absolutely no money. </p><h2>  Transfers </h2><p>  The hotel is located near airports, so getting there is convenient.  Consider the distance from the nearest airports to the hotel: </p><ul><li>  Sharjah - 9.5 km. </li><li>  <span>Dubai</span> International <span>Airport</span> - 18.8 km. </li><li>  Ras Al Khaimah - 53.9 km. </li></ul><p>  If desired, you can order a transfer to the hotel, which is paid separately. </p><p>  But free buses take tourists to Sharjah, to the Chinese market and to Dubai.  It is very convenient, you can just go sightseeing around the cities without excursions, visit shopping centers, see interesting places, where we will dwell separately. </p><h2>  What can I see next? </h2><p>  In Dubai, you can go to the world famous <span>Dubai</span> Mall.  There you can ride the metro, go to the famous "Sail".  This is a chic hotel in Bourges Al Arabia.  It is interesting to climb the highest observation deck on the highest building in the world - the Burj Khalifa. </p><p>  People are advised to visit the palm island and the Mountain Hutt Safari, the Sharjah Aquarium, and there is the Sharjah Paintball Park in the same place.  Ride necessarily on dhow boats on the bay, the emirate looks very nice in the evening.  The lights of many hotels will impress more than during the day. </p><p>  Of course, it is worth visiting in the evening hours and the famous musical fountain in Dubai.  The performance is impressive.  But be prepared that you have to invest decently.  The UAE is a very expensive country.  There is nothing to do with a thousand dollars, except to lie on the beach.  But you really want to get maximum pleasure if you have already climbed so far from your native places. </p>
