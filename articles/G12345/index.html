  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Men's vests - learn to knit</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Knitwear is versatile, beautiful, and functional.  In addition, hand-made gadgets (handmade) do not go out of fashion for the past season.  Pay attention to fashion collections - men's and women's vests are always present in them.  Agree, this is a great reason to please loved ones with new things.  An elementary pattern and simple knitting can be done even by an inexperienced craftswoman. </p><p>  Fashionable men's vests feature a loose fit.  Convenient and comfortable models can be made embossed or smooth viscous.  Both trends in the coming season are very relevant. </p><p>  The cheerful multi-colored strip does not give up its positions.  By the way, this is a great way to put the rest of the yarn into action. </p><p>  Creative knitted men's transformer vests are models with removable sleeves.  True, you will have to tinker with stitching the lightning, but the end result is worth such an effort.  Particularly good are similar models in a youth wardrobe. </p><p>  A walk in the fresh air, work in the country or a trip to the countryside?  Knitted vests for men, children and women are appropriate in any environment.  A beautiful pattern and soft yarn will make this item your favorite wardrobe item.  Combined with loose jeans, a turtleneck or a shirt, the vest will be a great casual ensemble. </p><p>  <strong><span>Men's vests</span> for dad and son</strong> </p><p>  Today I will tell you how to connect a simple male model with a V - neck and a deep armhole.  According to one description, you can immediately carry out two vests for your beloved men.  Today, the trend of "son as dad" is very popular.  Besides, you must admit, it looks very nice. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To work, you need 700 g of beige and 50 g of brown wool yarn.  From this amount, an adult model of size 50 - 52 and a vest for a boy with a height of 145 - 150 cm will be obtained. </p><p>  Now a little about what is better to knit.  Men's vests can be made of any type of yarn, but some features will not hurt to take into account. <br>  Yarn from 100% wool is very warm and holds its shape well, but falls off too quickly and can cause <span>skin irritation.</span>  Therefore, it is better to take for knitting threads containing <span>synthetic fibers,</span> such as acrylic. </p><p>  <span>Knitting a men's vest with knitting needles is</span> not much more difficult than a scarf.  However, the pattern will still have to be built.  At least in order not to make a mistake in the size of the finished product. </p><p>  The second step should be to calculate the required number of loops.  It is very easy to do.  Tie a sample, iron and determine how many loops are in one centimeter, and then just multiply by the desired number.  Do not forget that knitted things tend to stretch.  Therefore, you can safely drop a dozen loops so that the finished product sits more tightly. </p><p>  To get started, use knitting needles one size smaller than those you intend to knit the entire vest.  Put a dark brown thread on the knitting needles and knit 4 rows with a twisted 1X1 elastic band: perform the wrong loop as usual, and tuck the front loop behind the back wall.  After four rows, change the thread color.  This way you get a striped elastic. </p><p>  Our vest is knitted with a pearl pattern, which is the simplest alternation of the front and back loops.  On the wrong side, repeat the pattern, and in the third row we change the sequence - over the front loop we perform the wrong loop and vice versa.  The back and front are fully made of beige yarn. </p><p>  To cut, divide the fabric at the required height in half and continue knitting simultaneously from two balls.  So you do not miscalculate the number of rows. </p><p>  Carefully steam the finished canvas, prick it on the pattern and leave it to dry.  After that, sew all the details.  To finish the sleeve, dial the armhole loops on circular knitting needles and knit in the same pattern as the elastic band on the bottom of the vest.  When closing the last row, first knit the loop as loose as possible and then pull it through the adjacent one.  In this case, the edge will be quite elastic. <br>  To make a cutout, also loop over the entire neck.  So that the inlay lies beautifully, at the point where the canvas bifurcates, knit three loops together, stretching one through the other.  After closing the loops, lightly steam off the elastic bands without ironing. </p>
