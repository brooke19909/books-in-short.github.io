It brought a considerable number of innovations that have found their practical application, this is a fact.  But, on the other hand, any update becomes a potential source of problems.  Of course, initially it was completely impossible to design the iOS 9 update, reviews about which flooded the international network, it was almost impossible.  Another question is whether we will see the optimization of the firmware in the future, and whether minor flaws and major errors of the developers will be fixed in it.  But this is not for us to decide, but for now we‚Äôll talk about the main problems associated with this update. </p><h2>  Inherited from iOS 8? </h2>

    <p>  The firmware of the eighth version for "ayos" was called absolutely raw by experts.  Optimization, of course, is not equated to zero.  But, nevertheless, she was somewhere near this mark.  The flurry of indignation that followed from users of iPads and iPhones can be called logical. </p><h2>  List of gaps </h2>

    <p>  Among the most common errors were regular crashes from programs, deleting files from the cloud service.  Many owners of iPhones 4c said that after installing the firmware, the devices began to slow down.  Well, of course, you can not ignore the theme of the battery.  It discharged too quickly for devices of this class with such technical characteristics.  But just try to imagine one thing: all this, compared to the flaws of the iOS 9 update, seems like flowers.  The magnitude of the problem with such a comparison should be immediately clear even to the most inexperienced user.  And this article was written, in fact, in order to help users solve at least part of the problems associated with installing the firmware. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The message ‚ÄúFailed to update the software‚Äù </h2>

    <p>  The English name for this failure is Software Update Failed.  An error can occur both during installation by connecting to a Wi-Fi access point, and when downloading software by using iTunes.  The possible reason is that at the moment the Apple servers are overloaded and they cannot install the update on all user devices at once.  Therefore, you will need to wait.  A new iOS 9 update may be installed next time. </p><p>  First, make sure your connection to the international network is stable.  If there is no problem with the signal level, just wait a day or two, and then try again.  The new iOS 9 update does not suit every user, and rumors are spreading quickly enough, therefore, perhaps, soon the stream of owners of ‚Äúapple‚Äù devices who want to install the firmware will weaken significantly.  You can easily download the update to your smartphone due to the weakening of traffic. </p><h2>  Not enough space </h2>

    <p>  A message that there is not enough memory on the device to install the firmware appears when you try to download it through a Wi-Fi access point.  Actually, here the cause of the occurrence is transparent as water.  The iOS 9 update takes a long time to load (or it may not load at all) in this case due to the fact that the device‚Äôs memory must be freed from the presence of third-party multimedia files. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Recall to users: in the case of iOS 8, such an error led to the device getting into the so-called recovery loop.  But updating the <span>iPhone iOS</span> 9 makes it possible to temporarily erase certain applications from a smartphone.  When the firmware is installed on the device, the programs will return to the device by downloading them from the store.  Otherwise, I would like to note two methods that can be used when a similar problem occurs.  The first way is to activate the ‚Äúallow the removal of applications‚Äù function.  To do this, click the button of the same name.  In this case, you don‚Äôt have to do anything else.  The second method is to selectively or completely clean the iPhone.  This, respectively, delete media files and reset the smartphone to the factory settings. </p><h2>  IOS 9 update takes a long time to load? </h2>

    <p>  Often when trying to update the firmware for users of ‚Äúapple‚Äù devices, the following problem arises.  It seems that the process of downloading the update has been started, but it ends with the fact that the corporate logo of the American company is displayed on the screen of the device.  A <span>status bar</span> may also be present <span>,</span> but not in all cases, which should be noted.  So it turns out that users begin to ask: ‚ÄúiPhone freezes when updating iOS 9, what should I do?‚Äù </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The way out of this situation is to force the loading of your device.  But it does not always help, and therefore there remains one more method.  This is a device recovery through Recovery Mode using aityuns.  We remind you that all the multimedia contents of the smartphone will be deleted.  Refund is possible only if a backup copy of the data in the <span>cloud storage has</span> been created in advance <span>.</span>  We note additionally that if the ‚Äúhome screen‚Äù button on your device does not work, and it hangs itself, it is not possible to put an iPhone or iPad into <span>DFU mode</span> . </p><h2>  Data Transfer Issues </h2>

    <p>  What to do if after updating IOS 9 the cellular network does not work?  Similar errors do occur, however, the connection is not based on any standard.  It is, in fact, not only about GPRS and 3G, but also about LTE.  However, you can always check if this is the problem by doing one simple step.  This is joining a Wi-Fi hotspot.  If it works, then we continue to deal with the problem as follows.  First, restart our ‚Äúapple‚Äù. </p><p>  We switch the cellular data switch, which is located in the menu (section ‚ÄúCellular communication‚Äù), into the inactive position, and then we activate it again.  After that, turn on the flight mode for half a minute.  When everything is done, reset the settings.  Such a sequence of actions should solve the problem of the inability to connect to the international network due to cellular standards. </p><h2>  IOS 9: ‚ÄúSlide to update‚Äù </h2>

    <p>  Such an error occurs quite often if you evaluate the situation by the number of user questions in various forums.  That is why it is important to know how a similar problem can be solved.  If you see ‚ÄúSlide to update‚Äù after installing iOS 9, then the following steps should be taken.  First, open the iTunes on a desktop computer or laptop and connect the phone to the device.  We perform synchronization, and when the update request appears, we give permission for it.  When the process is complete, simply linearly follow the instructions displayed on the screen.  They will help to superficially configure the device after installing the firmware. </p><h2>  Problem sending messages </h2><p>  If the iMessage service does not work after updating IOS 9, fixing the error will not be difficult.  To begin with, we additionally note that messages can be sent, but the process itself takes a fairly long time.  If you are among the users who installed the new firmware and now suffer from the corresponding problem, then proceed with the following instructions. </p><p>  Initially, we check whether there is a stable connection with a cellular connection.  To do this, you can activate the Internet connection using a SIM card.  We also check how messages are sent when the smartphone is connected to a Wi-Fi access point.  Poor signal quality and its low level can just affect the data rate of the message. </p><p>  If an error occurs when sending messages through a mobile connection, perform operations with the slider in the ‚ÄúCellular Communications‚Äù section.  That is, disconnect and enable the connection again.  If this does not help, then check whether the subscriber to whom you send messages is a user of the corresponding service.  Let's say everything is correct.  In this case, log out of the account.  To do this, go to the menu called ‚ÄúMessages‚Äù.  Next - to the ‚ÄúSending / Receiving‚Äù section.  There we already see the button on which our Apple ID is written, click on it.  Select the item called ‚ÄúExit‚Äù.  When the operation is completed, log in again.  If the above methods didn‚Äôt solve the problem, reset the phone. </p><h2>  Getting iPhone in Recovery Mode </h2><p>  What should I do if the iOS 9 update does not turn on, and the device switches to recovery mode when trying to install it?  Note that, in fact, a similar error occurs after the firmware has been downloaded from the official server.  The installation can be interpreted in different ways, but we have the same result: the update does not turn on, and the phone itself goes into recovery mode.  How to deal with this shortcoming?  You can immediately see the icon of the USB cable and aytuns on the screen.  So what to do in this case?  The first item will be a forced reboot of our device.  Next, we connect the device to a personal computer using the appropriate wire.  When this is done, run iTunes on the computer.  It should automatically detect that the iPhone was connected in recovery mode.  Through the program, we, in fact, will do this.  Here is a simple solution to this problem. </p><p>  By the way, what can lead to such an error?  Users should understand that updating iOS 9 (which, to be honest, is not the best reviews) requires the greatest possible reliability when downloading and installing.  This includes a stable connection with a Wi-Fi access point, as well as the absence of factors that could affect the connection of the device with a computer via a USB cable. </p><h2>  If Wi-Fi is not working properly </h2><p>  Many devices after installing the firmware (IOS update date September 9 - September 16, 2015) begin to interact incorrectly with Wi-Fi access points.  That is, the device simply does not connect to them.  What to do in this case?  First of all, reset the network settings.  After that, we try to connect to a particular wireless network.  If this step does not give the expected results, turn on the flight mode and hold our device in this state for ten seconds. </p><p>  The solution to the problem may be a temporary shutdown of the wireless module.  You can do this by going to the menu item called ‚ÄúConfidentiality‚Äù.  It is located in the device settings.  After that, select ‚ÄúLocation Services‚Äù, from where we go to ‚ÄúSystem Services‚Äù.  An alternative is to change the DNS in the appropriate settings.  You need to set public servers of Google. </p><h2>  IOS 9 update. Reviews </h2><p>  As noted earlier, this version of the firmware has a huge number of small (and not so!) Painful flaws.  In general, they are solved quite quickly and simply in most cases ... But many reviews suggest that it is not particularly worth rushing to install the version.  Of course, if you want to try it personally, to find out what and how, then you can try.  But be prepared for the fact that you will initially have to pay attention and time to solve the fundamental problems associated with the new version of the operating system. </p>
