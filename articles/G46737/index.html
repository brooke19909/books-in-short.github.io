It is also called FOM EVA or foam rubber.  It is a thin and elastic sheet of porous rubber.  He is very malleable at work, products from him hold their shape well and look very beautiful and natural.  Most often, jewelry, toys, accessories, and interior items are made from this material.  In this article, we will learn to perform flowers.  From foamiran we will make a rose and a lily.  So, we study the instructions, look at the photos and get a boost of inspiration. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="flowers from foamiran" class="if" height="252" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/356872.jpg" width="416"></div>

    <h2>  Rose is a flower from foamiran.  Master class (preparatory stage) </h2><p>  For work, we prepare materials and tools specified in the following list: </p><ul><li>  foam rubber; </li><li>  cotton buds; </li><li>  hot gun or glue "Second", "Dragon"; </li><li>  scissors. </li></ul><h2>  Description of the manufacturing process of crafts "Rose" (from foam rubber) </h2><p>  In order to make <span>flowers from foamiran</span> in the <span>form of roses,</span> you need to make blanks - petals.  To do this, cut the foam rubber into squares.  Such parts need 6 pieces of different sizes: 3x3, 4x4, 5x4.  Next, the petals need to give volume.  This is done as follows.  We take the square blank in our hands and twist.  The resulting roll is rolled between the palms, heating it.  FOM EVA when heated becomes elastic and supple.  Therefore, when you feel the heat, flatten the workpiece and slightly stretch its edges, giving a convex shape.  Here is the first rose petal.  Thus we draw up all the square details.  After cooling, they will keep their shape well.  Next, we collect the blanks into a single whole.  In this case, flowers from foamiran will be mounted on a cotton bud.  Stick a bead on one part of it.  Do not forget to remove the fleece.  Well, if the hole in the bead is the same diameter as the stick‚Äôs circumference, then the mount will be strong.  Now attach the small petals, wrapping them slightly around the stick.  After gluing the medium and behind them - large parts of the bud.  From the foam of green rubber cut the blank in the form of an asterisk.  In the middle of this part, make a small hole.  Pass the wand through it, and attach the ‚Äústar‚Äù at the base of the flower, forming a sepal.  Decorative rose is ready. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mk flowers from foamiran" class="if" height="428" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/356871.jpg" width="570"></div>

What do you need to do the crafts? </h2><p>  We learn to make flowers from foamiran with our own hands in the form of a decorative lily.  First, prepare the materials and tools indicated in the list: </p><ul><li>  foamiran pink or white; </li><li>  iron; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  stack or wooden skewer; </li><li>  towel; </li><li>  <span>glue "Dragon",</span> "Second" or thermal gun; </li><li>  paper-braided wire (diameter 0.35); </li><li>  acrylic paints; </li><li>  red marker; </li><li>  floristic accessories - stamens and pistils (can be used from an old plastic flower); </li><li>  green tape-tape; </li><li>  cardboard; </li><li>  pencil. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="flower from foamiran master class" class="if" height="370" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/356897.jpg?1395323210298" width="413"></div></li></ul><h2>  Stage of manufacture of foam rubber products in the form of a lily </h2><p>  The following is a detailed master class (MK) "Flowers from foamiran - lilies."  On cardboard, draw a sketch of the oval-shaped lily petal with an elongated and sharp one end.  Cut the template and transfer it to the foamiran.  For one flower you need six petals.  Cut them out.  Next, with the help of stacks or skewers on these details, arrange the "veins".  Do this very carefully so as not to damage the structure of the material.  The next step is the formation of bends on the petals.  Take one piece and lean it for a second against the sole of an iron that has been preheated.  Then quickly put the petal on the towel and slightly stretch the edges of the workpiece with your fingers.  They will take on a wavy shape.  Now on these blanks from the wrong side vertically attach the wire.  Its end should extend a few centimeters beyond the lower edge of the part.  Bend all the petals so that the bulge is on the front side.  Paint them with acrylics in the colors that are inherent in lilies.  <span>Twist the stamens and pestle</span> with a tape tape into one piece.  Next, attach the petals in two tiers of three pieces.  Spread the bud, place the stamens in different directions.  The foam rubber lily is ready. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself flowers from foamiran" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/356869.jpg?1395322972109" width="558"></div>

    <h2>  Where to apply? </h2><p>  According to the technologies described above, flowers of other species are performed.  The difference is only in the shape and size of the petals.  Such flowers from foamiran can become a beautiful decoration for hair: a hairpin, elastic or decor of a hoop.  Glue them on the base and let dry.  An exclusive bud will become a worthy decoration of your image. </p><p>  Also, such products look great if applied as a brooch.  You will only need to attach the buds to special fittings using hot glue. </p><p>  Bouquets of flowers made of foam rubber look very natural.  A stalk is made from ordinary wire wrapped in brown paper or green <span>floral ribbon</span> .  A bud is attached to it.  Make some of these flowers - and the perfect decor element for your interior is ready. </p><p>  Creative people have found such applications for flowers from FOM EVA as the decoration of handbags, clutches, belts.  Even the simplest outfit will sparkle with fresh colors, if supplemented with such an original attribute. </p>
