    <h2>  In the first millennium </h2><p>  The ninth century put an end to the <span>empire of Charlemagne.</span>  It scattered like a plate on the floor into small pieces.  One of these fragments - the country of the Western Francs - became a kingdom, where the descendants of the emperor Charlemagne, Carolingi, received the rule, the dynasty weakened, marked by the seal of degeneration.  Royal power at that time could not be called even weak - there was practically no power.  Who was opposed to the unification of France?  Is that time. </p><p>  When the last Caroling died, all of France could fit in a <span>shepherd’s bag</span> - a small patch of Ile de France with the lands around Orleans and Paris.  In 987, the king was anointed by Hugo Capet.  Naturally, neither Hugo nor the other Capetians on the throne of France was satisfied with such a state of affairs when their vassals, the Dukes of Normandy, for example, became not only richer than kings, but also stronger than them many times.  Can there be other reasons for the unification of France? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Capetings </h2><p>  The first Capetings survived on the throne, literally balancing on one leg, but they stayed, survived, gained strength and ruled until 1328, constantly increasing territories and taming vassals.  A very healthy family, with centenarians who introduced the continuity of the main political course.  They usually crowned the eldest sons during their lifetime, so there were no disputes about succession to the throne. </p><p>  Of course, "the family is not without a freak," not all Capetings have shown themselves to be skilled rulers.  However, this situation must be considered objectively.  How did the unification of France take place, in what conditions?  The medieval world is so fragmented and cramped for any initiative that it is amazing how hereditary possessions (royal domain) were so significantly increased.  The first successes of the unification of France are justly attributed to the Capetians. </p>

    <h2>  Powerful enemies </h2><p>  As soon as Louis VI managed to extinguish the baronial revolts, taking as a rule to support the nominees from the people, giving them even the highest public posts in the hope of future devotion;  he barely rebuilt the old Carolingian church into the first truly Gothic monastery of Saint-Denis, taking from there an adviser to himself Abbot Suger, when the Duke William appeared in Normandy.  Yes, that one is the Conqueror. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The political situation to the extreme was complicated by William's subjugation of England in 1066.  As a vassal of the French king, William himself became king - and the king of a much more powerful house, building up power with much greater speed than the Capetings.  Henry II already had the "Anjou mini-empire", becoming the ruler of England, Normandy, Anjou, Aquitaine and many lands that make up most of modern France.  The most offensive is that if you ask yourself who was the opponent of the unification of France, you have to answer - your own vassals. </p>

    <h2>  Young yes early </h2><p>  The fifteen-year-old King Philip II resolutely took up the correction of this state of affairs.  Very smart, prudent, and even sometimes vile for the good of the cause, he was one of the most patient and far-sighted politicians of the Middle Ages.  It was not in vain that Philip was called Augustus.  One who was opposed to the unification of France, became the enemy of the king. </p><p>  The choice of foreign policy was the collection of land and rounding of the territory, while the domestic one was the consolidation of the acquired property.  Philip did equally well with both.  It was attended by a variety of talents - an excellent commander, a cunning diplomat, a wise legislator and an excellent manager coexisted in this young, but by no means fragile creation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Philip vs England </h2><p>  Henry II, king of England, Norman and further on the list, inherited a lot from the new ruler of France.  Despite the fact that an alliance was concluded between the two powers, Philip was intriguing so successfully that the sons of Henry greatly weakened the Anjou empire by constant rebellion. </p><p>  With Henry's successor, Richard I, Philip, who had matured by that time, could not intrigue, but he had friendship and joint <span>crusades.</span>  But with the next ruler - John Landless managed to cope quickly, easily and with relatively small losses.  The goal of unifying France was worth it. </p><p>  At first, Philip put John on trial for the murder of his nephew, Arthur, who, however, died under very mysterious circumstances.  John did not appear in court.  Then Philip confiscated all his possessions, which were on the mainland, for violating the vassal oath. </p><p>  Four years after the war and after the defeat of the British in 1214, Philip annexed not only Normandy to French lands, but also Anjou, as well as a number of regions in the north.  These were the first successes of the unification of France. </p>

    <h2>  Crusade </h2><p>  The Albigensians were a fun people.  The Pope did not like it at once: troubadours, knights, poets are clearly embraced by heresy, if they say that the Lord is not all-good and not omnipotent.  This albigensian heresy was saturated with several provinces of the south of France - Toulouse, Languedoc, Provence.  At the court of Count Raymond of Toulouse, the most talented and brilliant people of his time gathered. </p><p>  The French North, at the call of the Pope, went on a campaign against the Albigensians.  And meanwhile, Philip strengthened the northern borders, while his vassals drowned the Languedoc culture in blood. </p><p>  The faith of the barons was fanatical, and greed helped a lot.  The southern regions, including Languedoc - destroyed and executed, also came under French rule.  Philip, however, did not find this.  By 1224, the result of the crusade was obtained as the next step on the path to unification of France. </p><p>  According to the milestones of the reign of King Philip Augustus, you can trace the stages of the unification of France.  In addition, the positive aspects were the strengthening and consolidation of a unified power and the creation of a fairly coherent and efficient administrative system.  But it should be noted that Philip did not disdain anything to achieve his goals. </p>

    <h2>  Thirteenth century </h2><p>  <span>Louis Saint</span> ruled France from 1226 to 1270.  He was reputed to be so pious and wise that he was canonized by the Roman Church.  Repeatedly he acted as an arbiter in litigations between monarchs, but, being a frantic crusader, he never missed the benefits for the unification of France and strengthened the royal power very much. </p><p>  France bloomed with him, turning into a beautiful country, the cultural center with which it remains in Europe, and throughout the world to this day.  And then, under the wing of the wise monarch, the best theologians, troubadours, writers flocked from everywhere.  Magnificent cathedrals were built in Chartres, Amiens and Reims.  This is how the unification of France under King Louis the Holy happened. </p><p>  Despite his future holiness, Louis IX developed a difficult relationship with Rome.  In 1269, the Pragmatic Sanction was issued, which freed France from exactions and contributions to the Roman treasury and declared the independence of the Church of France from the Church of Rome.  The actions of Pope Innocent IV Louis in every way condemned. </p><h2>  Philip IV Beautiful and National State </h2><p>  The grandson of St. Louis could be called Philip Unscrupulous.  But called Beautiful.  Beauty turned out to be stronger than conscience.  Apparently, it was also stronger because Philip had the reign at the time of the decline of feudal power, which allowed to strengthen monarchism in the country, which he succeeded in.  He continued the work of his ancestors in every way possible.  The reasons for the unification of France did not go anywhere.  Philip prepared the country to join new territories. </p><p>  The policy of this king was dominated by aggression and cruelty.  These were the conditions of the era.  But here's an interesting fact: having been widowed early, he did not remarry, being faithful to his dead wife.  This reconciles many, even with his exorbitant ambition.  The stages of the unification of France after the reign of Philip did not end.  This process took almost the entire period of the Middle Ages. </p><p>  The influence of France under Philippe in Europe was strengthened, even from losses - the war with Flanders and the reprisals against the Templars - the country and its army received a good jackpot, replenishing the budget and armament.  Once again, a heated conflict with the British did not add France to Gascony - the possession of Edward I. Flanders also could not be taken over.  But here Pope Boniface VIII Philip even arrested.  And then he managed to elect the Frenchman Clement V, who moved the residence from Rome to Avignon.  It was a huge victory, since the unification of France was taking place - albeit not territorially, but nationally and religiously. </p>

    <h2>  The results of the unification of France </h2><p>  Gradually, a single language began to take shape, so the motley population of the country began to feel like a single people.  Favorable conditions for the development of culture appeared, art flourished, and education was being established. </p><p>  But only by the end of the 15th century France was able to acquire all the features of a centralized monarchical state.  Under Louis XI, serious reforms and transformations took place.  Cities were exempted from military service.  The vassals were able to pay off military service.  The army became hired, a special tax was instituted on it. </p><p>  Transformed almost completely public administration.  Relations with other countries became possible only at the highest - royal - level, vassals were forbidden. </p><p>  Taxes become permanent.  Officials appeared to manage this entire economy.  <span>General states</span> stopped convening.  Foreigners were invited to create industry, which contributed to the growth of cities and trade. </p>
