The MegaFon company, knowing this, accrues additional points for communication to its customers.  Everything is simple.  The more the subscriber is talking on the phone or using the modem, the greater will be his reward.  But not ordinary rubles will be credited to his account, but bonus points.  So, questions arise about where they come from, how to spend them, and how to transfer points to MegaFon into money.

    <h2></h2><h2>  Who can become a member of the program? </h2><p>  But can any subscriber of the company become a member of the MegaFon-Bonus program?  And will it cost him any money?  As some customers of the company believe, such a unique service cannot be provided for nothing.  But in reality, it is not only completely free, but any MegaFon subscriber can become its absolute participant, except for legal entities and <span>corporate clients.</span> </p><p>  Within a day after connecting, a new subscriber number becomes a member of <span>the loyalty program,</span> and he receives 5 invitation bonus points.  This amount, of course, is not enough to transfer points to money on MegaFon.  But then the client immediately gets acquainted with all the benefits of MegaFon-Bonus. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How are points awarded? </h2>

Many people notice that the bonus balance often does not change immediately after a conversation.  The fact is that they are charged only 1 time per month at the end of the billing period.  Usually from 1 to 5 is the number of the current period.  For every 30 rubles spent, the subscriber will receive 1 point.

    <p>  In addition, additional points can be obtained by purchasing mobile devices in the MegaFon communication salons.  The company often holds promotions, and the subscriber can get a very impressive amount of them for the purchase of a branded tablet or cell phone.  It is worth noting that points are not awarded for the services provided within the intranet, national and international roaming, as well as for the services of content providers and Replace the beep. </p><h2>  How to change points on MegaFon? </h2>

But how to transfer points on MegaFon to money, minutes and other pleasant gifts?  To do this is very simple, it is only advisable to first clarify your bonus balance.

It can be minutes, SMS and Internet traffic packages.  Those who want to make a memorable gift from MegaFon for themselves or friends can redeem points for branded souvenirs or gift certificates.  In addition, you can pay with them when buying a mobile device in the office or get a discount on communication services. </p><p>  Of course, souvenirs and certificates can only be obtained at the office.  But other rewards can be activated quite independently.  To do this, you can use the special USSD request * 115 #, the Service Guide service, or call 0510. Knowing how to transfer points to MegaFon, you can do this at any convenient time.  Thus, you can save your money or make a very important call.  In addition, non-monetary rewards can be presented to another subscriber participating in the loyalty program. </p><h2>  How many points are stored? </h2>

Often this leads them to confusion.  But the fact is that they have their own shelf life.  So, if in the last 12 months the subscriber has not used them, they can be canceled.  Invitation points are completely deducted after 3 months.  And, of course, if the subscriber number becomes corporate or reissued to a legal entity, all accumulated points are deleted.

      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  In addition, since not everyone knows how to transfer points to MegaFon into money and other gifts, the company periodically at its discretion may award a bonus package to the subscriber.  This usually happens if the client has not used the program for more than 6 months.  The reward is selected based on what the MegaFon subscriber is used to spending his money on. </p><h2>  How to refuse to participate in the program? </h2><p>  Despite all the advantages of the MegaFon-Bonus program, not everyone wants to participate in it.  Therefore, the operator provides them with the opportunity to disable it at their own request.  To do this, go to the office with a passport and write a statement.  Starting the next day, it will cease to act.  True, all previously accumulated points are automatically canceled. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The MegaFon-Bonus program is a unique offer of a mobile operator, which for the first time in the Russian market offered its customers to receive rewards for communication.  Despite the fact that it has existed for several years, none of the competitors could offer anything like this.  Only subscribers of one mobile operator have such a privilege as points on MegaFon.  To transfer to money or to something else - this is up to you to decide. </p>
