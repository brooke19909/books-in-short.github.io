    <p>  Experienced tourists advise beginners on the beach to go farther to the right or left of the main entrance.  Otherwise, you will have to sunbathe, surrounded by a huge number of Indians who simply love to swim in the sea with screams and screeches (and they do this without taking off their clothes). </p><p>  Many European tourists on the beaches order fresh fish.  Several of its types are brought directly to the sunbeds so that the client can choose what they like.  Then, at a certain hour, the fish is cooked in the neck.  The sea near the hotel, like almost everywhere in India, is very warm and reasonably clean.  There are no cow "mines" on the coastline.  Of course, on the beach, tourists are offered all kinds of entertainment - a banana, a parachute, etc. </p><p>  The sand on the beach in Colva has a beautiful silver hue.  Since its structure is very small (almost dusty), you can walk on it and sunbathe on it with great comfort.  It was mainly for beautiful and comfortable beaches that Colva fell in love with European tourists, including Russian. </p><h2>  Soul Vacation Resort &amp; Spa 3 * (Goa, India): reviews and room rates </h2><p>  The rooms of this hotel are popular with all guests, without exception.  Towels are changed daily (sometimes every other day).  The maids also do not forget to replenish the shampoo and gel in the shower room.  Bed linen is replaced approximately once every few days (5-6).  This, of course, is not too common.  But the linen in this hotel is not washed, as in many other hotels in India, and not torn.  In the shower room, in addition to the standard cosmetic set, there are a needle and threads. </p><p>  Just excellent food - this is what has earned tourists in particular the good hotel Soul Vacation Resort &amp; Spa 3 * reviews.  The disadvantages of this hotel, some guests include only the fact that on its territory (on the lawns) there are ants.  And very biting.  But the hotel administration is constantly holding various kinds of events aimed at the destruction of these insects.  Ants never creep into numbers. </p><p>  Worth staying at this hotel is not too expensive.  Prices for luxury rooms range from 4500-5500 rubles per day for two people.  On most specialized sites, this hotel is classified as a three star hotel.  However, the service here is really at a very high level.  Therefore, the correct name of the hotel is still - Soul Vacation Resort and Spa 3.5 * (Colva).  This is the class this hotel actually corresponds to. </p>

    <h2>  Service Reviews </h2><p>  The staff of the Soul Vacation Resort and Spa in Colva, most tourists consider very friendly and responsible.  Almost all the requests of guests are fulfilled instantly.  The administration also listens to the advice of its customers regarding improving the service.  Tipping at this hotel is optional.  Maids will still perform their duties efficiently.  But many guests still put on the bed 30-50 rupees for employees.  After all, their work is really hard. </p><p>  There is one more plus for which the Soul Vacation Resort and Spa hotel in Colva has earned excellent reviews from tourists.  India is not a rich country, and the staff here is often very poor.  Many hotels in this country, unfortunately, sometimes have theft.  Employees in some cases simply cannot resist the temptation to take the money left by the guest in the room or, for example, the phone.  Hotel Soul Vacation Resort has earned good reviews from tourists, including the fact that theft here never happens. </p><h2>  Colva Infrastructure </h2><p>  The Soul Vacation Resort hotel is located, as many guests of India believe, very well.  In the immediate vicinity there are many restaurants, cafes, bars, etc. There are also a market nearby the hotel.  Here you can buy including various exotic fruits.  Many merchants in this bazaar speak good Russian, and therefore making purchases here is very easy. </p>

    <h2>  Sights of Colva </h2><p>  Including several very interesting places located nearby, guests are praised by the Soul Vacation Resort &amp; Spa 3 * hotel.  <span>Tours to India are</span> popular mainly because of the very beautiful nature and luxurious beaches.  But of course, in this country there are also architectural sights.  In the immediate vicinity of the Soul Vacation Resort are: </p><ul><li><p>  Church of Our Lady of Mercy; </p></li><li><p>  Sernabatim Beach. </p></li></ul><h2>  Temple of Our Lady and Sernabatim Beach </h2><p>  The Church of Our Lady of Mercy was built in 1630.  This building is perhaps the main attraction of Colva.  The fact is that a miraculous statue of Jesus is kept in this temple.  The church building itself looks impressive.  Ancient architecture harmoniously combines with the snow-white color of the walls.  Unfortunately, the miraculous figurine itself can only be seen in October, during the annual religious festival of Fam. </p><p>  Sernabatim, in fact, is the southernmost part of Colva Beach.  The sand here is silver (almost white), and the water is crystal clear.  The main advantage of this beach is considered to be almost complete deserted.  It‚Äôs very nice to relax surrounded by nature.  The waves on this beach are not as high as in Colva.  Therefore, it is definitely worth coming here with the children. </p>
