Immediately there is a feeling that you are in a dungeon with countless treasures that sparkle and shimmer.  In these amazing natural formations, as if eternity has stopped.  Most of this fabulous beauty is concentrated in a depression, the height of which is fifteen and the width is fourteen meters.  Its volume reaches two and a half thousand cubic meters. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>
