The mechanism includes a steel core located inside the coil.  Thanks to it, a special contact device is activated by means of which the connection and opening of the power circuit is carried out.  Efficiency does not depend on the state of the start button - after all, the mechanical component reliably supports the power supply of the circuit. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As two control links, a radio signal receiver and a mobile remote control are used, with which commands are given (for convenience, you can make or buy a special holder for it).  The radius of their interaction can reach 20 meters in closed rooms, and in the open air - generally 100 meters. If we have a factory remote switch, then we should not be surprised if it has the ability to control the brightness of lighting (which positively affects the life of the lamps). </p><p>  Often, it may also be provided to reproduce the last set system parameters.

Developed and marketed devices that have a touch control type.  But the disadvantage of such remotes (as well as phones and tablets, which may act in their role) is the rather low sensitivity.  Another important advantage that almost any remote switch has is the ability to control several power grids at the same time. </p><h2>  Advantages of remote switches </h2>

This issue is especially relevant for people who have rooms with suspended and suspended ceiling structures.  In this case, the remote-controlled switch can simply be hidden between the walls.  As a result, the planned stylistics of the interior will not be violated and at the same time convenience will be ensured when using light.  And there‚Äôs nothing to say about the ease of managing several rooms, except for just two words - almost ideal.  The connection of the remote light switch will depend on the type of lamps that are combined with this device.  What is the difference?  So, when you have to work with classic incandescent lamps, all actions are performed similarly to connecting conventional electrical equipment.  The installation of their LED counterparts is somewhat different.  So, it is necessary to provide good nutrition using both zero and phase.  By the way, as experienced craftsmen advise, it is advisable to place the remote-controlled switch as close to the lamp as possible.

They will provide invaluable assistance while simultaneously controlling multiple light sources in which any possible lamp can be installed.  With this device, you can turn off the lights without leaving the street from your home - and this is not a problem.  So, most samples work quietly at a distance of up to 100 meters.  The most advanced (and most expensive) models boast the ability to control from a distance of 150 m.

    <h2>  Features of work </h2><p>  Important is the fact that devices can control lighting not only remotely, but also in manual mode.  By the way, continuing the topic of the versatility of responding to remotes, it should be reported that the device is suitable not only from a TV, but also from a music center, air conditioning and other devices that work on this principle.  And so you can control the lighting while lying on the bed or sofa.  An important feature is also the property of the dimmer (that is, the <span>dimmer).</span>  This technical feature has a positive effect on the life of incandescent or halogen lamps.  Remote switch with remote control allows you to spend the resource of their service is not fully, but only partially.  Thus, the time of their working capacity and the performance of their function is stretched. </p><h2>  Imitation of human presence </h2>

The first is an imitation of the presence of people in an apartment or house, which is especially important if you need to leave.  For this, pre-set timers are used.  If they are not provided, then a similar mechanism can be built on yourself if you have the appropriate qualifications.  Another important function of the remote switches is to turn off the light if it is on for a long time.  Usually it equals 12 hours.  This is convenient if you went to the cottage or just outside the city to relax for a couple of days, and the light was left on.

Given the variety of devices on the market, the functionality rests solely on the monetary issue.  And here it is worth noting an interesting fact about the remote switch.  The price of models starts from several hundred rubles and ends at tens of thousands.  Although schematically they are not very different.  Why is that?  The fact is that a wide range of cheap models is the products of China, which cannot boast of reliability and durability.  Therefore, choosing a remote switch with a remote control, you need to make sure that you have the original products in front of you.  And finally, speaking of manufacturers of quality goods at low prices, it is worth paying attention to what Belarus offers.  This partner of the Russian Federation in the Eurasian Union offers a choice of a wide and high-quality assortment of these products.
