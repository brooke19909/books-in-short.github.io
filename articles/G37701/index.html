Here you can sunbathe under the hot sun for days on end or visit ethnological and historical excursions, go swimming or hiking, watch the wildlife, or enjoy the beauty of nature. </p><p>  Sights of Indonesia, which we want to talk about in our article, will be interesting to everyone who is partial to the culture and history of this country.  Further we will focus on the following objects: </p><ul><li>  Monkey Forest </li><li>  Attractions of the island of Batam. </li><li>  Taman Mini. </li><li>  Prambanan </li><li>  Botanical Garden. </li><li>  Safari Park. </li><li>  Komodo and Bali islands. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of indonesia" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22797/844286.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><h2>  Monkey forest </h2><p>  Ubud, located in the central part of Bali, can not be called an ordinary resort.  This ancient city is rightfully considered the center of ancient crafts and national culture.  A jewelry gallery, a wood carving center and a batik gallery preserve and cultivate crafts that Indonesia is proud of.  Ubud, whose attractions are not limited to artistic crafts, is known throughout the country thanks to the Monkey Forest reserve. </p><p>  In this small park there lives a company of rather wayward and spoiled by the attention of monkeys.  Employees of the reserve recommend that tourists carefully monitor their belongings and jewelry, as arrogant animals are accustomed to appropriate the property of gaping travelers. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Walking along the concrete paths, you can stumble upon the current "temple of the dead", which the local population considers a source of evil and mystical power.  Also in the park there are many beautiful and outlandish plants.  They will certainly interest connoisseurs of local flora. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Attractions Bahamas Indonesia" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22797/844316.jpg" width="491"></div>

    <h2>  Attractions Batam Island (Indonesia) </h2><p>  Until the end of the last century, this part of the country was a small piece of land on which poor fishing villages huddled.  Since the island received the status of a free trade zone, its affairs quickly went uphill.  Now a modern airport is located here, developed infrastructure and many hotels have appeared. </p><p>  Speaking about the sights of Indonesia, one can not help but mention the Barelang bridges, which connect several neighboring islands.  By the way, they got their name from the first syllables of the names of these same islands: Batam, Rempang and Galang.  The total length of these structures is two kilometers, and each of the six bridges received the name of one of the local rulers who lived here in the 15-17 centuries. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Indonesia Jakarta. attractions" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22797/844290.jpg" width="595"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Indonesia.  Jakarta </h2><p>  The attractions of this bustling city are very diverse and attract thousands of tourists and locals every day.  All of them allow you to feel the atmosphere of Jakarta and immerse yourself in it with your head.  First of all, experts recommend visiting the ethnographic park "Taman Mini", which recreates miniature Indonesia over a vast territory.  Here you will find 27 pavilions, each of which tells about one of the provinces and shows visitors <span>objects of national life.</span>  If you go to the dream park in Anchol, you can visit the art market and buy batik, leather goods, souvenirs from wood and bone, as well as the work of local artists.  Jakarta is known for its many museums that introduce its visitors to the history of the country and its cultural heritage. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of indonesia. list" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22797/844288.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Prambanan </h2><p>  If you manage to visit the exotic and mysterious <span>island of Java,</span> then be sure to visit the famous temple complex.  All the sights of Indonesia of the Middle Ages are distinguished by beauty and grace, however Prambanan is called the pearl of this country.  Most of the temple buildings, unfortunately, are in ruins.  Currently, tourists are shown the spiers of Hindu and Buddhist shrines, which were restored at the beginning of the 20th century by Dutch scientists.  The central part of the complex is considered to be three temples, which locals call ‚ÄúLara Jongrang‚Äù, which can be translated as ‚Äúslender virgin‚Äù.  All of them are decorated with beautiful paintings on the theme of the ancient Indian epic "Ramayana" on a stone relief.  Then you can explore the smaller temples and hear from the guide a romantic story that describes the origin of this place. </p>

    <h2>  Bali Botanical Garden </h2><p>  Tourists and local residents come to the central part of the island who are not indifferent to the beauties of nature.  The Botanical Garden of Eka Kariya has collected on its lands the famous and rare plants that Indonesia is famous for.  Bali, whose attractions are widely known throughout the world, is proud of its national park.  No wonder the garden is considered a family recreation area, where the local population comes to rest for the whole day.  In addition, there is a serious center for the study and conservation of plants, conducting extensive educational activities.  <span>The national park</span> differs from its own kind in that tourists can also get a good dose of adrenaline.  The fact is that on the territory of the botanical garden there is an adventure park Bali-Tritop, which has cable cars, bungees, suspension bridges and much more.  You can choose a track of any degree of difficulty and experience a lot of vivid sensations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ubud indonesia. attractions" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22797/844279.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Komodo dragons </h2><p>  Sights of Indonesia, the description of which can be met everywhere, most often relate to the famous <span>island of Bali.</span>  However, as part of this large state there are many small islands that are famous for their unique flora and fauna.  Among others, Komodo, which is part of the National Environmental Park and is protected by UNESCO, can be distinguished.  It is here that you can see the descendants of prehistoric lizards, often called "dragons from the island of Komodo."  Interestingly, locals still venerate amazing lizards and believe in their magical origin.  They feed predators, thereby ensuring their safety and the safety of tourists.  Animals, in turn, feel excellent, they are not at all wary of human society.  Travelers come here to see how the lizards hunt or, what seems even more interesting to them, find out the relationship with each other. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of indonesia. description" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22797/844299.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Bali Safari Park and Marine Park </h2><p>  Sights of Indonesia include many natural and marine monuments.  In 2007, the island of Bali was enriched by another theme park, which quickly gained popularity and became one of the most visited.  About 80 species and approximately 400 animals live in safari and marine parks under conditions that are very close to natural.  Here you can visit free animal shows, watch elephants swimming, and also performances of the Balinese tiger.  For children, their own amusement park is open here, where they can ride a traditional carousel, ride <span>toy cars</span> on a moving tape, visit an octopus ride, ride a water slide in a water park and experience the coolness of a roller coaster.  In the national village located in the park, you can learn real Balinese dances, and watch a dance show on the weekend.  At the very end of the tour, you can explore the natural attractions of Indonesia, enjoying an elephant safari, taking a bus or taking a ride on a traditional park tram. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  We tried to tell you everything about the main attractions of Indonesia.  The list of these amazing places can be continued for a very long time: Bali-Barat, Batubulan, Borobudur and so on.  However, it is impossible to describe in one article all temple complexes, national parks, beautiful lakes and wild jungles.  On each of the six thousand inhabited islands of Indonesia, you can find for yourself something interesting and attractive.  Therefore, experienced tourists recommend making a plan before the trip and visiting the most interesting sights of Indonesia. </p>
