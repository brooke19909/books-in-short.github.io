Many travelers come to these parts to enjoy the amazing nature and remoteness from civilization.  Literally driving out of town for a couple of kilometers, you can see not only the bay, but also the Barents Sea, which washes the rocky and dark coast of the region. </p><p>  From the window of almost all rooms of the hotel you can see the port, which smoothly passes into the bay.  There is also a walk, because the building is located in a busy place in which the infrastructure is constantly developing.  The address of the "Azimuth Hotel Murmansk": Lenin Avenue, 82. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="68.971194" data-lng="33.07661899999994" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="15"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/1/4/6/6/11466.png"></div><p>  The object was formerly an administrative building.
