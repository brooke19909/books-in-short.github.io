Ancient forts and structures erected during the colonial era, which Cartagena is famous for, reverently preserve the ancient history, and numerous local monuments are protected by UNESCO. </p><h2>  The history of the ancient city </h2><p>  After excavations carried out by archaeological expeditions, it was found that the first people in the Colombian city appeared before our era.  The ancient <span>Indian tribes</span> tried for a long time to restrain the colonization of land by Europeans, until they retreated in front of the Spanish detachment that landed in 1533 in search of treasures. </p>

    <p>  It is believed that it was then that Cartagena was founded.  Colombia is proud to have preserved its national and cultural dignity with a unique atmosphere.  And he got his name from the Spanish settlement, from where the conquerors arrived. </p><h2>  Place of export of treasures to Europe </h2><p>  Through the city, which became the main port in the <span>Caribbean Sea,</span> looted innumerable treasures were exported to Europe, and Britain really wanted to take such a tidbit. </p><p>  It is not surprising that all the famous pirates were engaged in robbery in this place.  Researchers studying the ancient history of the city know that the proud Cartagena was subjected to at least 5 times brutal attacks.  Colombia shuddered when, in the 16th century, the English pirate <span>Francis Drake,</span> who did not know compassion, burned the main cathedral of the city and held the local population hostage for 3 months, later receiving an ransom that was unbelievable at the time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The defense, independence and decline of Cartagena </h2><p>  Concerned with this situation, the Spaniards think about the defense of the city, and soon a huge and powerful fortification system is being built around Cartagena, the forts of which are still the main local attraction. </p>

    <p>  In the XVIII century, a new British attack on the port took place, and only thanks to the competently erected 11-kilometer fences survived the heavy and long siege of Cartagena.  Colombia in the 19th century fought a lot and spent time negotiating, and the declaration of independence by the city caused a new round of pressure on the courageous port, only from the Spanish side. </p><p>  The year 1821 marks the beginning of the decline of Cartagena: hostilities, sieges, famines and epidemics lead to the loss of trade ties and the complete destruction of the heroic city. </p><h2>  The long-awaited revival </h2><p>  At the beginning of the 20th century, the long-awaited revival takes place: black gold deposits are found in the country, and the construction of an oil refinery in Cartagena begins, after which the pearl of the Caribbean Sea is actively developing.  Now the city, actively engaged in trade and industry, is becoming a tourist mecca for many travelers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cartagena Attractions" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1123879.jpg" width="600"></div>

And everyone who prefers a carefree vacation under the bright sun will be surprised by truly luxurious beaches, the largest and most equipped of which is Bocagrande.
