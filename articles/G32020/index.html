This resort is located on the Black Sea.  It combines a picturesque sea coast, ancient architecture and mountains. </p><p>  Sights of New Athos are of historical and cultural value, which attracts tourists from all over the world.  Everyone here can find something interesting for themselves. </p><h2>  Architecture </h2><div class="photo" data-original="rosskurort.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="new Athos architecture" class="if uuid-2463417" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10393/2463417.jpg"></div><p>  Let's dwell on this in more detail.  What is so remarkable about New Athos?  Abkhazia is a country with a rich history.  This could not but affect the architectural image of the city.  There are unique buildings that have been preserved here since ancient times.  Some of them were almost completely destroyed and rebuilt from scratch.  Restorers managed to keep them almost intact. </p><p>  In the annals, the first mention of these places dates back to the III century.  The city at that time was characterized by a developed trade infrastructure.  It was here that the largest port on the Black Sea coast was located.  Excavation results confirm that the culture of the locals was well developed.  Somewhere in the V century, the Iverian fortress was built on the side of the mountain. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A couple of centuries later, a wall appeared here, which was supposed to protect the fortress from the invaders.  At different times, the city was owned by Turks, Genoese, Byzantines.  This period had a great influence on the architectural image of the city.  At one time, the city belonged to the Russians.  During this time, a magnificent monastery and chic gardens appeared here.  They were created by the monks who came here from the shores of Greece. </p><p>  What to see in New Athos?  Monuments here are mainly represented by numerous religious buildings.  Next, we will consider the most interesting and beautiful of them. </p><h2>  New Athos Monastery </h2><div class="photo" data-original="russinfo.center" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="New Athos Monastery" class="if uuid-2462961" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2462961.jpg"></div><p>  What is its feature?  This is the most famous attraction of New Athos.  The temple complex includes Panteleimon Cathedral.  This is the largest temple in the whole country.  Tourists are attracted by the beauty and significance of the structure.  Thousands of pilgrims come here every year.  The building itself is beautiful and large-scale.  Bright walls and brilliant domes surrounded by green cypress forests look very solemn.  Tourists from all over the world come to admire the beauty and grandeur of the temple.  Entrance to the monastery is free, the main thing is to follow the rules of conduct on the territory of religious buildings. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Anacopian Fortress </h2><p>  How does it attract tourists?  Another interesting attraction of New Athos is Anakopia fortress.  This is the largest defensive structure of the city, preserved to this day.  It was reconstructed, but it was not possible to completely restore it.  This does not spoil the view at all, but even gives the fortress sophistication and attractiveness.  Ruins help create an atmosphere of antiquity.  You seem to be transported to the era of the founding of the city.  It is from here that the history of the New Athos began.  The fortress attracts tourists not only for its historical value.  Here is the famous well in which water never ends.  In ancient times, the watchtower also served as an observation point.  It was from here that one could see the whole city, starting from the center and ending with the surroundings.  Today, an observation deck is organized here. </p><h2>  Grotto of St. Simon the Canonite </h2><div class="photo" data-original="kurortyumorya.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Grotto of St. Simon the Canonite" class="if uuid-2463388" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10393/2463388.jpg"></div><p>  What can be said about him?  Another attraction of the city of New Athos is the cave of Simon Canonite.  Walls are cut down in the gorge, they depict the faces of saints and other ritual images. </p><p>  Nearby is one of the most important religious monuments.  The temple is a stately strict building of white stone.  They named him after a saint who could heal people.  Unfortunately, many unique murals could not be restored.  Currently, services are held in it, religious rites, baptisms and services. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Drandsky Monastery </h2><p>  What other attractions of New Athos are worth seeing?  <span>Of course, this is the</span> Dranda Temple of the Assumption of the Mother of God.  Local residents use it for services, rituals and services.  The cathedral attracts tourists due to its unusual architecture.  The building has the shape of a polyhedron.  It has interesting pentahedral protrusions.  The walls are made of red brick and plastered.  The building as a whole looks rather unusual, but at the same time restrained and modest. </p><h2>  Museums and sculptures </h2><p>  From the point of view of tourists, institutions with antique exhibits are no less interesting.  What are they?  Not far from the New Athos Falls is the Museum of Local Lore.  Here is a large collection of ancient archaeological finds that reflect the ancient life of the local population.  Tourists may also be interested in a large collection of ancient weapons, presented at a permanent exhibition. </p><p>  At the entrance to the famous New Athos cave, tourists are greeted by the Golden Fleece sculpture.  This attraction gained great popularity thanks to the worldwide celebrity of this myth.  To look at her, here come lovers of history and legends from around the world. </p><p>  Very popular is the sculpture "Eagle tormenting a snake."  Previously, it was located near the Navafon Falls.  Now she was transferred to a park near a pond with black swans. </p><p>  The sculpture ‚ÄúMermaid‚Äù is interesting because it is hidden by the jets of a waterfall.  It will be quite difficult to see it in its entirety. </p><h2>  A few words about nature </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="New Athos Waterfall" class="if uuid-2462955" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2462955.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to architectural and cultural values, the natural attractions of New Athos have gained great popularity.  They must be included in the tourist route.  Without a doubt, it is worth a visit to Iverskaya Mountain.  Anacopian fortress is located on its top.  Here you can find the entrance to the New Athos cave.  For tourists, this is one of the most remarkable natural attractions of Abkhazia.  You can climb to the top both on foot and on horseback.  A stunning panorama of the Black Sea coast opens from above. </p><p>  On <span>Iverskaya Mountain</span> there is also a huge cave with a length of almost 2 km.  Its huge grottoes with bizarre stalactites and underground galleries are simply amazing.  How to get here if you are going to New Athos?  Cave tours are held regularly.  There is even a special train that you can take a look at. </p><p>  Another amazing natural attraction awaits you near the temple of St. Simon Canonite.  New Athos waterfall is one of the best natural monuments.  However, it is worth noting that the dam was created by human hands.  It was built by the monks of the monastery to use water from the floodplain of the river.  Due to the lack of outflow, it swamped.  After the construction of this dam, New Athos Falls became one of the most interesting places in Abkhazia. </p><p>  For walks with children, the Psyrikhinsky Reserve is excellent.  Here you can simply walk and enjoy the beauty of nature and fresh air. </p><h2>  Other interesting sights </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the nature of the new Athos" class="if uuid-2462946" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2462946.jpg"></div><p>  What else is interesting in New Athos?  There are several unique places that are definitely worth a visit if you are planning a vacation in Abkhazia. </p><p>  Here is some of them: </p><ol><li>  Stalin's dacha: in New Athos there was a personal plot of the leader.

Ponds and the park are famous for their unique black swans. </li><li>  Embankment of New Athos: reviews of vacationers confirm that this is one of the best walking areas on the Black Sea coast.
