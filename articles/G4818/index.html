The enormous wealth and generosity of the soul of this man mysteriously coincided with the heyday of the arts in Russia at the end of the 19th century.  Many artists and writers of that time owed him fame, he was a friend of Gorky and Chaliapin, he knew Vrubel closely and patronized Stanislavsky.  His death marked the end of a small era that could rightly bear his name. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="biography of Savva Morozov" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1042920.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Biography of Savva Morozov </h2><p>  The future patron of the arts, a millionaire and philanthropist was born in 1862 in a family of hereditary Russian merchants.  He received his primary education at the fourth Moscow gymnasium, after which he was enrolled in a mathematical course at Moscow University.  He was acquainted with <span>Vasily Klyuchevsky,</span> attended his lectures, and after receiving his education, like many other wealthy people, he went to Europe. </p><h2>  Cambridge </h2><p>  Having visited England, Savva Timofeevich Morozov decides to continue his education at Cambridge, one of the oldest English universities.  After completing the course, he receives a diploma in chemistry and prepares a dissertation on the subject of textile business.  Weaving laid the foundation for the wealth of the British Empire, so it is not surprising that upon arrival in his native Fatherland, Savva Morozov pays special attention to the development of weaving manufactories. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Morozov Savva Timofeevich" class="if" height="289" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1042933.jpg" width="227"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  First steps </h2><p>  According to the official biography of Savva Morozov, the educational period in his life ends in 1886.  Having received the news of his father‚Äôs illness, he returns home and becomes the head of the family empire.  Already at that time, Morozov Savva Timofeevich became known among industrialists and traders as the head of the Partnership of the Nikolsky manufactory.  Here he applied his knowledge gained abroad: his work concerned not only production efficiency, but also the raising of the social standards of his own workers.  At his enterprises, working conditions are changing - work is paid better, labor is becoming more efficient and safe.  Morozov paid attention to the living conditions of workers.  At his enterprises, medical assistance to employees was considered exemplary, and the number of accidents in the manufactory was minimized.  The conditions for cultural recreation are being created - an amusement park, several libraries and a theater.  Even the aged employees could count on Morozov's care - with him several almshouses were arranged, in which old people could peacefully end their days. </p><h2>  Zinaida Morozova </h2><p>  Such a well-known and wealthy man as Morozov could choose any beauty at the bride's fair.  The lack of title and merchant origin was more than replaced by enormous wealth.  Morozov received a salary fifty times higher than that of the most famous minister Alexander III, the omnipotent Witte.  Despite many proposals, Morozov made his own choice. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="love of savva morozov" class="if" height="262" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1042936.jpg" width="200"></div>  <span>The biography of Savva Morozov is</span> silent where and when the young industrialist met one of the famous beauties of that time - Zinaida Zimina.  By the beginning of their acquaintance, the husband started a divorce proceedings against his wife and in the end left her with nothing.  Nevertheless, the love of Savva Morozov was stronger than gossip.  He neglected conventions and married a divorced woman, who had previously been the wife of one of his relatives.  Such a choice was a severe blow to his mother.  But Savva Morozov, both in work and in life, acted without looking back.

The mansion of Savva Morozov was built according to the design of Fedor Shekhtel.  The appearance of the building repeats all the trends of the Neo-Gothic style, which was very popular at the end of the 19th century.  The interior of the house was striking in its contrast - among the luxurious rooms intended for the wife, Savva Morozov arranged for himself a simple and convenient study, in which he preferred to spend all his time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Savva Morozov's mansion" class="if" height="434" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1042944.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Zinaida Morozova was an arrogant and conceited beauty, who adored a luxurious life.  Both capitals fumbled about her jewelry and toilets.  Once Morozova appeared at the ball in a dress, the train of which was longer than that of the empress.  This circumstance caused a scandal in <span>secular society.</span>  The naughty temper of the young wife was manifested in various trifles, often leading to scandals. </p><h2>  Cooling the senses </h2><p>  Pretty quickly, Savva Morozov‚Äôs great love turned into disappointment in his wife and his own environment.  Despite the fact that Zinaida gave him four children and insisted on continuing their life together, the couple were less and less seen together.  The biography of Savva Morozov does not allow us to judge whether a certain woman was the reason for the cooling of feelings, or whether the disappointment in the wife was just the fault, but the reality turned out to be very prosaic.  He quickly became disillusioned with family life and tried to visit his wife‚Äôs social events as little as possible, leaving more and more strength to leave work.  The theater enters his life as an outlet for the hypocritical secular splendor that he often observed at home.  Unfortunately, the children of Savva Morozov inherited only a small fraction of the exceptional qualities of their father. </p>

    <h2>  Art theater </h2><p>  Savva Timofeevich brought the idea to build his own theater from England.  In Kamergersky Lane there was a place for the future Art Theater, to which Morozov gave all his strength.  He not only built this institution from scratch, but also directly participated in the construction.  More than three hundred thousand rubles were spent on the construction of the new building - huge money for those times.  The new theater focuses more on the auditorium and stage.  The new hall accommodated one thousand three hundred spectators, and even eminent Petersburg critics admired the interior. </p>

Ten years after the opening of the theater, a commemorative sign was issued, which depicted people who had invested their money and their talent in the existence of the theater.  These are Stanislavsky, Nemirovich-Danchenko and Morozov.

    <h2>  Support for revolutionary activities </h2><p>  At this time, Savva Morozov draws closer to the representatives of the Bolshevik party and finances some issues of the Iskra newspaper.  At his expense, congresses of the RSDLP are financed, various meetings and educational events are held.  Savva Morozov's mother was seriously afraid that her son was dragged into the millstones of the revolutionary movement, and thanks to her connections she was able to remove him from office.  Under the pretext of treating depression, Savva Morozov leaves Russia and leaves for treatment in France.  The riviera was the last refuge of the Russian patron and industrialist.  In May 1905, Savva Morozov shot himself. </p><h2>  Questions </h2><p>  The biography of Savva Morozov left many questions to which there are still no definite answers.  Why did Morozov give money to revolutionary figures, why did he support actors and writers, what did he see the point of his activity?  Perhaps in the near future, researchers of the life path of Savva Morozov will be able to find answers to these and other questions. </p>
