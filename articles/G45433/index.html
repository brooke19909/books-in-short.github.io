How to knit picks</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It is no longer summer outside, and the cold season only inspires you to create something warm and cozy, namely a knitted headdress.  Beret is an ideal accessory in order to provide your head with warmth in bad weather, to hide your hair if it is not properly laid, or simply add something special to the image. </p><h2>  Where did the beret come from? </h2><p>  Beret is a national French headpiece that is usually made of wool or felt.  Such an accessory is the subject of admiration for many fashion designers and designers, because to this day it remains a classic, stylish and versatile headpiece.  Often it can be seen on the style icons. </p><p>  The history of art tells that hats similar to modern berets were worn in the Bronze Age.  At first they began to be worn in Northern Europe, and later berets became widespread in the south.  In a state like Ancient Crete, they were worn by the Minoans - local peasants.  He also served as a headdress for the Romans and Etruscans - the mysterious people who inhabited Italy.  Beret was especially popular among European artists throughout the history of mankind. </p><p>  The Basque National Beret was the traditional headdress of shepherds from the Valley of the Pyrenees (a mountain range that divides southern France from northern Spain).  The industrial production of Basque berets began in the 17th century in Oloron-Sainte-Marie, in the south of France, the first factory - Beatex-Laulhere.  From 1810 to 1920, berets were intended exclusively for the working class, and by 1928, more than 20 French factories and some Spanish and Italian manufacturers produced millions of berets for everyone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the western fashion since 1920, men and women wore berets as part of their sports uniforms, and then as a stylish headdress.  Military berets were first adopted by the French rangers of the Alps in 1889.  Seeing berets on the military during the First World War, the British general Hugh Ellis suggested using beret as a necessary headdress for soldiers. </p><h2>  How to wear a beret? </h2><p>  A beret can be worn in different ways, but this does not prevent it from being probably the most elegant headdress that has won the love of many.  In North and South America, berets were usually worn by pulling one side of the head.  In Central and South America, the local custom is the manner of wearing a beret so that it lies in the shape of a square and is pulled over the front of the head.  It can be worn by both men and women. </p><p>  Military berets were made of wool.  They were usually with a cord that allowed you to tighten the headgear.  Berets were often adorned with metal or fabric items. </p><h2>  Knitted beret </h2><p>  When it is snowing or raining outside, I want to hide under something warm, and first of all I need to cover my head.  And what can warm your head better than a warm hat?  Of course, store shelves are full of a wide selection of hats.  But why buy them, when you can tie!  Knitwear is very beautiful, and most importantly - profitable.  After all, you can tie it exactly as you want. <br>  To tie a hat is corny.  And to look like a true lady, tie a beret.  The plus is that it takes fit very quickly.  Its thickness is sufficient to provide warmth and comfort.
