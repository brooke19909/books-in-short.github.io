    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  This hotel is located in a quiet place called Pefka, on the beach.  As you know, the island of Rhodes is washed by two seas: the Mediterranean and the Aegean.  Pefka is located on the shores of the Aegean Sea.  The distance to the nearest village of Lardos is one and a half kilometers.  From the resort town of Lindos, which has a lot of shops, bars, restaurants and various entertainment, the Montemar Beach Hotel is six kilometers away.  The island‚Äôs main city, Rhodes, is 55 kilometers away.  The air harbor is sixty kilometers from the hotel.  Thus, after arriving at the airport, the journey to the hotel will take you about an hour.  You are unlikely to be bored on the road, as magnificent landscapes will open from the windows of the bus or car.  As for the distance to the sea, the hotel complex consists of two parts: one of them is located across the road from the beach, and the other is only a couple of hundred meters from the water's edge.  So the path to the beach will take several minutes. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Montemar Beach Resort 3 *: traveler reviews </h2><p>  Since for many tourists a very important factor when choosing this or that hotel is the comments of people who have already stayed here, we decided to give generalized reviews of our compatriots about this hotel complex.  First of all, we can say with confidence that many travelers were satisfied with their vacation both in Rhodes in general and in Montemar Beach Resort in particular.  But we offer to understand everything in more detail. </p><p>  As for the rooms, there were no complaints about the cleanliness, decor and operation of the equipment.  Despite the fact that the hotel is three-star, the rooms are quite spacious, the atmosphere is cozy and pleasant, and the bath has a supply of toiletries, which is constantly replenished by maids.  The only thing that confused some tourists who got rooms on the upper floors was a slight interruption in water.  But this phenomenon turned out to be temporary.  In addition, the hotel administration in case of a complaint always tries to move guests to a more suitable room. </p><p>  A lot of positive reviews relate to infrastructure and entertainment for children.  So, the Russians who came to rest with their families were very pleased with the presence of water slides, paddling pools, a mini club, playgrounds and children's animation. </p><p>  As for nutrition, no complaints were expressed with the quality and variety of food.  So, our compatriots claim that the menu here is more than good for the level of a three-star hotel. </p><p>  Tourists really liked the hotel's beach.  Despite the fact that when entering the water there is a large pebble, it is quite possible to do without special shoes.  As for the sea, literally everyone was delighted with it. </p><p>  In general, our compatriots were satisfied with the animation program, especially the daily one.  So, many liked the work of local animators who gently entertained holidaymakers, inviting them to take part in gymnastics, yoga, dancing, competitions and funny games.  The evening shows seemed good to tourists, but they did not cause enthusiastic enthusiasm. </p><p>  Summing up, we can say that according to our compatriots, this hotel is a very good budget option for a vacation, especially if you are going on vacation with children. </p>
