The most interesting of them, without a doubt, can be called the Nokia Lumia 630. Expert reviews indicate that this is the first model in the world equipped with two SIM cards and running on the mentioned operating system. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 630" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/527332.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  general description </h2><p>  The phone belongs to the so-called ‚Äústate employees‚Äù, it has a well-thought-out and simple design typical for devices from this manufacturer.  The appearance of the model is somewhat similar to its predecessors, however, rounded corners appeared here.  The smartphone measures 129.5x66.7x9.2 millimeters, while its weight is 134 grams.  The Nokia 630 is available in black, white, bright green, orange and yellow.  Its back cover is made of matte polycarbonate, slightly rough to the touch.  In addition to the lens hole, you can see the grill of the music speaker on it.  The model does not have a <span>front camera, a</span> direct button for taking pictures, and a flash.  The main system keys, unlike previous versions, are not located on a separate panel, but on the screen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the right edge there is a volume control, as well as a button for turning on and locking, which is painted in the color of the rear panel.  As for the left rib, it is empty.  At the top end you can find a hole for connecting a headset, and at the bottom - microUSB port.  Users do not really like the feature of the device, which consists in the fact that in order to access SIM cards and an additional memory slot, it is necessary to remove the battery. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia lumia 630 reviews" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/527333.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Ergonomics and build quality </h2><p>  The removable cover of the device closes tightly and does not make any unpleasant sounds with squeaks.  Build quality is also at a high level.  There are no complaints about the ergonomics of the Nokia Lumia 630. The reviews of its owners suggest that, thanks to its small size, it‚Äôs comfortable to control the smartphone with even one hand.  Moreover, the phone fits comfortably into it and does not slip out even with a long conversation. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The display size is 4.5 inches.  It works with a resolution of 854x480 pixels.  It should be noted that such a modest indicator, as a rule, is characteristic only for <span>cheap smartphones</span> running on the Android operating system.  Through the use of proprietary ClearBlack technology, black color is clearly visible at different viewing angles, even when exposed to direct sunlight.  The Nokia 630 smartphone does not have <span>a light sensor,</span> so the user will have to manually adjust the brightness level - high, medium and low. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia lumia 630" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/527336.jpg" width="580"></div>

This was the result of the MultiTouch Test program.  The upper part of the screen turns off its backlight when you touch it (for example, with your ear), which saves battery life.  The surface of the screen is protected from shock thanks to <span>Gorilla Glass</span> 3. The manufacturer did not provide a good oleophobic coating for the Nokia 630 smartphone. User reviews indicate the abundance of fingerprints that remain on the display. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The model is equipped with a 5 megapixel camera with auto focus, but without a flash.  Its focal length is 28 millimeters.  Through the use of digital zoom, the image can be enlarged four times.  Pictures are created with a maximum resolution of 1456x2592 pixels.  The lack of a front camera does not affect the rating of the model in the best way.  Video recording is performed at a speed of 30 frames per second in HD format. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 630 reviews" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/527335.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Camera launch in Nokia Lumia 630 can be done using two separate applications.  Operating modes can be selected for each of them in the settings.  The same goes for ISO, white balance, exposure number, image format, and so on.  Among other things, the user has the ability to download convenient for him applications related to the camera through the "Store". </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The device is based on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 platform with four cores.  The smartphone operates at a frequency of 1.2 GHz, while the <span>Adreno 305</span> coprocessor is used for graphic operations <span>.</span> The RAM capacity, which is 512 megabytes, is quite enough to work with the Windows Phone 8.1 operating system.  At the same time, the device cannot pull many games that are now popular.  As for the built-in memory, its volume in the Nokia 630 phone is 8 GB.  At the same time, one cannot fail to note the fact that the user has less than half of this volume at his disposal, since all the rest is reserved for system resources.  However, if you wish, you can purchase a removable memory card (the device supports media up to 128 GB). </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The modification uses a removable lithium-ion battery of 1830 mAh type.  According to representatives of the manufacturer, such a capacity should be enough for a maximum of 16 hours of telephone calls.  In reality, as practice shows, with moderate use of the device, the user can safely count on a whole day using the phone.  The Nokia 630 smartphone fully charges in just a few hours.  The current state of the device can be viewed in the menu item "Battery Saver".  At the same time, the ‚ÄúUse‚Äù tab provides information about programs and applications that consume the most electricity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone nokia 630" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/527337.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sound </h2><p>  There can be no serious complaints about the maximum volume of the phone.  Quite a good quality differs and the sound that is played through the headphones.  Along with this, attention should be paid to the fact that they are not included in the standard equipment of the device.  You will not be able to immediately listen to the radio, since the role of the antenna is played by the headphones. </p><h2>  Dual card version </h2><p>  As noted above, one of the main features of the new product was its modification, which supports the work with two SIM cards.  It is called Nokia 630 Dual Sim.  It should be noted that each of the two starter packs of mobile operators used separately in the device is assigned tiles with lists of calls and SMS ‚Äî respectively, ‚ÄúPhone‚Äù and ‚ÄúMessages‚Äù, which cannot be said about many other similar modifications.  The presence of a second SIM card has absolutely no effect on the autonomous operation of the model, since an additional radio module is not provided.  Therefore, the user cannot talk simultaneously on his two starting packages. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 630 dual sim" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/527334.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  To summarize, it should be emphasized that the main advantages of Nokia 630 smartphones have become quite attractive and stylish appearance, the use of the latest version of the modern operating system, relatively low cost, and, of course, the modification with two SIM cards.  Anyway, there are a lot of shortcomings here.  In this case, we are talking about a low resolution display, the lack of a front camera with a light sensor and automatic flash, as well as a very modest size of RAM.  From all this, the conclusion suggests itself that the representatives of the manufacturer decided to save on the ‚Äústate employee‚Äù.  As for the cost of the device, the recommended price that will have to be paid for the option with one SIM card is 7990 rubles, while for the model with two mobile operators - 8490 rubles. </p>
