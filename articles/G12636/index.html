    <p>  Sunny Beach is a place where many people come with children.  For little travelers, all conditions are created here: a gentle entrance to the water, numerous playgrounds, pools.  Since 2003, an upscale water park has been operating here. </p><p>  Another advantage characteristic of this <span>Bulgarian coast</span> is that all its hotels are built right by the sea, so there is no need to go to the beach for a long time.  Sunny Beach is also great for young people.  She is attracted to modern night clubs and discos.  The whole season, the "golden" youth are "hanging out" here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotels </h2>

The best hotels in this north of the Bulgarian Riviera not only offer comfortable rooms, quality services, but also have fairly affordable prices.  It‚Äôs not easy to navigate in such a variety on your own, so many people prefer to use the reviews of those lucky ones who have already been here.

    <h2>  Prices </h2><p>  Bulgaria has always been considered a fairly inexpensive place to stay, although today for some reason many people prefer Turkey.  There is no resort chaos, such as, for example, in Antalya or Alanya, while nature, beaches, and service in most hotels can give odds to many other countries with no less developed tourist infrastructure.  And the confirmation is Sunny Beach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chaika beach reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/578179.jpg" width="600"></div>

For example, for a night in a three-star hotel you can pay only 30 euros, which is very inexpensive, considering the cost of an average European hostel. </p><p>  As for tour operators who offer to visit Sunny Beach, they can get a ticket for seven days in a 4 * hotel with full board for two for forty thousand rubles. </p><p>  The trend of many European resorts - aparthotels - is perfect for families or for large companies.  <span>Sunny Beach</span> offers a large selection.  It is not difficult to remove them, since there are many offers.  And therefore, it affects their price level, which is very attractive.  For example, fifty euros costs an average studio at Sunny Beach Aparthotel. </p><h2>  Chaika resort </h2>

    <p>  Many vacationers admit that they chose the Chaika Beach hotel because it is located very close to the sea.  They really liked the design, which decorated the reception, halls and some corridors made in the antique style with numerous mirrors. </p><p>  The location of the hotel was chosen very well: there are many entertainment venues nearby.  A lot of positive reviews about nutrition.  The menu has a lot of fruits, delicious salads, chicken and meat dishes. </p><p>  The rooms are equipped with everything you need.  The hotel has two excellent restaurants.  The territory, although small, but green.  There are two open, always clean pools, which have many free sunbeds and umbrellas.  The Arkadia building has a SPA center.  Some vacationers express dissatisfaction with the fact that on the beach the necessary equipment - trestle beds and mattresses - are issued for a fee. </p><p>  There are some tourists who in their reviews note a somewhat ‚Äúsluggish‚Äù service, especially on the days of settlement of large groups.  In general, the work of the staff did not impress very many.  Some did not like the quality of room cleaning, while others did not like the frequency with which bedding or towels changed. </p><p>  Nevertheless, the vast majority of travelers were satisfied with their stay and hope to return here again.  Chaika Beach Hotel can be recommended to all categories of vacationers. </p>
