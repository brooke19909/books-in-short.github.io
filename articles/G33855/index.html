Demolition of five-story buildings in 2015</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A few decades ago, five-story buildings were considered comfortable housing with all the amenities that they could afford in Soviet times.  They began to be built in the 50s of the XX century according to standards that fully meet the needs of a person of that era.  But in modern conditions, the standards of quality housing are completely different. </p><p>  For the first time, they began talking about the possibility of demolition of dilapidated (mostly five-story) housing in the late 90s.  Then it was decided on the need to replace them with modern <span>residential complexes</span> by 2010.  The implementation of the <span>five-story building demolition</span> program <span>in Moscow</span> was entrusted to the Department of Urban Development Policy.  The site of this organization has a map of Moscow on which five-story buildings to be demolished are marked.  The map is systematically updated, which makes it possible to see which buildings have already been demolished and which have not. </p>

    <h2>  Why did the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãdemolishing old houses become relevant? </h2><p>  Firstly, people have become larger than they were then.  And now tiny kitchens and corridors, small combined bathrooms can create inconvenience, cause discomfort and a feeling of dissatisfaction.  Secondly, people's ideas about high-grade housing have changed.  Thirdly, against the background of modern buildings, the former five-story buildings look morally obsolete.  And most importantly, the life of most of these buildings has long expired.  It was designed for only 25 years, and the real age of many of them is already over 60. Therefore, there has long been a question of replacing them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow demolition of five-story buildings in 2015" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/9143/1951374.jpg" width="600"></div>

Networks do not meet modern energy efficiency requirements and are also seriously old.  This applies not only to electrical, plumbing and sewer systems, but also to supporting structures, supporting elements.  Their wear creates a high risk of accidents. </li><li>  The high cost of major repairs.  In terms of material costs, it is commensurate with the construction of a new house with a large number of amenities.  If its implementation is deemed appropriate, then the life of dilapidated buildings can be increased to 150 years. </li><li>  The small size of the apartments and the lack of amenities, including high sound permeability.  The convenience factor may not be so important for older residents, but it is of considerable importance for young families.  In new buildings, apartments are more comfortable for living. </li><li>  Ugly appearance.  The old five-story buildings have long gone out of fashion and look rather dull and dull, especially against the backdrop of modern buildings. </li><li>  Old houses have narrow balconies and windows, thin walls and other common shortcomings that modern buildings do not have. </li><li>  Demolition of Khrushchev will allow to modernize the transport network and make it more convenient. </li></ul><h2>  Why do not everyone welcome the demolition of five-story buildings? </h2><p>  Although most support the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãrelocating to new housing estates, there are those who wish to stay in their former apartment.  For many, a change of residence may mean an increase in transportation costs, the need to change previous habits, and possibly even a place of work.  Relocation is associated with a lot of negative and older people are especially sensitive to this.  In addition, environmentalists fear that along with the demolition of houses, the trees growing there will be cut down, and this will worsen the environmental situation in the city. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  <span>Five-story demolition</span> program <span>in Moscow:</span> pros and cons </h2><p>  The program was developed by the <span>Moscow city</span> government <span>.</span>  It involves the demolition of over a hundred of the most shabby Khrushchev.  At the site of demolished buildings, modern residential complexes, institutions for children, sports facilities, green areas will be built or created.  Nevertheless, the townspeople express dissatisfaction with this program due to the insufficiency of measures taken.  The actual number of morally and physically obsolete buildings is significantly greater than what is indicated as objects for demolition. </p><h2>  Five-story building demolition program 2015-2020 </h2><p>  A more updated version of the program, designed until 2020, involves the replacement of all old high-rise buildings in poor technical condition.  It is called "Demolition of houses in Moscow 2015-2020."  In accordance with the plan for the demolition of five-story buildings, all obsolete high-rise buildings are divided into 2 main categories: </p><ul><li>  Multi-storey buildings to be demolished. </li><li>  Multi-storey buildings to be preserved. </li></ul><p>  Residents from the first category of buildings are supposed to be relocated to new buildings under construction, the living space of which meets Moscow standards.  The size of the new apartment in square meters corresponds to the size of the previous one.  The same goes for the number of rooms.  Moreover, the price of a new apartment often exceeds the price of the previous one.  This is achieved by attracting funds from city funds. </p>

    <p>  The program for the demolition of five-story buildings involves the replacement of a quarter of the housing stock of the city of Moscow. </p><h2>  What houses does the relocation program not cover? </h2><p>  The most durable buildings will not be demolished.  This is, first of all, structures made of reinforced concrete panels, as well as brick and blocks.  They have a longer service life, strong walls, good thermal insulation.  Most of them were built in the 60-70s of the XX century.  After 40 years of operation, they were only 20 percent worn out. </p>

    <p>  Demolition of five-story buildings of unbearable series can be applied only to those of them that are in the worst technical condition.  The remaining houses from these categories will be repaired.  Some houses are proposed to be completed. </p><h2>  Pros of new buildings </h2><p>  <span>Apartments in new buildings</span> have an improved layout and have more amenities.  They have large halls, three elevators, including two with improved characteristics.  The rooms are well decorated and square.  The first floor is adapted for disabled people.  The eighteenth floor has spacious apartments, adapted for large families. </p>

At the entrance to the house is a specially hired employee. </p><h2>  What will the newcomers receive in return for their former housing? </h2><p>  Residents of two-room apartments will become owners of apartments of a similar size in the new building.  At the same time, the layout in new apartments will be more convenient for residents.  The size of the family does not matter: only the initial living space is important.  However, if the housing was put on the line for redevelopment, the size of the new apartment will be calculated on the basis of 18 square meters per person. </p><p>  If a citizen lived in a communal apartment, then in a new house he will be provided with a separate apartment.  The main rule is the relocation of people to new complexes under construction.  But if you write a statement, you can become the owner of a secondary housing. </p><p>  The law on the demolition of dilapidated buildings does not provide for any financial manipulations, for example, surcharges for the best housing.  This is considered illegal. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Demolition of five-story buildings in Zao" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/9143/1951361.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Progress </h2><p>  The demolition of five-story buildings in Moscow in 2015 began.  Work was carried out simultaneously on 40 buildings.  During the first quarter, 16 buildings were demolished.  During the year, 2,648 families were relocated to new apartments.  In 2016, work began to lag far behind the schedule.  It was supposed to relocate 8,019 families.  Until May 1, 2016, 671 families were to receive new housing.  However, the demolition of five-story buildings in the company affected only 9 of the 35 houses offered for demolition.  In the northwestern district, 8 out of the 12 buildings were demolished. In the northern district, 9 out of 24 planned works were carried out.  In the southern and eastern parts of the capital, the gap was the largest. </p>

    <h2>  The reasons for the lag behind the demolition schedule </h2><p>  The demolition process of dilapidated houses is not carried out in full, which is associated with such reasons as: </p><ul><li>  Change of power in the capital. </li><li>  Deterioration of the economic situation in the country. </li><li>  Protests of retirees. </li><li>  A large number of dissatisfied residents. </li><li>  The complexity of the demolition process and the high cost of such work in areas with dense buildings. </li><li>  Some houses were found suitable for further operation. </li></ul><p>  Thus, the demolition schedule of the five-story buildings was not fully implemented. </p>
