What does this term mean?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  At one <span>time, Spain</span> was one of the most powerful kingdoms in Europe.  The great influence and aggressive policy of her masters would not have been possible without a harmonious internal system of royal power, which in its decisions relied on the influence of two pillars - the strength of the church and secular power.  It was the second branch of power that the Cortes represented. </p><h2>  Authority - Cortes </h2><p>  It is impossible to say exactly where and when the cortes appeared.  It is known that by the middle of the 12th century this word was already used both in colloquial speech and in official documents.  The origin of these organs is associated with the name of the early Spanish kings - Fernando II and Alphonse IX. </p><p>  The Cortes were electoral assemblies similar to Parliament in England and the <span>General States</span> in France.  True, in Spain, this form of self-government arose a little earlier.  In Castile, King Fernando II turned for advice not only to the nobility and the clergy, but also to the wealthy townspeople - caballero.  It was about a marriage between Infanta Berenguela and the son of Frindich Barbarossa Conrad.  <span>The prenuptial agreement</span> between the heirs of the two powerful kingdoms contained many items that required strict execution. </p>

    <h2>  Etymology of the word </h2><p>  Unfortunately, there is no reliable data on what this word means.  Knowing where and when the Cortes appeared in Spain does not clarify the origin of the term.  Most likely, it was borrowed from the Castilian or Aragonese dialect of the Spanish language, and its original roots have been lost for centuries.  In the early Middle Ages, the word often coexisted with the Latin term ‚Äúcuria‚Äù.  Perhaps the answer to the question ‚Äúwhat is the Cortes‚Äù lies precisely in Roman law.  But where and when did the Cortes in Spain arise, and how they were transformed into a state institution, you can answer in more detail.  After all, the Cortes are the prototypes of modern parliaments in all European countries. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Decrees of Alfons IX </h2><p>  Scientists are still arguing about where and when the Cortes appeared in Spain.  But until the end of the 12th century, all the meetings of wealthy citizens and merchants were unsystematic.  In 1188, in Leon, King Alphonse convened wealthy citizens, representatives of the nobility and clergy - the best and most eminent people in Spain.  For what purpose the cortes were created, you can learn from the short chronicles of that time.  These representatives of the three estates swore allegiance to their master.  And the king, in turn, took an oath that he undertakes to remain faithful to the people, to respect the privileges and customs of the country. </p><p>  What are cortes?  Such contractual relations indicate, first of all, that royal power in Spain was not absolute - a simple royal decree on raising funds or mobilizing citizens did not guarantee absolute fulfillment.  And against the background of constant clashes with Muslims, such a threat could cost the kings of freedom and independence.  Therefore, some support from the townspeople of Leon and Castile was necessary.  It was there that the first organizational meetings appeared in Spain. </p>

    <h2>  For what purpose were the Cortes created? </h2><p>  First of all, to achieve the support of citizens in military operations and government affairs.  The second - to develop certain laws of interaction between citizens, clergy and ordinary people.  These rules applied to courts, laws on private property, taxes.  The set of agreed rules and liberties was called ‚ÄúFueros‚Äù. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The emergence of the Cortes </h2><p>  Medieval chronicles and chronicles can answer the question of where and when the cortes appeared in Spain.  History has it that the first cities governed by the Cortes were Castile and Leon.  The time of the appearance of these collections should be attributed to the 11-12th century.  The next step was to provide the most influential part of citizens with legislative rights and their gradual transformation into <span>representative bodies.</span>  Significant is the meeting of Cortes in 1202, when eminent citizens bought from the royal authority the right to mint a gold coin.  A huge sum was paid for the right of coinage, which was almost six times higher than all the king's income from taxes and fees. </p>

    <h2>  Three estates </h2><p>  To know, the clergy and the townspeople - caballeros - are three estates who took part in the work of the Cortes.  New legislative assemblies did not always include representatives of the three estate classes.  Estado militar - the secular government - raised issues for the consideration of society.  The secular branch was created by representatives of the king - rikos amberos, and by the small nobility - hidalgo and infanson.  The clergy were also present in two forms - the central archbishopric and the local clergy.  The third force was represented by estado llano - delegates from urban communities.  The order of their participation has not been standardized.  First of all, representatives of the cities belonging to the crown took part in the Cortes.  Another condition was the presence in the city of its own council - consejo.  There are cases when citizens made decisions independently. </p>

    <p>  Where and when did the cortes in Spain, consisting of citizens, appear?  Meetings are known in Valladolid in 1295 and four years later.  The issues addressed at these meetings did not include the presence of the nobility and the clergy. </p><p>  Cortes are now the highest legislative bodies in Spain.  Here they make decisions regarding the entire state.  And it is hard to believe that the beginning of this form of government was laid a thousand years ago in Castile and Leon. </p>
