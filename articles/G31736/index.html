This question worries many subscribers.  Indeed, modern users are very fond of connecting their home Internet from their own mobile operator.  And for mobile devices, this is already an integral part of the tariff plan.  Let's try to figure out what Beeline can offer us in this sense.  Maybe he really offers pretty favorable Internet conditions for home and gadgets? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beeline internet package" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1120971.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What happens? </h2><p>  But first, let's talk a bit about what we will deal with.  As already mentioned, you will have to choose from Beeline an Internet package for use.  What services in this sense does our operator offer? </p><p>  For starters, this is a mobile option.  For phone and smartphone.  These gadgets, to be honest, Beeline has its own tariffs.  Pretty profitable and interesting. </p><p>  In addition, there is also a separate section - "Internet for the tablet."  Something similar to offers for mobile. </p><p>  There is also a USB modem and home Internet.  By the way, very often USB routers are used exclusively for home use.  If you do not need an ultrafast connection, then you can choose this option.  Now it‚Äôs worth looking at what Beeline has to offer from specific products. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Highway </h2><p>  The first thing you should pay attention to is the Highway.  This service is a mobile Internet.  Beeline offers its subscribers rather favorable conditions for connection and use.  You get an ultrafast connection, but with some limitations.  When the threshold is exceeded, the <span>speed of the Internet will drop</span> several times. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="home internet beeline" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1120970.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  There are many options for Highway.  By the way, this tariff can be attributed to universal.  Why?  After all, it applies to all gadgets.  Both on smartphones and tablets.  You can connect your service to: </p><ul><li>  1 GB </li><li>  4 GB </li><li>  8 GB </li><li>  12 GB </li><li>  20 GB </li></ul><p>  With all this, you will be charged monthly fee in the amount of, respectively: </p><ul><li>  200 rubles; </li><li>  400; </li><li>  600; </li><li>  700; </li><li>  1200. </li></ul><p>  As a matter of fact, to connect "Highway" to yourself, you can use the call to the operator at 0611. You inform the tariff, and then wait for an answer.  In addition, to connect to the "Beeline" Internet "My Account" is also suitable.  Log in, select the "Mobile Internet" section, find the "Highway" with the appropriate limit and click on "Purchase" at the bottom of the page.  Most subscribers are advised to connect an Internet package of 1-4 gigabytes for Beeline mobile devices.  And nothing more. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  "EVERYTHING IN THE HOUSE" </h2><p>  True, there is one more rather favorable offer from our today's mobile operator.  And it also applies to mobile devices and gadgets.  Beeline has an Internet package called ‚ÄúEVERYTHING IN THE HOUSE‚Äù.  If you have a ‚ÄúALL‚Äù line tariff plan, then you are able to provide yourself with a high-speed connection to the World Wide Web.  True, this service per month will cost 400 rubles.  The connection speed will be up to 40 Mbps.  Pretty fast, to be honest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beeline Internet personal account" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1120969.jpg"></div>

    <p>  How to connect this option?  In this case, you need to find in the section "Beeline" -Internet ("My Account" on the official website must be activated, that is, you must log in there) the corresponding inscription.  In our case, this is "EVERYTHING in the house."  Select this tariff, then click on it and scroll through the page to the very end.  Click "Connect" there.  After that, you will receive a message with the operation confirmation code.  Enter it in the appropriate field, after which you can rejoice at the result. </p><p>  In truth, ‚ÄúEVERYTHING in the house‚Äù should be connected only to those who actively use the Internet on their gadgets.  For the average subscriber, this is not necessary.  It is too expensive to pay for Internet services.  True, this option is perfect for USB modems.  In this case, the home Internet (Beeline) will be quite profitable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  "Year as a gift" </h2><p>  In truth, our today's operator still has many profitable and interesting offers.  For example, you can provide free Beeline Internet for home use for a year.  To do this, you have to use a special promotion.  It is called "Year as a Gift." </p><p>  In principle, this option is very beneficial for those subscribers who want to use only the home Internet.  Paying attention to the proposal is also worthwhile in cases where you do not have the appropriate equipment for the connection.  In this case, Beeline Internet package "Year as a gift" is quite profitable. </p><p>  What needs to be done to get them?  Just purchase an Internet modem from Beeline.  Depending on it, your connection speed will vary.  You can purchase SmartBox Pro.  In this case, the speed of Wi-Fi and LAN will reach 100 Mbps.  Such a purchase will cost 5900 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beeline internet phone" class="if" height="434" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1120968.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In addition, there is another Beeline provider Internet package, which falls under the campaign "Free Internet".  To connect it, it is enough to purchase the appropriate equipment, as in the previous case.  But this time the modem will cost 2 <span>500 rubles,</span> and it is called SmartBox ONE.  The connection speed will be 50 Mbps.  Also a pretty good offer, which many pay attention to. </p><p>  Which of the proposed tariffs to choose?  This is up to you.  It all depends on how actively you use the Internet.  Most subscribers are advised to purchase a modem for 2500 rubles.  50 Mbps is enough to quickly download large documents, as well as watch movies in high quality.  For 5900, a modem is worth buying only if many computers are connected to the device.  Here is such a profitable home Internet ("Beeline"). </p><h2>  Mono </h2><p>  But these are not all the options that our current mobile operator can offer.  Many are trying to connect the Beeline Internet.  The telephone, to be honest, is almost never used at home for work on the World Wide Web.  And therefore, gadgets should use either the terms of your tariff plan, or "Highway".  But if you want to work with Beeline on the computer from the Internet, you will have to try pretty hard to find yourself a good deal. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mobile internet beeline" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1120967.jpg"></div>

    <p>  For example, you can opt for the Mono line.  This is a fairly fast internet for moderate cost home use.  There are several options: </p><ul><li>  "Mono 15"; </li><li>  "Mono 50"; </li><li>  "Mono 100". </li></ul><p>  All offers depend on the speed of your Internet connection.  So, for example, when connecting "Mono 15" you will get 15 Mbps per second, with "Mono 50" - 50, and with "Mono 100" - 100, respectively.  Of course, all these offers differ in cost.  You must pay for the rates accordingly: </p><ul><li>  350 rubles per month; </li><li>  450; </li><li>  650. </li></ul><p>  To make a connection, you must either contact the Beeline office, or use the "Personal Account" on the operator‚Äôs official website.  In principle, there is nothing complicated about this.  Users say that Mono is a pretty good deal that you really should pay attention to.  If you are an active person who loves surfing the Internet, then you should connect a "Mono 100".  In extreme cases, "Mono 50".  This is enough for the modern user.  "Mono 15" is not so popular.  After all, the network connection speed is quite low for the home Internet.  Therefore, it is better to refuse this offer.  Especially if you prefer to watch movies online. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beeline internet modem" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1120965.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  "EVERYTHING TO TV HOUSE" </h2><p>  And we continue to choose with you on the Beeline Internet.  Phone, smartphone, tablet or computer - it doesn‚Äôt matter what device you will be connecting the tariff for.  The main thing is to choose the best solution based on your needs.  If it‚Äôs not so difficult to decide on gadgets yet, then you have to tinker with your home Internet. </p><p>  If you are an active user who also wants to use the services of television from the operator, pay attention to the tariff "EVERYTHING in the house of TV".  At Beeline, this type of Internet package is designed to connect to a network at a speed of 100 Mbps, as well as provide a digital set-top box and 121 channels as a gift.  <span>The subscription fee</span> will be 650 rubles per month. </p><p>  Many users note that this is a great way to save.  The only BUT: television works with the Internet is not very high quality.  Although if you are not afraid of minor malfunctions and malfunctions, you can pay attention to "EVERYTHING in the house of TV."  In addition, this option is suitable for subscribers who want to watch digital television and use the Internet quickly. </p><h2>  "Multi" </h2><p>  There is also a family of services such as Multi.  This is something similar to the previous sentence.  You get a TV with a prefix, as well as the Internet on favorable terms.  Plus 121 channels to watch. </p><p>  When you connect the "Multi 50" will have to enjoy the speed of 50 Mbps.  And for all this, pay 750 rubles a month.  If you need a faster Internet, then you can pay attention to the "Multi 100".  The speed will increase 2 times, and the cost will be 950 rubles.  Also, as a gift, you receive, as already mentioned, 121 basic channels for watching digital television and a set-top box. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="free internet beeline" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1120966.jpg"></div>

    <p>  ‚ÄúMulti‚Äù differs from ‚ÄúEVERYTHING in a TV house‚Äù in its cost, as well as in the quality of connection.  Many subscribers claim that it is this option that should be connected if you want to watch TV without fail and use the Internet constantly. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  So we got acquainted with all the profitable packages from the Beeline operator.  As you can see, both home and mobile Internet (Beeline) can be connected on favorable terms.  But which particular option to choose? </p><p>  There is no single answer.  Each user must decide his own requests for speed and capabilities, and then choose the appropriate option.  Practice shows that on phones, subscribers use packages of services that are provided according to the tariff plan.  But for the home or connect "Mono 50" ("Mono 100" much more often), or "Year as a gift" along with equipment.  In any case, the final decision is entirely yours. </p>
