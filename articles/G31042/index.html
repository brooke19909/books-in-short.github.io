Electronic cigarette Eleaf iKiss</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, on the street, you can more and more often see a purposefully walking young man, drawing air from some colored stick and letting out smoke.  If you, having sniffed, do not catch the characteristic tobacco smell, it means that a vaper has swept past you.  This has become a kind of movement.  Paritors are also grouped together according to their interests, as smokers used to group on the porch of public buildings.  Comparing their devices, evaluating their design and trying new liquids, they find inexhaustible topics for conversation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Eleaf Ikiss.

    <h2>  Fashion or panacea? </h2><p>  It all started with the fact that smokers cornered by anti-smoking laws found an outlet in electronic cigarettes.  However, today it has become even fashionable to have an addiction not to cigarettes in a pack and not to cigarettes, but to various forms and types of vaporizers. </p><h2>  What's wrong with cigarette smoke? </h2><p>  What scare us when they talk about the dangers of smoking?  Tobacco contains several thousand harmful substances.  Some of the most dangerous are resins.  Formed in the cooling of smoke in the mouth, and settling in the lungs, can cause cancer.  They weaken the immune system and provoke allergic reactions.  A smoldering cigarette is a source of carbon monoxide, poisoning the body of a smoker and causing oxygen starvation not only in him, but also in others. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cigarettes Eleaf Ikiss" class="if" height="439" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41415/1185403.jpg" width="600"></div><br>  Nicotine constricts blood vessels, provokes shortness of breath, undermines the central nervous system.  In addition, a person who smokes often smells bad (although the smell of expensive tobacco is one of the most effective aphrodisiacs, according to some. But this is already a question for cigarette manufacturers what they add to cigarette cases).  From life safety posters, we know that a cigarette can cause a fire.  Also, smoking has many unpleasant cosmetic consequences, such as yellow teeth and early aging skin.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Pros of an electronic cigarette </h2><p>  Electronic vaporizers solve many of these terrible problems.  They do not burn, do not smell and do not affect the color of teeth.  True, they still contain dangerous nicotine, but manufacturers of electronic cigarette liquids have also solved this problem by releasing nicotine-free bases.  Despite the fact that opponents of vaping warningly raise their fingers at every corner due to the low knowledge of these devices, a considerable amount of their research is being conducted in the world.  In 2012, Greek scientists discovered toxic substances in the smoke of electronic cigarettes.  But their content was 9-450 times lower than in the cigarette. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Electronic Cigarette Eleaf Ikiss" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41415/1185910.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Thus, the advantages of an electronic cigarette are obvious.  The sooner a new-fangled device is in your hands, the sooner you will get rid of instructive recommendations to take care of your health.  And Eleaf Ikiss cigarettes will make this transition less painful and even elegant. </p><h2>  To help a beginner vaper </h2><p>  Before you start choosing a vaporizer, the first thing you need to understand is that electronic cigarettes are divided into two categories according to the type of puff - hookah and cigarette. </p><p>  The first delivers steam directly to the lungs.  Such devices are equipped with a wide duct, a lot of steam is obtained, but it is more rarefied and less saturated.  A cigarette puff is more familiar to smokers - the vapor is first collected by the cheeks and then inhaled into the lungs.  Accordingly, its amount decreases and it becomes saturated. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Eleaf Ikiss belongs to the hookah puff cigarettes.  Reviews, of course, will help you decide on the method of soaring, but it‚Äôs better to still find a store where you can try those and other devices yourself. </p><h2>  Which liquid to choose? </h2><p>  Electronic cigarette liquids vary in taste and nicotine concentration.  Fruit lovers are offered apple, cherry, melon, citrus fruits.  But adherents of exclusively tobacco tastes will have to sweat pretty much to choose the right greed.  You will be surprised how much diversity can be hidden in this category.  Many manufacturers, in order to facilitate the task, produce the basics with the taste of famous cigarettes - "Parliament", "Marlboro", "Davidoff".  There are liquids and the taste of pipe tobacco.  You will also be asked to choose a nicotine content.  It is basically 0;  6;  12 and 18 mg. </p><h2>  Eleaf Ikiss: Overview and Features </h2><p>  Eleaf iKiss electronic cigarette is one of the most successful new products of 2014.  The compact size and decent functionality made it a welcome acquisition for many beginner vapers.  The length of the cigarette is only 122 mm, it can easily fit even in the breast pocket of your shirt.  For every taste, you can choose one of six colors in which it is presented. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ismoka Eleaf Ikiss" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41415/1188052.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  All four components - the vaporizer, the case and the base of the atomizer, the battery - are interchangeable, so you do not have to buy a new cigarette if one of the parts fails.  In the transparent plastic case of the atomizer, the liquid level is easily visible.  You can choose a model with mechanical or automatic tightening.  An evaporator resistance of 2.2 ohms will be enough to fully reveal the taste of the liquid. </p><p>  Like all small electronic cigarettes, Ismoka Eleaf Ikiss is equipped with a rather weak battery.  But this can be corrected if you purchase a special cigarette case with a built-in 1700 mah battery.  In addition to the convenience of storage, its obvious advantage lies in the fact that you can charge the device at any time. </p><p>  The Eleaf Ikiss electronic cigarette has an original charger mount - it literally magnetizes to the tip of the device.  You will appreciate this when you remember how, cursing, tried to find the inlet to the touch.  And, of course, you can continue to soar while charging. </p>

    <h2>  Some tips to follow up </h2><p>  There is nothing easier than using an Eleaf Ikiss cigarette.  The instruction in Russian is attached to the device, and we are sure that you will perfectly understand it.  Nevertheless, we note here some key points.  The greatest difficulty is usually the filling of the tank with liquid.  You may come across a warning against getting into the evaporative coil, which is located in the center of the tank.  The need to aim at the remaining wall can cause trembling hands in an inexperienced vaper.  However, one should not follow this rule so categorically: as yet, no one who violates this rule has a cigarette stopped functioning properly.  The atomizer is designed to work in a humid environment and courageously endures your awkward manipulations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Eleaf Ikiss.

    <p>  Before the first use, it is recommended to soak the atomizer with liquid, for which it is necessary to wait a few minutes after the gulf before starting to soar.  This will avoid overheating and premature failure of the heating element. </p><h2>  Electronic cigarette Eleaf Ikiss.  Customer reviews </h2><p>  All users of this model unanimously note its compactness and stylish design.  Most often, representatives of the fair sex choose it, enticing themselves with a sophisticated look in the literal sense of the word, as well as those who do not want to burden themselves with wearing a large steam unit.  More attentive to technical details, users respond positively to the qualities of the evaporator, recognizing a quite decent hover for 2.2 ohms. </p><p>  But there are also less enthusiastic reviews about Eleaf Ikiss cigarettes.  Some buyers got a model that began to leak.  In fairness, I must say that this is generally a common occurrence in the world of electronic cigarettes, for which it is recommended to purchase cases.  It is also possible that woe to customers just came across a fake.  However, for the full picture, we will take these comments into account, especially since many others write the opposite.  They also complain about a rather weak battery, but you have to be prepared for this by buying a small model. </p><h2>  Toys for adults </h2><p>  Electronic cigarettes are a great alternative to regular smoking.  Now you can proudly respond to a request to give a lighter ‚ÄúI don't smoke.‚Äù  After all, you have fresh breath, pockets are not covered with shag, fingers do not smell of tobacco and the complexion has improved.  You can feel free to kiss women (and men), fearlessly bend over and take a button of your interlocutor in an intimate conversation.  In addition, you have acquired a stylish accessory to the envy of friends. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pros of an electronic cigarette" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41415/1185422.jpg" width="354"></div>
