Fantasy flight of a true lover hand made - endlessly, inspired by a craftswoman - a chest full of ideas. </p><p>  And what kind of craftswoman did not try to find use for bottles?  Dear lovers of needlework, this article contains a variety of ideas for inspiration.  Let's take a closer look at a couple of ways to create a bottle decor. </p><h2>  Bottle decoration </h2><p>  Isn't it great to diversify a bottle of wine or champagne?  We decorate the dishes.  And if you give a bottle?  Wouldn't it be nice to receive a beautifully designed present as a present?  It‚Äôs immediately obvious - a man tried, thought about a gift.  And if there are a few beautiful bottles in shape?  Why get rid of them if they can find application, for example, in the form of decoration in the kitchen or as a vase.  The main thing is to decorate correctly, which we will do now. </p><p>  DIY bottle decoration is a simple undertaking, moreover, pleasant.  In addition, a proven fact - work with hands, for example, weaving, knitting or the same decor - soothes.  Below are a few DIY bottle decoration workshops (with photos and detailed instructions for you). </p><h2>  For the holiday </h2><p>  So, on the nose holidays.  Whatever it is, I want something special, original.  Why not decorate the table with a pretty bottle?  The holiday begins with the atmosphere.  So, let's go over the list.  If you have ... </p><h2>  New Year </h2><p>  New Year is a noisy cheerful holiday.  Beautiful Christmas tree, bright lights and balls on it, the smell of needles and ginger.  If we decorate dishes on the New Year‚Äôs table, windows and houses, a green beauty and even pets, then how can we skip and not transform a bottle of champagne is a mandatory attribute of the New Year? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Felt Decor </h2><p>  The most common way to decorate a bottle for the New Year is to sew a felt cap.  This bottle decor is sewn in a couple of minutes, and will last for more than one year. </p><p>  So, let's try to sew a cap in the form of Santa Claus. </p><p>  For this we need: </p><ul><li>  Felt red and white. </li><li>  Beads or eyes for hand-made. </li><li>  Glue. </li><li>  Needle, thread, scissors. </li><li>  Pencil and paper. </li></ul><p>  To begin with, we need to make a template by which to cut the felt.  The cap will be in the form of an elongated isosceles triangle.  Draw an elongated triangle along the length of the hypotenuse bottle of approximately 15 cm. Take an extra centimeter into account.  Prepare a fluffy beard template in advance to simulate <span>Santa Claus's beard.</span> </p><p>  Put the large triangle pattern on the felt and cut out two triangles.  Cut off the upper corner, backing off about 5-6 cm. Do not throw it away, this is the future hat. </p><p>  Sew the cap on the sides.  Turn and try on a bottle.  The hat also needs to be sewn and twisted. </p><p>  From white felt, cut a beard and a thin strip for a hat. </p><p>  After trying on the hat, place the eyes on the main part and glue it.  Sew fluffy beard and strip to the cap with white threads below. </p><p>  If desired, you can decorate the hat with a white strip. </p><p>  Santa Claus is ready. </p><p>  Imagine.  Several bottles can be decorated with caps in the form of a snow maiden and a snowman, as well as make deer or a symbol of the coming year.  They will keep company with your Santa Claus at the festive table. </p><p>  In addition, the simplest bags with embroidery are also popular from felt.  You can also put knitted jewelry on the bottle, but a felt cap is the fastest way to decorate. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  And how do you like this New Year‚Äôs option as a home decoration? </p><div class="photo" data-original="andersruff.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="New year decoration" class="if uuid-2347528" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2347528.jpg"></div><p>  And if you have an extra garland, then the easiest way to quickly diversify the interior of the room is to drop a garland in a bottle.  Bright, pleasant lamp can be placed near the Christmas tree. </p><p>  There are many other ways to decorate the bottle, we will talk about them later. </p><h2>  Wedding </h2><p>  This is a magnificent and special celebration, and the decorations on the table should also look magnificent and bright.  Therefore, special attention should be paid to the decor of the bottle for the wedding. </p><p>  In addition to the way to dress them up as a bride and groom, there are several more ways to decorate the bottles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.crazyforus.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Primer and varnish" class="if uuid-2347582" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2347582.jpg"></div><p>  To create such unusual decor elements, we need: </p><ul><li>  Primer. </li><li>  Brush </li><li>  Spray can with gold color. </li></ul><p>  To decorate, you need to take: </p><ul><li>  White, silver and gold ribbons. </li><li>  Artificial flowers. </li><li>  PVA glue. </li><li>  Sparkles. </li><li>  Glue the moment. </li></ul><p>  So, we will begin our DIY bottle decoration workshop. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  To get started, remove all the labels from the bottles that you will decorate.  The next step is to degrease the surface, alcohol is suitable for this. </p><p>  Coat the bottles with primer, if necessary in several layers.  Let it dry. </p><p>  It remains only to cover a few bottles of paint.  Drop a couple of white bottles.  For a glossy effect, they can be varnished. </p><p>  You can decorate the sides of the bottle with artificial flowers and ribbons, neck ribbons.  A small way to diversify the composition is spangles, cover with a glue PVA bottle at the bottom and sprinkle with spangles and sequins of the corresponding color. </p><p>  If during the holiday the decor is not affected, then the bottles can be left as decoration for the interior. </p><p>  By the way, about the decor of bottles with ribbons.  It is very simple.  Read more about this later. </p><h2>  Decor with ribbons and threads </h2><p>  Bottles in the interior are a good idea, especially if they are beautifully designed.  Let's try to repeat the master class on the decor of bottles of ribbons and threads.  Below is an option on how to make a few bottles that will look good in the living room or hallway. </p><div class="photo" data-original="imgble.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Home decoration" class="if uuid-2347643" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2347643.jpg"></div><p>  What do we need for this bottle decor with our own hands: </p><ul><li>  Twine or woolen threads. </li><li>  Glue. </li><li>  A few buttons or pearl beads. </li><li>  Lace ribbon. </li><li>  Ribbon for flower or dried flower. </li></ul><p>  Before working with the bottle, it must be degreased. </p><p>  The decor with twine has several nuances, however, this will not bring much complexity to the process. </p><p>  First, you need to start wrapping the bottle from the bottom.  Lubricate it with glue and twist the thread with an even snake.  Be careful with the rib.  On it, too, you need to glue the twine so that the bottle is stable. </p><p>  Secondly, after the bottom, the process goes from bottom to top, the thread must go parallel to the bottom.  Make sure that the rope does not bend, otherwise it will ruin the whole picture (of course, if this is not intended). </p><p>  Carefully consider attaching the thread at the neck.  A loose end may result in destruction of the entire composition. </p><p>  After you have done the main work with threads, start decorating.  Look at the photo.  Among other things, you can decorate the finished work with additional flowers and sequins, sparkles and beads, as well as put flowers or wire shapes in bottles. </p><p>  Note: Twine can be replaced with a crocheted pigtail.  Experiment! </p><h2>  Decor with beads, beads and sparkles </h2><p>  Beads and sparkles, small and bright material, they can turn out bright, beautiful bottles. </p><p>  Pay attention to this DIY bottle decor photo: </p><div class="photo" data-original="homesthetics.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Glitter Decor" class="if uuid-2347694" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2347694.jpg"></div><p>  This method does not take much time.  For him you will need: </p><ul><li>  Beads and sparkles of pink and gold color. </li><li>  Cylinder with gold paint. </li><li>  Glue. </li></ul><p>  Before starting work, be sure to degrease the surface of the bottle with alcohol or acetone. </p><p>  Next, apply paint from the balloon to the bottles and let dry. </p><p>  Decorate the bottle, start from the bottom.  Apply glue from one side to the desired length and sprinkle with sparkles, spraying from the bottom to the neck.  Cover the whole bottom. </p><p>  Apply glue above.  Sprinkle the first color with a second color to get a gradient. </p><p>  Simple, fast and incredibly beautiful.  This is an easy way to decorate a bottle, for example, to a festive table. </p><p>  If you have enough time, then try to make a bottle for the house, pouring out the composition.  This is done very simply.  Put a rough drawing of your drawing on the bottle.  Lubricate parts and sprinkle alternately.  Let the time dry.  This is an original way to decorate a bottle by creating a small picture on it. </p><h2>  Decor paints </h2><p>  Speaking of pictures, we cannot pass by and not tell how to paint bottles with acrylic paints and how to draw on bottles. </p><p>  There are several ways to color a bottle.  The first way is to paint from the inside.  Using a syringe, diluted acrylic paint is introduced into the bottle and thoroughly smeared.  The finished products are dried upside down to make the glass paint. </p><p>  This method has its own advantage - quickly, simply, and most importantly, the bottle will not lose its glass sheen.  But, on the other hand, you will not be able to draw a picture. </p><p>  The second method allows you to draw on a bottle.  For a simple and original pattern, electrical tape can be useful.  To get perfectly even stripes, stick on electrical tape and paint on top. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Striped bottles" class="if uuid-2347810" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2347810.jpg"></div><p>  If you want to draw an image on the surface or create an entire composition, it is best to prime the bottle before work. </p><p>  Look at how beautiful the decor of the bottle turned out with your own hands.  The master, it can be seen, put his soul into his work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thesmartteacher.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fantastic drawings on bottles" class="if uuid-2347812" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2347812.jpg"></div><h2>  What to paint? </h2><p>  The question arises by itself - and what to use when applying paint?  Here's a small note: using a nylon brush, you are unlikely to achieve a perfectly smooth surface.  It‚Äôs better to use a sponge for her.  True, the paint will have to be applied in several layers.  For a simple pattern with electrical tape - excellent.  Therefore, in order to avoid incidents with a pattern, cover the bottle with soil before work. </p><p>  An even coating layer will provide a spray can.  This is the third way of registration.  With it, you will get not only an even thin layer, but also a nice gradient when using several colors.  In addition, do not forget about stencils.  You can either buy them or make them yourself. </p><h2>  Neon </h2><p>  If you are a fan of original things, then you will like the paint that glows under ultraviolet.  You can decorate the bottle as a pattern, as well as a couple of droplets. </p><p>  Glowing colors are an interesting material for creativity. </p><div class="photo" data-original="voinevier.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bright design" class="if uuid-2347813" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2347813.jpg"></div><h2>  Gift bottle </h2><p>  Finally, look at how you can make a bottle of champagne in an original way.  What a delicious chocolate pineapple!  Just like the real one! </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="1fERhSSqnvg" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fERhSSqnvg" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/7/3/5/1735.jpg"></div><p>  We hope that this workshop on bottle decor has given you a lot of new ideas.  The decoration process is not complicated, but a huge number of ways allows you to realize any fantasy.  Using different materials as the basis and for decoration, you will get unique things for the home and table.  This is a good decoration and gift giving, and a pleasant decoration in the living room. </p><p>  Create and share your photos of bottle decor.  Get inspired and create new ideas.
