Most often, children and their parents attend ice rinks, which are more in the capital than, probably, in all of Russia.  If you want to not only ride, but also learn the basics of figure skating, then go to the Krasnaya Presnya park.  There is a large ice rink with artificial turf.  Every day, for everyone, lessons are held from <span>Ilya Averbukh</span> and his school ‚ÄúThe Way to Success‚Äù.  Both children and adults can receive professional advice.  At the rink, you can rent skates or sharpen your own. </p>

This is one of the branches of the Botanical Garden of Moscow State University, which is located on Prospect Mira.  The floristic corner of the capital was founded at the beginning of the 18th century and still, despite the noise and bustle of the capital's streets, remains quiet and calm.

    <h2>  Kolomensky park </h2><p>  Where to go for a walk in winter in Moscow is cheap and incredibly interesting?  An ice rink, a warm dressing room and a small restaurant operate on the territory of <span>Kolomensky Park</span> .  But this is by no means its most important attractions.  There are two ski slopes, the length of which is approximately equal to five kilometers.  Ski equipment rental - 200 rubles per hour.  The most interesting thing is that the tracks go beyond the territory of the park and stretch along the Moskva River and the surrounding streets.  Both ski roads are isolated from traffic and are completely safe. </p>

    <h2>  We are participating in the quest </h2><p>  In Kolomensky park, renting skis on the Fairground, you can take part in the quest.  To do this, you need to activate this game through your smartphone and hit the road.  This quest is unique, it is possible to see the beautiful and ancient sights of Moscow.  In winter, when it is cold around and we all occasionally look out of the windows of cars or public transport, the cathedrals and the most beautiful buildings of past eras go unnoticed.  When skiing in the open air, you will pass by the museum of wooden architecture, the house of <span>Peter the Great,</span> you will see the <span>Ascension</span> Church and a number of ancient temples. </p><h2>  Other Moscow parks in winter </h2><p>  <span>Park areas of</span> our capital attract both tourists and residents of the city at any time of the year.  In the cold season, numerous ice rinks open here, cozy coffee houses are equipped, so everyone can spend time both outdoors and in a pleasant place surrounded by the company.  In many parks (Gorky, Izmailovsky, the same Kolomenskoye) they offer such an attraction as an inflatable sled banana.  This is an analogue of a sea banana that rolls along the waves.  On such sleds you can freely roll and shout, recharge with positive and new impressions for the coming week. </p><h2>  Traditional metropolitan entertainment </h2><p>  The city of our country, which at any time of the year pleases with bright entertainment and attractions, is Moscow.  VDNH in winter is a traditional place for spending a weekend for all residents of the capital.  Here, most of the extreme attractions that are open in the summer are valid.  In addition to them, the rink is being poured - one of the largest in the city.  The number of cafes is increasing dramatically.  In winter, ice slides are open for children at VDNH, and there is always a fair with home-made goods.  Therefore, if you still have not decided where to go in Moscow in the winter, go here.  On the expanses of VDNH you will find everything from extreme sports to handmade soap. </p>
