    <p>  <span>A segment of the</span> smartphone <span>market</span> , which is usually called ‚Äúpremium‚Äù, implies the presence of devices marked by a lack of proposals put forward from, so to speak, the titans of the sphere.  The thing is what?  The fact that the manufacturer should not only declare that he created a new phone, but offer the buyer something really worthwhile.  After all, who will look at a well-known brand if the device does not stand out from the competition, if it does not have any features?  This situation also occurs in the case of ‚ÄúNokia 8800‚Äù. </p><p>  The Finnish manufacturer paid great attention and allocated large funds in order to interest potential buyers with its products that fell into the corresponding segment.  If you carefully understand, then the company's proposals can be called truly unique.  We also note the fact that the devices were designed and created in such a way that the maximum period of time does not lose their value, but keep it at the initial level.  This thoughtful move took place on the part of the Finnish manufacturer of mobile phones. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Features </h2>

    <p>  Nokia has one significant difference from its competitors.  In more detail, the manufacturer launches models on the smartphone market that are equal in functionality to other devices.  At the same time, these devices have their own unique design and unique features.  Originality, and only.  Perhaps this was the basis of the company's pricing policy.  Thanks to this feature, the maximum retention period of the highest price of the device, which was about 900 euros, is achieved. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúNokia 8800‚Äù in the market </h2>

    <p>  According to official figures, the model dominated the segment a little more than six months.  Thus, the price of the device was fixed at a certain level.  All this allows us to say with confidence that the Finnish manufacturer has not retreated from its pricing policy and this time, successfully continuing the general trend.  Accordingly, the manufacturer managed to attract a considerable number of people, some of which still use the creations of the company.  Well, it's time for us to move from words to deeds.  And we will start from the most standard position. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Equipment </h2>

    <p>  The Nokia 8800 phone, the photo of which is presented in this article, comes with the device itself, a table cup that needs to be used for charging, the charger itself and a wired stereo headset for using the radio and listening to multimedia files.  As an addition, there is a disc on which the software is recorded, a velvet pouch for storing accessories, as well as a rag for cleaning the screen.  But the general composition, as always, is completed by the documentation provided by the user manual and warranty card.  In general, the equipment is not bad, which can not be said. </p><h2>  Design </h2>

    <p>  The form factor of the Nokia 8800 gadget, a photo of which was presented by the company during the official release, is presented by nothing more than a slider.  Until that moment, the Finnish manufacturer had no such devices in their arsenal, such devices were simply absent.  Although at certain times the company approached them.  To be convinced of this, it is enough to recall the Nokia 8910 model.  However, the design of any slider is the corresponding mechanism.  And here he was arranged on a different principle.  In practice, it turned out that the functional part really flew up when the mechanism was activated. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The Nokia 8800 Gold is unique in its kind thanks to its housing.  It is made of stainless steel.  The exception is only the rear panel, or rather, its upper part.  If you remove the cover, then under it you can see the company inscription located near the slot designed to install a SIM card.  But it should be noted that there are a lot of metal elements in the device, probably, the engineers went too far with this. </p><p>  This is easy to verify.  Just remove the back cover of the phone and you will see how thick it is.  The thickness is about 0.5 millimeters.  For an element made of metal, this is really a lot.  You can again resort to comparison.  If we take similar devices and look at the corresponding element, we notice half the thickness. </p><p>  However, the phone ‚ÄúNokia 8800 Gold‚Äù thanks to such a generous use of metal components lies securely in your hands, it does not break out.  The severity, of course, is felt, but useful, but not outrageous.  If we take into account the fact that the surfaces of the device are polished, then <span>tactile contact</span> with the device cannot be called unpleasant.  It turns out that we either turn the disadvantage into an advantage, or simply balance the parameters. </p><h2>  Surface imperfections </h2>

    <p>  She is easily soiled.  Leaving fingerprints is not difficult.  And if it‚Äôs somehow possible to hide them on the case, it‚Äôs unlikely that they can be removed from the screen for a long time.  They are noticeable, of course, very strongly, and this is a clear drawback of the Nokia 8800 phone, the original of which the user can purchase in the cellphone.  But we add that everyone has long been accustomed to fingerprints and ceased to perceive them as a real disaster.  Probably, this business is more individual.  And those who really pay attention to this fall into units of a hundred. </p><h2>  Dimensions </h2>

    <p>  In all three planes, the dimensions of the device are as follows: they are 107 and 45 millimeters in height and width, and 16.5 in thickness.  The mass of the device is 134 grams.  Which looks quite logical when considering the material for manufacturing the case.  However, the phone looks lighter than it actually is. </p><h2>  Positioning </h2><p>  The Finnish manufacturer has announced the device ‚ÄúNokia 8800 Sapphire‚Äù as a device for men.  This does not mean that it is not intended for women.  It simply indicates the target audience, and then everyone decides for himself.  But if we rely on official statistics, we note that eighty percent of the sales of this model of mobile phone were made by men.  What should speak for itself. </p><p>  Although the point here is not at all what design the device has.  And the distribution of sales by gender does not depend so much on dimensions either.  Probably, the result lies in the initial positioning of the Nokia 8800 phone.  China once tried to do something in order to increase sales by connecting more women to them.  This was manifested in an attempt to add color schemes.  However, colossal successes of the Celestial Empire in this direction could not be achieved. </p><h2>  Conclusion and owner reviews </h2><p>  The phone is equipped with a speaker and a microphone not the best model.  Therefore, the quality of communication is clearly affected.  This has been repeatedly confirmed by numerous reviews and tests.  The owners of the device, which at one time acquired it, also refer to this.  In particular, the wheezing of the speaker can be noted.  There is also the so-called <span>white noise.</span>  <span>This</span> is nothing more than a hiss, confirming the ongoing conversation between the two subscribers. </p><p>  The device is equipped with a good vibration alert, which is quite difficult to miss, even if the device is in the pocket of a jacket or trousers.  The peculiarity of this model is rather in the original design.  At the time the phone entered the market, there was nothing similar in the segment.  And according to the materials and the form factor, hardly any device could create competition. </p><p>  At the end of the article, we note that the screen is protected by an additional layer of special glass.  It is akin to that used in watches belonging to the middle segment.  It uses the so-called <span>sapphire crystal.</span>  The coating on our model is hardened.  The Finnish manufacturer drew attention to the fact that such glass protects the device from minor mechanical damage. </p>
