The latter include Liechtenstein - a castle in Austria, located on the edge of the Vienna Forest.  Many stories and mystical legends are associated with it. </p><h2>  History of the name and castle of the same name in Germany </h2><p>  In German, the castle is called Liechtenstein.  This word is literally translated into Russian as ‚ÄúLight Stone‚Äù, which is no coincidence, because the castle was built from beige stones taken from a nearby quarry. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Liechtenstein castle how to get" class="if uuid-3106423" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60659/3106423.jpg"></div><p>  It is from this name that the princely family of Liechtenstein received its surname, and not vice versa, as some tourists might think.  This dynasty ruled for several centuries and still rules a small state of the same name in Western Europe.  Its area is only 160 square meters.  km </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is noteworthy that a castle of the same name is located in Germany in the municipality of Liechtenstein.  It was built in the XIX century and at the moment belongs to the Dukes of Urah.  Like the castle of Liechtenstein in Austria, it is open for tourist excursions.  Visitors can see an extensive collection of weapons and armor. </p><h2>  In the Middle Ages </h2><p>  According to official figures, the history of this Austrian castle dates back to 1130-1135.  It was in this time period that the construction of Liechtenstein was completed.  Its initiator was a man named Hugo von Liechtenstein, who today is considered the founder of the princely dynasty. </p><p>  Around the same time, the first written mentions of the building, reached by modern historians, date back to.  These documents speak of the castle as the house of Liechtenstein. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pixels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Liechtenstein Castle Photo" class="if uuid-3106424" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60659/3106424.jpg"></div><p>  In the following decades, the castle of Liechtenstein in Austria changed and expanded.  Over the entire period of its existence, he has changed many owners.  In addition to the original owners, representatives of the Kevenh√ºller, Habsburg and other families lived here. </p><p>  Several times the castle was destroyed and rebuilt.  This happened for the first time in the 1500s during a Turkish campaign against Vienna, near which the building is located.  After a hundred and a half years, Liechtenstein was restored and again turned into ruins in 1683.  Regular restoration work began only in the 1890s. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Our days </h2><p>  When the Second World War began, the castle of Liechtenstein in Austria was significantly damaged.  At the moment, the castle is still owned by the Liechtenstein dynasty.  Now tourist excursions are regularly held here. </p><h2>  Description and photo of the castle of Liechtenstein </h2><p>  Liechtenstein cannot be called the largest in area or the highest castle in Austria.  Its distinctive feature is its unusual shape - the width of Liechtenstein is only 13 m, which is why the castle can be called quite narrow.  Length - about 50 m. </p><div class="photo" data-original="austria-forum.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Liechtenstein castle inside" class="if uuid-3106425" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60659/3106425.jpg"></div><p>  Observing from the side, you can see that Liechtenstein looks like it is growing directly from the rock on which it is built. </p><p>  The castle is one of the few surviving structures built in the Romanesque style, characterized in architecture by a laconic exterior and a special composition.  Around the main tower of Liechtenstein are the rest of the buildings in the form of various geometric shapes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.schloss-lichtenstein.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="castle lichtenstein" class="if uuid-3106428" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60659/3106428.jpg"></div><p>  The interior decoration, as well as the exterior, also traces elements of the Romanesque style.  The most important and ancient castle building is the chapel of St. Pankratia, where you can see a picture depicting the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.  To this day, services are being held in the chapel, the beginning of which is announced by the ringing of bells. </p><p>  It is important to remember that you can take photos and videos only from the outside: inside the castle of Liechtenstein it is forbidden to take photos or record videos.  For violation of the rules shall be fined. </p><h2>  How to get to Liechtenstein Castle </h2><p>  The exact address of the building: Maria Endersdorf, 2344, which is a few kilometers from the Austrian capital - Vienna.  There are several options for getting to the Liechtenstein Castle.  The easiest of them is to get to your destination by car, renting it or ordering a taxi.  You need to go from the Vienna railway station to the south on the A21.  The road will take no more than half an hour. </p><p>  More complex options involve the use of public transport.  You need to take the S2 train and get from the Praterstern metro station to Modling station.  Then you should take a bus to the Giesshuber Strasse stop and, leaving, follow the signs that lead directly to the castle. </p><p>  An alternative way is to take the Wien Liesing station on the same train and then take the bus to the Maria Enzersdorf Schulplatz stop. </p><h2>  Castle visit </h2><p>  Liechtenstein is open to visitors all year round.  Opening hours in spring and autumn - from 10 to 16 hours, in the summer - from 10 to 17 hours, in the winter - from 10 to 15 hours. </p><p>  Currently, visiting the castle of Liechtenstein for tourists is available exclusively as part of the excursion group.  Excursions start hourly, no advance reservation is required. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="castle lichtenstein austria" class="if uuid-3107727" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60659/3107727.jpg"></div><p>  The duration of the visit to the castle is 50 minutes.
