Professional digital SLR camera</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Canon EOS-1DX is a digital SLR professional camera, released in October 2011. The letter X in the name indicates the number 10, indicating the generation of the camera.  In 1DX, two lines of professional EOS cameras were combined - reporting 1D and studio 1Ds, one of the first full-format cameras in the world. </p><p>  EOS 1Ds Mark III, the latest model in the 1Ds line, had a full-format (36x24 mm) CMOS sensor and a maximum resolution of 21.1 MP, while EOS 1D Mark IV, the latest model from the 1D line, had 16 MP CMOS with a 1.3x crop factor ( 27.9x18.6 mm), but had a high shooting speed. </p><p>  With the advent of the 5D Mark II with a sensor equivalent to CMOS 1Ds Mark III in March 2012, the popularity of cameras for professionals began to decline, since the 5D M2 was half the price, and it was not inferior to them in quality of photos.  This was a decisive factor when choosing a camera for many. </p>

    <h2>  Canon 1DX Key Features Overview </h2><p>  They are as follows: </p><ul><li>  18.1 megapixel, full-format CMOS; </li><li>  61 autofocus points, of which 41 are crosshairs; </li><li>  zonal, spot and advanced autofocus modes; </li><li>  two DIGIC5 + processors; </li><li>  shooting speed up to 14 fps; </li><li>  photosensitivity 100 - 51200 ISO in standard mode and 50 - 204800 ISO in advanced; </li><li>  100,000-pixel RGB auto-exposure sensor </li><li>  DIGIC4 auto exposure processor; </li><li>  +/- 5 Stop Exposure Compensation; </li><li>  Full HD video shooting with ALL-I or IPB compression; </li><li>  up to 30 min of video in Full HD resolution; </li><li>  shutter delay 55 ms in normal mode and 36 ms in user mode; </li><li>  use of the address-time code when shooting in HD mode; </li><li>  clear LCD viewfinder with focusing screen; </li><li>  3.2-inch, 1 megapixel LCD screen; </li><li>  EICS advanced cleaning system </li><li>  touch control panel; </li><li>  2 slots for CF memory cards. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="canon 1dx" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1122327.jpg" width="462"></div></h2><h2>  Innovations </h2><p>  EOS-1DX has so many innovations that they could last for several generations of cameras. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The main feature of the Canon 1DX was the newly created 18.1 megapixel full-frame CMOS sensor with the arrangement of microlenses without a gap, which allowed to increase the speed of data recording and photosensitivity of the camera.  The light sensitivity range reaches 51,200 ISO, and the extended - 204,800. </p><p>  The camera implements the second generation of the UWMC dust protection system.  The infrared filter of the sensor is not shaken completely, as before, but in parts.  The filter vibrates from top to bottom, moving dust particles in a wave-like fashion, and its dust-repellent fluorine-containing coating only contributes to this. </p><p>  Canon 1DX sequential shooting speed at maximum resolution and a fixed mirror is 14 fps.  For ISO 32000 and higher, the shooting frequency is reduced to 10 fps.  We managed to avoid additional camera vibration thanks to several key technological solutions.  To move the mirror and the shutter, a twin-engine system with a large torque is created.  And to ensure high-precision autofocus and image stability, the viewfinder mirrors are fixed with a special vibration-absorbing mechanism with 4 wedges. </p><p>  14 fps in Full HD corresponds to a data transfer rate of 252 MP / s, which was a record for full-format DSLRs.  This was facilitated by 2 DIGIC5 + processors and a 16-channel sensor output.  Processors are 3 times more productive than DIGIC5.  Compared to the 1D M4, the output speed increased by 1.4 times, and photosensitivity - by 4 (or 2 stops).  Now the camera takes up to 9 pictures with multiple exposures and with 4 types of overlays (medium, additive, bright, dark). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There are 3 standard shooting modes: ‚ÄúStudio‚Äù, ‚ÄúReport‚Äù and ‚ÄúLandscape‚Äù. </p><p>  The Canon 1DX Digital Camera is capable of self-diagnosis and error logging.  This contributes to the quick elimination of breakdowns. </p><p>  The battery capacity is 2450 mAh.  You can also use 1D Mark IV batteries. </p>

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  Canon 1DX is not very different from its predecessors in appearance.  But there are several significant additions.  This is an infrared port on the front of the camera capture and several additional programmable function buttons duplicated on the vertical and horizontal camera captures. </p><p>  Equipped with a lens and flash, the Canon 1DX professional camera is fully waterproof and can withstand 15 minutes under heavy rain.  The case is made of lightweight but durable magnesium alloy.  Joints, connectors, buttons, batteries, slots are protected by seals.  The camera was tested in frost and high humidity.  It uses materials created for operation in extreme conditions.  Weight - 1340 g. </p><p>  The size of the camera is impressive - 158x163.6x82.7 mm.  This is due to the fact that the battery is built into the handle, and the controls are located on it: shutter release, autofocus button, mode dial. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  On the front of the device, in addition to the already mentioned infrared port and programmable buttons, there is a mount, a button that blocks the removal of optics, a microphone. </p><p>  At the back are the main control panel and viewfinder with a rubber overlay. </p>

    <h2>  Viewfinder </h2><p>  The design of the viewfinder in the Canon 1DX has not changed.  100% frame coverage, 0.76x magnification, point of view rendered at 20 mm.  The viewfinder received an information display identical to the EOS 7D model, which displays more parameters: an indicator of the status of autofocus, shooting mode has been added, a discharge has been added to indicate the ISO sensitivity.  However, according to user reviews, when the camera is off, the image becomes cloudy.  Moreover, the viewfinder becomes cloudy in frost due to freezing of <span>liquid crystals.</span>  The focus indicators in low light will be red, and in high light only the outlines of the working points are lit. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  In addition to the viewfinder display, the EOS-1D X is equipped with two monochrome informational LCD displays (one for the back and one for the top) plus a 3.2-inch color LCD for the back.  The display uses a special rubber filler to prevent air from entering between the screen and the protective glass.  This minimized reflection and glare and increased the viewing angle to 170 ¬∞.  The screen allows you to evaluate the picture and focus in the same way as in the viewfinder. </p><p>  Under the screen is an information display with the status of memory cards.  Above the color screen there is a microphone, buttons for deleting, increasing and switching on the viewing mode. </p><h2>  Governing bodies </h2><p>  The Canon 1DX was the first SLR camera with 2 joysticks for various camera positions.  Between them is a control dial and a menu button. </p><p>  For the first time, a canon professional camera was equipped with 2 CF card slots.  Recording is performed on 2 cards at once, sequentially or by file type.  The slots are protected by seals, and their accidental opening prevents the pivoting lever of their metal. </p><p>  The flash mount is located on the top panel.  To the left are the exposure meter, autofocus and shooting mode buttons.  By pressing 2 buttons, you can enable exposure bracketing. </p><p>  To the right of the flash mount is a second monochrome display designed to display data on aperture, remaining memory, shutter speed, ISO, autofocus, buffer, battery charge, shooting type, exposure compensation.  The information display has an orange backlight.  Above it are buttons for turning on the display backlight, white balance selection, exposure compensation, and quick ISO settings.  Near the descent there is a control dial and a button for switching the selection of the autofocus area, working with user functions and the measurement mode. </p><p>  On the left panel there are sockets for connecting system extensions, PC, microphone, remote control, audio-video output, HDMI, USB and LAN.  Below is the battery latch. </p>

    <h2>  LAN </h2><p>  The EOS-1DX was the first SLR camera to be connected to the network via an Ethernet port.  A network connection is used to transfer photos, video and remote control.  The Wi-Fi module can be used to synchronize the shooting time and sort the photos in the order they were created. </p><h2>  Autofocus </h2><p>  The autofocus system has been radically changed.  The Mark IV 45-point autofocus has been replaced with a 61-point system covering most of the image.  Autofocus takes into account sensor data, color and illumination, information from lens gyroscopes. </p><p>  Sensors are arranged in blocks.  The 41-cross sensor allowed us to seal the focus area.  One of the focus points or zones is suitable for sharpening.  Rotating the camera 90 ¬∞ will change their position, leaving the subject to be photographed under autofocus control. </p><p>  For photographing small objects, a spot mode is provided, which reduces the size of the AF point to a small area.  An object is captured at any point.  While moving the subject or camera, the autofocus will keep it in the field of sharpness at the points at which it will fall. </p><p>  AI Servo tracking focus allows you to predict the movement of an object or return to the place of the last correct position. </p><p>  Focusing under artificial lighting takes into account the <span>chromatic aberration of the</span> lens and color temperature to correct autofocus.  Panorama shooting is recognized, and, when horizontal movement is fixed, the camera fixes the focus on the initial frame of the sequence. </p><p>  The EOS-1D X has 6 focus settings: </p><ul><li>  standard </li><li>  for fast-moving objects, in which tracking will continue even when the object leaves the controlled area (swimming, tennis, skiing and other dynamic sports); </li><li>  instant focus on objects (start of running competitions); </li><li>  for instantly changing the trajectory of objects (football); </li><li>  focusing on objects that are progressively moving in the vertical and horizontal directions (figure skating); </li><li>  focus on instantly changing the direction of movement or unevenly moving objects (gymnastics, basketball). </li></ul><p>  Autofocus microcorrection can be set for any lens and even for its various states. </p>

    <h2>  Light meter </h2><p>  The DIGIC4 processor uses RGB sensor data with a resolution of 107,250 pixels and accurately measures exposure thanks to color and face detection. </p><p>  The exposure meter breaks the image into 252 zones, and in low light - into 35, to obtain more data and light. </p><p>  Automatic analysis of the brightness, color, contrast, motion and distance to the subject makes it possible to adjust the brightness, determine faces, optimal exposure and <span>white balance.</span> </p><p>  Exposure meter data is necessary to set the correct flash illumination of faces even when the brightness of some secondary objects is excessive. </p><h2>  Video recording </h2><p>  The Canon 1DX digital camera was created not only for photographers, but also for video operators.  You can shoot scenes with a resolution of Full HD with a frequency of 30 fps and with a resolution of 1280x720 with a frequency of 50 fps.  Sound control is possible.  Recording takes place in H.264 encoding, but you can also choose ALL-I or IPB.  Recording lasts up to 30 minutes without video size restrictions thanks to the exFAT file system. </p>

    <h2>  Canon EOS 1DX: reviews + criticism </h2><p>  According to reviews by professional photographers and amateurs, the camera holds focus well, is fast, clear, and convenient to hold.  They note the excellent coherence of the device with the flash.  The dust on the matrix ceased to bother.  A professional Canon camera is accurate, ergonomic, has low noise and dynamic range, high ISO.  Users are satisfied with the large viewfinder, the full format of the camera, the ‚Äúrate of fire‚Äù of the device, the speed and number of autofocus points.  A pleasant surprise was that the battery capacity is enough to shoot more than two thousand frames for 8 hours - instead of the claimed thousand. </p><p>  But there are some comments.  Some lack RAW for complete control and adjustment of light.  I don‚Äôt like the change in the arrangement of buttons for different Canon models, as it takes time to get used to it.  The criticism is also caused by the large weight of the camera, the instability of autofocus operation in low light.  For some, the camera gave out ‚Äúbroken‚Äù files, which was eliminated by replacing the system board.  And the ‚Äúglitches‚Äù when connecting the 50 / 1.2 lens were ‚Äútreated‚Äù by removing the battery.  Well, the main drawback of the Canon 1DX is the price, which, although it has decreased significantly since its release, still remains quite high - about $ 4000. </p><h2>  The king is dead - long live the king! </h2><p>  The camera has brought radical changes to reporting devices.  The resolution of images, the number of AF points and the number of deeply thought-out settings have increased.  The shooting speed reached 14 fps. </p><p>  But life does not stand still.  1DX was replaced by an even better Canon EOS-1DX Mark II camera - a 20.2 megapixel full-format camera with a DIGIC 6+ processor.
