The essence and characteristics of stoicism</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The philosophical ancient current of stoicism is a kind of tribute to virtue, which teaches everyone and every morality, order and responsibility.  These dogmas appeared during the late Hellenism and existed in <span>ancient society for</span> several centuries.  This movement got its name, foundations and essence in Greece, but very soon became popular in the Roman Empire.  It is impossible to talk about what is stoicism, briefly.  Therefore, based on the works of ancient sages, we will consider this concept more broadly. </p><h2>  Origin and Description </h2><p>  The approximate date of the founding of the school of stoicism in the <span>ancient world is</span> considered to be the 4th century <span>BC.</span>  It was then that the Porto Stoa Poikile hosted the first public appearance of Zeno of Kitai.  He played the role of a teacher and told everyone about his discoveries and thoughts in the field of philosophy.  So he became the founder of a new school, which later literally overgrown with other dogmas and stereotypes.  Generally speaking, then stoicism in philosophy is masculinity, unwaveringness, firmness and resistance to all life's trials.  It can be said with full confidence that the image of a typical Stoic, as he was portrayed in the representation of ancient sages, was firmly entrenched in the consciousness of European society.  Such a term always characterizes a person who is hardy, unsentimental, one who feels a sense of duty to himself and others.  It is also worth noting that stoicism is the rejection of any emotions, since it is they that prevent a person from thinking sensibly and making rational decisions. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Periodization </h2><p>  In this matter, the opinions of scientists differ.  Some researchers highlight the so-called <em>zero period</em> in the history of this school.  It is believed that in the Stoa Poikilas, the sages who had precisely stoic outlooks on life gathered 300 years before the birth of the founder of this movement.  Unfortunately, all of their names are lost. </p><p>  <em>The first period is the Ancient Stoya</em> .  It lasted from IV to II century BC.  Its main character was, of course, the founder - Zeno of China.  Along with him were Cleanthos and Chrysippus of Sol.  The first stage of stoicism is considered to be exclusively Greek, since the teachings have not yet gone beyond the borders of this country.  After the death of their mentors, students were engaged in their business.  Among them, we can distinguish Diogenes of Babylon, Cratetus of Mullah, Antipater and so on. </p><p>  <em>Middle Standing, or Stoic Platonism.</em>  It existed from the 2nd to the 1st century BC.  The main characters of the era are Posidonius and Panetius of Rhodes.  It was these representatives of Stoicism who began to transfer their knowledge to Rome, where later they also became popular.  Their students continued to develop the school - Dardan, Diodotus, Atinodor, etc. </p><p>  <em>Late Stoya</em> - from the 1st to 2nd century AD.  This period is also known as Roman stoicism, since it was in this state that the doctrine continued to develop.  The main representatives of the third era are <span>Marcus Aurelius,</span> Seneca and Epictetus. </p><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Sometimes scientists distinguish the fourth period of the existence of this school, which coincides in time with the third.  In this case, <em>late Stoicism</em> is represented by Platonists and Pythagoreans.  The main character here is <span>Philo of Alexandria.</span> </p>

    <h2>  What is this philosophy based on? </h2><p>  In order to understand how the sages expressed their thoughts in those days, what exactly they put into the heads of others, it is necessary to understand what the doctrine of Stoicism was.  The theory of this school, which Zeno ‚Äúpatented‚Äù, was divided into three parts.  It was logic, physics and ethics (just such a sequence).  Often it was compared to a flowering garden, where logic is a protective fence, physics is a growing tree, and ethics are its fruits.  Similarly, the data were divided into three parts and the egg - the shell, protein and yolk (in a known sequence).  Zeno‚Äôs colleague, Kleanf, believed that stoicism is a much wider doctrine, because it should include more components.  He introduced such sections as dialectics, rhetoric, politics, ethics, theology and physics.  Those sages who continued to develop the doctrine after the death of the founders returned to the original theory, which included three elements. </p>

    <h2>  Logics </h2><p>  The logic of the Stoics consists of purely theoretical conclusions, each of which must be correct.  In this case, we immediately note that it is impossible to compare them, since the theory of each subsequent refutes the correctness of the previous one.  This stage of teaching is necessary because, as Chrysippus claimed, it changes the state of the material soul.  So, let us briefly consider a few logical conclusions of stoicism: </p><ul><li>  If A exists, then B. exists. A is, therefore, there is B. </li><li>  A and B do not exist at the same time.  And we have, therefore, B cannot exist. </li><li>  There is either A or B. Moreover, B is absent.  Therefore, A exists. </li></ul><h2>  Physics </h2><p>  To understand this section, it is important to remember that stoicism in philosophy is a purely material thing.  It is on matter that all his teachings are based, which reject feelings and emotions, and other manifestations of something inexplicable and intangible.  So, the Stoics see the world as a living organism, which is the material part of the material God who created all this.  This is precisely the man himself, whose fate is predetermined by the Creator - she is called rock in this context.  Therefore, any objection to the plan of the Almighty is meaningless and even punishable.  The Stoics believe that on the way to the realization of his duty, a person meets a passion, which becomes his main thorn.  The person who has got rid of passions becomes strong and ready to fight.  Strength, in turn, is the subtlest matter that is sent by the Lord. </p><h2>  Ethics of stoicism </h2><p>  In ethical terms, the Stoics are comparable to cosmopolitans.  They claim that each person is a citizen of the universe, and each is equal before his Creator.  On one level are masters and slaves, barbarians and Greeks, men and women.  Ancient stoicism teaches everyone to be kind, directs on the true path, makes self-develop and improve.  Moreover, any deviations from dogma, surrender to passions or committing sins are considered the lowest act.  To put it more briefly, the essence of the ethics of stoicism is that each is part of a mosaic, one of the many elements of the general concept.  And the one who agrees with this, fate leads, and the one who refutes his mission, she drags. </p>

    <h2>  Summarize this information </h2><p>  After we have examined all the elements that make up stoicism, we briefly describe it.  You need to live in harmony with nature, without harming others and yourself.  It is worth obeying your rock, go with the flow, as there is a reason for everything.  At the same time, it is necessary to remain impartial, strong and courageous.  A person should always be ready to overcome any obstacle in order to become better and more useful for the world and for God.  The characteristic of stoicism also lies in its affects.  There are four of them: disgust, pleasure, fear and lust.  Avoid those will help "ortho logos" - the correct judgment. </p>

    <h2>  Ancient Stoya and its development </h2><p>  In those centuries when stoicism was only born in ancient Greece, it was more theoretical in nature than practical.  All the philosophers who were his followers, including the founder himself, pored over the creation of the theory, the written basis of the new school.  They succeeded, as we can see today.  Concrete logical conclusions appeared, a certain material base in the ‚Äúphysics‚Äù section, as well as the results, which were entitled by the word ‚Äúethics‚Äù.  According to the ancient Greek sages, the essence of stoicism lies precisely in the dispute.  This is clearly demonstrated by conclusions that are considered logical.  Perhaps it is the Stoics who are the authors of the famous expression ‚Äútruth is born in a dispute‚Äù. </p><h2>  Middle stage of development </h2><p>  At the turn of the era, when Greece became a colony of mighty and domineering Rome, the knowledge of the Hellenes became the property of the Empire.  The Romans, in turn, preferred the matter to the word, because this philosophical school ceased to be purely theoretical.  Gradually, all the knowledge acquired by the Greeks began to be put into practice.  It was quotes from the Greek sages that motivated many soldiers of the <span>Roman army.</span>  Their words served as support and support for people who were lost in life.  Moreover, over the years, Stoicism has become so accustomed to society that the boundaries (but not completely) between slaves and masters, as well as between the sexes, gradually began to blur.  In short, Roman society has become more humane, reasonable and educated. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="representatives of stoicism" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/662370.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Roman philosophy.  Stoicism in its last years of existence </h2><p>  At the dawn of a new era, this movement has already become a kind of religion and an unwritten life charter for every Roman.  The whole logic of Stoicism, its conclusions, laws and metaphors are in the past.  The main ideas of the Greek sages embodied in life - the materiality of everything and everyone, impartiality and submission to fate.  But here it is necessary to highlight that it was at this time that Christianity began to spread in the world, which gradually conquered all the countries of Europe and Asia.  But what was the situation in the Roman Empire?  For the Romans, stoicism is everything.  This teaching consisted of their life, their faith.  They believed that man should be as close to nature as possible.  He must remain cold, extremely calm and restrained.  But the main idea that the Romans themselves derived, based on the knowledge of the Greeks, is the fight against the fear of death.  In their opinion, the person who has overcome this flaw becomes one of the most important links in the universe. </p><h2>  Features of the development of stoicism in Rome </h2><p>  It is clear that if we are talking about death, about fears, then this is a clear sign that philosophy is turning into theology.  As you know, people are afraid of the second, therefore they submit to all dogmas, unconditionally following each rule.  In the last years of its existence, Roman stoicism acquired not only enormous proportions, but also pessimistic motives.  For its representatives (and this was the overwhelming majority of the elite of society), it was important not self-development and unity with nature, but complete submission to rock, right up to the loss of one's ‚ÄúI‚Äù.  In this case, the main task was to cope with the fear of death.  That is, everyone was determined that at any moment he might not be, and there is nothing to worry about.  Such motives are especially clearly seen in the work of Epictetus.  They took root after Stoicism was adopted by Marcus Aurelius himself - the emperor of a great power. </p>

    <h2>  Contact with Christianity </h2><p>  In the early years of its existence, the Christian religion did not find adherents in every corner of the globe.  For a long time, peoples could not abandon ancient beliefs, the traditions of their ancestors.  In some cases, they were combined with Christianity (dualism), the same tendency was observed in the Roman Empire.  From the first century AD, stoicism begins to spread on a massive scale in the state.  This could be compared with the new laws, which became mandatory for everyone.  The Romans were literally crazy about apathy and unity with nature, but very soon their views began to change under the influence of the new faith.  For a long time, the people, including the ruling dynasty, did not accept Christianity.  Years passed, and the foundations of these theological teachings began to complement each other.  It should be borne in mind that Christianity at that time was the youngest religion, it needed a certain basis, which Stoicism could provide.  Today, this relationship can be clearly traced.  Indeed, in both theories we are told that one cannot be biased, one cannot indulge in vices, evil, or fear.  Both Christianity and Stoicism are teachings about kindness, about knowledge, about strength, and also that the ways of the Lord are mysterious, and each of us must be submissive to the Higher Plan. </p><h2>  Paradoxes and incidents </h2><p>  It often happens that a certain doctrine, which stretches over several centuries, therefore, is compiled by various people, as a result consists of inconsistencies and some absurdities.  That is exactly what stoicism is in philosophy.  This doctrine originated in the 4th century BC and existed after this for 600 years.  In the course of development, there was not only a transition from apatism to pessimism.  At the heart of the problem was the fact that man is simultaneously subordinate to God and his plans, but at the same time remains internally free.  It was the mental restlessness that many Stoics preached both in Greece and in Rome.  Modern researchers believe that this is one of the sides of logical teaching.  The first conclusion excludes the correctness of the second, and vice versa. </p><h2>  Stoicism today </h2><p>  To meet a typical Stoic in the 21st century is almost impossible.  The dogmas of ancient teachings are comprehended either by researchers who are closely involved in this, or by theologians, while adherents of mainly eastern religions (there are more similarities with the philosophy of Stoicism).  Each of us to a small extent can draw the knowledge of ancient authors from the Bible.  In fairness, it is worth noting that even most of the sacred commandments are based on the ancient theology of the Romans.  But sometimes people of our time are still called Stoics.  This happens if the person completely surrenders, becomes a fatalist, loses all faith in himself and his abilities.  Such people are typical apats who take any turn of fate, any loss or find for granted.  They really are not happy about life and are not upset if something terrible happens. </p><h2>  Afterword </h2><p>  Stoicism in philosophy is a whole science that has existed over the centuries and gave rise to many of the knowledge and teachings that appeared in the Middle Ages.  The Stoics believed that the Universe is material, and each of its cells, each element has its own destiny and destiny.  Therefore, in no case should one resist the events that occur.  Everything that happens has its own reasons, and a person living in harmony with nature, with this course of life situations, will be a worthy part of the universe.  The one who opposes all this will be unhappy.  For his fate is in any case destined, and not to leave her.  Therefore, everyone has a choice.  A person can put up with rock and live in happiness and rapture until death.  Or resist everything, making yourself and others miserable. </p>
