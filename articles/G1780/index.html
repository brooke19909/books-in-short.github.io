    <h2>  Accommodations </h2><p>  A lot of words of admiration are written about living conditions and impeccable, full of attention service.  It‚Äôs not even so important where to settle - in a modern building or in a bungalow - everywhere it will be cozy, elegant and elegant.  The rooms are single and double, many of them belong to the categories of "luxury" and "suite".  More on this will be described below.

And reviews too loudly shout about it. </p><p>  Sanatorium "Rus" (Sochi) for outdoor activities to offer its guests too much that can.

    <h2>  Arboretum and beach </h2><p>  And around the buildings, organically blended into the marvelous, delightful <span>dendrological park</span> on more than twenty hectares, you can find shady arbors, viewing platforms and breathe incomparable air.  In the evenings you can explore the city, because the sanatorium is located in the very center of Sochi, where guests will find entertainment for every taste around the clock.  And next to it is the sea!  With its own beach resort, which stretches for half a kilometer.  Here, of course, the bathtubs are not only marine, but also sunny and air, as well as all kinds of water activities and boat trips. </p><p>  The beach is located next to the buildings - from fifty to three hundred meters to the sea.  Everything is equipped here for the convenience of vacationers, according to reviews.  Sanatorium "Rus" (Sochi) has one of the most convenient pebble beaches on the coast.  There are umbrellas, sun loungers, and cabins - showers and changing rooms, a boat station and a rental point work.  And how nice to go on a fast boat on an exciting sea trip!  Or just grab a scooter or a banana.  Or go skiing! </p>

    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  As already mentioned above, the Rus resort is very favorably located.  Sochi receives enthusiastic reviews from both nature lovers who rested on walks in the wonderful arboretum and bought a drink at sea, and from people who managed to restore their health in a unique diagnostic and treatment center with a rich medical base.  Even professional athletes are not left without a training base, doing in the sports complex, gym and fitness rooms.  There are two pools - one with sea, the other with fresh water.  Business people can combine relaxation with working moments, even for conferences there are appropriate conditions.  And despite the abundance of other beautiful health resorts in Russia, one of the best is considered the sanatorium "Rus" (Sochi).  Reviews confirm this. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In terms of housing, this resort complex also beats its neighbors: there are three buildings, two bungalows and detached villas, in the latter there are only luxury apartments.  The most chic, of course, the first building is the Imperial, a real palace with three floors, a vivid example of Stalinist neoclassicism with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äãfifteen thousand square meters.  This building, built in 1954, is fundamentally different from all modern - and often surprisingly beautiful - buildings of the city: with the elegance of fountains, with the splendor of <span>marble stairs,</span> especially the one that leads to the sea.  And the panorama that opens to the residents of the upper floors, in general, can not be described.  This is what the Rus resort is especially proud of in Sochi.  The Primorsky building from the neighboring sanatorium complex could be compared with the Imperial, if we did not consider the purely architectural merits of these buildings. </p>

    <h2>  About documents and procedures </h2><p>  In addition to providing assistance to the spa and sanatorium, since 2015, the sanatorium also heals people with compulsory health insurance if they provide a compulsory medical insurance policy.  Specialists work fruitfully - cardiologists, pediatricians, therapists, endocrinologists, neurologists, urologists, obstetrician-gynecologists, otolaryngologists, ophthalmologists, dermatologists and proctologists.  Arriving on the resort cards in the sanatorium "Rus" (Sochi), there were many reviews about the treatment, and all of them are full of gratitude.  Strange if it would be otherwise.  Here, each vacationer is treated like a loved one, wherever he comes - to be treated or have fun.  So far, those treated by the policy have not so much been received by the Rus sanatorium in Sochi, reviews are quantitatively lost in the general flow, since this is a new business.  If there is no sanatorium-resort card, it can be issued for a fee according to the approved price list, today it costs one and a half thousand rubles, if there is the possibility of providing the OMS and SNILS policy or a copy thereof. </p><p>  Children can also be healed, but only from the age of five and always accompanied by at least one of the parents.  The treatment and the number of procedures are determined by the supervising doctor, based on the diagnosis, the severity of the disease, its stage and phase, as well as its attendant ones.  All this should be indicated in the spa card or identified during the examination.  The recommendations of doctors advising here are also taken into account.  Sanatorium "Rus" (Sochi) provided photos on their sites in such quantity and quality that it is rather difficult to choose the most interesting ones, however, some of the life of vacationers is represented here.  By the way, over the list of examinations and procedures, you can get paid services, their huge assortment.  Vouchers also do not provide for course treatment with medicines and hydrogen sulfide macetine baths, even if they are prescribed by the attending physician, since such procedures are provided only by the Rus resort in Sochi for a fee.  Reviews, however, are about this procedure - purely positive. </p>

    <h2>  History </h2><p>  Since the middle of the last century, the sanatorium has been repeatedly updated.  Equipment in the hospital is fully consistent with the profile.  Here people with diseases of the nervous system, as well as the musculoskeletal system, urological and gynecological profiles undergo rehabilitation.  A computer tomograph has sixty-four rows of detectors, its characteristics are unique, therefore, computed tomography effectively helps diagnose diseases.  Therefore, reviews are good about this Palace of Health.  Sanatorium "Rus" Sochi recommends for the treatment and restoration of health in the first place. </p><p>  Residents of Russia have always loved to relax and be treated in a city where all sorts of healing factors are combined: the climate is subtropical, the sea is warm and gentle, the vegetation is rich, mineral springs are plentiful - the famous Matsesta and other healing and drinking waters are used.  It is the abundance of exceptional features that annually calls for huge flows of vacationers, and the most fabulous place in which they manage to settle is the Rus resort (Sochi).  Reviews are probably written by almost everyone who rested here, because everywhere there is a huge amount.  All Sochi sanatoriums welcome guests.  But in this hospital they also know how to correctly receive them. </p>
