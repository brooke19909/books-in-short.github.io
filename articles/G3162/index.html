  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Valuation of fixed assets</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the practice of economic activity of enterprises quite often used such a thing as the assessment of fixed assets.  The vast majority of companies in the course of their activities acquire property.  Sometimes his service life is calculated in months, after which he is deducted from the balance sheet, sometimes more than a year. </p><p>  In the latter case, these are <span>fixed assets.</span>  Here, along with the rest of the property, they sometimes have to be evaluated. </p><p>  <strong>When such an assessment is needed</strong> </p><p>  This procedure is necessary in the following cases: </p><p>  - for tax purposes; </p><p>  - at privatization measures; </p><p>  - for the redemption of certain objects of the property complex; </p><p>  - at registration of lease relations; </p><p>  - upon conclusion of a loan agreement with a pledge of property; </p><p>  - at formation of the price for sale; </p><p>  - in assessing the authorized capital; </p><p>  -in the event of property disputes. </p><p>  However, the most important assessment of fixed assets in the current work.  If the management of the enterprise owns this information at a certain point in time, this significantly <span>increases the competitiveness of the company.</span>  In this case, operational efficiency in management is much easier, and production and financial risks become easier to identify.  Naturally, provided that the entire assessment process is carried out correctly. </p><p>  <strong>Assessment Types</strong> </p><p>  In modern accounting and economic practice, the valuation of fixed assets can be carried out in several ways.  We give a brief description of them. </p><p>  1. Full or inventory - represents the value of fixed assets at the time of their acquisition.  This includes all shipping and installation costs. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  2. The residual value is the most necessary category, calculated by subtracting depreciation expenses from the total cost. </p><p>  3. Recovery assessment determines the value of these funds, taking into account their depreciation, but based on <span>market prices.</span>  Therefore, sometimes it can exceed the full cost. </p><p>  4. The <span>book value is</span> reflected in the accounting documents of the enterprise, on its basis, the calculation of taxes.  It is calculated according to a mixed scheme, since part of the objects are taken into account at <span>replacement cost,</span> and part - at full. </p><p>  5. The market valuation of the <span>property of the enterprise,</span> perhaps the most clearly reflects the price of fixed assets.  Everything has been taken into account here - initial cost, depreciation, market situation and even the existing financial situation of the company.  It is this indicator that appears in all agreements and contracts in transactions. </p><p>  <strong>How is it made</strong> </p><p>  Valuation of fixed assets is carried out in monetary terms and is a rather complicated procedure.  To conduct it for the internal needs of the enterprise and current accounting usually cost their own specialists.  They have all the tools in their hands for accurate and thorough calculations.  It is enough to take into account the existing data and add new ones.  Moreover, in the arsenal of accountants there are now perfect software products that require only the timely input of certain information.  The program will give the result itself. </p><p>  However, when an independent evaluation is required, the services of a third-party organization are simply necessary.  Most often, such circumstances arise in contentious situations: the <span>division of property, the</span> withdrawal of participants from a joint stock company, debt restructuring, bankruptcy, and so on.  Despite the high commissions charged by such firms, this option has several positive features.  The most important are objectivity and competence.  These factors, coupled with licensed services, should ensure that the evaluation results are recognized by all parties.  However, the participation of one or another organization can be agreed in advance in writing. </p>
