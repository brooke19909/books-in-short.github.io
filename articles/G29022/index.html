Let's discover the secret. </p><h2>  Most visited </h2><p>  In the largest - Industrial - district, the park named after Yuri Gagarin (Samara) spreads over an area of ​​34 hectares.  It was discovered a long time ago - in 1976.  This place he occupies today is considered the geographical center of the city.  And before that there was the most ordinary, unremarkable outskirts.

    <h2>  Sad story </h2><p>  Once in this forest (in the 1930s-1940s), country houses of NKVD workers were located.  Not far from them, citizens were buried, but not dead.  The shot.  Not here killed - in other places.  And then secretly, at night they brought them here and dumped them in common graves.  According to official figures, over the years they have recruited no less than a few thousand people. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For a very long time they could not find the whereabouts of these secret burials.  There are a lot of trees in the park.  Oaks, in fact, were planted in order to hide these terrible places.  And therefore, over each pit, when 20-30 people were thrown in there, a young oak tree was planted.  The Chekists thought that such strong, powerful trees would never be destroyed.  And the remains of the unfortunate, those killed innocently will not be found.  But found.  Found nine graves.  In them - about 3600 people. </p><p>  Now in place of one such hole is an obelisk of marble.  And the inscription that states that victims of repression are buried here.  “Let us worship the memory of the innocent victims,” the words urge. </p><p>  And many have heard about it.  Veterans from other cities, for example, even specially come to the address: Samara, Gagarin Park - to pay tribute to these people. </p><p>  But enough about the sad.  Today is a different life.  Of course, Samaritans know about this historical place and always remember.  They come here to the park named after Yuri Gagarin (Samara was not accidentally famous for him), also in order to look at samples of military equipment of the Great Patriotic War.  They are exhibited on the field for special viewing. </p>

    <h2>  And a lake with swans </h2><p>  According to the design of this zone, everything is created here for a comfortable rest for people.  Powerful oaks, fluffy spruce, curly maples - this is what is remarkable for the park named after Yuri Gagarin (Samara). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Also, from the day of its foundation, squirrels live in this recreation area.  They can be hand-fed, which gives great pleasure to both adults and children. </p><p>  The stadium is small, the stands are also not very many.  But there is where to exercise.  And in the winter to drive on skates. </p><p>  In the summer at your service is a wonderful sports ground.  It is very spacious.  So there is enough space for everyone.  Also in the summer months, various competitions are held here.  For example, karting.  And in this place there are free yoga classes.

With an artificial island. </p><p>  Note that the park named after Yuri Gagarin (Samara) has every reason to boast of its own complex of recreational and sporting events.  Both are very diverse and healthy.  And when there are bike paths, and even with the rental of sports equipment, the number of people who want to spend leisure time here will increase significantly. </p><p>  Many <span>summer cafes</span> and all kinds of entertainments have Gagarina Park (Samara).

    <h2>  "Three Bears" </h2><p>  This is not the name of a popular fairy tale.  Such a sonorous name was chosen by one cafe that "settled" here 19 years ago.  Workers have gained extensive experience, which allows them to maintain leadership in the market.  And continue to improve the quality of their services.  Not only is this culinary institution the largest in the park, its menu includes dishes of oriental and Caucasian cuisine.  Chefs will amaze any gourmet with their skill. </p><p>  But that is not all.  The cafe has billiards, table tennis, air hockey.  Plus a dance floor.  Every evening, pleasant music sounds.  There are dancing. </p><p>  But the main highlight, of course, is the rides.  From extreme to family.  For example, Soft Room is a three-story complex for children.  There are many interesting things - a dry pool with balls, all sorts of slides, stairs, trampolines, labyrinths and games. </p><p>  And the “trick" is free Wi-Fi.  And the only one in the whole park! </p><p>  Now you understand why so many visitors like to come here on weekdays and weekends? </p>

    <h2>  Ferris wheel </h2><p>  And now about how Gagarin’s park in Samara loses a little.  Attractions always require new, more advanced.  And it is desirable to provide this. </p><p>  The fact is that five years ago, in 2010, they began to build a real miracle in the park: a ferris wheel 80 meters high.  It was planned that it will be the highest in all of Russia. </p><p>  Two years have passed.  The wheel is not started.  Moreover, they generally dismantled it.  Removed everything at the root!  And therefore, today the old <span>ferris wheel</span> is still spinning and turning <span>,</span> raising tourists to a height of 25 meters. </p><p>  But there are <span>roller coasters</span> and all kinds of turntables upside down in the park for thrill-seekers.  It’s even scary to look at them, not to sit down and ride yourself! </p>

    <h2>  Sail quietly on a boat </h2><p>  You can rent a boat or a catamaran to ride on the man-made canal in the summer, this also distinguishes the park named after Yuri Gagarin (Samara).  Attractions, entertainment, and there are such: you can ride a horse and ride in front of everyone.  Or perch on a pony.  But this is more suitable for the kids. </p><p>  There are also playgrounds with all the tricks and wonders, a kart track. </p><p>  Would you like to rush on skates on clean malls?  Please go to the rental point.  All the necessary set, including a helmet, elbow pads and knee pads, will be issued to you.  Do you like a bike?  Also there is such a thing for those who wish. </p><p>  Back in Soviet times, the real An-10 was in the forest recreation area.  This plane was converted to the Antoshka children's cinema.  The guys ran there for the cartoons.  But when a fire broke out in the early 90s, it was dismantled and not renewed.  And it would be necessary.  Vacationers have such a request. </p><p>  Also, until 1997, the city zoo was located on this territory.  He was then removed to another place. </p><h2>  Families come </h2><p>  Beautiful alleys, many entertainment events and attractions, rental of sports equipment, several beautiful houses where you can have a bite to eat or take a tasty treat with you, a stage where concerts and other cultural programs take place every week - all this is pleasant to the townspeople.  They gladly go to the Gagarin park (Samara) with whole companies or families. </p><p>  His territory is always well-groomed, neat.  And all the different buildings, the same outlets and small cafes, have their own special design style.  It harmoniously fits into the overall natural landscape. </p>
