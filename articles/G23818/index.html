    <p>  The brand-new device from Blackview completely destroys prevailing stereotypes and the BV8000 Pro model can be called a breakthrough in the segment of secure mobile devices.  The device received an attractive and powerful ‚Äústuffing‚Äù on board, and its capabilities are comparable to conventional premium smartphones. </p><p>  So, the hero of today's article is the <span>Blackview BV8000 Pro</span> smartphone <span>.</span>  <span>User reviews</span> , advantages and disadvantages of the gadget, as well as the appropriateness of its purchase will be discussed in this review. </p><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  The device comes in a white box made of cardboard.  The design can not be called original, because the whole design rests in a solid white color with modest blue accents in the corners of the package.  There is no beautiful girl holding a phone, no sea sunsets - only a bare white background. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the flip side there is a meager specification, award icons at some exhibitions and a couple of custom reviews of owners on the Blackview BV8000 Pro in the form of praises.  And again, everything was done in black and white, without a hint of other colors.  Why such scarcity is not entirely clear, but we are still more interested in the contents of the box, rather than the wrapper. </p>

Owners in their reviews of the Blackview BV8000 Pro were especially pleased with the rare OTG cable and USB adapter, which, as a rule, had to be purchased separately.  The tool in the face of a small screwdriver looks impressive and does not look like another Chinese consumer goods.  The only instruction turned out to be some kind of confusing and with too original design, so you have to study it seriously and carefully. </p><div id="sjcont"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The main task of such devices is to look and work where other smartphones cannot afford it.  Our respondent fully complies with this requirement.  By design, it is noticeable that the designers tried to give the gadget an external likeness of premium devices.  Judging by the reviews of the owners on the Blackview BV8000 Pro (IP68), then a good half of users consider the smartphone a brutal and expensive-looking device. </p>

    <p>  The body of the device is made of metal in combination with high-quality plastic.  Almost the entire front part is occupied by a five-inch display, protected by durable third-class glass from the venerable "Gorilla".  Below are the usual buttons for the Android platform: Back, Home, and Menu.  There you can see the front camera eye and light sensors with the approximation. </p><h2>  Design features </h2><p>  The device has a metal perimeter, and at the corners are rubberized inserts.  The latter with due reliability protect the device from falls.  On the right side you can see the power button of the device, a fingerprint sensor and the camera shutter button.  I am glad that the manufacturer heeded the wishes of users and feedback on past generations of gadgets and moved the fingerprint scanner to the side.  On the one hand, this is unusual, but judging by the reviews on the Blackview BV8000 Pro, it‚Äôs very convenient to use.  It should also be noted that the sensor works quickly, correctly and almost instantly gives its user access. </p>

    <p>  On the opposite side is the volume rocker and a function button that can be configured for almost any action, for which many thanks also to the designers. </p><h2>  Protection </h2><p>  The device is protected from moisture and dust according to IP68 class, that is, the device will feel fine and work at a depth of up to three meters, and without time limits.  In addition, the smartphone is not afraid of falling onto bare asphalt from a height of human growth and a sharp change in temperature conditions. </p><p>  Users in their reviews of the waterproof Blackview BV8000 Pro (IP68) are especially grateful to the designers for the lack of plugs while maintaining protective features.  By introducing Capless USB technology, the manufacturer completely got rid of these ever-tearing and interfering elements. </p>

    <p>  The minijack for the headset also has no plugs.  In this case, you should not be afraid of moisture: the technology has been thoroughly tested and field tested, so there is no reason for concern.  Such solutions can often be found on A-group smartphones, such as the Galaxy S8 series from Samsung, the Xperia XZ from Sony, and the LG G6. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The device received an intelligent IPS-matrix, which can easily cope with high resolution at a resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels (Full HD).  An acceptable pixel density of 440 ppi allows you to give a good picture, as well as good contrast.  The brightness margin is quite impressive, so on a sunny day the information is easily read from the screen. </p><p>  In addition, viewing angles also pleased: the maximum angle for IPS-matrices allows you to quietly flip through photos or watch videos in the company of several like-minded people.  In general, judging by the reviews on the Blackview BV8000 Pro (IP68), users are satisfied with the available screen capabilities.  The results of a smartphone (by benchmarks and visually) are no worse than models from the premium segment, with the only difference being that the latter do not have such protection. </p><p>  As mentioned above, the display received a reliable and impenetrable glass from Gorilla of the third series, coupled with a good oleophobic coating.  In addition to the glass itself, there is still a factory film on top: it does not happen to be superfluous, and indeed there is none, but it provides protection.  Moreover, the latter does not happen much. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The fresh Mediatek processor Helio P25 series is responsible for performance, and the graphic component lies on the shoulders of the same modern Mali T880 MP2 accelerator.  The manufacturer did not spare RAM for the device (6 GB), as well as the internal memory - 64 GB. </p>

    <p>  If you want to save money, you can buy a more modest version with 4 GB, but it's not worth it.  Judging by the reviews on the Blackview BV8000 Pro, 4 g of igabyte is already not enough for modern applications and the smartphone on some especially ‚Äúheavy‚Äù applications starts to freeze, sag and lag.  Therefore, it is better not to be stingy and take the normal, and not a stripped-down version of the gadget. </p><p>  As for the speed of work, there are no questions here: the interface is lightning fast, programs are installed and launched in a matter of seconds, and applications work without problems. </p><h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  The gadget received a non-removable 4180 mAh battery.  Even with the most active use of the smartphone, it‚Äôs enough for almost the whole day, and this despite the gluttonous Android platform. </p><p>  If you are a fan of long trips and toys for you is not the main thing, then you can set the maximum energy saving mode, where the battery life will increase almost three times. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  Reviews on the Blackview BV8000 Pro are all positive.  The manufacturer finally managed to construct not only a securely protected mobile gadget, but also to make it technically savvy. </p><p>  The model turned out to be beautiful in everything - from the appearance to the filling.  As a result, we got not only a good smartphone with impressive technical capabilities, but also a fully protected gadget.  Blackview BV8000 Pro is a unique device, which has no analogues yet, therefore the verdict is unambiguous - it is recommended for purchase. </p>
