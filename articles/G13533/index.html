    <h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  Hotels in Pattaya are presented in a sufficient variety, there are more urban establishments located far from the coastline.  It is quite difficult to find a hotel on the coast, but it is not necessary.  Moreover, most Asian hotels not only do not fit their description, but in principle are able to spoil the holiday.  That is why it is necessary to be extremely careful, even demanding in choosing a hotel, to pay great attention to the reviews of real vacationers, which will help to objectively look at all potential options.  Most often, tourists choose hotels in Pattaya and Thailand in general, for reasons that they will exclusively spend the night in a room.  We suggest paying attention to a mid-range hotel.  This is Red Planet Pattaya (ex. Tune) 3 *, which we will help to evaluate from all the necessary sides.  First of all, it is interesting to know what conditions for vacationers he can offer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  So, the Red Planet Hotel Pattaya boasts an excellent location, because the beach is literally within easy reach.  The entertainment center is only 4 km away - you can get on foot or use public transport.  An international hospital is within walking distance, so in case of sunburn or the slightest health problems, you can always go there for medical assistance. </p>

    <p>  Within walking distance from the hotel are shops, bars, restaurants, all the entertainment of the city.  Of course, if you plan to go on vacation with young children, this hotel is unlikely to suit you.  And all because in the season it is quite crowded and noisy, the music does not cease in the evening. </p><h2>  Population </h2><p>  Tourists note that check-in at the Red Planet Pattaya (ex. Tune) 3 * hotel is fast enough.  Even those tourists who arrive earlier than the due date for check-in receive the room keys within 10-15 minutes.  The vacationers will also be pleased with the absence of a deposit.  As in any other Asian hotel, when checking in in the presence of hotel staff, it is necessary to check the condition of the equipment and plumbing, in case of the slightest breakage, ask to be immediately eliminated. </p><div id="sjcont"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  The hotel is considered quite large by local standards - vacationers are invited to stay in one of the 192 rooms.  Most of the rooms are double with twin beds, which can be moved if necessary.  There are rooms equipped for disabled people in Red Planet Pattaya (ex. Tune) 3 *.  The description of the rooms fully corresponds to the category of the hotel. </p><p>  Each room has a private bathroom with all the necessary bath accessories and cosmetic products necessary for hygiene procedures.  Moreover, all vacationers will receive a TV with satellite channels, including Russian.  Of course, on vacation, TV is not a matter of prime necessity, but it allows you to keep abreast of the latest world news, and is also a great opportunity to relax in the evening watching a fascinating movie. </p>

    <p>  Given the sweltering heat and stuffiness inherent in the season, each room also has air conditioning.  It is he who is responsible for maintaining freshness and pleasant coolness.  In fact, for a small price you will be offered good conditions at the Red Planet Pattaya (ex. Tune) 3 * hotel.  Reviews of real vacationers only emphasize this, because the hotel managed to get a good rating on the most popular tourist portals.  The rooms are small but clean and comfortable.  There is everything you need for relaxation.  Each room has a safe designed to store valuables, money and documents. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The lack of a refrigerator can confuse some vacationers, but given the fact that the budget cost of living in it can be forgiven, this drawback.  Moreover, most tourists eat at local bars and restaurants.  Unfortunately, the rooms do not have balconies, but the hotel is located on the second street from the beach, so tourists would still not be able to admire the sea coast.  Large windows on the floor, which fill the room with the necessary light, have replaced the balcony. </p>

    <h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Like most other city-style hotels, Red Planet does not have a huge landscaped area.  If you are used to relaxing in luxury Turkish hotels, your first impression will probably not be the most encouraging.  But the rest in Pattaya, in principle, is not built around the hotel, it is so beautiful and interesting here that the hotel and the room in it are necessary only in order to put yourself in order and get enough sleep. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  No modern tourist can imagine his life without the Internet.  So, all vacationers, upon checking into the room, will receive a password from wireless Internet.  The signal is enough to communicate with relatives and friends, as well as watch your favorite movies and shows in real time. </p><p>  The hotel is under 24-hour security, which not all hotels in Pattaya can offer.  It turns out that tourists and vacationers can not worry about their safety.  There is also parking at the hotel, which is often used by tourists who rent motorbikes at local companies - the most popular form of transport in the city. </p>

    <p>  The rooms are cleaned daily, towels and bed linen are changed according to the first requirement of vacationers - the rooms are maintained in perfect cleanliness.  At the reception, an airport shuttle is available at an additional cost.  Moreover, at the information desk you can find a detailed map of the city showing all the attractions, cultural and historical places.  The kind staff will help determine the excursion program. </p><p>  If your flight Moscow - Thailand takes you to the resort ahead of schedule, you can always leave your things in the locker room, change clothes and go to the beach without wasting a minute of time. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Staying at the Red Planet Pattaya (ex. Tune) 3 * hotel means going to the restaurant for breakfast.  In fact, for Asian resorts, having breakfast is the norm.  They are typical here: rice, eggs, sausages, sliced, fresh fruits and vegetables, coffee, tea, juices to choose from.  Of course, after a few days of staying at the hotel, I can get fed up with breakfast, since they do not differ in variety, but certainly no one will remain hungry. </p>

    <h2>  Beach and sea </h2><p>  The sea is just a 5-7 minute walk from the hotel.  But not all tourists consider this place suitable for a beach holiday.  But just a little walk along the coast, as you are sure to find a quiet little place with a clean sandy beach and the sea.  Many tourists believe that in Pattaya, in principle, you can not swim due to widespread dirt.  It must be admitted that this is a profound error: the sea is not dirtier than what we can see in the resorts of the Black Sea region.  And all because in season a huge number of vacationers from different parts of the globe gather on the beach.  Moreover, do not forget that Pattaya, among other things, is also a port city.  If you want perfect white sand and crystal sea water, go to the nearest <span>island of Koh Lan.</span> </p>
