By conducting experiments, a person can reveal an objective law.  The study of phenomena and their correlation also contributes to this. </p>

    <h2>  Empirical methods of cognition </h2><p>  According to the scientific concept, empirical and theoretical knowledge consists of several methods.  This is a set of steps necessary to solve a specific problem (in this case, we are talking about identifying previously unknown patterns).  The first empirical method is observation.  It is a focused study of objects, which primarily relies on various senses (perceptions, sensations, ideas). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At its initial stage, observation gives an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe external characteristics of the object of knowledge.  However, the ultimate goal of this <span>research method</span> is to determine the deeper and internal properties of the subject.  A common misconception lies in the idea that scientific observation is passive <span>contemplation.</span>  <span>This is</span> far from the case. </p><h2>  Observation </h2><p>  Empirical observation is detailed.  It can be either direct or indirect by various technical devices and devices (for example, a camera, telescope, microscope, etc.).  As science develops, observation becomes more complex and complex.  This method has several exceptional qualities: objectivity, certainty and unambiguity of purpose.  When using devices, an additional role is played by the interpretation of their readings. </p><p>  In the social and human sciences, empirical and theoretical knowledge assimilates heterogeneously.  Observation in these disciplines is particularly difficult.  It becomes dependent on the personality of the researcher, his principles and attitudes, as well as the degree of interest in the subject. </p><p>  Observation cannot be carried out without a specific concept or idea.  It should be based on a certain hypothesis and record certain facts (in this case, only related and representative facts will be indicative). </p><p>  Theoretical and empirical studies differ in detail.  For example, observation has its own specific functions that are not characteristic of other methods of cognition.  First of all, it is providing a person with information, without which it is impossible to further research and put forward hypotheses.  Observation is the fuel on which thinking works.  Without new facts and impressions, there will be no new knowledge.  In addition, it is through observation that we can compare and verify the truth of the results of preliminary theoretical studies. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Experiment </h2><p>  Different theoretical and empirical methods of cognition are also distinguished by the degree of their intervention in the process under study.  A person can observe him strictly from the outside, and can analyze his properties on his own experience.  This function is carried out by one of the empirical methods of cognition - experiment.  In terms of importance and contribution to the final result of research, it is in no way inferior to observation. </p><p>  An experiment is not only a purposeful and active intervention of a person in the course of the investigated process, but also its change, as well as reproduction in specially prepared conditions.  This method of cognition requires much more effort than observation.  During the experiment, the object of study is isolated from any extraneous influence.  A clean and clear environment is created.  The experimental conditions are fully defined and controlled.  Therefore, this method, on the one hand, corresponds to the natural laws of nature, and on the other hand, differs in an artificial, human-defined essence. </p>

    <h2>  Experiment structure </h2><p>  All theoretical and empirical methods have a certain ideological burden.  An experiment that is carried out in several stages is no exception.  First of all, planning and step-by-step construction take place (the goal, means, type, etc. are determined).  Then comes the stage of the experiment.  Moreover, it occurs under the perfect control of a person.  Upon completion of the active phase, it is the interpretation of the results. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Both empirical and theoretical knowledge has a specific structure.  In order for an experiment to take place, the experimenters themselves, the object of the experiment, instruments and other necessary equipment, a technique and a hypothesis that are confirmed or disproved, are required. </p>

    <h2>  Devices and installations </h2><p>  Every year, scientific research is becoming more difficult.  They need an increasingly modern technique that allows them to study what is inaccessible to simple human senses.  If earlier scientists were limited to their own eyesight and hearing, now they have at their disposal unprecedented experimental facilities. </p><p>  During the use of the device, it can have a negative impact on the studied object.  For this reason, the result of an experiment sometimes diverges from its original goals.  Some researchers are trying to deliberately achieve such results.  In science, this process is called randomization.  If the experiment takes on a random nature, then its consequences become an additional object of analysis.  The possibility of randomization is another feature that distinguishes empirical and theoretical knowledge. </p><h2>  Comparison, description and measurement </h2><p>  Comparison is the third empirical method of cognition.  This operation allows you to identify differences and similarities of objects.  Empirical, theoretical analysis cannot be carried out without in-depth knowledge of the subject.  In turn, many facts begin to play with new colors, after the researcher compares them with another texture known to him.  Comparison of objects is carried out within the framework of the features essential for a particular experiment.  At the same time, objects that are compared in one line can be incomparable in their other characteristics.  This empirical technique is based on analogy.  It underlies the <span>comparative historical method, which is</span> important for science <span>.</span> </p><p>  Methods of empirical and theoretical knowledge can be combined with each other.  But almost never does research go without description.  This cognitive operation captures the results of a previous experiment.  For description, scientific notation systems are used: graphs, charts, figures, diagrams, tables, etc. </p><p>  The last empirical method of cognition is measurement.  It is carried out by means of special means.  Measurement is necessary to determine the numerical value of the desired measured quantity.  Such an operation is necessarily carried out in accordance with strict algorithms and rules accepted in science. </p>

    <h2>  Theoretical knowledge </h2><p>  In science, theoretical and empirical knowledge has different fundamental supports.  In the first case, this is the distant use of rational methods and logical procedures, and in the second, direct interaction with the object.  Theoretical knowledge uses intellectual abstractions.  One of its most important methods is formalization - the display of knowledge in a symbolic and sign form. </p><p>  At the first stage of the expression of thinking, the usual human language is used.  It is distinguished by complexity and constant variability, because of which it cannot be a universal scientific tool.  The next stage of formalization is associated with the creation of formalized (artificial) languages.  They have a specific purpose - a strict and accurate expression of knowledge that cannot be achieved with natural speech.  Such a system of characters can take the format of formulas.  He is very popular in mathematics and other <span>exact sciences,</span> where you can not do without numbers. </p><p>  With the help of symbolism, a person eliminates the ambiguous understanding of the record, makes it shorter and clearer for future use.  Not a single study can do without speed and simplicity in the use of its tools, and, therefore, all scientific knowledge.  Empirical and theoretical study equally needs formalization, but it is at the theoretical level that it assumes extremely important and fundamental significance. </p><p>  An artificial language, created within a narrow scientific framework, is becoming a universal means of exchanging thoughts and communication of specialists.  This is the fundamental task of methodology and logic.  These sciences are necessary for the transmission of information in an understandable, systematic way, spared the shortcomings of the natural language. </p>

    <h2>  The importance of formalization </h2><p>  Formalization allows you to refine, analyze, clarify and define concepts.  The empirical and theoretical levels of cognition cannot do without them; therefore, the system of artificial symbols has always played and will play a large role in science.  Conventional and expressed in spoken language concepts seem obvious and clear.  However, due to their ambiguity and uncertainty, they are not suitable for scientific research. </p><p>  Formalization is especially important when analyzing alleged evidence.  The sequence of formulas based on specialized rules is distinguished by the accuracy and rigor necessary for science.  In addition, formalization is necessary for programming, algorithmization and computerization of knowledge. </p><h2>  Axiomatic method </h2><p>  Another method of theoretical research is the axiomatic method.  It is a convenient way of deductively expressing scientific hypotheses.  Theoretical and empirical sciences cannot be imagined without terms.  Very often they arise due to the construction of axioms.  For example, in Euclidean geometry, the fundamental terms of angle, line, point, plane, etc. were formulated at one time. </p><p>  In the framework of theoretical knowledge, scientists formulate axioms - postulates that do not require proof and are the initial statements for the further construction of theories.  An example of this situation is the idea that the whole is always larger than the part.  Using axioms, a system for deriving new terms is constructed.  Following the rules of theoretical knowledge, a scientist can obtain unique theorems from a limited number of postulates.  At the same time, the <span>axiomatic method is</span> much more effective for teaching and classification than for discovering new patterns. </p>

    <h2>  Hypothetical-deductive method </h2><p>  Although theoretical, empirical scientific methods differ from each other, they are often used together.  An example of such an application is the <span>hypothetical-deductive method.</span>  With the help of it, new systems of closely intertwined hypotheses are built.  Not on their basis are new claims regarding empirical, experimentally proven facts.  The method of deriving a conclusion from archaic hypotheses is called deduction.  This term is familiar to many thanks to Sherlock Holmes novels.  Indeed, the popular literary character often uses the deductive method in his investigations, with the help of which he builds a harmonious picture of the crime from many disparate facts. </p><p>  In science, the same system operates.  This method of theoretical knowledge has its own clear structure.  First of all, familiarization with the texture takes place.  Then assumptions are made about the patterns and causes of the phenomenon under study.  For this, various logical tricks are used.  Guesses are evaluated according to their probability (the most probable is selected from this heap).  All hypotheses are checked for consistency with logic and compatibility with basic scientific principles (for example, laws by physicists).  Consequences are derived from the assumption, which are then verified by experiment.  The hypothetical-deductive method is not so much a method of new discovery as a method of substantiating scientific knowledge.  This theoretical tool was used by such great minds as Newton and Galileo. </p>
