The family lived poorly, the land plots were very scarce, and there was a whole problem to feed on them.  Parents had to earn extra money.  Sergei as a child lost his mother and two older brothers - Vasily and Vladimir. </p><p>  During the First World War, fierce bloody battles took place in these places.  And the family of Sergei Ivanovich moved to the Urals, in the village of Shumikha, fleeing the Kaiser troops.  Then Gritsevtsi left for Zlatoust.

    <h2>  Education </h2><p>  First he graduated from the Shumkhinsky seven-year railway school.  In 1931, according to the Komsomol ticket, he was sent to study at the Orenburg military school of pilots, which he graduated with honors in 1932. Then, in 1936, he entered the Odessa military school. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Work </h2><p>  Immediately after leaving school (in 1927), Sergey Gritsevets went to work at the Shumikha station.  But he did not work there long.  And in the same year he switched to the Zlatoust Mechanical Plant as a student of a locksmith.  And after training, he began working in the hobby workshop. </p><p>  Thanks to his talent for working with people, in 1931 he was elected secretary of the Komsomol cell and the Komsomol committee of the plant.  A little later, he became a delegate to the first congress of drummers. </p><h2>  Military service </h2><p>  After graduating from the Orenburg flight school in 1932, Sergei Ivanovich served as a fighter pilot in the Kiev Aviation Division.  Since 1933, he became the commanding officer in the first Krasnoznamensk aviation fighter squadron named after Lenin in the Trans-Baikal Military District. </p><p>  Later he commanded first a detachment, and then a regiment.  After graduating from the Odessa military school, Sergei Ivanovich was asked to stay in it to work.  So he became an instructor for pilots. </p><p>  Since 1938, already in the position of senior lieutenant, Sergey Ivanovich Gritsevets, whose biography is closely related to aviation, served in a special purpose flight school, which was known as the 20th Kirovabad.  In it, he trained Spanish military pilots.  Sergei has repeatedly petitioned to send him to fight in Spain. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gritsevets Sergey Ivanovich biography" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1272029.jpg" width="295"></div>

But until the end of May, for various reasons, the composition of the group decreased by twenty-five people.  Five died (one of them during the training), two were missing, ten were injured, two more fell ill, and six were expelled as unsuitable for front-line service. </p><p>  As a result, a new group consisting of thirty-four pilots was sent to replace them.  It included the most experienced pilots, including Sergey Gritsevets.  In the summer of 1938 the group was delivered to Spain.  Sergei took the family name Gorev.  Until the end of October, he participated in many battles, making 115 sorties. </p><p>  According to official figures, he personally shot down six enemy aircraft and another twenty-four in a group with military comrades.  Especially distinguished in heavy battles on the river.  Ebro.  In this area, the rebels widely used the latest ME-109 fighters, which were equipped with more powerful guns and surpassed the Soviet I-16s in speed. </p><p>  According to archival documents, Sergey Ivanovich Gritsevets, whose photo is in this article, showed very good results in Spain (42 battles, 7 personally shot down enemy planes).  In December 1938, Sergey became a major, and in 1939 he was awarded the title Hero of the USSR.  Moreover, it should be noted that he was never a captain.  He was immediately awarded the rank of major after senior lieutenant. </p><p>  The hardest in Spain were the last three months when the final fights were on.  At that time, thirty fighters and bombers were personally shot down by Sergey. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Khalkhin Gol River </h2><p>  After the Spanish war, Sergei Ivanovich was offered the post of chief of the Borisoglebsk military aviation school.  But he refused her and went to serve in the Far East.  Once again, Sergei Ivanovich showed his flying skills and strong character in brilliant battles in the sky over the Khalkhin-Gol river. </p><p>  At that time, the Japanese attacked Mongolia.  As a result, military equipment and Soviet troops were sent to defend the republic.  Major Sergey Ivanovich Gritsevets was included among them as one of the best fighter pilots. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sergey Gritsevets biography" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1272030.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In Mongolia, he flew an I-16, then was appointed commander of a separate group of Chaika fighters.  From June 22 to August 30, 1939 he made 138 sorties, shot down 12 enemy aircraft.  There he made another feat, rescuing the commander of the seventieth regiment - Zabaluev. </p><h2>  Achievements and exploits </h2><p>  In 1935, he led a team of six fighters.  The route ran from Bochkarev to Spassk-Dalniy.  Landing made in Khabarovsk.  Sergei Ivanovich with the group set a record during the flight, completing it in a hundred and ninety minutes. </p><p>  During the Spanish war, S. Gritsevets practically accomplished a feat when, in half an hour (during one battle), he shot down 7 enemy aircraft (5 of which were fiat fighters).  This was the first time in the history of aviation.  Sergei flew to the I-16.  During the battle, his plane was completely riddled with bullets, but he was still able to land him at the airport.  The battle was watched by numerous witnesses.  And the English correspondent then wrote a separate article about the air battle. </p><h2>  Feat in Mongolia </h2><p>  During the war in Mongolia, when the Japanese attacked the republic, as already mentioned, Gritsevets saved Major Zabaluev, the commander of the seventieth fighter regiment.  The next fierce battle was over over the territory that the Japanese captured.  Japanese fighters, shot down by Soviet pilots, flew down.  And to determine who was shot down - their own or the enemy, it was almost impossible. </p><p>  But Sergey Ivanovich Gritsevets, whose feat will be remembered for centuries and set as an example for young pilots, nevertheless noticed that a Soviet plane was shot down.  With a keen eye he captured the picture of the battle and instantly appreciated the complexity of the situation.  The Japanese fighter, seeing easy prey, wanted to catch up and finish off the falling enemy aircraft.  But he was prevented by Gritsevets. </p><p>  He sharply directed his fighter towards the Japanese and in defensive bursts distracted him from his plan.  The battle continued on the sidelines, and Sergei Ivanovich continued to save the comrade‚Äôs plane.  After a short time, a burning fighter poked into the ground.  A pilot jumped out of it.  It was Major Zabaluev. </p><p>  He looked around and looked up at the sky.  Seeing a lone Soviet fighter, waved his helmet to him, saying goodbye.  It was impossible to survive.  Before the location of the Soviet troops was about sixty kilometers.  For walking, this distance is simply huge due to the fact that Japanese samurai roam around.  And a man in the steppe is in full view. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gritsevets Sergey Ivanovich monument" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1272021.jpg" width="405"></div>

    <p>  And suddenly Zabaluev saw that the fighter, which he noticed in the sky, shaking his wings and flying away in an easterly direction, suddenly returned and was on the decline.  It would be a certain death for many.  But Sergey Ivanovich Gritsevets did not abandon his comrade and took the risk, acting with utmost precision and caution. </p><p>  After jumping a little over the bumps, the fighter stopped not far from the major.  But these planes were single-seaters, and it seemed impossible to land the second pilot, let alone take off and take off in very difficult conditions.  Gritsevets was able to put a friend between his armored back and port side. </p><p>  And an hour later, Zabaluev was at his native airport, and Sergei Ivanovich swayed in the hands of pilots who threw him into the air.  This incident became a legend that was passed from mouth to mouth.  And everyone was ready to repeat this feat, if that happens. </p><p>  As a result, at the end of August 1939, the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Soviet Union decided to put bronze busts in the homeland of those awarded for exemplary tasks and heroism.  Received his award and Sergei Gritsevets - twice <span>Hero of the Soviet Union.</span> </p><h2>  Battle tactics </h2><p>  In his groups, he practiced all the tactics developed by Soviet pilots.  For example, separation of fighters of various types in height.  First, the I-16, located on top, attacked the enemy.  And sting the enemy down.  And there the enemy was met by I-15. </p><p>  In battles over the Khalkhin-Gol river, Sergei Ivanovich was appointed commander of a team flying on new I-153 fighters, which pilots affectionately called "The Seagulls."  Gritsevets Sergey Ivanovich not only quickly was able to master the new machine, but also immediately appreciated its strengths, which he immediately took advantage of.  He himself experienced the "Seagull" at different altitudes and flight modes. </p><p>  New aircraft were very different from the old increased maneuverability.  But the enemy did not know about it.  Sergei Ivanovich ordered that this be kept secret until they were "cracked."  And so, the battle began.  The first flew Gritsevets, followed by the rest.  The attack was frontal.  And this meant that the initiative belongs to the one who of the opponents will turn around faster to get in the tail.  The enemy did not know about the increased maneuverability of new fighters.  And as soon as he saw the enemy on his tail, he began to rush about, but the "Seagulls" killed everyone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gritsevets Sergey Ivanovich feat" class="if" height="235" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1272006.jpg" width="320"></div>

    <h2>  Personal life </h2><p>  Information about the personal life of the famous fighter pilot is very small.  It is known that Sergey Ivanovich Gritsevets was married.  His wife's name was Galina Evgenievna Orlova.  They had two daughters: Larisa and Nina.  The wife of Sergei Ivanovich became for him not only his beloved wife, but also a real fighting girlfriend. </p><p>  On duty, they often parted.  And the separation began from the first years of service.  During the absence of her husband, Galina often lived with her mother.  But long separations did not affect their feelings, and they lovingly wrote letters to each other in anticipation of an early meeting. </p><h2>  Character pilot </h2><p>  Gritsevets <strong> </strong>  I did not like grandiose and magnificent events.  He was a humble, unobtrusive man.  He always tried to stay away from fanfare, which he considered completely inappropriate.  Evading excessive attention to himself.  His heart was sympathetic and kind.  About the dead comrades, it hurt until death. </p><h2>  The death of the famous fighter pilot </h2><p>  But Gritsevets Sergey Ivanovich, <span>twice Hero of the Soviet Union,</span> did not manage to receive the insignia that he was supposed to.  By decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Council, he was entitled to the Golden Star medal.  It was established in October 1939. </p><p>  But Sergey Gritsevets died a month before.  A tragic accident cut short his life.  On September 13, the heroes of Khalkhin-Gol were met at the Central Moscow airfield.  Sergei Ivanovich failed to evade the ‚Äúgatherings‚Äù.  After them, he asked his superiors to let him go to Odessa, to visit his pregnant wife and daughter.  It was as if he foresaw his death. </p><p>  But they did not let him go, as the meeting with Stalin was coming.  And Gritsevets was on the list of invitees, and his absence would be immediately noticed.  But Commander Smushkevich stood up for Sergey Ivanovich, and the pilot of the squadron Viktor Grachev volunteered to take him to Odessa.  Sergei Ivanovich was given only a day to see his wife and daughter. </p><p>  Gritsevets went to Odessa with his friend and neighbor Pavel Korobkov.  On September 14, the pilots visited their native school, met with fellow soldiers.  Before flying to Moscow, Sergei Ivanovich suddenly wanted to take a family photo as a keepsake.  He had a presentiment that she would be the last in his life. </p><p>  They returned on time, but still they were almost late for a meeting with Stalin.  He spoke in detail about the upcoming operation.  It was necessary to liberate the western regions of Belarus and Ukraine.  On September 15, the pilots arrived at a new duty station.  In the evening, Sergei Ivanovich managed to send a telegram to his wife that he had arrived at the place, everything was fine and the service began.  He promised to write and asked not to worry. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gritsevets Sergey Ivanovich twice a hero of the Soviet Union" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1272015.jpg" width="588"></div>

    <p>  But on September 16, 1939, Sergey Gritsevets, whose biography could have been longer, died in a plane crash.  It happened in the Vitebsk region, Orsha district, near the village of Bolbasovo.  Sergei and Major Khara took to the air at 19:05 and headed towards Bolbasovo.  After some time, Major Kitaev caught up with them. </p><p>  We had to navigate only along the Minsk-Orsha railway line.  At first, Hara was the leader, but when it got dark and visibility worsened, Kitaev flew forward.  There was no radio communication on the planes, and we had to communicate with gestures.  It is strange that the flight of pilots to Bolbasovo was reported only at 19:55, when three fighters appeared above the airfield. </p><p>  Visibility was disgusting - haze and low cloudiness.  The airfield was not prepared for the arrival of the pilots.  Landing spotlights were removed and taken to the shooting range, where machine guns were urgently prepared.  Despite the fact that the airfield in Bolbasovo was considered the best and largest in Belarus, the runway was not electrified.  They used night markings using kerosene lamps under the guidance of a junior technician Kostorny. </p><p>  Gritsevets Sergey Ivanovich landed first, by all rules.  Fearing a collision with other fighters, he drove off to the neutral lane and asked the duty officer whether all the planes had landed.  And at that time Major Hara landed.  Sergei Ivanovich pressed the gas, trying to dodge the airplane rushing at him, but did not have time.  It ended in seconds.  Major Hare was more fortunate.  He survived and escaped with minor injuries, a nervous shock and bruises.  Kitaev sat on the strip and no problem at all. </p><h2>  Lost pilot </h2><p>  Immediately, in a fever, Major Khara was accused of the death of Sergei Ivanovich.  Subsequently, he was rehabilitated and found that the causes of the death of one of the best fighter pilots in the country were the weather, disorganization, the rush of the host country and the lack of spotlights, which made the landing extreme and dangerous. </p><p>  Grytovets was buried in a hurry, without military comrades and even without relatives.  The Soviet government decided not to report the death of the best fighter pilot on the day the military operation began.  It was afraid that this message would cause a huge resonance.  Relatives were not even immediately informed of his death.  The grave of Sergei Ivanovich was dug right next to the airfield, not even in the cemetery, but in the Bolbasovo garrison. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sergey Gritsevets twice a hero of the Soviet Union" class="if" height="248" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1272031.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  An ordinary metal bedside table was installed on the grave with a photograph, an asterisk and the inscription: ‚ÄúTwice Hero of the USSR Major S. I. Gritsevets.  1909‚Äì1939. ‚Äù  On October 31, 1939, the Council of the People's Commissar decided to perpetuate the memory of Sergei Ivanovich.  It was probably planned to move the grave to Orsha.  But his memory was immortalized only after the war. </p><h2>  Everlasting memory </h2><p>  Gritsevets Sergey Ivanovich, whose monument was erected at the place of death, will remain forever in the hearts of many fighters.  In the city of Baranavichy, the famous fighter pilot was immortalized in the form of a bronze bust.  In Minsk, a monument was erected to him and a memorial plaque was erected.  In Moscow, St. Petersburg and three Belarusian cities, streets are named after Sergei Ivanovich. </p><p>  In Belarus, DOSAAF, an aviation sports club, was named in its part.  On the facade of the Minsk school number 22, on the building, a memorial plaque with a portrait of Sergei Ivanovich. </p>
