One of the most visited places of the state will surprise even many travelers who have seen it. </p><h2>  Busy metropolis </h2><p>  Multinational Shenyang (China) is located in the north-east of the country of contrasts.  The administrative center of Liaoning Province, which includes nine districts and three districts, stretches along the banks of the Hunhe River.  This is the most important industrial and transport hub, connecting different regions and areas with various routes.  The authorities of the developing metropolis, deservedly called the northern capital, care about the protection of nature, paying attention to the numerous green parks that enliven the village. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="shenyang city china" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2048762.jpg"></div>

    <p>  After 2008, when the Olympic Games were held here, tourists from different countries rushed to the picturesque Shenyang, which received substantial financial support. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Occupying an area of ‚Äã‚Äã3.5 thousand m2, Shenyang (China) is recognized as one of the most <span>ancient cities in the world.</span>  More than seven thousand years ago, the first people who were engaged in agriculture and hunting appeared on its territory.  In the XVII century, the settlement was captured by the Manchus, who called it Mukden and transferred here the capital of the Qing Dynasty. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the XX century, Russian troops entered the city, which turned into a stronghold of the Russian Empire.  This period is marked by economic growth and cultural revival. </p><p>  In 1929, Shenyang gets its modern name, and after the war in 1945, he moves to <span>the Republic of China.</span> </p><h2>  Climate and weather </h2><p>  The climate in the city is temperate continental.  The weather is formed by monsoon winds that change their direction.  For hot (temperature often reaches 35 ¬∞ C) and wet summers, oceanic winds are responsible.  Winter is quite cold thanks to anticyclones from Siberia, and 15-degree frosts are not uncommon. </p><p>  Most often they come here in autumn or spring, when there is almost no rainfall. </p><h2>  Mukden Palace - Imperial Residence </h2><p>  Speaking about the main sights of Shenyang (China), one can not help but mention the imperial palace, located in the historical district of Shenhe.  The former residence of the rulers of <span>the Qing Dynasty,</span> whose construction began in 1625, is the country's main architectural monument, inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="shenyang china" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2048777.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The well-preserved palace complex, with more than 70 buildings, expanded at the request of the new rulers.  Located in the very center of the city, it stands out with a bright orange roof, considered the symbol of the emperor - the son of the sun.  So in ancient China, the high social status of the beloved ruler was emphasized.  The ensemble, which has historical value, is now a museum that attracts the attention of tourists. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Beiling park </h2><p>  The largest park in the city covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã3 300 000 m <sup>2</sup> .  In addition to luxurious flower gardens, here is the tomb of Emperor Huantaiji.  Born in ancient times, the name of Beiling ("North Grave"), it was built according to all the canons of Chinese architecture: curved roofs, beautiful relief painting, ornaments with dragons. </p><p>  A paved road leads to the tomb, which rises above the plain. </p><h2>  Dongling Mausoleum </h2><p>  The imperial tomb is located in the east of Shenyang (China).  In 1629, it was decided to erect a mausoleum that inherited all the features of the construction of the former tombs of the rulers. </p><p>  The amazing architectural complex, the territory of which has the shape of a square, is made in the Manchu style: the roofs of the buildings resemble a tent.  About 30 buildings are surrounded by a giant green park.  The tomb of Emperor Taizu Nurhatsi and his Empress is under the protection of UNESCO. </p><h2>  Unusual building </h2><p>  An unusual building rises in the center of Shenyang (China).  Photos of the unique building, designed in the form of an ancient coin placed on the edge, must be taken by tourists as a keepsake.  Local architects brought to life a unique project, the design of which caused a lot of controversy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Shenyang China how to get" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2048796.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Some residents are unhappy with the architecture of the impressive building, and the bank‚Äôs office that appeared in 2011 even got into the top of the ugliest buildings in the world.  However, most Chinese people felt that this form attracted prosperity, and took their savings to a financial institution. </p><h2>  The Ring of Life </h2><p>  On the border between Fushun (Liaoning Province) and the city of Shenyang (China), the description of which is presented in the article, there is another extraordinary building.  The gigantic steel ring with a radius of 170 meters shines brightly at night thanks to the built-in LEDs.  Serving as an observation deck, a modern attraction attracts foreign visitors.  Many people compare the Ring of Life with the Eiffel Tower, which has become a symbol of France.  However, to this day, residents condemn the authorities for the fact that 16 million US dollars were spent on the construction of the structure, the value of which is very doubtful. </p>

    <h2>  The infamous zoo Shenyang Zoo </h2><p>  The notorious private zoo was founded in 1988.  After 20 years, the whole world learned about it from the media after the death of about 500 animals as a result of criminal actions by employees.  Zoo workers took home meat intended for animals, and starving predators attacked people. </p><p>  In addition, it turned out that the Chinese killed white tigers - representatives of an endangered species listed in the Red Book.  Employees believed that animal bones helped to heal from all diseases, and healing liquors insisted on them.  In 2010, the zoo was closed by decision of the authorities. </p><h2>  Miraculous Object Benxi Cave </h2><p>  A typical object of ecotourism is the deepest caves in the world, located near the colorful Shenyang (China).  The karst landmark, which stretches for 5 kilometers, is located in the Bensi massif.  It was formed as a result of erosion by water sources of limestone. </p><p>  There is a wonderful park in front of the entrance, where the sound of the waterfalls is peaceful, and in the pavilions you can buy various souvenirs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="shenyang china description" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2048793.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The natural masterpiece consists of three parts, but the latter is closed to the public, as it is a natural monument.  The first Bensi cave is a dry landscaped gallery with walking paths lined with paving stones.  It surprises with unusual natural formations that are illuminated in the dark by artificial lights.  Giant stalactites are very reminiscent of animals, and, as visitors note, the resemblance is actually stunning. </p><p>  The Bensi Water Gallery is an <span>underground river that</span> tourists ride on boats. </p><h2>  A city adored by shopaholics </h2><p>  According to vacationers, the largest shopping center in the country is the city of Shenyang (Kitayrod).  Shenyang (China) is famous for its entire shopping areas with numerous shops where you can buy anything you want. </p><p>  Most boutiques are open from 9.00 to 22.00.  Speaking of prices, we can say that they are divided into fixed and contractual.  They like to bargain here, and sellers make small discounts.  But in local markets, traders can reduce the price by almost half.  Most often, Russian tourists buy electronics and household appliances, clothes and shoes, souvenirs and toys. </p><h2>  How to get to Shenyang in China </h2><p>  Since the city has an international airport, it is not difficult to get to it from all over the world.  Direct flights are operated from Tokyo, Shanghai, Beijing, Seoul, Sydney and other cities.  From the capital of our homeland to the metropolis, you can fly in 8 hours, breaking 6 thousand kilometers.  The average ticket price is 20 thousand, but we must remember that the price rises in the period from March to October. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="shenyang china reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2048820.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In addition, you can get from Moscow to the northern capital of China by train.  Travel time is more than five days. </p><h2>  Shenyang (China): reviews </h2><p>  According to tourists, this is a typical Chinese city with a unique flavor and Asian surroundings.  Russians willingly visit it, since the country is represented in it in all its diversity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="shenyang china sights" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2048757.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Numerous foreigners come here to do business, not travel.  The city has a very developed hotel infrastructure, but there are almost no budget hotels for picky tourists. </p><p>  Despite the high cost of services, this is a wonderful place to relax: there are no giant crowds of people, as in Beijing.  And there are legends about local hospitality! </p>
