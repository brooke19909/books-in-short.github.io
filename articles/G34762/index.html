    <h2>  Types of Talcas </h2><p>  In addition to the unusual transparency of the water, there are wonderful landscapes in the Talkas region.  Bashkiria is characterized by a very bright and diverse flora and fauna.  It is especially beautiful in this place in autumn, when mixed forests acquire fabulous shades.  But in the summer there is something to admire: the flowering of herbs, lush trees, sunny beaches and incomparable sunrises and sunsets.  Perhaps the perfect place for a romantic weekend with your loved ones. </p>

    <h2>  Lake Talkas, Bashkiria.  Recreation facilities </h2><p>  The weather here is very changeable, especially in the fall, and if you are not accustomed to rest “savages” in tourist tents on the lake, then sanatoriums are always at your service, and pioneer camps are for children.  The only negative is that rooms and a ticket must be purchased in advance, otherwise you may simply not get into the holiday home.  The largest, by the way, bears the name "Talkas" in honor of the lake on which it is located. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In summer, you can relax on the beach, take sun and mud baths, swim and play volleyball or badminton.  For lovers of privacy, you can rent a boat or go hiking in the woods. </p><p>  In the autumn season, many hunters and mushroom pickers gather here, and in winter it’s a sin not to ride a sled or ski from the nearest slope! </p><p>  In addition, you can go on excursions to <span>the Gadelsha waterfall,</span> the first capital of <span>Bashkiria, the mountains of</span> Arendyk or Yanguzai and even to the <span>ancient city of Arkaim,</span> where experienced guides will share knowledge with you. </p><p>  It is worth noting that pricing here is quite loyal.  Per day per person, the price can vary from 600 to 2500 rubles.  If you still plan to relax in the tent city, get ready for the fact that you will have to pay a little on the passage of the barrier.  Of course, count your money on additional services: excursions, baths, rentals, etc. And do not forget, going to Lake Talkas: the map is your faithful friend, since getting lost here is very easy! </p>

    <h2>  How to get to Talcas </h2><p>  Often newcomers tourists, having heard the colorful stories of more experienced "colleagues", are going to go to Lake Talkas, how to get there, however, they did not really find out.  As a result, many hours wandering around the nearby villages and villages are fraught with a spoiled mood and battered nerves. </p><p>  The easiest option is to go along the Beloretsk-Ufa highway.  30 km from Beloretsk there is a fairly large T-shaped intersection on which a signboard is located.  There you will find directions to Askarovo and Baymak.  That's just the second you need.  Approximately 45–50 km after turning to Baymak, there will be a left pointer to the village of Tubinsk, and not far from the highway there will be a small gas station, which can serve as the main reference point.  Further, all the traffic is directly following the signs to the Talkas sanatorium on a dirt road. </p>

    <p>  By the way, if there is time, be sure to pay attention to the landscapes that can be seen on the road along the Ufa highway.  Perhaps these species are nowhere else in the Urals! </p><h2>  Fishing in Talkas? </h2><p>  Many fishermen are very fond of Lake Talkas.  The rest here is wonderful, and the fish pecking is a pleasure.  By the way, not only common crucian carp and rudd, but also perch, tench and even pike are found in fish from this place.  Moreover, if you try, you can pull out a fairly large copy.  And lovers of exotic can safely go to the lake to catch crayfish. </p><h2>  Legends of Talcas.  Bragin Stone. </h2><p>  Like any place favored by tourists and vacationers, Lake Talkas has its own legend, according to which more than 200 years ago a certain prince Bragin from Orenburg visited this area.  For a long time he wandered around the neighborhood with his armed squad of 30 guard soldiers and severely oppressed local residents.  Without Bragin’s permission it was impossible to tie the knot in a lawful marriage, and if the cruel prince could be reached, then only on condition that he spends the first 3 nights with his bride.  Resistance, as they say, was useless: all the rebels were hung up or sent to the chopping block. </p><p>  And only one batyr Amin managed to defeat the persecutor and protect the people.  He trapped Bragin in the <span>reed thickets</span> when he hunted ducks, and shot him in the chest, breaking through the monster through a tight arrow.  The same arrow split the boat.  And before his death, the prince threw his ring, previously given by the queen, into the water.  Later this ring was found in a pike caught in Lake Yauguli.  Since then, it has been believed that these two lakes connect under the mountains. </p>
