    <h2>  Erich Gepner: the beginning of a military career </h2><p>  Erich dreamed of a military profession from early childhood.  Therefore, in the ranks of the regular army of Germany, he proved himself to be a dedicated soldier, capable of not only fulfilling orders, but also giving them.  And so, in 1906, only a year after entering the service, he receives his first rank - lieutenant. </p><p>  In the fall of 1913, the still very young Erich Gepner entered the military academy in Berlin.  However, he did not have time to finish it, because in 1914 all the military were called up to the front of the First World War.  True, such a twist of fate only benefited the young officer, since on the battlefield he began to replace one military rank with another. </p><p>  As a result, at the end of the war, he came home with the epaulettes of the captain.  In addition, Iron crosses of both degrees decorated his chest. </p><h2>  Peaceful time </h2><p>  Thanks to his merits in 1921, Erich Gepner got a job at the cavalry inspection at the War Ministry.  Here he is noticed by a higher management, and soon the officers are transferred to the division headquarters.  It was a fateful moment, which played an important role in the formation of Gepner. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, in 1930 he became commander of a regiment, and in February 1933 he received the rank of colonel.  Following this, he was transferred to the chief of staff of the 1st Army Corps.  And in the winter of 1936, Erich Gepner became a major general.  And, finally, in the spring of 1939 he was appointed general of the cavalry, commander of the 16th motorized corps. </p>

    <h2>  The Second World War </h2><p>  General Gepner Erich began his participation in World War II with the Polish campaign.  Then he was transferred to France, where he proved to be an outstanding leader, for which he received the rank of colonel general.  In 1941, Gepner was sent to the Soviet Union, so that he would help with a tank attack on Leningrad, and then on Moscow. </p><p>  However, on January 8, 1942, his 6th Army Corps came under heavy return fire.  As commander Erich Gepner decides to retreat, despite a clear order to fight to the death.  Such self-will was unacceptable - the general was dismissed from the ranks of the Wehrmacht with shame.  In addition, Gepner is deprived of all awards and merit, which becomes the greatest blow to his pride. </p><h2>  Betrayal and execution </h2><p>  July 20, 1944 a number of Wehrmacht officers attempted the assassination of Adolf Hitler in order to overthrow the tyranny of fascism.  However, their plan fails, all the conspirators are sentenced to death.  Erich Gepner, who has been in close relations with the Resistance since 1935, is on the list of perpetrators. </p><p>  The death sentence was put into effect on August 8, 1944.  The former general of the fascist army was hanged in the Pletzensee prison. </p>
