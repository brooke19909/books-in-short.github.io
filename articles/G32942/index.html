As a rule, in some ways they are very similar to each other - this is a low price, not very original design, low-quality assembly, high technical parameters.  The work of such market representatives, indeed, sometimes leaves much to be desired. </p><p>  In this article, we also talk about the device presented in the budget segment.  The device has a 2-core processor, an 8-megapixel camera and, in addition, is made in a simple ‚Äúbrick-like‚Äù case.  That is, by all indications, it resembles a typical representative of a smartphone from the Middle Kingdom. </p><p>  Meet: this is the Prestigio Multiphone 4055 Duo. </p><p>  Read what this model is and what to expect from the device, read in our review. </p><h2>  Positioning </h2>

    <p>  Let's start with what concept the device is endowed with, as well as with the manufacturer.  So, Prestigio is a fairly well-known (recently) developer of low-cost electronic devices.  A wide range of smartphones and tablets from this company are delivered to the target market of the CIS countries.  In terms of functionality and reliability, of course, it is difficult to call these models good, but the characteristics of this product are quite tempting.  Together with an affordable price, they apparently do their job and force the buyer to make the right choice. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Regarding the Prestigio Multiphone 4055 Duo, it is definitely not so easy to say anything.  The model is far from the flagship of its lineup, which is why it should not be treated strictly.  Instead, the phone can be categorized as those workhorses that operate without glitches and freezes and are the daily assistant to their customer.  Read more about how a smartphone does its job. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  So, since we mentioned the appearance of the device as a criterion by which to evaluate the model, then we will start with it.  However, as already mentioned, you should not expect something original in this matter from the Prestigio Multiphone 4055 Duo.  The phone was made as simple as possible, limiting itself to the decorative thread on the back cover as a decoration.  Front-end smartphone is no different from hundreds of similar noname-devices. </p>

    <p>  So, firstly, the diagonal of the Prestigio Multiphone 4055 Duo display is 4 inches, which is why the smartphone is compact, easily fit in the palm of your hand.  Secondly, despite this, the model was made in a somewhat convex body, which reaches a thickness of 10.3 mm.  This gives some, somewhat unnecessary, massiveness to the device.  Thirdly, the design of the smartphone should be said as typical for the reason that it is not much different from the mass of other devices.  Prestigio Multiphone 4055 Duo has the same set of three system buttons under the display, a classically placed speaker (above the screen), as well as keys to unlock the screen and adjust the sound on the side panels.  Even the camera eye on the back cover is typically located in the center.  Summing up, we say that the appearance of the device is too typical to pay attention to it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As for the assembly, it is, surprisingly, made at a high level.  As noted by the reviews describing the Prestigio Multiphone 4055 Duo phone, the model does not give a reason to talk about backlashes and creaks when squeezing the panels.  This means that all the components of the body sit quite tightly and reliably.  As regards materials, there is nothing to highlight - the only highlight is the effect of the ‚Äúrubber‚Äù coating on the back cover. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The phone presented in our review operates on the basis of a TFT display.  This means that it can hardly be called colorful and clear, which is a screen based on IPS technology.  The picture that the <span>Prestigio</span> Multiphone 4055 Duo <span>smartphone</span> gives out is somewhat grainy and blurry, especially if you look closely at it.  The reason for this, in addition to TFT-technology, is the low resolution - 800 by 480 pixels.  The density of dots due to this is set at 220 pixels per inch. </p><p>  The brightness of the screen can be called satisfactory - at its minimum level, the user is comfortable working with the phone in pitch darkness;  while the maximum brightness allows you to see the image even in sunlight. </p><p>  But with the color rendering, the Multiphone 4055 is not so smooth.  When the device is tilted, the gamma of the display changes significantly, transforming the picture. </p><h2>  CPU </h2>

    <p>  We have already mentioned that the <span>Prestigio</span> Multiphone 4055 Duo mobile <span>phone</span> has two cores, which provide its quite quick work in the process of everyday use.  We are talking about MediaTek MTK6577 - a processor that is used on budget models of many manufacturers.  Each of the cores presented in it is capable of demonstrating a clock frequency of up to 1.2 GHz.  The RAM, which is 512 MB in size, also provides fast (if possible) work with applications.  According to reviews, only 120-150 Mb remain free of the indicated number, which protects the device from further freezing.  Therefore, the recommendations of many buyers note that on the part of the developer it would be advisable to expand the amount of memory up to 1 GB. </p><p>  If you believe a number of performance tests conducted in both our and other reviews, the device behaves very well - provided that it does not run complex programs and games.  Another thing is that anyone who takes this unit should understand that this model is already clearly not intended for such purposes. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  The Prestigio Multiphone 4055 Duo smartphone, the characteristics of which we presented above, runs on the Android OS version 4.1.1.  Despite the tradition of the developer to install their own interface on their Prestigio products, in the case of the smartphone we indicated in the review, they installed ‚Äúbare‚Äù Android, which cannot but please the fans of the latter.  As ‚Äúoutsiders‚Äù, you can only mention programs from partners - like the eReader Prestigio reader and others.  If desired, all of these applications can be deleted. </p>

    <p>  Some buyers are looking for information on how to flash the Prestigio Multiphone 4055 Duo to the next version of the operating system (more precisely, to Android 4.1.2).  Just note that there are no difficulties in this - you just need to install special software on your PC that allows you to update the software platform, and by connecting the phone to it, perform a series of actions.  But we do not recommend doing this, because there are a lot of reviews indicating that on this firmware the device starts to work with braking.  Therefore, by conducting such actions, you run the risk of doing worse. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  About the pictures that the smartphone takes, we found a lot of negative reviews.  Based on them, we can conclude that the manufacturer deliberately overestimated the technical characteristics of the camera module in order to contribute to the growth of phone sales.  In practice, most likely, together with 8 megapixels, the model has only 5. </p><p>  The front camera is required for communication via Skype, and you should not expect the quality of shooting from it, of course. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The battery preloaded on the Prestigio Multiphone 4055 Duo (reviews confirm this) has a capacity of 1500 mAh.  This is enough for a smartphone with such a display and a set of functions to ensure its operation throughout the day (subject to active use).  If you take care of the safety of the charge, then its service life will increase to 3-4 days. </p>

    <p>  We managed to find many recommendations that could shed light on what the model is.  Some of them describe the problems that customers identified during the operation of the device.  As it turned out, there are enough such flaws.  For example, reviews indicate a downed accelerometer.  The device simply does not recognize slopes adequately. </p><p>  Another drawback is the screen sensor.  You can work with it only if your fingers are completely dry. </p><p>  Users also complain about the heating of the case.  Obviously, this is a direct consequence of the insufficient level of processor optimization.  In this regard, the smartphone consumes an excessive amount of battery power and at the same time starts to hang slightly. </p><p>  Regarding braking, by the way, you can find a lot of reviews.  People complain that the device can be unbearable - does not respond to clicks, does not open the menu, and so on. </p><p>  But, on the other hand, there are characteristics that testify to the stable and uninterrupted operation of the smartphone for several (2-3) years. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2>

    <p>  Before us is a typical ‚Äústate employee‚Äù with all the ensuing consequences.  The device is inexpensive, quite practical, but has several disadvantages that affect many similar devices.  We would not recommend taking this smartphone as the main phone.  But, in our opinion, it can be an ideal addition if you need, plus the main one, also a gadget for 2 SIM cards. </p>
