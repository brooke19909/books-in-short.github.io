On this day, everything is especially festive.  The spirit of the <span>New Year</span> and, of course, the New Year tree comes to every house.  It is decorated with all kinds of toys: sweets, figures of animals and people, flowers, etc.  However, toys and jewelry made by hand from paper will look especially original and beautiful on this fluffy beauty.  We are talking about New Year's origami toys.  Origami masters can work real miracles from paper, their crafts amaze and at the same time delight us.  Why not try experimenting with <span>origami for the New Year?</span>  Toys made in this way will undoubtedly decorate the Christmas tree. </p><p>  So, we will not come up with anything new and confine ourselves to garlands, balls, as well as decorative Christmas trees.  All we need for this is paper, preferably colored, some glue and scissors.  Origami Christmas toys, with the exception of some species, are very simple to make, despite the apparent complexity. </p><p>  <span>How to make garlands?</span>  Take a sheet of paper, cut it lengthwise into equal parts, about 2-3 cm wide.  After that, carefully fold them in half and cut along the fold line.  With each of the resulting pieces, do the same.  Then take one piece, bend its ends to each other and you get a circle.  Apply a small layer of glue to fix the resulting piece of our future garland.  Now take the second sheet and push it through the first, just bending and fixing the ends.  Continue until the garland is long enough for you.  The final link in our chain will be a piece of paper that will hold both ends of the garland together.  That's all. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you already made a garland of paper, then you definitely need to make a Christmas tree.  To do this, take a piece of paper or cardboard.  Cut out two identical triangles from it.  If you wish, you can trim the edges of our tree a little, and then it will look even more beautiful.  Now take the paint (of course, green) and apply it in a thick layer on paper or cardboard.  When the paint is already dry, use a thick cloth or hand-draw patterns to the Christmas tree.  This can be done by conducting circular movements on the paint.  So, the last touch, take a ribbon or lace, use a needle to fasten the tree and hang it. </p><p>  Of course, the most complex and beautiful on your Christmas tree will be a ball of kusudama.  This is an extremely beautiful ball made of paper.  Take a square sheet of paper with sides of about 30 cm. Fold it diagonally twice.  Then gently bend the fold of one of the sides so that you get a square.  This must be done on the other hand.  You will get 4 small folded sides in a square.  With each of them you need to repeat the previous action.  You will get a polygonal shape.  Now from the side where it is wider, bend the edges of each of the protrusions first to each other, and then to the middle.  Fix all folds and lines properly.  Expand the sheet and twist it with the colored side inward, then fold it again so that all the edges are on one side of the square.  If everything is done correctly, then you will get a polygonal figure.  This is an element of the ball, such elements need another 35 fragments.  Glue them all together.  The resulting ball will undoubtedly focus universal attention on itself on the holiday. </p><p>  Origami Christmas toys are becoming more popular today.  It is not necessary to immediately make complex and large origami - Christmas toys.  Remember, origami is patience.  There are simple figures, but there are very complex ones.  In any case, Christmas toys - origami, plaster toys, or other toys - made by yourself, are much more valuable and beautiful than those that can be bought at any store. </p>
