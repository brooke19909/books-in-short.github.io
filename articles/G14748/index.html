These home assistants significantly save time for housewives, which makes it possible to more rationally engage in other household affairs. </p><p>  The principle of operation of such equipment is simple: washing powder fell asleep, loaded dirty laundry, selected the desired washing mode, turned on the machine.  The unit will do the rest of the work on its own. </p><p>  To ensure continuous operation of the device, it is necessary that the dirty water is drained from the unit periodically.  It is this function that the hose performs.  Like any part, from time to time it requires replacement.  And if there is no way to call the master, it is useful to know <span>how to change the drain hose in the washing machine</span> with your own hands. </p><h2>  Purpose and types of hoses </h2><p>  The main function of the hose is the removal of dirty water from the machine into the sewer.  During washing, depending on the selected mode, water is drained several times. </p><p>  Typically, water removal hoses are supplied with new equipment.  But if the hose length is not enough to connect, you will have to look at a specialized store selling household appliances and accessories. </p><p>  In the washing machine, changing the drain hose is not difficult, the main thing is to choose the right one. </p><div class="photo" data-original="diy.stackexchange.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Drain hose extension" class="if uuid-2760546" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70222/2760546.jpg"></div><p>  There are three types of drain sleeves: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Fixed hose.  Standard sizes of a usual hose: 1 - 5 meters.  If you need to extend the sleeve, the two hoses are interconnected using clamps. </li><li>  The telescopic hose is considered a universal device.  A sleeve 60 cm long can stretch up to two meters.  The main disadvantage of corrugated hoses is their susceptibility to blockages. </li><li>  Hoses in the bay are very convenient.  This design solution allows you to cut the hose to the required length for special serifs. </li></ol><h2>  Reasons to replace the hose </h2><p>  Before changing the drain hose in the washing machine, it is necessary to carefully visualize the integrity of the sleeve and determine the need for work. </p><p>  There are several reasons for replacing a hose: </p><ul><li>  often after purchase it turns out that the hose is not long enough for a proper connection; </li><li>  if an unpleasant odor develops over time and cannot be removed, the sleeve is clogged (scale or dirt); </li><li>  the presence of a break in the sleeve indicates the need for its replacement, since gluing the damaged area for a short time helps to extend the life of the hose. </li></ul><p>  Unlike the filling device, before changing the drain hose in the washing machine, you will have to disassemble the unit. </p><h2>  Hose location </h2><p>  Before disassembling the housing, it is necessary to determine which side the pump is located on.  You can change the drain hose in the Samsung washing machine by entering the body through the bottom of the unit.  Many manufacturers of other models use the same arrangement principle for this part. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In some devices, the drain hose is located behind the unit body.  For top-loading units, the sleeve may be on the side of the unit.  Therefore, the determination of the place where the drain hose is connected to the pump is the main condition for a quality repair. </p><h2>  General rules of work </h2><p>  Each machine has individual characteristics, but the principle of replacing the sleeve for draining the liquid remains unchanged.  You can change the drain hose in the Indesit or Ariston washing machine as follows: </p><ol><li>  Since the washing machine is a complex electrical appliance, the first priority is to disconnect it from the mains.  This requirement must be observed to ensure safe work.  In the case of incomplete washing, it is impossible to proceed with the replacement, you need to wait for completion. </li><li>  The next step is to disconnect the unit from the water supply system.  In this case, you must try not to damage the sealing gasket, which will be needed to reinstall the sleeve. </li><li>  Next, the case is disassembled at the location of the sleeve in order to penetrate the inside of the washing machine, where the drain pump is located. </li><li>  The drain pipe is disconnected from the pump.  Most often, fastening is carried out using clamps, so you need to loosen the clamp. <div class="photo" data-original="buythetop10.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Drain hose mount" class="if uuid-2760511" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70222/2760511.jpg"></div></li><li>  Next, you need to disconnect the sleeve from the sewer and remove the remaining fluid. </li><li>  After that, a new hose is installed. </li></ol><h2>  Features of replacing the hose in the machines "Indesit", "Ariston", "Samsung" </h2><p>  To change the drain hose in the LG washing machine, you need to get inside the unit through the bottom. </p><p>  The main stages of work to replace the sleeves in the units of this group: </p><ol><li>  Remove the cover that covers the drain pump filter. </li><li>  We remove the remaining water by unscrewing the drain plug of the filter. </li><li>  Carefully move the unit away from the wall and tilt it back to a reliable support. </li><li>  After performing these operations, we get access to the hose.  After loosening the clamps with pliers, we remove the damaged element. <div class="photo" data-original="www.searspartsdirect.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Removing a damaged drain hose" class="if uuid-2760589" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70222/2760589.jpg"></div></li><li>  We install a new hose by completing the list of the indicated actions in the reverse order, and fix it with clamps. </li><li>  We connect the second end to the sewer system. <div class="photo" data-original="diy.stackexchange.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Connection of a drain hose to the sewerage through a siphon" class="if uuid-2760549" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70222/2760549.jpg"></div></li><li>  We check the reliability of the docking points. </li></ol><p>  How to change the drain hose in the Ariston washing machine?  It is not difficult, all actions are similar to the previous ones.  The main thing is to strictly comply with the workflow. </p><h2>  Replacing the drain in vertical loading machines </h2><p>  The principle of working with vertically loaded machines is the same as with horizontally loaded machines. </p><ol><li>  Before changing the drain hose in the washing machine, you need to remove the side of the unit.  It is necessary to unscrew the bolts around the perimeter of the side wall and push it back.  Pressing down, disconnect it from the unit. </li><li>  Having access to the hose connection, remove the clamp. </li><li>  Remove the damaged sleeve and install a new one. <div class="photo" data-original="www.searspartsdirect.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Installing the hose to the drain pump" class="if uuid-2760557" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70222/2760557.jpg"></div></li><li>  After replacing the sleeve, we assemble the case.  Then we connect the other end of the hose to the sewer. </li></ol><p>  As practice shows, difficulties with replacing the drain pipe usually do not arise.  The main thing is to do everything carefully, because with a small inaccuracy, neighbors from below can suffer if water leaks, as well as flooring in your own apartment. </p>
