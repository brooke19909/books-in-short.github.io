Its circulation was not limited, since it was actively used by citizens of the USSR, and there are many copies to this day.  But all the same, one coin is different - discord, because the value of even such a frequently encountered instance depends on a number of circumstances. </p><h2>  What determines the value of a coin of 15 kopecks in 1962? </h2><p>  Like any other coin, 15 kopecks has two main evaluation criteria.  The first is what metal it is made of.  Our coin is made of an alloy of copper and nickel, the so-called alloy nickel silver.  It is an inexpensive metal. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.allnumis.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Front 15 kopecks" class="if uuid-2805701" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104418/2805701.jpg"></div><p>  The second criterion is the collection value of the coin.  And it consists of a number of factors, such as circulation, coin safety, its appearance, etc. And here the cost of a coin of the same denomination and year of issue can have a difference of tens and hundreds of times. </p><h2>  Auction value 15 kopecks </h2><p>  According to the auction site raritetus.ru, the value of a coin with a face value of 15 kopecks in 1962 varies from 5 to 308 rubles.  And the price is calculated on a special international scale of numismatists, consisting of 7 gradations: G, VG, F, VF, XF, aUNC, UNC, where G is the lowest degree of preservation of coins, and UNC is the highest.  Accordingly, gradations will also reveal the value of 15 kopecks of 1962, since in addition to a high degree of preservation, this coin has little value for numismatists. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The average cost, therefore, was distributed like this: </p><ul><li>  VF - 24 rubles; </li><li>  XF - 42 rubles; </li><li>  AU - 91 rubles; </li><li>  UNC - 207 rubles. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Coins of the USSR obverse" class="if uuid-2805696" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104418/2805696.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to gradations, there is another category - Proof.  These are coins in perfect condition, which are stored in special plastic boxes or cases, sealed so that nothing penetrates from the external environment, and the product is preserved in its original form.  Such a banknote on this auction site has an average cost of 155 rubles. </p><p>  The coin was running, met in large numbers.  15 kopecks of the USSR in the period from 1961 to 1991 have the same coinage standard. </p><h2>  Coin description </h2><p>  The emblem of the USSR (from 1956) is depicted on the front side of the coin.  The image is applied large enough, but simplified (there is no inscription on the tape wrapping around the ears).  In the center, in the upper half-disk of the front side, the sickle and hammer crossed among themselves are depicted, which are on the background of a schematically depicted globe.  A sickle and a hammer and a globe around each side entwine a wreath of ears of wheat intertwined with a ribbon of fifteen turns (that is how many republics were in the Soviet Union).  Crowns all five-pointed star, located between the tips of the ears.  In addition, the obverse depicts a half-disk of the radiant sun (located under the globe between the halves of the wreath).  At the bottom - the inscription "USSR". </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.coins-of-the-world.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="15 kopecks of poor quality" class="if uuid-2805694" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104418/2805694.jpg"></div><p>  The reverse shows the face value, under it is the word "cents", as well as the year of issue - 1962.  On the sides - an open wreath of ears of corn and oak leaves (at the bottom of the wreath). </p><p>  The perimeter of the coin on both sides is framed by a convex edging, which, as it were, starts the edge. </p><p>  On the edge of the coin with a face value of 15 kopecks in 1962 - a lot of notches.  By type of edge - ribbed. </p><p>  The coin itself is white (gray) in color due to the characteristics of the alloy.  It has no ferromagnetic properties. </p><h2>  Coin history </h2><p>  The coin was minted in the Leningrad Mint, but there are no signs of this mint on it.  In 1962, by the way, only small (small change coins) up to 50 kopecks were issued.  The most similar variety of the 15 kopeks USSR line for the 1962 sample is a coin of the same face value of 1961. </p>
