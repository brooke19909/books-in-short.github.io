A simple technique and a quick build-up of knitted fabric allow beginners to believe in themselves.  In order to knit a simple thing, consisting of one part, such as a scarf or hat, experience is not required.  Learning how to crochet is easy.  A convenient tool, yarn, a little patience ... And after a few hours, a beginner needlewoman can deftly knit columns and crochets, watching her favorite TV show. </p><h2>  Tools and materials </h2><p>  Hooks come in classic shapes, pointed for smooth yarn, rounded for fluffy, long for tight Tunisian knitting and a fork for lace Irish braid.  A beginner should not study all kinds of hooks in detail so as not to lose enthusiasm. </p><p>  It is enough to know that the thickness of the tool should correspond to the thickness of the thread.  The hook number is equal to the diameter of the head in millimeters.  A suitable hook size may be indicated on a skein of yarn.  Compliance is checked independently by passing the thread into the groove of the hook.  If the yarn hooks well, does not fall, does not slip, it means that the tool was chosen successfully. </p><p>  The canvas, linked by number 2.5 or 3, noticeably arrives, remaining soft and dense.  Ideal for the first exercises, as for beginners to crochet quickly learn the technique and get a visible result is very important. </p><p>  For crocheting, you can take any yarn.  Lush yarn will hide the pattern and make it difficult to count loops.  Thin - for the most patient craftswomen, it is usually knitted with complex openwork.  For training, well-twisted acrylic or blended yarn is convenient. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  First loop </h2><p>  How to learn to crochet from scratch?  First you need to master the tool in your hands.  It doesn‚Äôt matter if your fingers are a little tense and the thread is not tight enough.  Dexterity will appear very soon.  The tool is kept grooved to itself, like a pen or spoon.  In the other hand they hold knitting.  It doesn't matter if you hold the tool with your right or left hand.  Left-handed people will get the same patterns as right-handed people, only on the other side of the canvas. </p><p>  From the ball, the thread extends through the index finger.  It is called working.  The thumb holds the thread in the bend of the index, the remaining fingers - in the palm of your hand.  The tool must be brought under the working thread, make it a circular motion, so that the thread crosses under the hook.  A loop has formed on the instrument.  Repeating the first movement, the hook is again brought under the working thread, grab it and stretch into the previous loop.  Pulling the hook up, tighten the bottom.  The first loop lies loosely on the hook, and underneath it is a tightly knotted knot. </p><h2>  The beginning of the knitted fabric </h2><p>  A vertically tied sequence of loops creates the basis for knitting.  It is called a chain, and loops elongated from one another - air.  The figure clearly shows how the loops are tied. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.brudiy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="chain of air loops" class="if uuid-2416528" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2416528.jpg"></div><p>  The last, ‚Äúleading‚Äù loop is always on the hook until the knitted fabric is finished. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  More complex loops are called columns. </p><h2>  Connecting post </h2><p>  To complete the first row of knitting, the air chain is clamped between the fold of the index finger and thumb.  The first column of the first row is tied from the third from the end of the loop of the chain.  The thread is pulled simultaneously through the loop of the base and leading.  The column is ready.  This type of loops is used to connect longer columns, they close the chain of air loops, they are used when tying the finished fabric and to connect parts. </p><p>  As a workout, you can knit a row to the end.  To create an even canvas in each row, columns of the same type are used.  In openwork, on the contrary, holes in the canvas are formed by alternating long and short columns in the same row. </p><p>  Exercises will help you learn how to crochet quickly and easily, like fluent writing with a pen. </p><h2>  Simple single crochet </h2><p>  The working thread is pulled through the loop of the base.  Two loops are formed on the instrument, together with the lead.  The next step through them is pulling the working thread. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.crystalsandcrochet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="single crochet" class="if uuid-2416494" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2416494.jpg"></div><p>  This method of knitting loops creates a dense, even cloth.  The basic ability to work with these columns is already enough to create some simple thing. </p><h2>  Double crochet </h2><p>  This type of loop forms a high row.  So that the edge posts do not work shorter than the others, two lifting air loops are knitted at the beginning of the row of double crochet posts. </p><p>  How to learn to crochet a crochet column?  Double crochet next to the lead loop.  The hook is introduced into the loop of the base and the working thread is pulled.  Three loops form on the hook.  The working thread is pulled first through two of them.  Again double crochet and stretch through the remaining two. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.crystalsandcrochet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="double crochet" class="if uuid-2416497" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2416497.jpg"></div><p>  The canvas arrives very quickly if you knit it with this kind of loops.  It will be soft, a small relief pattern is formed on the front side. </p><h2>  Crochet patterns </h2><p>  To describe patterns using verbal and graphic methods. </p><p>  In the first case, all actions and loops are described in words.  Only the designation * rapport *, that is, ‚Äúrepeat‚Äù, is used.  The operations described between the asterisks must be repeated several times until the end of the row.  This method is used to describe some patterns, the complexity of which lies in the special position of the tool and thread.  For example, the pattern used to knit washcloths is easier to describe in words.  Any drawing to it will require a lot of explanation. </p><p>  The second method is much more convenient and more common in modern manuals and magazines.  The pattern is presented in the form of a diagram, each loop in a row is depicted using symbols. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="legend" class="if uuid-2416568" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2416568.jpg"></div><p>  The diagrams clearly explain how to quickly learn how to crochet a selected pattern.  Particularly convenient are schemes for describing circular patterns.  In this case, the circuit is read from the center. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.crochetkingdom.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="circular pattern" class="if uuid-2416550" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2416550.jpg"></div><p>  In straight-line patterns, a chain of air loops is not usually indicated.  They should be read from the lower right corner. </p><div class="photo" data-original="easy-crochet.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="direct circuit" class="if uuid-2416563" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2416563.jpg"></div><p>  With all the obvious advantages, the scheme does not convey some nuances.  For example, a method of introducing a hook into the base.  Sometimes the appearance of the pattern depends on this. </p><p>  To pull the working thread from the base, you can enter the hook in four ways: </p><ul><li>  under the front wall of the loop of the previous row; </li><li>  under the back wall; </li><li>  under the whole loop; </li><li>  between the columns of the lower row. </li></ul><h2>  Flat land </h2><p>  One of the most difficult nuances for beginners.  How to learn to crochet an edge?  It is necessary to make edge loops very carefully so that the edge turns out smooth, knitting does not tighten, and the number of loops typed in the first row is preserved. </p><p>  The edge of the column at the beginning of each row is formed from air loops.  Their number depends on the height of the row, that is, on the type of columns to which it is connected. </p><p>  The edge column at the end of each row is tied over a column of lifting loops. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.crystalsandcrochet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="flat edge" class="if uuid-2416499" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2416499.jpg"></div><p>  Correctly designed diagrams help you best deal with edge and lifting loops. </p><h2>  How to learn to crochet appendices </h2><p>  To increase the number of columns in a row, you can knit two from one loop of the base.  Places of such additions are almost invisible on the canvas.  In order not to lose, in the process of work they are marked with a contrasting thread. </p><p>  The addition of two or more columns from one loop of the base will violate the structure of the canvas, creating a noticeable fold.  Therefore, the addition of several columns at the same time is possible only at the end of the row.  The required number of air loops is dialed, the work is turned over.  The next row begins to be knitted on air loops, accordingly recounting which loop of the pattern it will start from. </p><h2>  Crochet diminution </h2><p>  To reduce one loop, skip the loop of the base and knit a column from the next or knit out two unfinished ones, connecting them ‚Äúto one vertex‚Äù.  Places to reduce the columns inside the canvas should also be marked with a marker. </p><p>  Reducing more loops is done at the edge of the canvas.  At the end of the row, the desired number of loops is not knitted, the fabric turns over and the next row begins.  At the beginning of the row, if you skip the desired number of loops, you can get a broach from the thread.  Therefore, the loops are knitted with connecting posts, and in the next row they are not knitted at all. </p><h2>  Knitting simple shapes </h2><ul><li>  Knitting a circle for beginners in stages. </li></ul><p>  How to learn to crochet a smooth disk?  Make a chain of six loops, close it with a connecting column.  The next row begins with two lifting loops - this is the first column.  Another eleven single crochet stitches are tied.  The number of loops doubled.  A row is closed with a connecting column. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.craftsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting circle" class="if uuid-2416544" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2416544.jpg"></div><p>  In the third row and all subsequent twelve loops are added.  Additions need to be done evenly, through the same number of loops.  As a result, wedges twisted around the axis are formed. </p><p>  If the circle is knitted with single crochet, the circle must be divided into six wedges and add six loops in a row. </p><p>  The ability to knit an even circle will allow you to knit a simple hat and show how easy it is to learn how to crochet.  For beginners, this is a great opportunity to try your hand. </p><ul><li>  Knitting a square motif. </li></ul><p>  How to learn to crochet the so-called "grandmother's square"? </p><div class="photo" data-original="yarnberry.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="grandmother's square" class="if uuid-2416404" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2416404.jpg"></div><p>  Using the example of this motive, one can show yet another way to dial round loops - the ‚Äúmagic ring‚Äù.  The working thread wraps around two fingers, forming a sliding loop.  A hook is inserted into this ring, three air loops are typed.  This is the first lifting column.  Fifteen more double crochet stitches are crocheted into the ring.  The end of the sliding loop is tightened, the first row ends with a connecting column. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.brudiy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="magic loop" class="if uuid-2416516" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2416516.jpg"></div><p>  To create a dense motif, the lifting loops of the second row and two * double crochets are knotted.  In the next loop of the base, the first corner of the square is formed.  A double crochet, an air loop, a double crochet, an air loop and another double crochet are sewn into the same base loop *.  The actions indicated between the asterisks are repeated three times until the row closes.  The shape of the square is well defined.  Then they continue to increase the square, in each row forming four corners strictly according to the figure. </p><p>  Using many square motifs, combining colorful or openwork elements, you can create products in the style of patchwork, napkins, tablecloths, bedspreads, accessories and clothes. </p><h2>  Shutdown </h2><p>  To finish knitting the fabric, the thread is cut at a certain distance from the last loop.  Pull into the leading remainder of the working thread and tightly tighten.  The resulting end is threaded into a thick needle and stretched into the end loops.  The product will not bloom and the edge will look neat. </p>
