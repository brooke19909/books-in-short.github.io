Lake Yarovoye - rest</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  More and more relevant, and most importantly, feasible in the current conditions are vacation offers in domestic resorts.  More and more Russians are eager to spend their holidays closer to unique natural sites.  Numerous lakes of Altai can be uniquely ranked as such.  Rest in the bosom of the virginally amazing beauties of this region is becoming more and more tempting for tourists and people who want to improve their health. </p><h2>  Lake District </h2><p>  Due to the many <span>lakes, Altai Krai</span> is considered to be a lake.  And rest on Yarovoy savages is one of the most successful.  According to ancient legends, the endless sea was previously located on this place.  Over time, it dried up, and only large "puddles" (lakes) recall the marine history of these parts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Altai lakes, rest" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20418/473246.jpg" width="600"></div>  Their unimaginable diversity provides tremendous opportunities for recreation.  Some lakes are freshwater, others are extremely saline.  And accordingly, their flora and fauna are also very different from each other.  It is the traveling ‚Äúsavages‚Äù who are more able to realize their own plans and ideas about good rest with a minimum amount of luggage (a tent and drinking water, replaceable clothes and swimwear, a supply of fruits and canned goods).

It is these crustaceans that, when they die, are mixed with silty sediments and salts, as a result of which, over the course of several centuries, healing mud was formed, which Lake Yarovoye is famous for.  Rest on it is favorable for the overall healing of the body and strengthening the nervous system, as well as to achieve a positive effect in the treatment of some intractable skin diseases. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Altai, Yalovo - mud therapy" class="if" height="319" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20418/473078.jpg" width="600"></div>  Amazing effectiveness is observed in the treatment of diseases of the joints and spine, a number of gynecological diseases and infertility in men and women.  The course of treatment can be taken officially at the base of local sanatoriums, even when resting "savages".  Having paid the cost of treatment in the nearest boarding house, you can fully receive healing procedures and feel the care of medical personnel.

    <h2>  Geographic features </h2><p>  Lake Yarovoye, with a length of 11.5 km, a width of 8 km and a maximum depth of 10.5 m, is located in the Kulundinskaya steppe.  The absence of external inflows and drains formed a highly mineralized reservoir environment, due to which the taste of the water is bitter-salty.  The lake is fed by underground key sources. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest in Altai" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20418/473229.jpg" width="600"></div>  The high shores, in the south-west cut by ravines, in no way interfere with organizing a memorable vacation on the wild savages.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  City history </h2><p>  The first mention of the city of Yarovoy can be attributed to 1941, when the memorandum addressed to the Minister of Chemical Industry of the USSR contained detailed arguments justifying the need to create a bromine plant on the shores of a salt lake.  As a result, a year later, in wartime, work began on the construction of the Slavgorod Chemical Plant, which needed large reserves of salt water.  It was thanks to the defense industry that these territories were considered closed for a long time, and there was no information about the uniqueness and beauty of the local natural resources. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake Yarovoye, rest" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20418/473065.jpg" width="600"></div>  The foundation of the city, next to which is the lake of the same name, dates back to 1943.  At that time, a small village was formed on this site, populated by chemists evacuated to the Altai Territory, and already in 1944 the production of chemical products was started.  And more recently (by historical standards) - in March 1993 - the town received the status of a city.

    <h2>  Modern realities </h2><p>  Currently, Yarovoye has become a modern, fairly compact town with a population of over 18 thousand people.  The lush greenery of public gardens and cozy gardens, unique architectural features and natural healing attractions attract many tourists and people who care about their health to Yarovoye. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Spring. Camping" class="if" height="289" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20418/473227.jpg" width="600"></div>  Rest in tents, in local sanatoriums and hotels, the private sector changes the status of the city during the "high" season to the level of tourist Mecca.  Every year, from June to August, the number of vacationers and people taking wellness procedures exceeds the population of Yarovoy 2-3 times.

    <p>  Not far from the city there is a tent camp, which corresponds to the ideas of the "savages" about "comfort" and the features of living in such conditions.  Located 10 km from Yarovoy freshwater lake ("Teply Klyuch") with a well-equipped shore, toilets, cafes and entertainment venues makes a pleasant variety in the "wild" pastime. </p><h2>  Climatic aspects </h2><p>  The sharply continental climatic conditions are characterized by high average daily air temperatures in the summer.  Their level almost completely coincides with the temperature indicators of the southern Russian resorts.  The minimum humidity of the climate, due to which the rest on Yarovoy savages becomes the most attractive, contributes to good tolerance of heat during the summer heat. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Altai, rest (Yarovoye)" class="if" height="353" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20418/473211.jpg" width="500"></div>  Over 2,000 hours a year, the sun shines over the territory of the Kulundinskaya Plain, providing the most favorable conditions for sunbathing.

    <h2>  Lake Yarovoye - a unique vacation </h2><p>  Recently conducted studies on the composition of lake water, salt and mud compounds have confirmed their unique properties: they largely coincide with the characteristics of the famous Dead Sea in Israel.  And the effectiveness of treatment, not inferior to the Israeli counterpart, increases the number of people who want to organize an unforgettable healing vacation.  Lake Yarovoye (Altai Territory) is increasingly being recommended by doctors for the successful cure of certain diseases. </p><h2>  Unsolved mysteries of antiquity </h2><p>  According to the ancient legends of the Scythian peoples, being on the lake contributes to the fulfillment of desires.  The lines of the earth's fault passing along the bottom of the reservoir and called by scientists "abnormal" confirm the guesses of the ancients, attracting with the incomprehensibility (for today's understanding) of mysterious phenomena in Altai.  "Rest - Spring - beauty and health" - clearly interrelated concepts.  It is possible that the energy message that forms the realization of our cherished desires is created precisely due to a combination of available natural factors: bitter-salt water, silty sediments and abnormally healing (in these places) faults of the earth's crust. </p>

Scientists have not yet been able to give a scientifically based explanation of everything that is happening and, probably, will never succeed (because such energetically acting natural forces can never undergo any quantitative measurement).  Although, maybe this is not so, because humanity cannot yet compose an integral "picture" of universal processes, but is content with only fragmentary and incomplete knowledge, which can often distort our perception of the world to some extent.

    <h2>  Recommendations and Tips </h2><p>  As special recommendations when bathing in such a saturated saline solution, it is advisable to consult a doctor in advance so that a prolonged stay in the local waters does not adversely affect the cardiac and nervous systems.  Rest on Yarovoy savages involves leisurely walks along the coast, which is very useful for respiratory diseases. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest in Altai" class="if" height="489" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20418/473228.jpg" width="494"></div>  Vapors of lake water saturated with bromine compounds are very useful for inhalation.

    <p>  The "wild tribe" of modern vacationers can feel all the amazing fragility and charm of pristine nature.  As the "daily bread" you can choose the culinary delights of Ukrainian, Uzbek or Japanese cuisine, offered on the berths of Yarovoy.  And, of course, no one canceled the food cooked at the stake, with aroma and delicious smoky aftertaste.  Approaching modern realities, travelers increasingly use miniature gas stoves, very convenient in camping conditions. </p><h2>  Aquapark </h2><p>  For the most comfortable sunbathing holiday, on two beaches the lake shores were covered with fine-grained sand.  You can rent sun loungers and pedal boats, use the shower and wash off the salt from the skin, which is so famous for the Yarovoye Lake.  Rest for children is impossible without visiting a local water park.  Fans of marine entertainment enjoy the artificial waves and steep bends of water slides.  Joyful pleasure from overlapping emotions makes the time spent in the water park invisible.  As a result, the whole day for children and adults skating, floundering and screaming with delight flies by in an instant. </p><h2>  Youth pier </h2><p>  For outdoor activities, there are two beach-entertaining complexes on the coast called quays (22 and 42), the cultural program of which includes regular discos and <span>foam parties.</span>  As invited guests you can see DJs and many "star" artists who come to Lake Yarovoye. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest on spring savages" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20418/473230.jpg" width="600"></div>  Rest on berth 22 is best suited for youth parties.  In the evening, this place turns into an open-air nightclub.  The system of shopping and entertainment facilities includes a 24-hour open- <span>air cafe</span> designed for 1000 seats, and two bars, as well as a small souvenir shop and shooting gallery.  For children there is a games room, a variety of <span>water slides</span> and other types of beach activities.

    <h2>  Family joys </h2><p>  Berth 42 is best for families.  A more relaxed atmosphere, European and <span>Ukrainian cuisine</span> in a summer cafe with 400 seats (to the accompaniment of live music, with a working mode until midnight) is designed for complete relaxation with your family.  Children's attractions, breathtaking roller coaster rides and trampolining are designed to entertain young visitors. </p><h2>  Holidays in the Altai Mountains </h2><p>  In the steppe regions, of course, there are no areas of active tourism such as mountaineering and skiing, which in the greatest diversity offers mountain Altai.  Holidays on alpine lakes primarily require extremely active physical activity, which is not very suitable for unprepared tourists, although the dizzying romance of horseback riding and hiking routes, fast-adrenaline rafting on crazy mountain rivers and the mysterious atmosphere of speleological tours has constant fans.  An incredible burst of energy and a healing effect comes from the amazing combination of the purest mountain air and mesmerizing, delightful landscapes, which are available to the maximum during a ‚Äúwild‚Äù vacation in tents.  Against the background of flowering meadows and glacial lakes, magnificent waterfalls and steep cliffs, the "mood" of the human body is involuntarily changing for the better. </p>
