    <p>  VHI is regulated by contract.  According to it, the company undertakes to pay for the services that are prescribed in it.

This is due to funding cuts.  The current tariff of 3.6% cannot provide coverage for medical care even for the working population.  The sphere will develop if the necessary funds are available. </p>
