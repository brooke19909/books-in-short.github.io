    <h2>  Where to begin </h2><p>  True, it‚Äôs best to prepare before this.  Especially if you are going to make a profit on the Internet constantly or on a regular basis.  It doesn't matter which way.  The main thing is that the work on the Web will occur repeatedly. </p><p>  Making money with the mind is not so difficult.  But before that, it is recommended to prepare for the process.  Firstly, without fail, get yourself an electronic wallet.  It is useful for transferring electronic money, followed by cashing it (if you wish).  Perfectly suitable "WebMoney" or "PayPal".  The first option is in great demand. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Secondly, it is desirable to have a working account on social networks.  One that will help you with your work on the web.  It‚Äôs best not to use a regular account, so you won‚Äôt be bothered when you are resting.  This item is optional, unlike the previous one. </p><p>  Thirdly, if you are thinking about how to make money in Russia with your own mind, and even on the Internet, it would be nice to register as an individual entrepreneur.  This option is relevant for those who plan to constantly conduct their activities and make a profit.  In general, registration is not required at the moment, it is very difficult to track Internet earnings.  Therefore, many "omit" this feature.  With a small profit, no individual entrepreneur is needed, but if you earn a lot in order not to find problems with the tax authorities, you will have to become an individual entrepreneur.  You can work on the "simplification". </p><p>  It is also recommended that you have a plastic debit card in your bank.  And tie it to a particular account.  Withdrawing money from an electronic wallet to "plastic" is much easier than issuing a money transfer.  All this was invented for the convenience of citizens. </p><h2>  Scammers </h2><p>  How to make money in Russia with your mind?  This question interests many.  After you prepare to earn money on the Web, you can determine the direction of your activities.  This topic causes a lot of controversy, disagreement and problems. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="make money online" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1240410.jpg"></div>

Especially when it comes to the use and application of intellectual abilities and knowledge.  The first and not the most honest option is particularly cunning and dodgy.  It's about fraud. </p><p>  You can earn money on the Internet by divorcing people for money.  For example, it‚Äôs enough to create a ‚Äúfake‚Äù website, which is an investment company.  Or post job advertisements (that you are looking for employees to work at home), and then ask for an insurance premium to make sure the integrity of the potential employee.  Full of fraudulent schemes, you can try to implement any of them.  But this is not recommended.  After all, usually when people think about how you can make money wisely on the Internet, we are talking about more honest tricks. </p><h2>  Surfing </h2><p>  Which ones?  There are a lot of options.  And everyone can choose something worthwhile.  Earning on the Web itself is divided into many categories.  Novice users may try to surf the Internet. </p><p>  We are talking about the so-called viewing of advertising for money.  Often, thinking about how to make money in Russia with your own mind using the Internet, this is the option chosen by beginners.  It's simple - you look at sites and ads, and you just get paid for it.  Not too much money, but it's better than nothing at all. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="earn your mind now" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1240409.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Internet surfing per month on average can bring you 2-3 thousand rubles of income.  This is subject to constant work.  For a student or a woman, maternity leave is a very good option.  You need to find a special exchange (site) that offers to make money on advertising, register there, attach an electronic wallet to your account and watch commercials and services.  Most often they choose to work on several exchanges, it is not so difficult.  The leaders at the moment are: SeoSprint, VipIP, Wmmail.  Registration is free, there is always work. </p><h2>  Sales </h2><p>  Earn with your mind right now!  To do this using the Internet, you can use a method such as organizing sales on the Web.  This option is most often used by sales managers.  Real people who sell something in stores. </p><p>  Usually it‚Äôs just enough on social networks and the Internet to advertise a product (most often it is about cosmetics, household chemicals and goods for children), place orders and receive interest from them.  Not everyone can handle such work, and the competition here is huge.  Rather, it‚Äôs not even earning with the mind, but simply a trick that helps to profit from the main job.  So it is not worth focusing on this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make your own mind" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1240408.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Web Design &amp; Programming </h2><p>  Make money with the mind on the Internet?  Easy!  Especially if you have knowledge in the field of web programming and design.  And indeed in any computer activity.

The option is very profitable, but not for everyone.  If you do not have any knowledge in computers and programming, then this method is not for you.
