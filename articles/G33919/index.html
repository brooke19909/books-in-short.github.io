It is hard to imagine that a parody talent will help him become a laureate of the Tony Award (theatrical analogue of the famous Oscar), which he received for his best role in a famous musical. </p><h2>  Biography </h2><p>  Dan Fogler, whose full name is Daniel Kevin Fogler, was born on October 20, 1976 in Brooklyn, New York.  His mother, Shari, is an English teacher, and his father, Richard Vogler, is a military doctor.  A private theater school was opened at <span>Boston University</span> , in which the future star learned the basics of the difficult acting profession. </p><p>  The first thing Dan Fogler, whose biography from the very beginning was connected with musicals and productions of Shakespeare and Chekhov plays, learned, in his own words, to dance in leotards and perform all those unthinkable actions that could not fit with himself. </p>

    <h2>  Singer popularity </h2><p>  For the first time, his talent was talked about all over the country when in 2005 he played the role of Mr. Barfie in the acclaimed musical The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee.  The whole plot of the production was that six oddly clumsy teenagers who entered puberty take part in a Putnam County spelling contest.  Their mentors are three of the same eccentric adults, who somehow managed to avoid all the difficulties that usually arise with the onset of transitional age. </p><p>  During the contest, teenagers not only compete in spelling, but also begin to understand that winning it is not the most important thing in life, and if you still lose, this circumstance does not make you a failure.  Dan Fogler himself (photo in the article) is sure that he was able to best embody in his character, Mr. Barfie, all those fears from which he himself suffered during his youth. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The actor was pleased with his work and said on this occasion that it was precisely this that he wanted to portray him on stage.  It is safe to say that Fogler himself came up with his character: fanfaron and an unbearable bouncer with a gait of a duck, waddling from side to side.  It is worth noting that this show was an amazing success, and this is evidenced by the fact that its show on Broadway lasted for more than nine months!  For this work he was awarded several awards, but the most respected of them was the Tony Award. </p>

    <h2>  Film career </h2><p>  First, Dan Fogler, whose films are now known and loved around the world, starred in short films.  The first one came out in 1999 and was called Brooklyn Thrill Killer.  It was a drama directed by directors Paul Franco and Derek Davidson.  However, the real fame for him as a movie actor was brought by the picture ‚ÄúBalls of Fury‚Äù by Robert Ben Garant, which was released on large screens in 2007.  Here Vogler played the main role of Randy Dayton - an extremely gifted ping-pong player, whose career, alas, rolled down.  However, the CIA provided him with the opportunity to return to the big sport, but for this he must take part in an illegal tournament organized on the estate of a criminal authority.  In this film, he played with the famous actor <span>Christopher Walken.</span> </p><p>  In the same year, Dan Fogler appeared in another film - a comedy called "Good Luck Chuck!"  - along with Jessica Alba and Dane Cook.  In 2009, he already shot his own picture "Hysterical Psycho."  It was a truly explosive mixture of thriller, comedy and horror.  His film was honored to open the Tribeca Film Festival, held at that time in New York. </p>

    <p>  In 2013, his second work as a director was released - the film Don Peyote.  By the way, he himself played the main role in him of the muddler and the loser Warren, who toiled from idleness until he met a homeless eccentric who told him about the imminent end of the world.  Forty-year-old Dan Vogler now has 45 acting and 3 directorial works, and he has also successfully starred in several films at the same time, most of which should be released this year. </p>
