If you are looking for an Easter tree, how to make it, then try to learn more about the ingredients from which it is created. </p><p>  This tree should look luxurious, because it symbolizes the beginning of a new life.  It will perfectly decorate the center of the kitchen table, and next to it you can put your Easter gifts, just like you put gifts under the Christmas tree for New Year and Christmas. </p><p>  You can make an Easter tree with your own hands, using not so many improvised means, but at the same time you need to try. </p><h2>  What do you need for work </h2><p>  To get the necessary ingredients, go to your garden or any park, break off a few branches of cherries or willows, which bloom just at that time.  This is the easiest way to make your own Easter tree. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself Easter tree master class" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/737987.jpg" width="225"></div>

Most likely, five or six branches will be enough for you, but more can be. </p><p>  You will also need a vase in which you put the branches.  It must be strong to support their weight. </p><p>  If you want your Easter tree to last longer, then you need to take a special container, usually used for flowers, and fill it with water.  You can add a little salt or special filler to the water.  Do-it-yourself Easter tree, the master class we are studying now, can be decorated with flowers, for example, lilies or roses.  You can take branches of lilac and add them to the general bouquet. </p><h2>  Easter eggs </h2><p>  The more you decorate this item, the more joy it will bring to your home.

    <p>  Most often, the branches of the Easter tree are decorated with Easter eggs.  You can buy ready-made products in the store and attach them to tree branches.  But if you really love everything done by your own hands, then take ordinary eggs, make holes in them through which they pump out the contents.  And then you can decorate the resulting empty shells in a variety of ways.  Make an Easter tree from <span>eggs dyed with</span> natural dyes, for example, using onions.  You can paint them with gouache or watercolor, making ornaments with a brush.  There are craftsmen who decorate eggs with beads, stringing them on strings, and thus create whole artistic compositions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Easter nest </h2><p>  Bird's nest is a common decoration for <span>Easter.</span>  Do-it-yourself <span>Easter</span> tree will look much better if you hang a nest on its branches.  To create such an ornament, you can use straw, glue, moss, grass, cardboard. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="easter tree how to do" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/737991.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  To make an Easter nest, you will first need to prepare a cruciform base for it.  With the help of a thin wire, it is necessary to form coils into which willow twigs are woven.  A decorative nest can be set on a beautiful plate, or you can cover it with grass and decorate with colorful feathers. </p><p>  Do-it-yourself Easter tree will look great if you decorate it with a bird's nest and put Easter gifts inside.  You can connect your children and close relatives to making gifts, which will help you arrange everything properly. </p><h2>  Gifts </h2><p>  Knitted Easter eggs can be used as gifts for such a tree.  You can knit a shell for eggs with cotton thread, acrylic or wool. </p><p>  If you knit from thin threads, then number two knitting needles are best.  You pick ten loops on the knitting needles and knit them with a garter stitch, that is, alternating the front loops and the wrong ones.  You can alternate different colors of yarn or make ornaments. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="easter bead tree" class="if" height="317" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/737994.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Having tied a small canvas twenty centimeters long, we sew it, fill it with filler and attach a ribbon to it.  Then you can put it in the Easter nest or hang it in the room. </p><p>  The material for creating such an egg is not necessarily thread.  You can not only knit it, but also sew it.  To do this, make a pattern, and for sewing use silk or chintz. </p><h2>  Birds and rabbits </h2><p>  Your Easter tree with your own hands will look better if birds and rabbits sit in its branches.  In order to create a decorative bird, you just need to take a tennis ball, decorate it with feathers that will represent the tail and wings.  In the branches of the tree you can plant rabbits, which can be made independently.  Option - buy a chocolate rabbit in a special store and hang on a branch.  Such a tree can be decorated with several pieces of carrots. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="easter bead tree" class="if" height="279" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/737988.jpg" width="238"></div>
