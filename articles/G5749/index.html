  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The best smartphones with moisture protection: an overview of popular models, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Contact with water is perhaps the most common reason for the failure of a mobile gadget.  Naturally, many users would like to minimize damage or avoid such unpleasant situations at all. </p><p>  Many popular brands went to meet consumers and began to produce smartphones with moisture protection.  Of course, they cost much more than ordinary analogues, but you have to choose the lesser of two evils.  But here there are some nuances. </p><h2>  Features of waterproof smartphones </h2><p>  The level, like the protection class, is different.  This indicator is usually denoted by the letters IP.  For example, IP53 class is a protection against dust and falling splashes.  While IP65 is a dustproof gadget that can easily survive a direct jet.  The best class to date is IP68.  Such a gadget can be safely immersed to a depth of 1 meter for half an hour. </p><p>  We will consider devices starting from IP65.  They meet the real concept of "waterproof".  All phones below this level, alas, will survive only splashes.  So do not flatter yourself and believe in advertising.  For example, a well-known Chinese brand announced the latest Huawei smartphones with IP53 moisture protection.  But in fact, this level will protect your gadget from dust and more.  A small spray to mobile phones is not a hindrance. </p><p>  Next, consider the best smartphones with moisture protection.  Denote the remarkable characteristics of the devices, as well as the opinions of users regarding each model. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Top smartphones with moisture protection: </p><ol><li>  Samsung Galaxy S8. </li><li>  iPhone X. </li><li>  HTC U11. </li><li>  Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact. </li><li>  Google Pixel 2. </li></ol><p>  We analyze the characteristics of the devices in more detail. </p><h2>  Samsung Galaxy S8 </h2><p>  The flagship of past years from the South Korean brand Samsung received the highest possible level of protection - IP68.  The gadget is not afraid of water and calmly dives to a meter deep without any consequences for it (within half an hour). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.samsung.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung Galaxy S8" class="if uuid-3242304" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3242304.jpg"></div><p>  The Samsung smartphone with moisture protection received a 5.8-inch display, 4 GB of RAM, excellent cameras and one of the fastest processors in this market.  It is also worth mentioning the advanced fingerprint sensor and attractive design, which today looks very fresh. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews of the owners, the only weak point of this smartphone with moisture protection is the battery.  3000 mAh capacity is not enough for the voracious Android platform and such a powerful set of chipsets.  But having instant recharges partly solves this problem. </p><h2>  iPhone X </h2><p>  Apple also has moisture-proof smartphones.  The new ‚Äúten‚Äù received the IP67 class.  So the gadget can dive to a meter depth for a short time.  We should also mention the exterior of the device. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="store.stormfront.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone X" class="if uuid-3242308" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3242308.jpg"></div><p>  The brand in this case moved away from its usual format and released a frameless device with the maximum possible useful area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe screen.  With a diagonal of 5.8 ‚Äù, this solution very significantly adds practicality to the gadget. </p><p>  Also pleased with the amount of internal memory - 256 GB, a powerful processor, excellent cameras, a bright display and the ability to unlock by face identification.  The device does not have any problems.  But here exorbitantly high price once again lubricates the whole pleasant impression. </p><h2>  HTC U11 </h2><p>  The flagship smartphone with moisture protection from the NTS brand fully complies with the IP67 standard.  That is, it can safely be immersed to a meter depth for several minutes without fear.  This model is very different from its predecessors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="HTC U11" class="if uuid-3242305" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3242305.jpg"></div><p>  The manufacturer completely redesigned the case and added very beautiful shades that play both in the sun and under a normal room light.  Alive, such a transfusion looks quite interesting.  However, the brand did not fully follow fashion trends and made the gadget in the usual 5.5-inch case with a frame. </p><p>  The model received an impressive set of chipsets that will digest any modern gaming application.  Pleased with the capabilities of the cameras.  The main peephole with a 12-megapixel matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãable to shoot any panorama in the best possible way. </p><p>  Users mostly respond positively about the model.  Fans of the NTS brand products are absolutely thrilled.  But some did not enter the old format.  They want to see a frameless design. </p><h2>  Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact </h2><p>  The latest generation of Compact has received the highest possible protection - IP68.  This device will be of interest primarily to those who decry the spade-shaped gadgets and are used to the classic form factor that fits perfectly in your hand. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.connect.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact" class="if uuid-3242306" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3242306.jpg"></div><p>  The diagonal of the display is 4.6 inches.  The device received an attractive appearance with a traceable "angularity" - the signature difference of Sony devices.  Despite the fact that the case is plastic, it cannot be called mediocre.  High-quality material almost like a metal cools your hand and does not give away from the model with a state employee. </p><p>  Pleased with the "filling."  A powerful processor, 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of internal, as well as a nimble video accelerator that quietly pulls out any game applications at maximum graphics settings. </p><p>  It is also worth mentioning the presence of a fingerprint sensor, quick charge functions and a USB interface of type C. Some users complained in their reviews about the low resolution of the screen matrix - 1280 by 720, but this is enough for their diagonal.  Pixelization, even with careful study, is not traceable. </p><h2>  Google pixel 2 </h2><p>  On sale you can find two varieties of the second generation "Pixel" - with screens of 5 and 6 inches.  Both devices fully comply with the IP67 protection standard.  Gadgets can be safely bathed in the bathroom without fear of spoiling them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.zdnet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Google pixel 2" class="if uuid-3242307" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3242307.jpg"></div><p>  The smartphone received a classic exterior and a fairly quick set of chipsets: a powerful processor, 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of internal.  The gadget quietly launches serious gaming applications at high graphics settings. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, many users liked the smartphone‚Äôs camera.  They showed excellent performance in poor light conditions, not to mention working on a fine sunny day.  But the apparatus also has a couple of spoons of tar. </p><p>  Firstly, the lack of support for memory cards.  For some users, 64 GB may not be enough, so hard disk space has to be used more rationally.  And the second is a 2700 mAh battery.  A sufficiently powerful processor on board and a high resolution matrix of the screen eat up the battery in front of your eyes.  Of course, if you do not abuse the "heavy" games and video in Full HD-scan, then there will be no problems. </p>
