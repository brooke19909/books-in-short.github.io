    <h2>  Hotel Policies </h2><p>  In accordance with the internal rules adopted by Vera Stone Palace 5 *, hours are set here for the registration of arrival and departure of guests.  So, the settlement of the staying travelers is carried out starting from 14:00.  However, this rule is not strict, and the administration always tries to meet tourists.  Therefore, if you arrived earlier than the deadline, provided that your room has already been vacated by the guests who stayed there before you and properly prepared by the hotel maids, you can enter it immediately.  Such an opportunity is not always available at the peak of the holiday season, when the hotel complex is full, as they say, "to the eyeballs."  So, if your room is not yet ready for check-in, you can leave things in the storage room and dine in the restaurant, take a swim in the pool, take a walk around the hotel or go straight to the sea on the beach. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As for the departure from Vera Stone Palace 5 *, you must vacate the occupied room before noon.  Upon delivery of the keys, it is also necessary to pay the cost of living.  You can pay both in cash and with plastic cards of payment systems such as Mastercard or Visa.  The question of the possibility of paying with cards of other payment systems should be discussed in advance with the hotel.  If you bought a tour to Vera Stone Palace through a travel agency and fully paid for it for your stay, then when you leave you will only have to pay for additional services if you used them. </p><h2>  Accommodation for guests with children </h2><p>  Since the five-star hotel complex ‚ÄúVera Stone Palace‚Äù positions itself for the most part as a place for a family vacation, tourists with children of all age groups are welcome here.  At the same time, if you place in your room on an extra crib a baby up to two years of age or in existing beds - a baby up to twelve years old, then you will not have to pay extra for this.  Placing a child over twelve years of age or an adult in an extra bed will cost 70% of the cost of living for one person.  Keep in mind that in each room of the Vera Stone Palace Resort 5 * hotel complex, only one extra bed for children or adults can be installed.  In addition, if you require such a service, you must inform the hotel in advance and receive confirmation from it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

Perhaps the only minus of the tourists called the location on the second line.  However, many travelers claim that walking a few minutes to the sea with an unhurried step is not at all difficult, but, on the contrary, is even pleasant.  The beach itself was very clean, large, with comfortable sun loungers and tents, as well as a bar and restaurant.  Some vacationers, however, were a little confused by the fact that <span>beach towels</span> can be replaced, albeit for a symbolic ($ 1), but surcharge. </p><p>  As for the rooms Vera Stone Palace (Cholakly) 5 *, then most Russians were completely satisfied with them.  So, cleaning was carried out regularly, and bed linen and towels were changed on time.  In particular, maids tried if vacationers left a tip. </p><p>  No particular disagreement arose over nutrition.  So, many of our compatriots found the food here very diverse and delicious.  You could always find a dish to your taste.  So neither adults nor children remained hungry.  In addition, I was pleased with the opportunity to dine right in the restaurant on the beach without having to return to the hotel. </p><p>  The largest number of positive reviews about the Vera Stone Palace Hotel relates to the animation team working in it.  So, our compatriots found its representatives as true professionals in their field who really love and know how to entertain holidaymakers.  So, many tourists say that they did not see a similar level of animation in other five-star hotels in Turkey.  Moreover, the entertainment program covers everyone here, regardless of age and nationality.  So, for the kids a mini club is open daily, and discos are held in the evenings.  For lovers of outdoor activities classes in aerobics, yoga and other sporting events are held.  And those who prefer to relax by the pool, expect a lot of fun contests and other recreational activities.  And, of course, in the evenings, bright and fiery shows are held in the hotel's amphitheater. </p><p>  Summing up, we can confidently say that the vast majority of Russian tourists were quite satisfied with their stay at the five-star Vera Stone Palace Hotel (Side, Turkey).  They do not exclude the possibility of coming here again and will be happy to recommend this hotel to their friends and relatives. </p>
