    <h2>  Agency weaknesses </h2><p>  Most modern people are much more willing to use the services of real estate services than on their own.  Nevertheless, practice has shown that all such agencies, regardless of size, use approximately the same schemes.  This means that no matter which company you choose, you still can‚Äôt guarantee the instant availability of a suitable option.  Large agencies will not treat your request as piece goods.  And small firms, as a rule, use proven schemes that are developed by the above companies.  And this means that the result will be the same.  So <span>how to quickly buy an apartment?</span>  Each of us is quite capable of making successful transactions, the subject of which is real estate of any type.  However, before this it will be useful to independently study the work of real estate agencies.  This will highlight the basic principles, determine the procedure and draw on the information you need.  For example, you need to know that at present there are two main areas of work of real estate companies.  Their most important difference lies in the method of payment for the services provided.  According to the first method, you can choose among the options selected by the employees of the organizations indicated above, and pay a certain amount when visiting each of them.  Thus, the transfer of funds to your agent is a gradual replenishment of the balance in relatively small amounts.  With this form of activity, you as a buyer should beware of the dishonesty of the agent.  After all, the more housing options you visit, the more money will be transferred.  According to the second method, the realtor still picks you up a number of apartments that fit the specified requirements, however, payment for his services is carried out only once upon arrival.  This means that the search for options will continue until you find the very apartment in which you want to live. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to buy an apartment" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10908/498380.jpg" width="600"></div>

A similar phobia is quite real.  However, it can be avoided.  So <span>how to buy an apartment?</span> </p><h2>  Advice </h2><p>  As the saying goes, "aware - means armed."  Therefore, you can avoid trouble if you have enough of the necessary information.  It is important to remember that the people who sell the apartments are not very different from other sellers.

    <h2>  Stage one: search for offers </h2><p>  Currently, more and more people can be ranked among those who daily and actively use the World Wide Web.  Therefore, each of them will be able to easily answer the question of how to find an apartment without a realtor.  This action is actually quite simple.  It is necessary to write the required query in the search line of any browser.  After that, you will be offered the Internet pages of a huge number of sites, the main purpose of which is to provide data on the apartments sold.  Here you can expect the first of the tricks.  For example, the submission of an advertisement is not by the owner of the apartment, but by an employee of a real estate agency.  Nevertheless, you can learn about this trick without even opening a detailed description of the ad.  You need to scroll down a bit.  If you come across two or more ads that show the same contact information, you can safely discard such options.  The same advice applies to the issue of how to rent an apartment without a realtor.  Remember that if you set out to carry out a transaction without any intermediaries, and the previously mentioned ads are tied to the same phone number, then they will lead you to the same person. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The second nuance waiting for you is the distortion of information.  It is clear that every seller wants to sell their goods at the maximum cost, and for this it is important to advertise the merits of the property.  In addition, quite often you can find ads in which the attached photos are not true.  For example, they may display some other object.  Unfortunately, in most cases, checking such a discrepancy becomes possible only during the inspection of the apartment. </p>

Nevertheless, if you were wondering how to buy an apartment without intermediaries, it will be important to pay attention to the following aspect: how often the property in question was sold and bought.  Ideally, the apartments should change ownership as few times as possible.  Otherwise, doubts creep in by themselves: is the apartment as good as they describe it?  What prevented previous owners from remaining in it?  Perhaps the answer to such questions will help visit neighbors.  Ask them about the former residents and other inhabitants of the entrance.  The second point that should be clarified with the seller is to clarify the issue of whether the property in question was not subject to litigation.  It is possible that the owner is trying to sell the seized apartment.  In addition, pay special attention to the number of heirs (if the current owner received the apartment by the will of his relative).  If there are any other persons applying for this dwelling, then find out the reason why they refused the apartment.  In practice, there are cases when, after some time, relatives suddenly appear, eager to settle on the living area in question.  Privatization remains an important issue.  Check if all the persons registered in this apartment were present at the time of purchase of real estate from the state.  Indeed, otherwise they may challenge the privatization carried out in court.

In this situation, you can pay attention to the room-by-room sale of housing.  This is not considered such an expensive pleasure, but finding the right option requires patience and perseverance.  So how to buy a room without a realtor?  Generally speaking, attention should be paid to those aspects that have already been indicated earlier in this article.  Nevertheless, when buying part of the housing, namely the room, you must remember that you become a co-owner of the property in question.  This means that some stranger to you will have as many rights to the property in question as you.  In addition, after the successful conclusion of the contract of sale, without your consent, various operations with this apartment will become impossible.
