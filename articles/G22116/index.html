    <h2>  About the resort </h2><p>  A delightful coast, small coves, majestic mountains and green valleys - all this is in Rhodes.  This is the most advantageously located Greek island, the season here lasts quite a long time - from March to November.  It was at this time that the weather in Rhodes pampers tourists and vacationers, the air warms up to 28-30 degrees of heat.  But being here is quite comfortable, there is no suffocating heat, and all this is largely due to the fresh sea breeze. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Moreover, before the beginning of the season and to its end, many tour operators offer tours at a huge discount.  A great opportunity to relax on the coast, surrounded by chic nature. </p>

    <h2>  About hotels </h2><p>  Of course, the correctness of the chosen hotel largely affects the quality of rest.  So, in Rhodes there are a huge number of hotels and hotels of various levels and price categories.  Here you can find very modest and budget city options or something luxurious and fashionable, demonstrating first-class service.  The choice of one or another option primarily depends on the preferences of the tourist and, accordingly, his financial capabilities.  We want to bring to your attention a rather modest hotel Faliraki Rose 2 *.  What are the conditions for tourists to stay?  Does it fit your description? </p><h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  So, <span>the Faliraki</span> Rose 2 * <span>hotel</span> is located in the small Greek village of Faliraki, 14 km south of the <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãof Rhodes.</span>  The hotel enjoys a favorable geographical position, because it is only 16 km from the airport.  Accordingly, tourists do not have to languish on the way from the airport to the airport.  Thus, there is more time to relax. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Some tourists believe that the Rose Hotel is far from ideal, its main drawback lies in its location.  Yes, the hotel is located outside the administrative center, but this is not critical.  The sea is far enough here, tourists will have to spend time daily on the road.  In principle, the hotel corresponds to its 2 stars. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  For the comfort of your stay in the hotel are responsible for the equipment and interior rooms.  Hotel Faliraki Rose 2 * <span>(Rhodes, Faliraki)</span> is no exception in this case.  Vacationers are offered a choice of rooms of several categories.  All apartments have an elegant interior, spaciousness (25 sq. M.) And functionality.  The atmosphere is simple, modern, therefore stylish and comfortable. </p>

    <p>  Each room has a private bathroom with a shower.  You can enjoy the sound of the surf and the view of the surrounding countryside of the village and the whole island on a chic terrace or balcony.  Moreover, all vacationers will be able to use the fully equipped kitchen with a refrigerator, a kettle and a set of dishes necessary for cooking and eating.  I must admit, the food prices in restaurants and cafes in Europe are just cosmic, the situation was worsened by the fall of the Russian ruble, so having a kitchen will be a great opportunity to save.  Comfort and pleasant coolness in Faliraki Rose 2 * rooms are supported by air conditioning.  Of course, breakdowns occur, in this case it is enough to contact the hotel administration with your claims - breakdowns will be eliminated in the shortest possible time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  The rooms are really spacious, bright, outwardly quite pleasant and comfortable, the furniture is new, comfortable.  Vacationers celebrate peace and quiet in the rooms - here you can really relax and enjoy the clean sea air.  The rooms do not have a TV.  For some tourists, this is a significant drawback.  If you came to Rhodes to relax, get acquainted with its history, cultural and natural attractions, then the absence of a TV will be practically not noticeable for you. </p><h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  The territory is small, but well-maintained, a lot of greenery.  All guests of the Faliraki Rose 2 * Hotel (Rhodes) can use the free parking.  Rhodes Island is considered the most beautiful in Greece, so many tourists rent a car, wanting to enjoy the scenery and visit all the sights for a short vacation.  So, now you don‚Äôt have to worry about the safety of the car and the parking place. </p><p>  The hotel has a barbecue area: in the evenings, a lot of vacationers gather here, sharing their emotions and impressions. </p><h2>  Entertainment and sports </h2><p>  The weather in Rhodes is quite affectionate, there are about 300 sunny days a year, however, you do not always want to go to the beach far.  In this case, you can stay at the outdoor swimming pool with a sun terrace, sun loungers and parasols.  Sports equipment and equipment can be rented at the hotel. </p>

The polite and helpful staff will advise you on the most interesting and noteworthy places on the island, tell you where to get excursions. </p><h2>  Service and additional services </h2><p>  If you count on a warm welcome and friendly service, you will definitely like the Faliraki Rose 2 * hotel.

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The hotel has a restaurant where you can have breakfast.  Most often, accommodation in a room does not include meals, but for a fee you can order it.  Continental breakfasts, traditional for European resorts: eggs, sausages, sliced, greens, fresh vegetables, coffee, tea and juices to choose from.  You certainly won't be hungry. </p><p>  A 5-minute walk from the hotel towards the sea there is a small shop where you can purchase everything you need for cooking.  By the way, the prices here are an order of magnitude lower than in stores and shops on the coast. </p><h2>  Beach and sea </h2><p>  The sea from the hotel Rose Hotel Faliraki 2 * (Greece, Rhodes) is really quite far away.  All lovers of beach holidays will have to spend 25-30 minutes daily on the road to the beach.  The beach here is gorgeous - clean fine sand, a smooth entry into the water and crystal clear and clear sea water.  All the beaches here are municipal, enough vacationers gather in the season, but due to the wide coastline, everyone can find a place.  If you are looking for a more secluded place, you can walk on both sides along the coast - you will find many deserted places hiding in the rocks. </p>

    <p>  For an additional fee, you can rent a sun lounger and an umbrella protecting from the scorching sun, as well as sports equipment and equipment.  Here, on the beach, you can buy a ticket for a luxury speed boat, yacht, go on it to the open sea or go fishing.  The places here are luxurious, picturesque, there are a lot of people who want to enjoy the island from the water. </p><h2>  Who is the hotel suitable for? </h2><p>  Most often, the Faliraki Rose 2 * hotel for their vacation is chosen by those tourists who want to visit the legendary Greek island, but are limited in means.  Indeed, reviews of tourists note that you can buy a tour with accommodation in this hotel for only 300-400 dollars for two people.  Of course, it‚Äôs stupid to wait for luxury, the presence of a chic and equipped area, but for a stay that involves staying at the hotel only late in the evening and at night, this is a good option. </p><p>  Of course, you can expect a lot from the hotel, but it should be understood that a 2-star hotel simply by its nature cannot be chic.  If you try to look for flaws, spoil your vacation, you definitely will not get pleasure from it.  We recommend taking a closer look at this small hotel. </p>
