Fortunately for man, not everything is lost - there are still sources of good fresh water on the planet.  The cleanest river in the world flows not somewhere, but in Russia!  What kind of river is this, what is it called, and why is practically nothing known about it?  It's time to sort it out. </p><h2>  Where is it flowing? </h2><p>  To establish where the cleanest river in the world is located, you need to turn to the map of the Russian Federation and find the republic of Mari El on it.  Here, in wonderful places, in the Morkinsky district, known for its excellent ecological situation, there is a river called Voncha.  Small and seemingly inconspicuous, it is recognized by scientists and researchers as the cleanest river in the world, and not only in Russia or Europe. </p><h2>  Numerical characteristics and the surrounding area </h2><p>  Voncha, the length of which is 33 km, is an inflow of the same small river.  To fly.  The width of the Vonch reaches only some 2-3 m, and the depth is even less - 1.5 m. It is even surprising that it was she who was able to win the championship in such a worthy nomination! </p>

    <p>  Voncha hides in the wilderness of the Mari forests, makes its way through thickets of alder, bird cherry, raspberry, curls among spruce and pine trees, and its small rivers and crystal clear springs, which are its tributaries, fill it.  The cleanest river in the world originates near the village of Wonzhedur (Vonchidur), in the name of which there is a mention of a river flowing near Wonche.  Near the village, two streams merge into one - this place is the source of the river. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Further, the flow path stretches through the lakes Yurdurskoe (in translation "the edge of many lakes") and Kozhlaerskoe (in translation "fir lake").  In general, this whole area is famous for a large number of reservoirs, legends about which have been going on since the time of the nomadic Mari tribes, who went to the forests from the coming invaders, Tatars and Bulgars, lived inside the forests, successfully engaged in fishing and having plenty of fresh water supplies necessary for of life.  So, from another river, Yushut, to Voncha, you can count more than 20 lakes, and there are even more streams and springs! </p><h2>  The cleanest river in the world: description </h2><p>  Woncha struck with its crystal clearness and the abundance of diverse vegetation around it of the members of the first expedition, which went to its shores and took a sample for analysis.  The cleanest river in the world is located mainly in <span>impenetrable forests,</span> where there are many fallen trees and dry stumps.  In this sense, Woncha was even lucky, because such a natural shelter protects her from excessive human intervention.  Not far from the banks of the river, a large number of birds and animals live, to whom the river provides access to water, clean air and an independent ecosystem. </p>

    <p>  Interestingly, Voncha was full-flowing many years ago and occupied a whole valley.  However, then the river became shallow due to man felling of trees and the appearance of numerous fields.  Today, such activities in the areas where the river is located has been discontinued, which favorably affects the general condition of the Vonchi. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  By the way, an interesting fact: one of the rarest species of fish is found here, namely European grayling.  What is the cleanest river in the world that can still boast of such inhabitants?  Woncha does not cease to justify its own uniqueness and the correctness of awarding it primacy in the category of purity. </p><h2>  Rivals </h2><p>  Many rivers claimed the title of the cleanest river in the world.  So, the second place was taken by the river.  Uba.  In addition to her, there is a winner in the nomination ‚ÄúThe Most Transparent River in the World‚Äù.  It is about <span>the Verzasca River</span> in Switzerland.  By inexperience, it can be mistaken for the cleanest river in the world, but this is not so - an analysis has confirmed that Voncha is a certain leader in purity. </p>

    <h2>  How was the study conducted? </h2><p>  The scientific community has established an indicator of water purity for this river thanks to ethyl.  At <span>Mari State University</span> , a trebutyl analysis was performed.  The results were astounding, stunning - absolutely no pollution was found in the river!  Although the whole region is famous for its good and stable environmental situation, even here for Voncha there are no equal.  The analyzes were carried out and subsequently repeated and double-checked, but each of them only confirmed the correctness of the initially established fact. </p><h2>  Why is it the cleanest, but called ‚ÄúVoncha‚Äù? </h2><p>  The cleanest river in the world, interesting facts about which by no means have exhausted itself, got its name not from the Russian word ‚Äústink‚Äù.  "Voncha" in translation from Mari means "I will pass", "go", because the verb "vonchash" defines the action "pass", "move".  From here the names of nearby villages and villages, such as Wonjepol and Wonjedur, were born.  The river itself can also be called ‚ÄúWonja‚Äù (this is what it is called in the upper reaches) - the existence of several pronunciation variants is due to the fact that the sound ‚ÄúCh‚Äù in the Mari language combines something between ‚ÄúZh‚Äù and ‚ÄúCh‚Äù itself. </p>

    <h2>  The connection of man and the river </h2><p>  The cleanest river in the world, the photos of which demonstrate its beauty, grace of bends and bends, is a pride for the residents of the Mari El Republic, although, admittedly, still not everyone knows about this heritage of their native land.  Be that as it may, it was in this region that famous Mari poets, writers (for example, the famous writer Sergei Chavain), composers and other talented cultural figures grew up - probably the crystal clear Voncha contributed to the development of their talent, was that natural inspiring force that every genius needs. </p>

    <p>  There are a large number of monuments of history, architecture, culture and nature.  We are talking about historical settlements with customs, beliefs and traditions preserved from ancient ancestors, about Yurdur and Poklonnaya Hill, Mount Chuksha, as well as mysterious pagan groves called "kyushoto". </p><p>  The 80s of the last century were marked by the creation of the Mari Chodra National Reserve, whose specialists and workers today guard this untouched corner of nature and its pristine purity in order to pass it on to their descendants in good condition.  Of course, the main part of Vonchi is located on the territory of the reserve, because it would be real blasphemy to not include this natural object in the complex of environmental measures. </p>

    <p>  Since ancient times, residents who settled along the banks of the Vonchi live here today.  This includes the villagers of Chavainur and even the people of the village of Papanino (Shorganyal), whose total number is only ... 5 people!  Too much or not much - for Vonchka it doesn‚Äôt matter to whom to provide benefit.  The only condition that a person is required to fulfill is to preserve this area, not to build up the region with factories, plants and other environmentally hazardous enterprises. </p>
