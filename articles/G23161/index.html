  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hotels of Bora Bora - dream islands.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A huge number of people annually prefer a holiday on Bora Bora to any other.  After all, this island is a real paradise for tourists and it is a recognized pearl of the Pacific Ocean.  He received this title thanks to the divine mother-of-pearl lagoon.  Bora Bora has a rich nature, and the purest waters have created many small islands around it, which are called motu.  They have hotels <span>Bora Bora,</span> as well as the airport.  In the middle of the island there are twin peaks, and palm thickets stretch around them.  Such a holiday is extremely attractive for newlyweds, who can also perform a wedding ceremony according to the Polynesian custom.  But not only couples in love come here to enjoy the beauty of the local nature.  Pineapple plantations, luxurious chalets, pristine pools, tropical parks, hospitable restaurants and Bora Bora hotels attract a lot of people. </p><p>  This island is full of life and entertainment awaits guests at every step.  Tourists love to see ancient temples, go to the mountains, take excursions, during which you can feed stingrays and sharks, visit the coral garden.  And the excellent cuisine of the local people causes a storm of emotions: a variety of sweets, fish and <span>breadfruit</span> dishes <span>,</span> fresh pineapples and other goodies.  The island also lures those who cannot imagine life without <span>scuba diving.</span>  In Tupitupiti you can dive perfectly with scuba diving, and even see barracuda, tuna and sharks.  And magical chalets floating on water are ideal for a relaxing holiday. </p><p>  The issue of placement here is not on the agenda.  Reviews of <span>Bora Bora</span> hotels are mostly good.  Perhaps the guests of the island are so fascinated by the magical atmosphere and the beauties of nature that they do not notice anything around.  But some tourists still sometimes complain about the slowness of hotel staff.  But the problem is that this is a feature of the whole nation, so you need to be patient and not be offended by the hospitable locals. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is not a surprise that hotels in Bora Bora are categorized as elsewhere.  Five-star hotels are in great demand.  The wonderful Bora Bora Pearl Beach Resort is located on a small motu and has 70 bungalows.  Some of them are in the garden, some on the shore, and the rest are installed on the water on stilts.  Despite the unusual appearance for Europeans, all rooms are equipped with air conditioning, bathrooms, refrigerators, telephones and minibars.  In addition, the hotel provides a Jacuzzi, two bars and restaurants, a swimming pool, a tennis court and a cinema.  Guests can enjoy water sports, engage in recreational activities, go fishing and cruise around the island. </p><p>  The 4-star Sofitel Coralia Marara is located on <span>Bora Bora Island</span> itself <span>.</span>  It offers 64 cozy bungalows that are decorated in Polynesian style.  As in other hotels, they are located in the garden, on the beach and on the water.  Only valuable tree species are used in the interior, which creates a pleasant atmosphere.  Tourists will be able to visit the restaurant, pool, evening show programs, take <span>a helicopter flight,</span> go fishing and play volleyball or tennis.  Fans of water sports will enjoy windsurfing, diving, water skiing, motorbikes or bicycles. </p><p>  For a good rest, the cozy three-star Hotel Le Matai Polynesia is also suitable.  Visitors are offered here 28 comfortable rooms, including standard ones with views of the endless ocean and bungalows on the water or just on the beach.  The rooms have a TV, telephone, bathroom and even a safe.  Guests of the island can go to a restaurant, shops, take a boat trip, as well as ride a <span>water bike</span> or take a jeep on a safari. </p><p>  The disadvantages of local hotels include the same notorious slowness of staff, which is not to everyone's liking, rather high prices for accommodation, as well as the special atmosphere and interior of rooms.  After all, people who are accustomed to the standard European design of rooms do not always remain satisfied with the local flavor. </p><p>  Vacation on the island is a dream come true for any tourist, it is an opportunity to transfer colorful drawings from postcards to reality.  And the Bora Bora hotels will leave only a positive impression on themselves. </p>
