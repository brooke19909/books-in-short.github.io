Many craftswomen use them for handmade work.  In this article we will consider such interesting material as beads.  We learn how to use it and at the same time make small crafts.  For example, strawberries from beads. </p><div class="photo" data-original="shilas.online" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="strawberry bead photo" class="if uuid-3098360" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/121563/3098360.jpg"></div><h2>  Necessary materials </h2><p>  In order to make strawberries from beads, as well as flowers and leaves as in the photo below, the following materials are needed: </p><ul><li>  red beads - a pack; </li><li>  black beads - pack; </li><li>  white beads - a pack; </li><li>  yellow beads - a pack; </li><li>  green beads (light and dark) - two packs; </li><li>  wire; </li><li>  green thread; </li><li>  scissors. </li></ul><p>  All this will be needed to make five strawberries, three to four flowers, and about seven leaves. </p><h2>  Beginner Workshop: Strawberry Bead </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="beadwork strawberries" class="if uuid-3097489" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/121563/3097489.jpg"></div><p>  Let's get to work.  To make berries, we use a technique such as parallel weaving. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  We perform the following actions: </p><ol><li>  Cut off the necessary length of the working material (15-20 cm) and bend it in the middle. </li><li>  String 3 beads.  We pull one end of the wire through 2 beads and gently pull it together.  It should make a triangle.  1st and 2nd row are ready. </li><li>  Next, at one end of the working material, we collect 3 beads.  We pull through them the other end of the working material.  We are tightening. </li><li>  In the 4th row we collect 3 red and 1 black beads.  We do with them what with the previous row. </li><li>  We add one bead in each row, not forgetting to mix with black, until there are 7 beads in a row.  We knit another row without adding. </li><li>  Then in each row we decrease one bead.  And we do so until we are left alone. </li><li>  At the end, gently twist the wire. </li><li>  We make 5 more such parts and connect them together. </li><li>  Before attaching the last part, in the middle of the berry you need to put a piece of red paper or a ball of plasticine so that the strawberry is voluminous and does not bend in the middle. </li></ol><p>  Now we figured out how to make strawberries from beads. </p><p>  Getting to the flower.  For this we need: </p><ol><li>  Cut 5-6 pieces of wire and string 13-15 white beads on them. </li><li>  Next, the ornamental material needs to be bent so that a petal is obtained, and carefully twist the edges. </li><li>  Getting to the core of the flower.  We collect 6 yellow beads on the wire and close them in a circle, piercing one end of the ornamental material through the last bead on the other side. </li><li>  After that, we collect 3 more yellow beads and thread the end of the wire through the middle bead.  We do this until a small yellow ball is formed. </li><li>  If all the details are ready, then we begin to combine them so that a white flower with a yellow core is obtained. </li></ol><p>  The flower is ready! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  We are taken to the manufacture of small leaves.  To make them, you must: </p><ol><li>  We take light green beads, and the right amount of pieces of wire.  In our case, we need to take 32-36 pieces of ornamental material of 10 cm each. This is enough for 5 strawberries and 3-4 flowers.  For each you need to make 4 leaves. </li><li>  For each piece of wire we collect 10-12 beads and connect the ends, twisting them. </li><li>  After we distribute 4 leaves and fix them to the bottom of the flowers and berries. </li></ol><p>  Now let's start making large sheets: </p><ol><li>  For one piece, you need to dial 10 beads on the ornamental material. </li><li>  Then on both sides add another 15 beads and connect the edges. </li><li>  We continue to do this by adding so many beads on each side to make a leaf. </li><li>  Do this about 3-4 layers. </li></ol><p>  We repeat the work, while doing 12-13 sheets for the bush.  Below you can see the finished strawberry photo from the beads. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="strawberry bead" class="if uuid-3096426" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/121563/3096426.jpg"></div><p>  When all parts are assembled, the ends of the wire of each flower, berry and leaf will need to be carefully wrapped with green thread.  After that, you need to fasten all parts of the bush together.  Such work also needs to be done with a green thread. </p><p>  Next, we take a small flower pot, dilute PVA glue, gypsum in it and mix it with water.  Gently stir all this mass and put our strawberry bush in it.  Let the gypsum harden and paint it in the desired color, or sprinkle with decorative pebbles. </p><h2>  Material for embroidery </h2><p>  In order to embroider strawberries from beads, you must have: </p><ul><li>  red beads; </li><li>  black beads; </li><li>  green beads; </li><li>  needle; </li><li>  thread (fishing line); </li><li>  fabric or finished sample on fabric. </li></ul><h2>  Beadwork according to the scheme </h2><p>  Today, you can embroider not only with thread or ribbon, but also with beads.  Such work is very entertaining and painstaking.  Although the result will please everyone.  Thanks to small beads and needles with a thread (fishing line), you can create masterpieces, embroider huge colorful paintings. </p><p>  In stores for needlewomen, you can buy a ready-made kit for embroidery with beads, which is very convenient.  Well, and who wants to create at their discretion, then pay attention to our proposed pattern for embroidery and get to work. </p><p>  We will consider only a small piece of such subtle creativity.  Let's try to embroider strawberries with beads.  If you want, you can draw an embroidery sketch. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bylinhasepontos.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make strawberry bead" class="if uuid-3099016" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3099016.jpg"></div><p>  Strawberry embroidery with beads is done as follows: </p><ol><li>  We take a needle with a thread. </li><li>  Embroidery begin with the upper left bead. </li><li>  In the first row, it is imperative to embroider from left to right. </li><li>  We stick the needle from the wrong side and pull it from the front.  Grab a bead of the desired color with a needle. </li><li>  We stick the thread in the right corner and pull it from the back.  We repeat with another bead what was done with the first. </li><li>  We keep order.  It is important to remember that the needle must always be pulled out of the lower left corner.  So finish the first row. </li><li>  We start the second row from the upper right corner.  Now embroider from right to left. </li><li>  The third row must be embroidered, as well as the first. </li><li>  If the previous row is shorter or longer, then you will need to get to the next row, making small inconspicuous stitches. </li></ol><h2>  Material for brooches from beads "Strawberry" </h2><p>  Many girls know that a brooch is a very delicate and exquisite decoration for clothes.  But there are times when it is impossible to find a brooch that suits you.  What to do in this situation?  The answer is simple - you can do it yourself. </p><p>  To make jewelry you will need: </p><ul><li>  red beads; </li><li>  green beads; </li><li>  black beads; </li><li>  black beads; </li><li>  green bugle; </li><li>  one large blue rhinestone; </li><li>  basis for beadwork (you can use felt); </li><li>  skin (piece); </li><li>  cardboard; </li><li>  clasp for brooches; </li><li>  needle for beads; </li><li>  pencil; </li><li>  paper; </li><li>  glue; </li><li>  scissors. </li></ul><h2>  Make a brooch </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="brooch bead strawberry" class="if uuid-3099073" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3099073.jpg"></div><p>  Let's get started: </p><ol><li>  In order to make a brooch, you need to draw a sketch of strawberries on paper.  Cut and make a pattern on the basis for embroidery or felt. </li><li>  Next, we trim the contour of the berry.  To do this, use red beads.  How to embroider with such material, we examined above. </li><li>  After proceeding to embroider the leaves.  First you need to sew the bugles so that you can see the veins of the leaf.  We fill the rest of the space with ordinary green beads. </li><li>  Then we begin to embroider in red.  Do not forget to sew large white beads randomly. </li><li>  After you have filled the entire space of the future brooch with beads, we begin to carefully cut it so as not to touch the contour thread.  Next, cut out the outline of the strawberries from cardboard and glue it to the wrong side of the brooch. </li><li>  After that, take a piece of leather and determine the location of the fastener.  Glue it along with the skin to the cardboard and carefully trim the remains along the contour. </li><li>  At the end of the work, we sew the contour with beads or a simple thread. </li></ol><p>  The brooch is ready! </p>
