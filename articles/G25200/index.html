It‚Äôs especially nice to brag to friends with decorative products made with their own hands.  This article offers several workshops where you will learn how to make crafts from tree branches with your own hands. </p><h2>  Preparatory stage for creating a chandelier from branches </h2><p>  Home furnishings will become more fabulous if the ceiling is decorated with an unusual chandelier.  Famous designers have long been working with natural materials, creating real works of art.  Craft from a tree branch with your own hands can be different, but to create a chandelier you will need the following supplies: </p><ul><li>  dry branches of trees; </li><li>  wood glue (preferably a <span>hot glue gun)</span> ; </li><li>  ball to the size of the desired chandelier; </li><li>  varnish, paints of metallic colors; </li><li>  secateurs; </li><li>  metal chain. </li></ul><h2>  Creating a chandelier </h2><p>  DIY crafts from dry tree branches are easy to do, the main thing is to comply with the technology: </p><ol><li>  First of all, you need to process the branches.  To do this, clean them from the remnants of the bark and cut them into sticks 20 cm long. The clumsy branches will look especially picturesque. </li><li>  Lock the ball.  We begin to assemble the chandelier from the top.  In the middle, you need to leave a place with a diameter of about 10 centimeters for the cartridge and light bulb.  You need to glue the branches randomly, carefully fixing them to each other.  The ends of the branches will stick out in different directions, this is good, but you need to make sure that they are no longer than 5 centimeters. </li><li>  It is necessary to collect in parts, from time to time giving the glue time to dry. </li><li>  You can choose any shape of the chandelier, you can make it in the shape of a ball, completely closed, you can leave a round hole at the bottom or in the shape of a lampshade.  It all depends on your desire and imagination. </li><li>  We leave the formed chandelier for a while, so that the glue is completely dry.  It is advisable to place it in a ventilated area.  Craft from a tree branch with your own hands can dry 2-5 days. </li><li>  The next step is to cut through the ball.  Carefully pull it through the hole left for the cartridge. </li><li>  If you want a metallic chandelier, you should paint it with spray paint.  If you want a natural wood color chandelier, it will be beautiful when you cover it with colorless varnish. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY tree branch" class="if" height="467" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28002/1113526.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  Next, we attach a chain to the top of the lampshade, connect the ends together.  And we fix the chandelier to the ceiling by the chain, and inside we lower the cartridge with the bulb.  Particular attention should be paid to the fact that the bulb must be low-power so that the dry branches of the chandelier are not ignited by high temperature. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY tree branches" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28002/1113527.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ol><h2>  What will be required for a <span>coffee table</span> made of branches? </h2><p>  <span>Crafts from</span> tree <span>branches</span> with their own hands for the garden or home are done the same.  Of course, in the case of street objects will have to spend money on varnish and <span>water-repellent coatings.</span>  To create a table you need to cook: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  a thick, forked branch for the table leg; </li><li>  branches of various thicknesses and boards; </li><li>  different numbers of sandpaper; </li><li>  jigsaws; </li><li>  adhesive tape, marker, wood glue; </li><li>  small and large screws; </li><li>  hard putty on wood; </li><li>  varnish and epoxy. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY crafts from tree branches photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28002/1113528.jpg" width="545"></div></h2><h2>  DIY table: stages of creation </h2><p>  Craft from a tree branch with your own hands in the form of a table will require time and attention: </p><ol><li>  Pick a thick branch that will branch into two or three branches.  This will be the leg of the table on which the countertop will be mounted. </li><li>  Process the selected base, remove the bark, saw off unnecessary knots. </li><li>  Next, grind the leg.  Coarse, primary sanding will require coarse sandpaper.  For finishing work, take fine-grained sandpaper. </li><li>  Cut the base so that the branch stably maintains balance, and the place under the countertop has a perfectly flat surface. </li><li>  A very difficult and crucial stage is the manufacture of countertops.  A simple option: cut a countertop from a board, process it, apply a wood pattern to the surface, varnish. </li><li>  There is a more interesting option - to assemble a countertop from tree branches.  To do this, you need to clean the branches, remove all unnecessary, cut along so that the branches retain their shape, but become flat, and fasten together, giving them the shape of a tree. </li><li>  Sand the resulting workpiece thoroughly. </li><li>  Next, put everything on the countertop and cut it off, setting the desired shape.  Glue the branches to the countertop and fix with small screws. </li><li>  Attach the countertop to the base. </li><li>  The next step is useful <span>tree bark,</span> which was cleaned from branches at the beginning of work.  Having slightly moistened and cut to size, it can be fixed with screws and glue from the end of the countertop. </li><li>  All self-tapping hats should be <span>covered with wood putty.</span> </li><li>  Let's start decorating the countertops.  Wash small pebbles and dry thoroughly.  Then fill it with all the gaps between the branches on the countertop, level it.  Pour epoxy to get a smooth, even surface. </li><li>  After the resin has dried, the countertop is ready.  Process all other parts of the table with varnish, and the table is ready. </li></ol><h2>  Cherry branches in a vase </h2><p>  DIY craft from a tree branch may look like a full-fledged item or an exquisite composition.  For the second option, the following raw materials will be required: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  cherry branches; </li><li>  bowl or shade; </li><li>  Newspapers </li><li>  PVA glue, thermal gun; </li><li>  knife, pruner, scissors. </li></ul>

    <p>  Technique of execution: </p><ol><li>  Using papier-m√¢ch√© technique, we make a round blank for a vase. </li><li>  When it is completely dry, with a sharp knife, carefully cut it into two halves and stretch the shape.  Cut through the neck.  Glue the two parts together again. </li><li>  If a flat bottom was not made during the manufacture of the base, then you can glue the legs to the bottom using pieces of twigs. </li><li>  Cut twigs into sticks up to 25 centimeters long.  Next, glue the gun in turn to attach the sticks to the base of papier-m√¢ch√©. </li></ol><p>  Thus, you can arrange watches, hanging flowerpots and other items. </p><h2>  Decorative twig for a vase </h2><p>  Tools and materials: </p><ul><li>  dry sprig of a beautiful shape; </li><li>  vase; </li><li>  corrugated paper; </li><li>  skein of twine, scissors; </li><li>  adhesive thermal gun; </li><li>  <span>gold spray paint.</span> </li></ul>

Carefully, without leaving unpainted gaps, paint the branch with gold paint.  To dry. </li><li>  Glue the leaves to a golden twig, wrap with twine, grease the ends with glue. </li><li>  Ready to put a twig in a vase. </li></ol><p>  Anyone can make crafts from tree branches with their own hands.
