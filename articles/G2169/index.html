    <h2>  What are the components of the price? </h2><p>  You can answer this question for quite some time.  It all depends on where you are going and how much.  Based on this, we will distinguish two main components - accommodation and price for the road.  In most cases, the cost of the permit is fixed, so a lot depends on your place of residence.  However, lately everything has changed a bit.  After Crimea has become a full-fledged part of Russia, traveling there through Ukraine, where it is now extremely unstable, would be very risky and unreasonable.  Therefore, not everyone decides to take the train.  Currently, you need to buy a plane ticket, which will cost you about 10-12 thousand rubles, and then get on a trolleybus, the price of one ticket is about 40-60 rubles.  To cross the Kerch Strait by ferry will cost you only 160 rubles, if you decide to bring your own vehicle with you, then you can safely add another 1,600 rubles.  As you see, to answer unambiguously the question ‚ÄúHow much does a vacation in Crimea cost?‚Äù  impossible, since a lot depends on the chosen route. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Accommodation prices </h2>

    <p>  If you are heading to the sea in the "velvet season", then housing will cost you an order of magnitude cheaper.  If we talk about small rooms that are separated by plywood partitions, then this is the cheapest option.  In September, you will have to pay 200 rubles per person, but in July-August - all 400 from one guest.  Of course, such a room is only suitable for sleeping.  At other times, the person is on the beach or walks, exploring local attractions.  Much also depends on the chosen region: for example, in Yalta the prices are the highest, and the same room with a TV and a bed will cost you 550-600 rubles a day per person.  Actively offered and houses by the sea, the cost of this is about 1600 rubles per day.  If you come with the hryvnia, you can not worry, at the moment it is still being accepted and no changes are planned yet. </p><h2>  Hotels &amp; Villas </h2>

    <p>  This type of housing can no longer be called a budget, as the prices will please not everyone.  If you want to rent a modern house, you will have to pay about 10,000 rubles.  You can also settle in the residence of the political elite of the Soviet era.  Such a pleasure will cost about 5000-6000 rubles a day.  As for hotels, there is a fairly large selection.  There are both budget options and more expensive, which is why the price of holidays in the Crimea varies depending on the region.  Alushta, for example, or rather the hotels of this city, have an average cost, but not everyone can afford Yalta, since prices here start at 3,000 rubles per day.  There is also such a type of housing as a tent.  Such vacationers are called "savages."  In fact, in order to enjoy your vacation at sea in this way, you need to go through a special registration, but most have not even heard of this. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Crimea, leisure, private sector - prices in different regions </h2>

    <p>  As noted above, a lot depends on where exactly you decide to go.  The most expensive place is considered to be Yalta, rest in Alushta will cost a little cheaper.  If we talk about such resort places as Sudak, Evpatoria or Feodosia, then the prices are even lower.  For example, a lunch for one person will cost you an average of 200-250 rubles, so in a week you will spend about 10 thousand from two people.  If you eat in the same way in Yalta, then you will spend more on a couple of thousand.  In principle, if we draw an analogy compared to last year, then Russian citizens can relax a little cheaper.  This is due to the fact that many hotels are idle and offer visitors discounts of 15-20%, which is very good.  From the foregoing, we can make a logical conclusion that if you want to relax as cheaply as possible, you need to go to Yevpatoriya, Feodosiya or Sudak and settle in ordinary rooms, 300-400 rubles per person. </p><h2>  For those who went to Sevastopol </h2><p>  If you really want to visit this resort, but are not sure that you have enough money, you need to carefully calculate everything.  For Russians, the best option is to use the airlines.  From Moscow to your destination, that is, to Sevastopol, you can fly non-stop, which will cost about 12,000 rubles (with transfers 11,000).  You can reduce the cost of the trip a little more if you use the airlines of Ukraine.  In this case, you will fly to Simferopol for about 10,500 rubles, and if with transfers, then for 9,500. Next, you will need to travel by train, it will cost 300 rubles.  As for the cost of living, then the prices are more reasonable than in Yalta.  A quite comfortable room with a TV and air conditioning can be rented for 600 rubles per person, without an air conditioning 400. As for the hotel, you will have to pay about 6 thousand (a double room) for a week of budget accommodation.  So, on average, you will need from 20,000 to 30,000 rubles for a flight and accommodation in a hotel or a room for two people for a week.  Do not forget that you need to eat, in the worst case it will take about 6-7 thousand a week, and at least have a little fun, and this is 3-5 thousand more.  Therefore, take with you 35-40 thousand rubles, this will definitely be enough for you. </p><h2>  We go to Evpatoria </h2>

    <p>  And now we‚Äôll talk about another, no less popular resort city.  Evpatoria is one of the oldest cities that were part of Ukraine.  This giant is already more than 2.5 thousand years old.  There are many attractions, both historical and cultural.  As for sea vacations, it is at a high level, because the local mild climate goes well with clean air.  There are many wellness programs: mud baths, various types of therapeutic massage, etc. Well, now let's talk about how much such a vacation in Crimea will cost us.  Pensions here are a bit more expensive.  On average, it is 1000 rubles per day.  You can count on a refrigerator, air conditioning, TV and free Wi-Fi.  As for the road, you first need to get to Sevastopol or Simferopol, and then come by train to Yevpatoriya. </p>

    <h2>  How to relax well and inexpensively? </h2><p>  Many will say with confidence that you need to choose one thing.  However, this is not entirely true.  If it‚Äôs good, then it‚Äôs not necessarily expensive, just as an unforgettable vacation does not mean that you have to spend a fortune.  Try to fully plan your expenses.  As practice shows, buying individual products on the market and cooking something yourself is an order of magnitude cheaper than eating in a restaurant or cafe.  Although you have come to rest, do not waste your money.  Of course, what to buy and what not is entirely a matter of your interests, but again, control your expenses.  As for housing, do not choose the cheapest.  Often, locals make small rooms from former sheds.  They do not pay tax for them and earn good money.  There you will find cockroaches, and flytraps, and other unpleasant animals.  Take something average so that there are several beds or one 2-bedroom, TV and air conditioning, you can have a fan.  So you can organize an inexpensive vacation in the Crimea without harming your health. </p><h2>  A few important points </h2><p>  With great confidence, we can say that the prices for holidays in the Crimea are very high.  The place, although worthy of attention, but in some places the service is still not up to standard.  On some beaches you will see a solid ashtray, which is not surprising in the best way.  You will never see this on the coastline of Greece or Turkey.  By the way, a 3-star hotel in an inexpensive resort in Greece will cost you as much as a week-long rest in Yevpatoria.  Of course, someone considers it his duty at least once to try a vacation in the Crimea.  Theodosius, for example, is famous for its nightlife, so in the evening there is a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãyouth.  Here you will find many nightclubs, bars and restaurants.  The opposite is another resort city - Nikolaevka (Crimea).  Rest here is more calm, although it cannot be said that nightlife is absent. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  That, in principle, is all that can be said about how much a vacation in Crimea costs.  As you can see, the prices here are very different.  Moreover, if in Sudak the cost of food and housing is the same, then in Yalta the prices are 15-20% higher.  If you go by the so-called "savage" and live in a tent, you can save a lot of money, but such a vacation is not suitable for everyone, but only for those who travel without children and love outdoor activities (diving or windsurfing).  Now you know how much rest in Crimea costs, and you can go on vacation and be sure that there is enough money, you just need to plan everything correctly.  Of course, if your budget is almost unlimited, then you can go to any city and live in an expensive hotel or house. </p>
