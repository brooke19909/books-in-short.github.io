    <p>  If you stay in Estonia until mid-January, you may need an umbrella.  This month, the average temperature is slightly below zero.  It is much warmer during the day, cooler at night, but not lower than -5 degrees.  Snow rarely falls in January, but it can rain.  At this time, the streets of the city are covered with a thin crust of ice. </p><h2>  New Year in Tallinn - places of rest and traditions </h2><p>  It should be noted that Estonians borrowed many New Year‚Äôs customs from the Scandinavian peoples.  Popular hats (wreaths) - belong to pagan traditions.  And the streets of the city are decorated according to European customs.  Cute, like gingerbread houses, dress up with straw crafts. </p><p>  On the tables you can find such celebratory food as jellied meat, roast, stewed cabbage, beer, homemade cakes.  At the end of the feast, the housewives are in no hurry to remove the treats from the table - they are left for disembodied guests, who can stop by guests this night. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Things to do? </h2><p>  No one will be bored here, but you will have the opportunity to walk a lot (the weather in Tallinn has it), admire the local architecture, learn the interesting centuries-old history of the city, enjoy unusual dishes in restaurants and cafes, and learn ancient legends. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="New Year tours in Tallinn" class="if" height="276" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/1104836.jpg" width="460"></div>

    <p>  Numerous temples hold Christmas and New Year concerts and services.  For example, in the Dome Cathedral you can get to the evening of organ music, and on the Town Hall Square to enjoy the performance of musicians and dancers. </p><h2>  What to see? </h2><p>  Tallinn is divided into two parts - Vyshgorod, which is called chivalrous, and Lower Old Town.  In the old days, it was a shopping district.  From Virus Gate, the Old Town begins.  Previously, there were shops and workshops of artisans of the Dominican monastery. </p><p>  Since 1441, the most important Christmas tree in Estonia has been decorated on Town Hall Square.  Here every year a grandiose New Year and Christmas fair unfolds.  There is also the oldest pharmacy, which appeared in the city in 1422, and in which today you can buy wine with various spices prepared according to an ancient recipe, as well as various sweets and marzipan.  This pharmacy has a small museum. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  From the Town Hall Square, where the Historical Museum is located in the Great Guild building, along the old cobbled street Pikk you can go to the P√ºhawaimu church.  Here you can see the most ancient clockwork, stained glass windows and city clocks of the XVII century.  This street ends with the Tolstaya Margarita tower and the Sea Gate. </p>

    <p>  On the parallel Lai street there is an amazing building that belongs to the Middle Ages - "Three Sisters".  Today it houses the luxurious Tallinn hotel.

On <span>New Year's holidays</span> , a special atmosphere of fairy tales, miracles and mystery reigns in the capital of Estonia.  Many people say that Tallinn is great for relaxing with children during the holidays in winter. </p>
