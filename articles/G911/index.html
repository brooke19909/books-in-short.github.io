This craft was invented in China.  It is believed that lanterns are not only a stylish Christmas decoration in the interior, but also an excellent amulet that scares away evil spirits and attracts good luck to the house!  To create such original toys it is worth involving the whole family, especially children, because they love to do crafts and have fun with their parents.

Even a small child will cope with this task, so do not be afraid to involve younger family members in the work.  Use the following instructions to make the jewelry: </p><ol><li>  Take a rectangular sheet of colored paper, cut a strip of one centimeter wide from its edge.  Set this strip aside, it will come in handy later. </li><li>  Fold the remaining paper twice in length, face inward. </li><li>  Move two centimeters from the edge of the paper triangle of the opposite fold and draw a line with a pencil. </li><li>  You need to make parallel cuts from the fold line at the same distance, do not step over the line. </li><li>  The paper triangle can be expanded, turn it on the front side, fold it with a tube.  Connect the edges with tape, glue or a stapler. </li><li>  Glue the strip to the upper part, and you will get a handle, for which you will be able to hang a toy. </li></ol><h2>  Create tissue paper lanterns </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Paper flashlight" class="if uuid-2325790" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67767/2325790.jpg"></div><p>  If you have tissue paper and you decide to create flashlights, then you should know right away that you will need to spend more time on manufacturing, however your flashlights will come out beautiful, elegant and light.  Follow the instructions to make them. </p><ol><li>  Take a couple of sheets of colored tissue paper, bend them in half in length. </li><li>  Fold the paper without fan.  Stick to a 1.5 centimeter bend width. </li><li>  Unroll the sheets, turn them over with the convex side to the table. </li><li>  Reassemble one side of the paper into a fan, and through it stretch a dense thread by threading it in advance into the needle, and be sure to tie the ends of the thread. </li><li>  Perform the same manipulations for the second side of the paper. </li><li>  Gently straighten the folds, secure the edges of the paper with tape, you get a volumetric rhombus. </li></ol><p>  That's how the original flashlight is made!  Crafts can decorate not only the Christmas tree, but also the desktop, windowsill and even the ceiling. </p><h2>  Round lanterns </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beautiful paper lantern" class="if uuid-2325786" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67767/2325786.jpg"></div><p>  This type of decoration is very simple to make, so it is worth attracting children to work.  Round lanterns resemble Christmas balls in shape, so they should decorate the New Year tree.

It is allowed to take papers of various shades. </li><li>  On each strip, step back along the edges of 3 millimeters and in these places make holes with a needle. </li><li>  Combine the paper strips, and insert rivets, which are sold at any needlework store, into the holes. </li><li>  Pull the strips out of the stack one by one, distribute them in a circle so that you end up with a ball.  Better to start from the bottom strip. </li><li>  When the toy is ready, a thread can be attached to one of the rivets for hanging. </li></ol><h2>  Circle lanterns </h2><p>  Flashlights can even be made from round blanks.  It will take you very little time to make the craft, and as a result you will get the original toy. </p><ol><li>  Take a thin colored cardboard and cut out 10 circles of the same diameter. </li><li>  Bend the circles twice with the colored side inward. </li><li>  Glue the blanks to each other in the places of the bend, leave only two circles intact. </li><li>  Insert a paper clip with one end straightened into the central part of the resulting circle.  Fasten the part with super glue.  You have a hook for hanging a toy.  Instead of a paper clip, you can even use a loop from tape or braid. </li><li>  Glue the remaining circles and decorate the toy with other decorative elements. </li></ol><p>  Here you can create such interesting and original flashlights yourself if you wish. </p><h2>  Create a serpentine </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Original serpentine from stars" class="if uuid-2325785" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67767/2325785.jpg"></div><p>  Are you interested in how to make a serpentine?  Now we will deal with this issue.  Serpentine is a thin and long paper tape with which you can decorate a Christmas tree, a room.  To create a decoration, you will need to immediately determine the paper: it should not be too thin, but not dense.  You can get a great serpentine if you use glossy magazine covers in your work.  Landscape paper will not work, it is heavy, and plain color will be just right.  First, white paper should be covered with a layer of watercolor or gouache, you can make blots with a brush, stains.  The surface of the sheet should be interesting to make your serpentine look beautiful.  The width of your tape should be no more than a centimeter.  Glued finished tapes to each other so that in the end you have one long strip.  Do not make the serpentine too long (more than one and a half meters), otherwise there is a chance that someone will get confused in it.  Before use, the tape can be curled by reeling on a pencil.  Just glue the tail with glue or scotch tape after winding on the pencil, and let it lie down overnight.  In the morning, cut the tail - and your serpentine is ready to use! </p>
