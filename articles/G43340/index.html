    <h2>  Geographical position </h2><p>  In the south of the Krasnodar Territory there is an amazing place - the Taman Peninsula.  It is washed by the waters of two oceans: Black and Azov, as well as the Kerch Strait.  The flat terrain, the long coastline with a large number of convenient bays, a favorable climate make Taman a very convenient place for a beach holiday.  The beaches of Taman are more than 200 km long.  High, picturesque, steep banks alternate with gentle, comfortable approaches to the water.  The peninsula is distinguished by diverse vegetation and beautiful landscapes.  The main source of fresh water in the region is the Kuban River and its tributaries.  A feature of the Taman Peninsula is a large number of estuaries and mud springs.  The latter have a therapeutic effect on humans, so relaxation can be combined with recovery. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Climate </h2><p>  The beaches of Taman are in the zone of temperate <span>marine climate.</span>  The weather is due to the influence of two such different seas - the Black and Azov - and the mountains' insecurity from the influence of the continent.  Taman has a large number of sunny days, there are more of them than in Sochi or Anapa.  The summer season begins in May and ends in October.  The average summer temperature is +24 degrees.  The main difference between the climate of Taman is a long, warm and comfortable autumn.  That is why the best grapes in Russia are grown here.  Winter in the region is short, with strong winds and rains, on average the temperature at this time of year is about 2 degrees Celsius.  Spring on Taman is early and dry.  Flowering of plants begins in March-April, and in May it is already possible to sunbathe and swim in shallow water. </p>

    <h2>  Features of rest </h2><p>  The specifics of recreation on Taman is that there is a choice between a calmer and quieter <span>coast of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov</span> and a more active, noisy and cheerful coast of the Black Sea.  The beaches of Taman are predominantly covered with a sand-shell mixture.  The degree of arrangement of the territories is different, you can find very wild places, and you can sit on a comfortable beach with all amenities.  Compared to other resort areas of the Krasnodar Territory, Taman is a less crowded and cleaner area.  It is very good to relax with families and children, although there are noisy fashionable places for young people.  A nice addition to a beach holiday is the interesting nature and mud lakes.  No less important argument in favor of Taman will be lower prices than in the Black Sea resorts. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Beaches rating </h2><p>  Feel free to choose Taman for your holidays.  The beaches, the photos of which are presented on the websites of tour operators, seem the same, but in reality this is not so.  They differ in terms of cleanliness, crowding and infrastructure. </p><ol><li>  By all accounts, the coast of the village of Golubitskaya is considered the best beach in Taman. </li><li>  In the village of Kuchugury is the second most popular and clean beach on the coast of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov. </li><li>  The recreation center "Golden Beach" with its part of the Azov coast in Peresyp takes an honorable third place. </li><li>  <span>Kosa Tuzla is</span> also included in the ranking of the best places of recreation in Taman. </li><li>  In the village of ‚ÄúVolna‚Äù, on the Black Sea side of the peninsula, there is another excellent beach. </li></ol><p>  The most general list is based on reviews of tourists in general.  But each vacationer has his own preferences and wishes for the place of rest.  Therefore, the rating does not claim absolute justice. </p>
