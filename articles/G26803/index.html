Although tourists often call it just a beach.  Apparently, this is just the perfect resort, which is often shown in commercials.  White sand, the ocean along which a chain of hotels stretches, the jungle - what else is needed for relaxation?  Yes, of course, Cuba is not the Maldives, the standard of living is lower, and its specificity also makes itself felt.  And fly here for a very long time - as much as 13 hours.  But tourists from Russia love this place.  What they think about Varadero (Cuba), what they advise to see and what can be done here - we will write below.  So, we go to the most famous resort of the island of Freedom. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cubatravel.cc" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cuba Varadero hotels" class="if uuid-2311063" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2311063.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Regular flights from Russia here simply do not exist.  How to get to Varadero (Cuba)?  In reviews, independent travelers recommend <span>transit flights</span> through Europe.  From Moscow, planes arrive exclusively in Havana.  They are performed by Aeroflot.  But the fact is that Varadero is located on the Ikakos Peninsula.  It is almost 150 kilometers from the capital of the country - Havana.  Therefore, tourists warn that after a long flight, a fairly long transfer awaits you - about four hours.  By taxi a little less, but expensive. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  And yet, you need to translate the clock.  Time in Varadero (Cuba) differs from Greenwich - by 5 hours less, and from Moscow - by 7. That is, if in the capital of Russia 19:00, then in this resort - 12 hours. </p><p>  In addition, there are difficulties with an independent trip.  The station, where buses leave for Varadero, is located far from the Havana hub.  You can get there only by taxi.  Local buses do not take tourists. </p><p>  If you fly directly to Varadero airport from Moscow, then the transfer must be done in Belgium or Germany.  However, tourists complain that in this case the trip can drag on for 22 hours.  From St. Petersburg connecting flights are convenient via Frankfurt and Vienna.  And from the Varadero airport to the resort, only 20 kilometers, and you very quickly get there by one of the many local buses. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yainis.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cuba Varadero Tours" class="if uuid-2311076" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2311076.jpg"></div><h2>  When is the best time to go? </h2><p>  It is believed that this resort has a temperate subtropical climate.  This means that you can go here at almost any time.  But, like in all resorts, there are seasons here.  The weather on Varadero (Cuba) has such specifics that the so-called wet period lasts from May to September.  It certainly cannot be compared with the rainy season anywhere in Thailand.  There may be showers, but it happens that it is barely dripping from the sky, and the rest of the time the sun is shining. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But at the same time, in July and August, the Cubans, as elsewhere in the world, begin the period of vacations.  Therefore, the number of people on the beaches may increase.  The cheapest season lasts September-October, because these months there is a high probability of hurricanes.  Although they rage there far from every year.  The most favorable period for a vacation in Varadero, tourists call the months from November to April.  True, prices are rising at this time.  The water in the ocean is warmest in summer, and in winter there may be a cooling. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cubatravel.cc" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="All Inclusive Hotels" class="if uuid-2311075" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2311075.jpg"></div><h2>  Tours to Cuba (Varadero) </h2><p>  Why do travelers come here?  Of course, sunbathing and swimming at any time of the year.  Dance salsa and anneal at parties to Latin rhythms.  Drink rum.  To play golf.  Travel around the area.  Not without reason, for 27,000 local residents, most of whom work in hotel services, there are hundreds of thousands of tourists who come to Cuba all year round. </p><p>  Many companies organize trips here.  Usually, their price includes a transfer to Varadero, hotel accommodation, meals.  But what about entertainment?  In the reviews of Varadero (Cuba), tourists claim that even if you travel by ticket from the operator, this does not mean that you have to spend all the time in the hotel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The best way to ride around the resort is to buy a daily pass for a double decker bus.  It is called the "Beach of Varadero Tour".  You can ride on such a ticket all day in different places.  Many more hotels rent bicycles for free.  The main thing, according to tourists, is not to leave them unattended on the street. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yainis.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cuba Varadero what to see" class="if uuid-2311080" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2311080.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  The hotel fund in the resort - these are hotels, often with a large territory, and villas.  If you want to relax cheaper, it is better to choose a rental apartment.  Recently began to build mini-hotels.  But most of the "package" tourists live in large complexes of 4-5 stars.  Bars, restaurants, cascading pools, playgrounds, a vast territory, park areas and even all inclusive - all these are the hotels of Varadero (Cuba). </p><p>  Among the hotels, the best from the point of view of tourists are Melia Las Americas, Barcelo Solimar and Trip Peninsula.  Some of them host the concept of "adults only".  Therefore, they are often used to spend a honeymoon.  Most of the hotels in Varadero (Cuba) that are rated best by travelers are networked.  As a rule, they are intended for wealthy tourists who pay for a high level of comfort. </p><div class="photo" data-original="davidlansing.com" data-author=": David Lansing, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Excursions in Cuba" class="if uuid-2311103" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2311103.jpg"></div><h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  We already mentioned that in the reviews Varadero (Cuba) is called a solid beach.  Indeed, a continuous strip of sand stretches for twenty kilometers.  Some beaches belong to hotels, while others are completely wild and unequipped.  But be that as it may, all of them are free.  The beaches of Varadero are constantly included in the top of the cleanest in the world. </p><p>  There is everything that tourists love - beautiful views, amazing water color, gently sloping entrance, sea caves, wild alluvial spits and coral reefs, suitable for diving and snorkeling.  The water is very warm, not lower than 24 degrees Celsius.  But beachgoers, especially tourists with children, should be wary of tropical jellyfish.  They are often thrown onto the sand after a storm.  The burns of these jellyfish, even the dead, are very painful.  Therefore, one must be careful. </p><p>  Even travelers from Russia appreciate the beaches of Varadero for the fact that, unlike Turkey or Egypt, there is no need to rush to take sunbeds.  There is always enough space here.  In addition, you can find corners where there are absolutely no people.  The beaches are safe, and the coast at the hotels is always guarded. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.minitime.com" data-author=": Sandra Foyt, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Varadero Cuba Attractions" class="if uuid-2311091" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2311091.jpg"></div><h2>  Entertainment, what to bring, what to try </h2><p>  What do tourists say in reviews of Varadero (Cuba) about all sorts of amusements?  Firstly, the beaches have a good infrastructure.  Cafe, water sports, horseback riding, yachting - all this is at the service of vacationers.  In the evenings, almost all hotels have discos, and there are night clubs.  Some cafes are famous for dancing to live music. </p><p>  They bring from Varadero, however, as well as from Liberty Island in principle - the legendary cigars and rum.  This is a mandatory set of Russian tourists.  ‚ÄúKubita‚Äù, ‚ÄúSerrano‚Äù, ‚ÄúTurkino‚Äù - all these magic names for coffee are also very popular among travelers.  In Varadero, such goods can be purchased at the Roma House, Cigar House shopping centers, as well as in Plaza America shopping mall. </p><p>  Even if you have paid for the all-inclusive meals system at your hotel, don‚Äôt refuse to go to local restaurants.  Otherwise, you will never feel the spirit of Cuba.  Fried toast in oil with strong coffee for breakfast, chicken sandwich "Empanadas" for lunch and fresh seafood - lobster, huge shrimp, squid - for dinner.  This is a must-try.  Do not forget that Cuba is the birthplace of such iconic cocktails as Daiquiri and Mojito.  They should definitely be tried here. </p><h2>  Attractions Varadero (Cuba) </h2><p>  There are no historical monuments in the resort.  But this does not mean that there is nothing to watch, and you need to spend all the time on the beach.  Since the weather in Varadero (Cuba) is suitable for pleasant walks in the winter, travelers are advised to take a walk in the local parks, Hosone and Todo en Uno.  There you can find very colorful restaurants. </p><p>  Near the resort is the famous Varaikakos Nature Reserve with unique caves.  You can also play golf here.  But even if you are not a fan of such a pastime, it is worth looking at the main mansion of the club.  This building, called Xanadu, is the former villa of the American millionaire Dupont, with whom the resort began to be built. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.transat.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Weather Cuba Varadero" class="if uuid-2311122" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2311122.jpg"></div><h2>  Where to go from Varadero </h2><p>  Many tourists who come to this resort recommend not to sit in one place.  This is a great base for trips to Cuba.  From Varadero you can go, for example, look at the Boca de Guam crocodile farm.  It is one hundred kilometers from the resort, on the way to the famous Playa Larga Bay. </p><p>  But some attractions are very close.  So, 15 kilometers from this city is a museum - the Jose Smith sugar factory.  Boat excursions from Varadero are also popular.  In Cuba, you can cheaply book a trip on a yacht or boat to the islands.  Not far from Varadero there is a place - Cayo Blanco, with good coral reefs for snorkeling.  Tourists also get as a bonus lunch with seafood, as well as a bar with good alcohol on board. </p><p>  On your own or with guides you can go to the "Caribbean Pearl" - the city of Cienfuegos, founded in the XIX century by the French, or in the capital of the country - Havana. </p><h2>  Travel Reviews for Varadero </h2><p>  Eternal summer, fruits, warm sea and soft sand, paradise life, rum and cigars, incendiary rhythms of salsa - this is how travelers usually describe their vacation in a few words.  It seems that everyone is good at the resort of Varadero (Cuba). </p><p>  In the reviews, however, tourists are not too happy that it is impossible or very difficult to use the Internet, even if you live in a five-star hotel.  Communication, if any, is very expensive, slow and not everywhere.  After all, in Cuba there is the only monopoly operator that is responsible for the Internet.  No choice.  And in the cafes and restaurants of the resort there is no Wi-Fi. </p><p>  The interior and furniture in the rooms are somewhat shabby, and the service as a whole is socialist, that is, very unobtrusive.  The food is usually good.  The excursions are very interesting and informative, and you can go by yourself and find a guide to your taste. </p>
