Either juice turns out to be too rare, or the pulp very often clogs the strainer - such nuances turn a simple lesson into penal servitude.  How to choose a juicer and what you need to know when buying? </p><h2>  Types of devices </h2><p>  Outwardly, all juicers are very similar: a cylindrical body, compartments for laying vegetables, tubes that remove the cake and juice.  However, according to the principle of operation, these devices are screw and centrifugal.  Both types are found on store shelves very often, you just need to make a choice. </p>

    <p>  Which juicer is better - auger or centrifugal?  Let's get acquainted with each type and consider the features of this technique. </p><h2>  Screw model </h2><p>  This juicer processes almost all types of ripe fruits.  It is of three types: </p><ul><li>  manual; </li><li>  horizontal </li><li>  vertical. </li></ul><p>  In order to get juice from softer fruits (tomatoes, citrus fruits, herbs, cabbage), a screw juicer is best suited.  Feedback from users who purchased a device of this kind confirm its convenience and quality.  However, it is worth remembering that it is better to choose electric models that do not require the application of force, otherwise the process of obtaining juice will bring a lot of physical costs and time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Principle of operation </h2><p>  <span>The screw juicer</span> is equipped with a screw shaft, with which it processes the products to be laid.  Its revolutions are powerful, but slow, and there is no <span>centrifugal force</span> .  The principle of operation of the screw juicer is very similar to a conventional meat grinder: when laying, the products are crushed and crushed, rubbed through the net, and the output is thick juice.  Pressed cake and juice go into special tubes. </p>

    <p>  What is a good screw juicer?  Feedback from consumers who have purchased such a model allows us to conclude that its main advantage is slow spin.  When operating at a low speed, the walls of the device and the products do not heat up due to friction, which allows you to save all the vitamins and minerals in them.  The cake at the exit looks dry and squeezed, which indicates the maximum extraction of juice and pulp from processed vegetables or fruits. </p><h2>  What are the benefits? </h2><p>  Screw juicers are leaders in the extraction of large portions of juice from many products.  Vertical models are designed to handle considerable volumes of fruits and vegetables, while horizontal ones can squeeze juice from all types of products, and also have additional functions and nozzles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The main advantages of screw juicers: </p><ul><li>  the juice is very thick; </li><li>  all juice is squeezed out of the products, as dry waste clearly indicates; </li><li>  the juicer is easily disassembled for washing, in some models there is a self-cleaning function; </li><li>  this technique is compact and takes up little space in the kitchen; </li><li>  Due to the low shaft rotation speed, screw juicers consume little power. </li></ul><p>  An important feature of this technique is the absence of noise during operation.  Having connected the device to the network, households will not even guess that at this moment there is a powerful extraction of fruits or vegetables. </p><h2>  Centrifugal juicers: reviews <strong></strong></h2><p>  The principle of operation of this technique is the operation of the engine and centrifuge.  When laying food in the groove of the juicer, they enter the blade, grind and move to the sieve.  Here they are ground using high speed and centrifuge power, which is included in the work. </p>

    <p>  Which juicer is better: auger or centrifugal?  It all depends on the result you want to get.  According to user reviews, the main advantages of centrifugal models are: </p><ul><li>  the ability to process solid foods (carrots, apples, pears, pumpkin); </li><li>  high speed (you can get up to 10 liters of juice in 5-6 minutes); </li><li>  ease of use; </li><li>  a wide neck allowing to process whole vegetables or fruits. </li></ul><h2>  Unpleasant spin moments </h2><p>  However, almost all centrifugal juicers have some obvious flaws that many buyers don‚Äôt like.  This model received reviews of a negative nature upon a detailed examination of the quality and consistency of juice: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  during operation, some valuable substances of the products are destroyed; </li><li>  the juice at the outlet is warm, liquid, and foams when it comes in contact with air. </li></ul><p>  Also significant disadvantages of this model are: the presence of a large amount of oilcake, which makes it very difficult to clean the juicer, and a lot of noise during operation. </p><h2>  Bosch Juicer <strong> </strong>  MES 3000 </h2><p>  This model belongs to the centrifugal type and has several advantages.  A juicer can prepare delicious, healthy juice for the whole family in just a few minutes.  This model is equipped with a fine-grained filter-mesh, which allows you to get a large amount of liquid at the outlet.  The case and all internal parts are made of stainless steel and high-quality plastic, which absolutely eliminates the oxidation of products during processing. </p>

    <p>  However, it should be remembered that the Mulinex juicer of this type is not intended for processing whole fruits.  Before loading into the machine all products should be cut.  If during the spinning process a piece of fruit is stuck in you, you can use the ‚Äúreverse‚Äù function, and the juicer will push the unlucky piece in the opposite direction. </p><h2>  Model Scarlett IS-571 </h2><p>  This centrifugal juicer has already won the preference of many lovers of proper nutrition and fresh juices.  The model is very powerful and has five speeds, which allows you to quickly process loaded fruits.  The luminous panel looks beautiful and stylish, with its help you can adjust the number of revolutions and the spin force.  Moreover, this Scarlett juicer is equipped with a rare program for obtaining pineapple juice. </p><p>  Also, the list of functions of this model includes: protection against accidental switching on, automatic feeding of cake and a special separator for foam.  The case and the inside of the juicer are made of <span>stainless steel,</span> and the neck size is 7.5 cm. </p>

    <p>  Loading whole fruits, delicious juice, high speed, excellent spin - that‚Äôs what you get if you have this juicer in the kitchen.  The price of the model is about 5-6 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  How to choose? </h2><p>  The range of modern home appliances is so large that any buyer can get confused when choosing a seemingly simple device like a juicer.  However, you should not rush, for a start you should determine for what purposes this wonderful machine is purchased.  Which juicer is better - auger or centrifugal, you will understand in the process of choosing a model in the store. </p><p>  Both devices do an excellent job with hard or soft fruits.  However, if you are a lover of thick <span>tomato juice</span> or mass harvesting of it for the winter, choose a screw juicer.  This model also allows you to get the maximum amount of juice from downloadable products, and it will be thick and saturated.  But if you are not a fan of pulp drinks, it is better to choose a centrifugal juicer. </p><h2>  Can all the fruits be used? </h2><p>  How to find out if there are restrictions on the choice of vegetables, fruits or herbs for pressing?  Will your juicer deteriorate when processing hard fruits?  The instructions, which should be in the box of the product, detail and accurately indicate the list of products available for processing.  Pay special attention to this! </p>

    <p>  If you want to pamper yourself with freshly squeezed juices from carrots, apples, beets or pumpkins, opt for centrifugal models.  They have good power, and a wide neck is designed to place whole fruits in it, which is very convenient. </p><h2>  The choice is yours! </h2><p>  To get healthy juice, pay attention to the material of the internal parts.  They should be made of durable stainless steel or high-quality plastic.  Also an important feature of any juicer is the presence of a speed controller and a display with tips to avoid unpleasant errors when it starts. </p><p>  Now you can determine for yourself which juicer is better: auger or centrifugal.  The differences between these models are significant, however, if you want to buy good equipment, look at the manufacturers and its cost.  A good juicer cannot have a low price, as it is made from quality materials and has a wide range of functions. </p><p>  To obtain juice from standard fruits, it is better to choose a centrifugal model.  For processing tomatoes, grapes or herbs, screw devices are better suited.  Decide which juice you like the most, what consistency and volume you need, and you can easily choose the perfect juicer for yourself! </p>
