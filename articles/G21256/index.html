Especially often you have to deal with the problem of <span>how to restore a deleted application</span> on an iPhone. </p><p>  Deletion of important data may occur due to the fault of the owner, as well as be the result of a software failure.  Fortunately, recovering deleted files is possible in most cases.  There are both built-in and third-party tools for this. </p><h2>  Application Recovery Requirements </h2><p>  The only condition is that the user is authorized exclusively under the Apple ID from which the application was downloaded for the first time.  If the program was downloaded under one account and then was deleted, then it will not be possible to restore it in another account.  And when all the conditions are met, the problem of how to restore a deleted application on an iPhone becomes completely solvable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dsi777.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to recover a deleted application on an iPhone" class="if uuid-2931523" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58295/2931523.jpg"></div><p>  Applications can also be restored if it was: </p><ul><li>  paid and will have to pay for it again; </li><li>  removed from the App Store and not available for first download. </li></ul><p>  As you can see, any application after uninstallation is available for recovery. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Ways to recover deleted applications </h2><p>  The most effective and most commonly used tools for recovering files on an iPhone are: </p><ul><li>  iTunes utility </li><li>  Use of iCloud cloud data storage </li><li>  from the device. </li></ul><p>  The methods for recovering files on an iPhone are markedly different from fixing a similar problem on other smartphones.  Therefore, it is recommended that you use the solutions provided by Apple. </p><h2>  The first method: from the device </h2><div class="photo" data-original="softdroid.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to watch a remote application on an iPhone" class="if uuid-2931528" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58295/2931528.jpg"></div><p>  To recover lost information using the device itself, you will need: </p><ol><li>  Launch the UltData program and select the ‚ÄúRecover from iOS device‚Äù tab located in the top menu. </li><li>  Mark applications and attachments in applications needed for recovery. </li></ol><p>  It should be noted that in the left panel there is an opportunity to watch a remote application on an iPhone and gain access to its contents. </p><h2>  Second way: iTunes utility </h2><p>  ITunes software product developed specifically for Apple devices allows you to buy licensed software, upload new content to your iPhone, as well as remotely control your device and create recovery points. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="mysettings.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to return a remote application to an iPhone" class="if uuid-2931536" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58295/2931536.jpg"></div><p>  Before returning the remote application to the iPhone, you need to find a copy of the operating system on the personal computer.  Backups are not created automatically, so they should be done manually. </p><p>  So, to create a recovery point you will need: </p><ol><li>  Connect the smartphone to a personal computer and launch the iTunes utility. </li><li>  After the computer detects the device, select "Create a copy."  After a while, copying starts, after which you can see the corresponding inscription in the "Recent Copies" section. </li></ol><p>  To restore the application using iTunes, you must: </p><ul><li>  Connect the device to a personal computer and go to the "Shop" section. </li><li>  Select the "Shopping" section. </li><li>  Find the deleted program and go through the recovery procedure. </li></ul><p>  Now, if any files were accidentally deleted, they can be returned using the previously created recovery point. </p><p>  Consider another method to return previously deleted files.  To do this: </p><ol><li>  Connect iPhone to computer and open iTunes app. </li><li>  Select "Restore from copy" in the "Browse" window. </li><li>  Select the desired backup point from the list and start resuscitation. </li></ol><p>  At the end of this process, all data at the time of the date specified at the recovery point will be returned. </p><h2>  Third way: iCloud cloud storage </h2><p>  Cloud data storage helps to automatically create iPhone backups with all user information.  To activate this function, you must enter the device settings and enable the corresponding item in the "Storage and copies" tab. </p><div class="photo" data-original="iphonegeek.me" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="I deleted the contact on the iPhone how to restore" class="if uuid-2931537" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58295/2931537.jpg"></div><p>  As a result, with constant access to the Wi-fi network, recovery points will be created automatically at intervals set by the system.  It should be noted that the disk capacity is 5 GB.  However, the space can be increased for an additional fee: 60 rubles for 50 GB. </p><p>  Before restoring a deleted application on an iPhone using iCloud, you must: </p><ol><li>  Download cloud data storage via iPhone and log in to your account using a password and Apple ID. </li><li>  In the window that opens, select "Settings". </li><li>  In the lower left corner find "Advanced". </li><li>  The Restore Files tab will appear, in which the data deleted during the last 30 days will be located.  It will be enough to just mark the necessary files and click "Finish." </li></ol><p>  If the user deleted the contact on the iPhone, how to restore them to the phone book or return notes and reminders to the calendar, you can find out in the ‚ÄúRestore files‚Äù tab. </p><p>  Recovery of lost data does not require special knowledge.  The problem of how to restore a remote application on an iPhone can be dealt with using the functions provided by the device itself or a number of applications that simplify this process. </p>
