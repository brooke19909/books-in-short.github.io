Sharm El Sheikh, hotels: tourist reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Have you ever heard of the Iberotel il Mercato 5 * hotel?  Sharm El Sheikh <strong> </strong>  if you visit, you can see it.  You will be taken to the resort town of Egypt, located on the <span>Sinai Peninsula,</span> in its southern part.  The hotel is located on the Red Sea coast.  He's great!  It was built in the South Sinai Governorate, where Sharm El Sheikh is one of the district centers.  The resort existed during the Ottoman Empire.  When Sinai was occupied by the Israelis in 1967-1982, the city was called Ophira.  Back in the 1970s, it was a small village.  It has gained tremendous popularity among tourists due to its convenient location, good climate, rich natural world, rapid and quality development.  It must be added that this metropolis is completely unlike typical Egyptian cities.  It differs from the beloved by tourists of Luxor, and from the capital of Cairo.  There is no resemblance in it with the Alexandria founded by the Greeks.  And the second main Egyptian city - Hurghada - is its complete opposite.  Sharm el Sheikh resembles, rather, the European resorts of the Mediterranean. </p><h2>  Tourism and rest </h2><p>  The resort of the European level is Sharm El Sheikh.  Hotels, 5-star and not only beaches, places for tourists to rest are located on its coast in an incredible amount.  Here are open more than two hundred hotels of various types and price levels.  Almost all establishments are equipped with swimming pools.  People get to the beach by bus.  On the seashore, they not only sunbathe and swim.  They are offered diving, snorkeling, scooter and water skiing services.  There are also bathyscaphes and boats with a glass bottom, on which tourists travel with pleasure through the sea. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
