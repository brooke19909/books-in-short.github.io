And if only 10 years ago only bouquets were made of flowers, today plants are an integral part of many decorative compositions.  Vibrant flowers adorn the walls and tables, as well as decorate food.  A composition in a pumpkin can decorate a table for any holiday.  How to make such an unusual decor, read below. </p><h2>  Composition with ears </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pumpkin compositions" class="if uuid-2230924" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2230924.jpg"></div><p>  To create such an element of decor will not be difficult.  A composition in a pumpkin, collected from dried flowers, can please a person for six months.  Making such a craft is simple.  But to prepare material for its creation will be troublesome.  After all, it is necessary to collect ears of corn in the field, to collect dried flowers, poppy heads and all small things, for example, cones and acorns.  After that, you need to prepare a pumpkin.  Cut off its upper part, remove the pulp and dry the crust in a natural way.  The main thing is that it does not become moldy during the drying process.  When all the preparatory work is done, you can begin to make a pumpkin composition with your own hands.  First of all, put a floristic sponge on a dried pumpkin base.  It is necessary to stick the legs of all plants into it so that the bouquet stands evenly and does not fall apart at the slightest touch.  First you should create a cent composition from spikelets.  In a second layer, frame a bouquet of dried flowers in a circle.  You can use not only flowers, but also various branches and even reeds.  If it seems to you that the bouquet turned out to be boring, supplement it with cones and acorns. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Autumn composition </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="autumn composition in pumpkin" class="if uuid-2230925" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2230925.jpg"></div><p>  What flowers are associated with the golden season?  Right, chrysanthemums.  You should choose them if you decide to make a composition in a pumpkin of flowers.  To build such an element of decor will be easy.  Do not have to dry a pumpkin or flowers.  But a <span>floristic sponge,</span> to create this decorative work, you will definitely need it.  We begin to make the composition in the pumpkin by dividing the yellow round beauty into two parts.  They do not have to be even, and the cut should not be made too straight.  Show your imagination.  Remove the hat from the pumpkin and cut the flesh from both the top and bottom of the vegetable.  In the resulting hole we place a floral sponge.  We close the pumpkin with a lid, and begin to fill the slot with flowers.  You need to select chrysanthemums in one color scheme with a vegetable, that is, in red, orange and yellow colors. </p><h2>  Flower arrangement </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="composition in a pumpkin of flowers" class="if uuid-2230926" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2230926.jpg"></div><p>  To make such a decor you will need a special, decorative vegetable.  Its difference from ordinary pumpkin is that it does not grow moldy.  We cut off the top of it and clean the flesh.  Now let the peel dry and paint it in any color.  When this stage is completed, you can begin to create a composition in a pumpkin.  The first step is to place a floral sponge in the blank.  We wrap it in cellophane, soak it with water and place it in a pumpkin.  Now you should stick flowers in a sponge one by one.  The composition may consist of any plants.  It can be standard roses, tulips, daffodils, etc. Do not use only those flowers that have too short a stick.  You can complement the composition with decorative branches. </p><h2>  Pumpkins in a pumpkin </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY pumpkin composition" class="if uuid-2230927" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2230927.jpg"></div><p>  There are two ways to make such a composition.  In the first we need small decorative pumpkins, and in the second we need to make paper mini-vegetables using papier-m√¢ch√© technique.  What to do, choose for yourself.  Autumn composition in a pumpkin is made as follows.  It is necessary to clean the orange beauty from the pulp and dry the workpiece well.  Then half the pumpkin should be filled with old newspapers.  But in the upper part of the vegetable, beauty should be created.  We put a floral sponge on the newspapers and strengthen the ears in it.  Now on the one hand you need to put miniature pumpkins in a chaotic manner.  If you want them to shine, you should first coat them with glossy varnish.  Maple leaves, grapes, rowan berries, rose hips and even decorative beads can complement this composition. </p>
