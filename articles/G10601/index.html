Trying to choose the right model and pattern, you can easily get confused.  Especially if the one for whom the entire project is being started cannot clearly articulate his requirements.  In this case, it is best (to save your time and nerves) to offer the man several simple options for cutting a sweater, choosing universal color schemes. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="men's sweater knitting scheme" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1467732.jpg" width="392"></div>

    <p>  He can agree to a classic <span>men's knit cardigan</span> (the scheme of which will be quite simple for a knitter). </p><h2>  Yarn: colors, composition, thickness </h2><p>  It's no secret that many men prefer conservatism when it comes to choosing clothes.  Of course, there are nonconformists who like light green jeans and bright pink shirts, but now we will not talk about them. </p><p>  In this article, two models of simple but very interesting jumpers will be considered.  Each of them can suit a man of almost any age: beloved, father, younger brother.  In addition, these things will be very practical, since they can be worn at work, at school, and in bowling. </p><p>  It will take at least 800 grams of yarn to knit a men's cardigan with knitting needles.  The schemes are designed for threads of medium thickness (about 250-350 m / 100 grams).  The composition of the material can be any.  Here you need to build on the preferences and needs of the ‚Äúclient‚Äù.  For heat-loving, 100% wool or blended yarn (50% wool or angora and 50% acrylic, cotton, bamboo or microfiber) is suitable.  Some men, even in winter, prefer exclusively cotton products, since they are hot in woolen ones.  This is especially true if they are the happy owners of quality winter jackets. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Getting to work </h2><p>  First of all, you need to bind a control sample.  This is an obligatory step for all craftswomen who want to make a man's jumper with knitting needles the first time and without blooming.  The pattern scheme is important for the size of the paintings: if there are harnesses, they must be present on the control sample.  Otherwise, the finished product will be less than planned. </p><p>  After steaming the sample, you can begin to calculate the loops.  Above is a universal man‚Äôs cardigan with knitting needles, patterns and patterns will help to knit a product of any size. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="jumper male knitting scheme" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1467733.jpg" width="482"></div>

    <h2>  <span>Facial surface</span> - as easy as shelling pears </h2><p>  All the details of this sweater are connected with a simple hosiery knit (front loops on the front side, wrong side on the wrong side).  Despite the simplicity, the product looks quite decent due to the neutral color and stripes of the jacquard pattern.  Among other things, the craftswoman must do all the work extremely carefully, observing the same density and symmetry of the details, so that a high-quality men's sweater with knitting needles is obtained.  The pattern of the ornament (even the most beautiful) will not be able to distract attention from disproportionate armholes or a skewed neck. </p><h2>  Scythe - timeless classic </h2><p>  The following model is an interesting combination of simple braids and an elementary pattern of front and back loops. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting patterns for men's jumpers" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1467734.jpg" width="406"></div>  In order to correctly distribute the strips of various ornaments on the details of the front and back, you should carefully measure the control sample and draw the location of all the elements.  Many craftswomen use checkered paper to plan such ornaments.  One cell can be 2, 4, 6, or even 8 loops.  It depends on the size of the rapports. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knit male cardigan with knitting scheme" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1467735.jpg" width="441"></div>

    <p>  In this case, the <span>men's knitting jumper, the</span> scheme of which is proposed above, is connected as follows: </p><ol><li>  Detail of the front and back to the neckline: ¬Ω scheme M1, scheme M2 (braid 4/4), scheme M1, braid, scheme M1 (central fragment), braid, scheme M1, braid, ¬Ω scheme M1. </li><li>  The upper part of the main paintings: M3 scheme. </li><li>  Sleeve (before dusk): scheme M, braid (center), scheme M1. </li><li>  Sleeve sleeve: M3 pattern. </li></ol><h2>  Making a collar </h2><p>  The designer used a fairly common and beloved type of collar to design this men's cardigan with knitting needles (schemes for this part are needed). </p><p>  The collar is made in the following way: </p><ol><li>  Loop calculation is done. </li><li>  The required number of elements is drawn on circular or straight knitting needles. </li><li>  A fabric with a height of 8-10 cm is knitted. Almost any elastic band (1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, French, English and others) can serve as a pattern.  The peculiarity of this detail is that its edges do not have to be even: they are consistently expanded and then narrowed.  The addition of loops occurs in each front row from two sides (two loops on one row).  When the collar is half knitted, you need to start reducing the number of elements.  This is done in the same way as before this addition.  As a result, when the part is folded in half and sewn to the roll-out of the neck, a collar of the desired shape will be obtained. </li><li>  When fixing parts folded in half to roll out, its edges are superimposed on each other. </li></ol><p>  The finished product can only be steamed with steam from the iron and presented to the happy future owner. </p>
