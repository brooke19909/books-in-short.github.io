  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DIY lightning brooches - master class with explanations and photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you are thinking about how to make a brooch with your own hands, then pay your attention to crafts from zippers.  Among old things it is easy to find unnecessary "snakes" that can be used to make beautiful jewelry.  Often craftsmen make flowers and insects, hearts and birds, fruits and berries.  Some people prefer abstractions from geometric shapes. </p><p>  How to make zipper brooches with your own hands, we will consider in more detail in our article.  Crafts from products with metal teeth are spectacular, but often plastic clasps are also used.  The basis for drawing a pattern laid out from strips with teeth is felt.  It is easy to purchase in small sheets at any sewing accessories store.  The range of colors is so large that you can choose the right shade for any outfit. </p><p>  Crafts made on denim and using wool for felting look interesting.  There are brooch options only with zippers, but crafts with colorful fabric inserts look beautiful.  Additionally, the decoration can be decorated with rhinestones or pebbles in the frame, sew or paste half beads or metal rivets. </p><h2>  Beautiful flower </h2><p>  To work on the brooch below, you will need the following materials: </p><ul><li>  black metal clasp with large links; </li><li>  an orange "snake" with small metal teeth; </li><li>  needle with an orange thread; </li><li>  glue gun; </li><li>  black felt circle; </li><li>  safety pin. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lightning flower" class="if uuid-3089810" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3089810.jpg"></div><p>  Before you start working on a zipper brooch with your own hands, cut off the fabric with scissors and scorch the entire strip with a candle so that the threads do not crumble.  On a prepared black felt circle, glue a coiled large strip of lightning with hot glue.  Cut the orange clasp into equal lengths, wrap it with loops and sew in the center with threads selected to match the fabric.  When you collect a lot of petals, wash them around the middle in a circle.  Pin a safety pin on the back, you can put a brooch on a blouse. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Spectacular jewelry </h2><p>  A flower-shaped brooch can be created differently.  It is sewn from one fastener, even a slider is used.  The basis is a circle of felt, this time in white.  The back petals are created from equal segments of the ‚Äúsnake‚Äù by stitching stitches along the free edge of the fabric.  Then the workpiece is pulled together with a thread to get the assembly and the semicircular shape of the metal part.  Then all the petals are attached to the base. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="flower from slices of &quot;lightning&quot;" class="if uuid-3089822" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3089822.jpg"></div><p>  The foreground of the brooch is folded from a long strip with a spiral and sewn along the edge to the felt.  Next, you will need a glue gun to securely fix the slider in the center of the crafts.  A brooch clasp is attached to the back side. </p><h2>  Filling a pattern with wool </h2><p>  Handmade masters often use felting wool for their crafts on lightning crafts.  It is easy to purchase both on the Internet sites and in the stores of goods for needlework, and of all kinds of colors and shades.  The first step is to choose the basis for the brooch.  Felt or felt sheets will do.  On the drawn contours of the picture, the ‚Äúsnake‚Äù fabric pre-cut to the teeth is sewn.  Some attach it with hot glue, but more often they sew it, bypassing each tooth in turn. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/417145984217838042/"><img itemprop="image" alt="flower from &amp; quot; lightning &amp; quot; and felting wool" class="if uuid-3089811" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3089811.jpg"></div><p>  Sometimes, making do-it-yourself brooches from lightning is carried out along the edge of a drawing element cut separately.  When all the details of the sketch are trimmed with teeth on the sides, they are combined into a single pattern, and then glued to a sheet of felt, matched to the tone of the craft. </p><p>  The last stage of work will be the actual stuffing with wool.  The process is carried out gradually, above each part separately.  In addition, you need a felting needle or a special device with a bunch of needles for work.  From below, be sure to place a sheet of foam or foam so that the needle passes through a bundle of wool and felt through and through. </p><h2>  Dragonfly brooch </h2><p>  To make such a zipper brooch with your own hands, as in the photo below, you will need a long black clasp, a colored fabric with a pattern and a felt sheet of any color.  An article is made of 3 separate elements: the central part (the body with the head), the wings on the left and right. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dragonfly brooch" class="if uuid-3089802" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3089802.jpg"></div><p>  For the body, the "lightning" is folded into a skein and the long edge is bent in half.  The connection is more convenient to perform using hot glue.  Do not forget to scorch the edges of the remaining tissue near the cloves.  To make wings, parts from fabric and felt are cut out and sheathed around the perimeter with a ‚Äúsnake‚Äù. </p><p>  The last step in working on a brooch will be combining all the finished elements on a black felt basis.  A dragonfly is attached to a large piece of fabric, and then excess is cut with scissors along the contours.  It remains to sew the clasp and the craft is ready! </p><h2>  Craft "Butterfly" </h2><p>  This is a complex work consisting of many small parts.  It is advisable to have a full-size painted template to use to try on pieces of lightning. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful brooch &quot;Butterfly&quot;" class="if uuid-3089817" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3089817.jpg"></div><p>  All elements are fixed on a black felt sheet with a glue gun, and the voids between the teeth are filled with felting wool. </p><h2>  Decorating brooches </h2><p>  The brooch made in the form of the first letter of the owner‚Äôs name looks original.  First, the inscription's perimeter is sheathed, then several finished parts are inserted inside. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="decorating brooches from lightning" class="if uuid-3091908" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3091908.jpg"></div><p>  The rest of the empty space is filled with small decorative elements - beads and pebbles of different colors and sizes.  The craftwork looks bright and colorful, therefore it is recommended to wear such a decoration only on a plain thing. </p><p>  The article presents a master class of brooches from "lightning" with a step-by-step description of the work.  Try and you can create such original crafts with your own hands!  Good luck </p>
