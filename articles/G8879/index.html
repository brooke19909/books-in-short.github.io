This is so, but in Samara there is another river, which is called the same name as the city - the Samara river.  And if through the Volga in the territory of the urban district you can only cross river transport, then through Samara or Samarka, as locals call it, until recently there were two bridges.  One of them has existed since 1954, the second - South - allows motorists to move around since 1974.  Of course, for a million-plus city, two bridges with such distances and the number of cars are clearly not enough.  Fortunately, in 2014 a new modern bridge was launched - Kirovsky. </p>

    <h2>  Cable-stayed bridge in Kirovsky district </h2><p>  The new <span>Kirov bridge in Samara</span> is cable-stayed.  What is this design? </p><p>  Imagine a suspension bridge when ropes or ropes are thrown from coast to coast, to which the pedestrian part of the bridge is attached.  A cable-stayed bridge is akin to a suspension bridge.  Its construction also uses steel cables - cables, but they are not fixed on the shore, but on high supports, which are called pylons.  Guys to the pylons can be attached at one point, diverging to different places of fastening of the stiffener beam (the carriageway is so correctly called), from the side it looks like a fan.  If there are a lot of cables, the attachment points are spread out at a certain distance, and such a structure is more like a string instrument, a kind of giant harp.  The Kirov bridge, the photo of which is presented in the article, has a fan <span>-type guy system.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The guys themselves are steel ropes in a waterproof sheath, twisted from many steel wires.  In turn, they are enclosed in their own shells.  The design of the cables is such that it is possible to replace individual elements (strands) that have become unusable. </p><p>  The pylons of the Kirov bridge are monolithic, concrete.  They are reinforced with a metal supporting structure in the cable mounting area.  The height of the pylons from the stiffener to the mounting of the cables is a little over 46 meters. </p><h2>  Technical characteristics of the Kirov bridge </h2><p>  The new Kirov bridge in Samara is automobile, cable-stayed, two-pylon.  Its total length is 10 kilometers 880 meters, given all interchanges and ramps.  The bridge has only six spans.  The main span has a length of 571 meters.  The width of the bridge is 60 meters, the highest point is 95 meters from the ground.  The bridge provides for three lanes in both directions.  The width of each of the six stripes is 3 meters 75 centimeters.  The construction of the bridge is capable of passing over 60 thousand units of automotive vehicles per day. </p>

    <h2>  Kirov bridge on the map </h2><p>  The bridge is located in two areas: in the Kirovsky <span>district of Samara</span> and the Volga Samara region.  From the side of the city Kirova Avenue leads to the bridge.  Next - departure to the left-bank part of the Samara River to the village of Chernorechye, settlements Belozerka, Nikolaevka. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is easy to get across the bridge onto the bypass road, onto the federal highway M5 Ural, onto the highway to Chimkent.  The Kirov bridge leads to free suburban roads, so it is possible to get to Novokuybyshevsk faster than through the South Bridge, even though this route is almost three dozen kilometers longer. </p>

    <h2>  The history of the construction of the Kirov bridge </h2><p>  The need for a new bridge across Samarka in the Kirov region is long overdue.  It was needed not only for unloading the city from transport, but also very necessary for summer residents, who had to travel many kilometers to get to the other side.  The project of the Kirov bridge was ready in 2006, construction began in 2007.  The general contractor was Volgaspetsstroy Closed Joint-Stock Company.  The CJSC did not work for long, soon the Samararatransstroy Limited Liability Company became the new contractor.  But this did not help much, the opening of the bridge was postponed many times.  Initially, they planned to hand it over in 2009, then they moved it to 2010, then - to 2012 ... As a result, the symbolic ribbon was cut only on October 10, 2014. </p><p>  The first trucks that took part in the construction of the bridge drove into the bridge.  And on the adjacent streets, motorists patiently waited their turn, by whom the new bridge cut the road to the dachas three times.  Some eyewitnesses said that if earlier they spent more than an hour and a half on the road, now they can get there in twenty-five minutes!  It pleases no less than the picturesque views that open from the bridge to the water meadows and the river Samara itself. </p><h2>  The cost of building the Kirov bridge in Samara </h2><p>  Since the bridge was designed to develop the infrastructure of the left bank of Samarka, not only the overpass itself was built, but also the ramps, interchanges and a dozen kilometers of the road behind the bridge in the Volga region of the Samara region.  The total amount of construction totals 12 billion rubles, 8 of which were transferred from the federal budget. </p><p>  Costs include the fact that bridge builders reduced the stock of sazan and sterlet during construction.  Now, fisheries annually produce several hundred thousand fry.  But, on the other hand, these costs are repeatedly paid off by the presence of valuable fish in the river. </p>
