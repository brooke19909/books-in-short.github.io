    <p>  Now there are five operators in the republic: </p><ol><li>  Win Mobile. </li><li>  "CrimeaTelecom". </li><li>  SevMobile. </li><li>  "Wave Mobile". </li><li>  MTS. </li></ol><p>  Most Crimeans use the services of the MTS operator.  Mobile communications in Crimea was presented only by this operator at the beginning of the transition of the peninsula to the Russian Federation, therefore it was MTS that gathered a huge customer base.  But other operators are not asleep, offering residents and visitors of the city interesting and favorable rates. </p><h2>  MTS </h2><p>  The most popular here is MTS.  In addition, it is the only all-Russian operator.  Because of the sanctions, the peninsula is serviced by a branch of this company, which is located in Krasnodar, however, MTS SIM cards can be bought anywhere - from stops to shopping centers. </p>

    <p>  The cost of one SIM card is 150 rubles, and this price includes 15 minutes for outgoing calls over the network.  At the same time, calls to the Ukrainian MTS number cost 2.5 rubles per minute, and the cost of communicating with a subscriber of another operator (including calls to Ukrainian and landline phones) is more expensive - about 10 rubles per minute.  As for messages, the cost of SMS to the number of the Russian MTS will be 1.5 rubles, and the price of SMS to numbers of other operators is 1.95 rubles.  Note that many users like this operator due to the lack of the need for mandatory replenishment and monthly subscription fees. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  We remind you that when connecting to MTS, it is advisable to immediately turn off the services that are activated by default.  They will be subject to additional charges.  In this, Russian mobile communications in Crimea are no different. </p>

    <h2>  Win mobile </h2><p>  This operator began to serve the inhabitants of the peninsula immediately after the MTS, therefore it is also one of the first.  Naturally, he also managed to collect a good subscriber base.  If at the very beginning mobile communications were available in Crimea in the GSM standard, today the Internet is also available in accordance with the third generation standard (3G). </p><h2>  Operator Rates </h2><p>  Win Mobile is primarily distinguished by the fact that it offers only 3 understandable tariffs: ‚ÄúAt Sea‚Äù, ‚ÄúFast and the Furious‚Äù, ‚ÄúFreedom of Communication‚Äù.  The starter pack at the same time costs only 50 rubles, so it is available to everyone. </p><p>  The name of the tariff speaks about its features.  For example, ‚ÄúFreedom of communication‚Äù is a tariff for communication within the operator‚Äôs network.  Here, the first 60 minutes are given free of charge daily, and then a fee is charged for each subsequent minute in the amount of 0.5 rubles per minute.  Communication with a subscriber of another operator costs 1 ruble per minute of communication.  However, all this is true only for the territory of Crimea, and calls to the mainland are more expensive - 9.5 rubles per minute, and the cost of calls to the CIS is even more expensive - 50 rubles per minute.  So mobile communication in the Crimea is now a little split between the peninsula and the mainland. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  But also Win Mobile offers additional tariffs.  If you often have to call to mainland Russia, then it is appropriate to connect the tariff ‚ÄúMy Russia‚Äù.  Then the cost of a minute on the numbers of Russian operators will cost 2 rubles.  For free communication with Crimean operators there is a tariff ‚ÄúFree calls‚Äù. </p><p>  As for the Internet, here the cost of one megabyte will cost 10 rubles, but you can additionally buy some package, which will save. </p><p>  However, for the Internet there is a separate tariff - "Fast and the Furious."  Here, for 400 rubles a month, the user receives 15 GB of traffic, which he can spend as he wants.  For one minute of conversation within the network you will have to pay 3 rubles, for calls to other operators - 9 rubles and 50 kopecks. </p><p>  The next tariff of Win Mobile operator is ‚ÄúAt Sea‚Äù, where the price of one minute for all numbers in the Russian Federation is 3 rubles.  But the cost of calls to the CIS countries has not changed - 50 rubles per minute. </p>

    <h2>  Krymtelecom </h2><p>  This mobile operator in Crimea operates on the basis of the equipment of the former Kyivstar and Ukrtelecom companies.  It was restored with the help of Chinese electronics manufacturing companies.  Users are offered five tariffs, but only three of them look best: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  "My Crimea". </li><li>  "Contact". </li><li>  Super Contact. </li></ol><p>  At the first tariff, each subscriber receives 30 free minutes of outgoing calls.  No money will be charged for incoming calls.  However, for every sixth minute of an outgoing call, you will have to pay 20 kopecks.  Calls to numbers of other Crimean operators will also cost cheaply - just 1.5 rubles per minute.  However, calls to Russian operators are more expensive - 5 rubles per minute.  Well, there is no subscription fee at all. </p><p>  With SMS, everything is simple: in the Crimea - 1 ruble, in Russia - 2 rubles, to the number of a foreign operator - 5 rubles. </p>

    <p>  With the "Contact" tariff, everything is also simple, because it is focused on communication within the network.  For 150 rubles, the user gets unlimited in the home network for one month.  At the same time, 5 GB of Internet and 100 SMS to numbers of other Crimean operators are available.  But the calls to the numbers of Crimean operators remained unchanged (as in the tariff "My Crimea"). </p><p>  The ‚ÄúSuper Contact‚Äù tariff will cost 2 times more expensive, but all values ‚Äã‚Äãare doubled.  Also, the subscriber gets 12 GB of Internet at unlimited speed.  If this is not enough, then you can additionally connect tariff fees to the Internet, including unlimited. </p><h2>  "Wave Mobile" </h2><p>  Mobile communications in Crimea today is represented by another new operator - "Wave Mobile".  He began to work in 2016.  There are 3 tariffs available for subscribers: "Wind", "Sea", "Sun". </p><p>  The most popular tariff "Sun" offers subscribers the opportunity to call any number of operators in the Crimea and Krasnodar Territory for 60 cents per minute.  But communication with the operator of Russia will cost 5 rubles per minute.  But the communication service with the CIS countries and Europe will cost more - 30 rubles.  in a minute.  But this is not true for all European countries.  For example, calls to Italy or Belgium will cost 50 rubles per minute. </p>

    <p>  "Sea" will cost 150 rubles.  per month.  For this money 300 minutes will be available on any numbers of the Crimea and Krasnodar Territory.  Also, the subscriber will receive 300 SMS to Russian numbers, 3 GB of Internet.  And calls to numbers of Russian operators will cost 3 rubles per minute. </p><p>  The tariff "Wind" is the most expensive - its price is 300 rubles per month.  "Wind" is Internet-oriented: the package includes an Internet package of 10 GB.  As for communication, a call to the number of other operators costs 10 rubles per minute, calls in the Crimea - 3 rubles.  in a minute. </p><p>  As expected, Wave Mobile offers additional options.  For example, you can connect the tariff ‚ÄúZero within the network‚Äù, etc. </p><h2>  SevMobile </h2><p>  SevMobile is the operator of Sevastopol, which has recently begun to operate.  The operator is distinguished by the extremely low price of the starter pack - only 30 rubles.  There are also internet-oriented tariffs, on-net calls and Crimean numbers. </p><h2>  Tariff Features </h2><p>  The first tariff is Radio Nanny.  By connecting it, subscribers receive 300 minutes for 3 favorite numbers, 100 SMS within the network and unlimited Internet at a limited speed (64 Kb / s).  Calls to numbers of other operators cost 1.5 rubles per minute, to city numbers - 1 ruble. </p><p>  The tariff "My choice" involves a fee of 100 rubles per month.  For this money, the operator offers 50 Mb of Internet (per day), 300 minutes in its network, 300 minutes to home or city numbers.  Calls to numbers of Russian operators will cost 6 rubles per minute, to numbers of Crimean operators - 1.5 rubles per minute. </p><p>  Also a popular package is "My City" for 180 rubles per month.  With this tariff you can call any number of SevMobile numbers.  There are also 90 minutes per month for calls to other Crimean numbers, an infinite number of SMS on the network and unlimited 3G Internet, however, at a speed of only 64 Kb / s.  A call to Russian networks will have to pay 3 rubles per minute. </p><p>  There are also tariff plans "My Internet" with the prefixes "5", "15" and "unlimited".  They cost 200, 400 and 900 rubles, respectively.  The subscriber receives 5, 15 GB of traffic or unlimited. </p><h2>  Mobile communication "Life" in the Crimea </h2><p>  After the well-known events, the Life operator existed on the peninsula for some time and worked quite successfully.  However, since December 2015, Astelit (the owner of the Life brand) ceased operations and disconnected communications.  Therefore, today Life mobile communications in the Crimea do not exist.  There are rumors that the structure of the company is not sold, but abandoned.  Perhaps, it was Life that became the last operator to leave the Crimea.  Today, mobile communications in Crimea are represented to a greater extent by branches of large companies.  This is partly why the names mentioned are not familiar to many. </p><p>  Which mobile communication in Crimea is better?  It is impossible to answer this question, because each operator has its pros and cons in tariff plans, coverage area and quality of communication.  But most residents of the peninsula use MTS cards. </p>
