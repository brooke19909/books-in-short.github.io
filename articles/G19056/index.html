It was at that time that the very first banknotes were born.  Subsequently, coins of various denominations of both valuable metals and various alloys began to be minted.  Noteworthy is the fact that they were produced not only for a sufficiently long period (until 1991), but also in various countries. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Place and time of issue of the first Soviet money </h2>

    <p>  So, the first mention of replacing old money with Soviet securities appeared back in 1917.  However, due to various disagreements between the members of the monetary committee, the replacement period dragged on for 2 years. </p><p>  At the same time, one should not forget that Soviet money differed from each other not only in its nominal value, but also in its ornament, as well as in its special clich√©.  On the most expensive of them was an image of the <span>coat of arms of the Provisional Government.</span>  On those of lesser value, an ordinary ornament of geometric shapes was depicted. </p><p>  So, the first Soviet banknotes came into circulation only in 1919 by decision of the Provisional Government and they were issued directly at the mint. </p><p>  An interesting fact is that some historians prefer to keep silent, and ignorant people simply do not know.  So, some <span>paper money of the USSR</span> had an ornament depicting a swastika.  In frequency, this applies to large bills, which later received the special name of credit tickets.  However, this information applies only to banknotes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But the coins appeared a little later, it is very difficult to name the exact date, but most historians say that this happened in 1924. </p><p>  It is also noteworthy that, despite their coinage inside the country, nevertheless, the bulk of such money of the USSR was made abroad, namely in England. </p>

    <h2></h2><h2>  Value of these cash today </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the Soviet Union has long been gone, and therefore there are no banknotes of that time in circulation, they are still in high demand.  Someone simply collects them, and someone earns on sale.  At the same time, the price of Soviet paper money today is much higher than the cost of coins of the same time.  So, for one banknote of 10 rubles, you can get from 500 to 1500 rubles.  For a coin with a face value of 1 ruble - from 100 to 350 rubles. </p><p>  This is explained by the fact that, firstly, initially there were fewer banknotes issued, and secondly, keeping coins for such a long time in good condition is much easier.  In addition, most of these Soviet banknotes had a higher <span>nominal value</span> than its metal counterparts. </p><p>  Very part can be observed at various auctions, a situation where Soviet money, whose nominal price is high, is sold for a low fee and vice versa.  This can happen for various reasons.  At the same time, money issued in limited quantities or those banknotes, the issue of which was dedicated to a significant date, have a higher value. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In any case, in order to profitably sell, buy or simply correctly evaluate Soviet money, you should contact persons competent in this matter or to special numismatist clubs.  After all, the price of Soviet paper money often changes. </p><h2></h2><h2>  The role of the Soviet currency in the modern economy </h2>

    <p>  Since the termination of participation in the economic turnover of money of the USSR, more than two decades have passed.  But even today they have a significant impact on modern banking.  This is explained by the fact that during the collapse of the USSR, all <span>bank deposits</span> were officially frozen.  At present, they are paying compensation. </p><p>  There is currently no single tariff at which such payments would take place.  The official rate is 86: 1.  That is, a contribution of 860 rubles is put on a contribution of 10 rubles to the USSR today. </p><p>  At first glance, such compensation may seem substantial.  But if you take into account how much the cost of food and utilities has increased, it may seem just negligible. </p><p>  But at the same time, the Ministry of Finance is already considering the possibility of reducing such compensation.  The calculation will occur in a ratio of 4: 1.  And this is even less, but there is still no reliable information confirming the approval of this proposal. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Compensation conditions </h2><p>  Despite the fact that almost all people kept Soviet money in banks, far from everyone will be able to receive even miserable compensation. </p>

Moreover, the amount of compensation is also calculated taking into account this factor.  For example, for those born between 1945-1972, compensation is issued in a ratio of 3: 1.  for those who do not fall into this range, the calculation is based on a 2: 1 ratio.

    <p>  But even in spite of such rather strict restrictions, far from everyone will be able to get their due money.  The fact is that a specific period is allotted for the payment of funds to people born in a certain period of time.  If you contact the bank after its expiration, then you can forget about payments at all. </p><p>  Therefore, in order to avoid such an unpleasant situation, it is advisable to contact the bank on this issue in advance. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  Surely many have heard how people who lived in the USSR sigh today about the prices of that time.  And this is not surprising. </p><p>  Firstly, there was an extremely low inflation rate, so small that it was not even noticeable. </p><p>  Secondly, despite the low salaries, people lived fully, because the prices were extremely low.  For example, what can you buy for a ruble today?  The only answer is nothing.  But in the Union it was possible to purchase bread, and milk, and some sweets.  And all this for one ruble. </p><p>  Of course, returning these prices back, however, like Soviet money, is no longer possible.  However, it should be remembered that such prices and such money have occurred in our history. </p>
