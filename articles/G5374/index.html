And from the side of employees, and from the position of customers.  This is the only way to evaluate the integrity of this organization.  After all, with the wrong choice of bank, you can be left without your hard-earned money.  Numerous reviews will help you understand how good RosEuroBank is.  It is impossible to trust them implicitly - there is no documentary evidence of the pros and cons of the organization.  Therefore, making conclusions about good faith, you will have to rely on your intuition. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rosevrobank reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1357014.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  RosEvroBank receives positive reviews for its localization in the country.  It has already been said that this organization is a very large network.  In almost every city in Russia, you can find its branches.  In small cities there are not many.  The bulk is located so far in Moscow and St. Petersburg.  But this does not mean at all that there are no RosEuro branches in a relatively small Kaliningrad. </p><h2>  Ratings </h2><p>  "RosEvroBank" reviews customers and employees of an ambiguous nature.  Some doubt the integrity of this organization.  Especially now when licenses are being taken away from financial institutions in Russia.  Therefore, I want to invest money where they definitely will not disappear.  In the rating of banks, RosEvroBank is not too close to leading positions.  It is located at about 20-30 place.  Therefore, some customers doubt the reliability of the company.  Employees point out that RosEuro will not close for sure in the near future.  But there is no significant evidence of this.  As well as rebuttals. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rosevrobank employee reviews Moscow" class="if" height="294" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1357016.jpg" width="535"></div>

We are dealing with a very large bank.  But he is not at the top of financial institutions that successfully operate in Russia.  If you decide to open an account here, please note that you do this at your own peril and risk.  The only guarantee that RosEvroBank will not be closed in the near future is the scale of the company - this network is quite large.  But customers recommend not holding large amounts at RosEvroBank.  So you can protect yourself from financial losses if suddenly this organization decides to close. </p><h2>  License </h2><p>  Sometimes you can find news that a license was withdrawn from RosEvroBank.  Or that they‚Äôre about to take it away.  These messages scare away customers.  The financial company RosEvroBank did not withdraw licenses.  And as of July 30, 2016, it is a functioning organization.  Therefore, you should not trust opinions indicating that RosEuro is already deprived of the right to conduct its activities.  This is a lie and a hoax.  Are you afraid that the license will still be taken from this company?  Then, as already mentioned, you can not store large amounts of money in this organization.  Deposits with small volumes can be collected without any problems. </p><h2>  Loans </h2><p>  Of course, in order to properly evaluate the work of an organization, you need to see what they think about its services.  For example, about loans.  This is the most popular service that all banks provide now. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rosevrobank employer reviews" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1357018.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  JSCB "RosEvroBank" reviews earns mixed.  The thing is that getting a loan here is not so difficult.  Customers indicate that employees can, in exceptional cases, meet them.  That is, to give out a loan even when other financial institutions refuse it.  This is a very rare occurrence.  And it acts when the loan is vital.  For example, to save a child‚Äôs life.  The paperwork here is exactly the same as in the other banks.  But the answer is usually given faster.  Interest rates in the institution are not too high.  According to customers, they are not higher than other banks. </p><p>  The main interest is what happens after the loan.  The thing is that the delay threatens the debtors with communication with collection companies.  For this, RosEvroBank receives negative reviews.  After all, if you even delayed a small payment, you can wait for threats and annoyance from the collectors.  Often, people who have already closed both debt and credit worry about the bank.  They are constantly phoned with threats in the absence of timely payments.  It is necessary either to communicate with the management of the company or to apply to the court.  Not too common, but it does occur. </p><p>  Some customers say that they did not take loans, but RosEvroBank is still worried about them.  Such cases are extremely rare, but they affect the rating of the organization negatively.  Therefore, many doubt the reliability and integrity of the company.  These are the loans at RosEvroBank that earn reviews.  But interesting moments do not end there. </p><h2>  Mortgage </h2><p>  Mortgage lending in Russia is becoming more and more popular every year.  The company "RosEvroBank" mortgage reviews are far from the best.  Customers point out the numerous shortcomings of this service.  For example, that in the conditions of mortgage lending on the official website false information is indicated.  It relates mainly to documents and terms of service.  You are promised to consider the application within 24 hours.  Like, confirmation of income occurs using an extract from the bank.  But in practice, you have to collect a complete list of documents: 2-NDFL certificates, paper in the form of a bank, and so on.  Also, instead of a day on average, mortgage lending is approved within a few weeks. </p><p>  Plus, RosEvroBank receives negative reviews for the discrepancy in the information provided on the mortgage.  Some managers may indicate one interest rate, others - another.  A rare occurrence, but it is taken into account.  RosEvro tries to pay attention to such customer reviews and fights with dishonest managers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="akb rosevrobank employee reviews" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1357015.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Some do not recommend taking a mortgage in this organization if you want / plan early repayment or partial with a reduction in the term of debt.  And do not take money in currency.  Some are now in huge trouble.  Indeed, before the dollar was worth about 30 rubles, now - 66-67.  The rate is not reduced at RosEvroBank.  Instead, they suggest extending the payment term by a couple of years. </p><p>  But good reviews about this organization and mortgage are also available.  They are not as few as it might seem.  It is indicated that people get approval for a loan quickly, interest rates are not too high.  The main thing is to fulfill all your obligations to the bank.  Then there will be no problems.  What to believe?  If you doubt the integrity of the organization or that you can pay the mortgage without any debts, it is better to refrain from contacting RosEuroBank.  It is almost impossible to agree on a respite.  Perhaps this financial institution is suitable only for responsible people.  They have no problems with it. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  An important role is played by the quality of <span>customer service.</span>  Here, as in most cases, opinions are shared.  Directly in the offices they communicate with you culturally, although not too friendly.  The speed of service is not too fast, but at the conclusion of the contract you will be answered all your questions.  RosEvroBank's clients emphasize that getting a consultation with a personal visit to a bank branch is as simple as getting it. </p><p>  But with telephone communication, everything is somewhat different.  It is difficult to get through to the organization if you managed to do this, not the fact that you will be able to answer questions.  Some operators do not understand what they want from them at all.  You can also sometimes hear rudeness or neglect in your address.  Similar opinions are sometimes found on a variety of otzovik sites.  It is not known whether this is true.  But getting through to RosEvroBank is really quite problematic.  And the management of a financial organization constantly apologizes for the rudeness of employees. </p><p>  The Internet and SMS banking work, but sometimes it is connected to non-functioning cards.  And these systems occasionally fail.  Not critical phenomena, but they push potential customers to distrust. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="acb rosevrobank reviews" class="if" height="311" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1357013.jpg" width="468"></div>

    <h2>  Working conditions </h2><p>  This is not all the important information.  RosEvroBank also earns employee reviews.  But not as a banking company, but as an employer.  What do applicants think about this organization?  The first thing potential employees pay attention to is <span>working conditions.</span>  RosEvroBank offers labor in warm, cozy offices, where there is everything you need for comfort and performance of official duties.  This makes me happy.  You will even have a lunch break. </p><p>  All posted vacancies involve work in departments.  Or you can agree on work at home (rarely, but the employer is ready to meet the subordinates) as some kind of call center operator or accountant.  Also, RosEvroBank receives positive reviews of employees for the work schedule.  Despite the fact that it is stressful, you will work strictly allotted time.  That is, from 9:00 to 18:00.  You don‚Äôt have to stay in the office for 12 hours!  You will only perform the duties specified in the employment contract.  An undoubted plus that RosEvroBank has - the reviews about the employer indicate that the company is not trying to outwit subordinates. </p><h2>  Earnings and social benefits </h2><p>  But not everything is as good as it seems.  Special attention is required to questions of earnings and the provision of a social package.  In these areas, RosEvroBank receives not very good reviews.  You will be attracted by easy and high earnings.  In this case, no serious work - only customer service in the office.  In fact, you will begin to receive a salary.  But instead of the promised 20-25 thousand, you can only earn 12-15.  This difference causes negative emotions among the applicants.  However, many employers do the same.  Therefore, a certain trick in the promises of earnings is not surprising. </p><p>  The social package at RosEvroBank is indeed provided.  And in full.  Problems can arise only with new personnel.  Most likely, they will have to take leave at their own expense, and also sit on sick leave without appropriate payments.  Time-tested employees are valued at RosEvroBank. </p><h2>  Routine or variety? </h2><p>  At today's interview, our employer can lure potential employees with creative and interesting work.  Only the diversity is zero.  And therefore, JSCB "RosEvroBank" does not earn the best reviews from employees.  You will have to perform routine work every day.  This does not suit many.  It is also worth noting that the workload is large.  There are many clients: someone needs help to deal with problems in service, some are waiting for consultations.  Working at RosEvroBank is not easy.  Most employees emphasize that if you do not have willpower and you are not ready to work with a large flow of customers, it is worth giving up employment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rosevrobank customer reviews" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1357019.jpg" width="508"></div>

    <h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear what RosEvroBank‚Äôs <span>employees</span> are receiving <span>.</span>  <span>Moscow,</span> St. Petersburg or any other city - it does not matter where the branch of the organization is located.  The fact remains: this company is far from the most reliable in terms of customer service.  You can trust her, but always be vigilant.  The license from RosEvroBank will not be taken away in the near future.  It is recommended to keep deposits of small sizes here. </p><p>  As an employer, RosEvroBank is not much different from most companies.  Therefore, no one will be able to tell you exactly whether it is worth contacting here for employment.  Salaries are paid regularly, try not to delay.  Although this does not always work out.  It is not a problem to receive a maternity leave package if you have worked at least half a year in an organization.  There is a constant staff turnover due to a busy work schedule.  Despite this, this institution is not the worst place to find a job! </p>
