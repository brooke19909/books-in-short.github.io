Everyone knows the sights of the French capital, and perhaps there are no people in the world who would not like to be in this living fairy tale.  Among them there are incredibly old buildings, which are literally miraculously preserved.  Along with them are masterpieces of <span>architecture of the 19th century</span> and our time.  And now we will go on a virtual tour in which we will take a closer look at the main attractions of Paris (see photo and description below). </p><h2>  Palace complex Versailles </h2><p>  Have you ever seen with your own eyes the residence of the king, which is literally carved from gold and precious stones?  If not, then immediately go on an excursion to Versailles, which is located only 21 kilometers from the city of Paris.  The sights of this place are the magnificent chambers of the palace itself, its park complex, the large and small Trianons, as well as the gardens that surround this whole miracle.  In Versailles, wealth and chic are traced in every detail.  For example, the Great Trianon is a complex of buildings in the classical style, where the close king loved to relax after the hunt.  There are even curtains on the windows woven from gold threads.  And Little Trianon was the resting place of the queen and her maids of honor.  The whole complex is designed in <span>the rococo style.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Paris Attractions" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/661365.jpg" width="600"></div>

Initially, this institution was called the Royal Opera House, and founded it in 1669.  A few years later, he was combined with the dance academy, and the opera house was reincarnated as the Academy of Music and Dance.  Around the same time, the first production took place there - Pomona.  The institution got its present name in 1871, after a series of revolutions and coups.  By 1875, the Grand Opera acquired its final appearance thanks to the architect Charles Granier, who worked on the building for about 10 years.  Today, his creation is one of the most beautiful <span>architectural monuments</span> that adorn Paris.  The sights of the Grand Opera itself are its many halls, balconies, passages, platforms and stairs.  In the red and gold hall is the famous giant ceiling, which was painted by Marc Chagall himself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of paris" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/661369.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Famous louvre museum </h2><p>  Without this museum-legend, perhaps, it is simply unrealistic to imagine Paris.  The sights that lie behind its walls are the numerous originals of artists from different eras.  To look at them, people come from all over the world.  So the Louvre has become the most visited and <span>largest museum in the world.</span>  It is also the only museum with its own McDonald's.  Going deep into the history of the building itself, it is worth noting that earlier it was a treasury of the ruling dynasties, and its size was not as impressive as it is today.  Gradually, the Louvre was overgrown with extensions, and by the 18th century it became a museum.  The famous pyramidal extension above it appeared at the end of the 20th century.  The main property of the Louvre is Mona Lisa.  An inconceivable crowd gathers around the picture, because the time for viewing the most mysterious smile in the world is limited for everyone.  In addition to her, the museum has <span>Venus of Milos,</span> as well as <span>Nika of Samothrace.</span>  In total, the Louvre has about six thousand exhibits. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Paris Attractions Photos" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/661368.jpg" width="600"></div>

One of these is Notre Dame Cathedral, which amazes everyone with its grandeur, size and beauty.  Its construction continued for 200 years, and thus the building absorbed the features of the <span>Romanesque</span> and Gothic <span>styles</span> .  During the revolution, the cathedral wanted to be demolished, but the Parisians managed to protect their pride from the rebels, escaping with only the destruction of statues and stained glass windows.  After these events, Notre Dame de Paris was restored for a long time, and as a result they returned to its original appearance.  Its unique feature is that there are no walls inside the building.  They are replaced by columns, portals, arches and stained-glass windows. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Paris Attractions Photos and Description" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/661364.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The Eiffel Tower </h2><p>  Today, the sights of Paris are simply inconceivable to imagine without this tallest building in the city.  The tower appeared here a hundred and twenty years ago, and at that time, alas, was not so loved by the townspeople and visitors.  Victor Hugo himself, as well as many other people of art, considered her ugliness and longed to demolish it.  Morris William, for example, always dined at one of the tower restaurants, saying that only from here this building is not visible.  Over the years, everyone loved the Eiffel Tower, especially tourists.  It serves as a symbol of the city, is the most visited observation deck in France.  The tower is painted today in a patented <span>bronze color,</span> which is most often called "eiffel". </p><h2>  What does Paris live and breathe? </h2><p>  Sights, photos of architectural monuments on postcards, baubles in the style of Provence and much more - this is why tourists come to the capital of France.  But you can feel the serene spirit of the city, its love and lightness in one of the local cafes.  Do not look for something exquisite, but just sit down in one of the summer courtyards of the city, order yourself a coffee with a croissant and listen to the voices that surround you. </p>
