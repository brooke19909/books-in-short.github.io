Every year, there are millions of tourists and pilgrims who want to see the main shrines, touch the sights that have become part of history.  It is difficult to list absolutely all corners of interest to visit, because there are so many of them.  Each path, every pebble here has its own history, its own legend, keeps the secrets of centuries ago.  The sights of Jerusalem amaze visitors with its uniqueness, holiness.  When you touch the walls of the temples it begins to seem that you are transported many centuries ago.  Before my eyes are events that have sunk into oblivion. </p>

Attractions here can be divided into Christian, Jewish and Muslim.  For Christians and Jews, one of the most significant places is the <span>Wailing Wall,</span> where people leave notes with desires.  The shrine is located near the place where the first and second <span>Jerusalem Temples</span> were erected <span>,</span> but it is not their ruins.  These are just the remains of the supporting structures of King Herod, but this does not detract from the significance of the wall.

First of all, it‚Äôs worth going to the Dome of the Rock mosque, known for its huge golden dome, whose diameter is 20 m. The construction is only an architectural monument; ministries are not held in it.  This is a reminder to all believers that it was here that the Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven.  It is also worth going to the Al-Aqsa Mosque, which is in third place in importance after the mosques in Mecca and Medina.  Here you can learn more about the night journey of the prophet on the path to ascension. </p>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Jerusalem sights" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10530/213072.jpg" width="500"></div>  The city is divided into Old and <span>New Jerusalem.</span>  Attractions are mainly concentrated in the old part.  It is there, in the Armenian quarter, that the Cathedral of St. James is located, built on the ruins of the Byzantine church in the 12th century.  The church was erected in honor of one of the 12 apostles - James, one of Christ's closest disciples.  It is also worth visiting the Way of Sorrow, or the Way of the Cross, which Jesus walked on, climbing with his cross to Calvary.  There are 14 stops, each of which is associated with a specific event that happened on the day of execution.  No one can guarantee that this is the same route that Christ was following, a believer just needs to feel and experience what he experienced.

One of the great shrines is the <span>Church of the Holy Sepulcher,</span> built on the site of the execution of Jesus Christ, where he was buried and where he was resurrected.  The first church was built by Elena - the mother of <span>Emperor Constantine the</span> Great.  It was she who went down to the dungeon and found the entrance to the cave with the Holy Sepulcher.  The quarries of King Solomon and the monastery of St. Mary Magdalene are also Jerusalem sights worth visiting.  Tsidkiyagu Cave is located near the Shekhe Gate, where Solomon mined white limestone, which was used to build the city.  If you want to plunge into a calm and pacifying atmosphere, you should visit the monastery of Mary Magdalena, built in the Russian style, on the Mount of Olives.
