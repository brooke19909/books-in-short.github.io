    <h2>  General Translation Information </h2><p>  Before you talk about how to send money from Iota to MTS, you should give a general description of the service that allows you to transfer funds from the balance.  As for MTS, the Direct Transfer service is one of the popular and frequently used options due to the fact that the operator offers a large list of payment directions - utilities, wired Internet, etc. - and several interfaces for making payments: for transfers within networks (it is convenient to use a USSD service between MTS subscribers), for the payment of other services - a web interface.  Replenishing Iota with MTS is no more difficult than transferring between accounts of one operator.  We will tell about how to do this later.  As for the Yota translation service, everything is not so transparent: after all, this organization appeared relatively recently and some services are still not fully explored by customers.  For any questions regarding communication services, you can contact the operator‚Äôs hotline or through the online consultation form available on the company's official portal. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  How to transfer money from MTS to Iota? </h2><p>  Before proceeding with the transfer of money between the accounts of these operators, you should make sure that the specialized service ‚ÄúEasy payment‚Äù is activated on the SIM card.  This MTS service allows you to transfer money to accounts of third parties.  To check her condition, you need to go to your personal account and clarify her status.  If it is disabled, you can connect it here, in your account.  If there are difficulties with activating the service, it is recommended to call the contact center (0890) or contact the office.  If previously the subscriber did not have to use the online number management tool, then it will first be necessary to register by indicating your phone number in the appropriate form on the website.  Next, you need to go to the section with payment and in the list of companies choose ‚ÄúIota‚Äù (LLC ‚ÄúSkartel‚Äù).  There are two options for transferring money: from a MTS mobile phone account or through a bank card.  Please note that all information about the terms of use of the service is given on the operator‚Äôs website. </p>

    <h2>  Bank Card Transfer Terms </h2><p>  Before transferring money from MTS to Iota using a bank card, you also need to familiarize yourself with the terms of the operation.  As in the first case, the information is posted on the payment start page. </p><ul><li>  The amount of commission for each operation is ten rubles. </li><li>  In one day, you can carry out transactions for transfer no more than five times (even if they are made in favor of various accounts of Iota). </li><li>  The maximum allowable amount that is available to the user in one transaction is three thousand rubles. </li></ul><h2>  Transfer of funds from the Yota account to the MTS number </h2><p>  The company "Iota" has also developed a payment service for making payments in various directions.  ‚ÄúIota.Money‚Äù is a service that any Internet user can use, and it is not necessary that he be a subscriber of this operator (‚ÄúIota‚Äù phone or other equipment is also not necessary to use a payment service).  Access to it is carried out through the official resource of the operator, which is not difficult to find through the search engine.  It is enough to register here, having created your personal account, deposit money into the account and you can perform transfer operations.  The list of possible payees is also located on the official website of the company, it contains a fairly large number of organizations.  You can also withdraw money to a bank card.  However, this will have to work hard, because there is no ‚Äúdirect‚Äù way to transfer funds.  First, you need to transfer a certain amount to an electronic wallet (the list will be available on the transfer form), and only after that through this wallet can the funds be transferred to a bank card. </p>

    <h2>  Withdraw funds from the account </h2><p>  The money placed on the account ‚ÄúIota‚Äù, the subscriber can withdraw.  Moreover, only the person for whom the SIM card is registered (an account is issued) has such a right.  He will have to select an office on the operator‚Äôs website, which will be more convenient for him to visit.  You can get money from the account only by writing a statement in one of the company‚Äôs branches.  The return is not carried out immediately, the maximum withdrawal procedure may take one month.  It is also worth considering that cash will not be able to get money, they will be transferred to a bank card account.  In this regard, the card details (card number, expiration date, BIC recipient, correspondent account, etc.) should be taken to the operator‚Äôs office along with the passport. </p><h2>  Which operator is better - MTS or Iota? </h2><p>  Since there are a lot of mobile operators, the subscribers have a difficult choice which company to choose.  Which is better - ‚ÄúIota‚Äù or MTS?  Many people have to deal with this question: successfully proven for many years of being on the MTS market or the promising and actively developing operator ‚ÄúIota‚Äù.  It is definitely impossible to say which of them should be preferred: each of these organizations has a mass of fans who are satisfied with the terms of service.  Each of these companies provides high-quality services, a number of additional options, services, and services, as well as produces its own equipment - an Iota phone, modem, etc. (MTS can offer similar products).  The question of which SIM card of which service provider to use should be decided by the client, independently. </p>
