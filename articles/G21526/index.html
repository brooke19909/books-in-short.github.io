    <p>  Stalin's real name is Dzhugashvili Joseph Vissarionovich.  He was born on December 9 (21 in a new style) on December 1879 in the Georgian city of Gori. </p><p>  For most of the natives of the <span>Soviet Union, the</span> years of Stalin's rule and his personality are associated with the process of industrialization, victory in the Great Patriotic War, as well as with the terrifying scale of repression, the number of victims of which elevates him to the rank of the most cruel and merciless ruler of his country.  More than three million people were executed or sentenced to imprisonment on political charges.  Numerous cases of deportation, dispossession, deportations bring the number of victims of the Stalinist regime to the figure of twenty million people. </p><p>  In today's times, most psychologists unanimously declare a significant impact on the <span>formation of the character</span> and personality in general of children's education and the family environment.  So what caused such a <span>tough character of</span> Stalin? </p><p>  According to historians, the leader‚Äôs childhood was not joyful and cloudless.  Frequent clarification of the relationship of the parents, accompanied by beatings of the mother by the non-drying father, could not pass without a trace and not affect the growing boy.  To suppress a sense of helplessness in front of a strong male fist, the mother was looking for an emotional way out on the future leader, therefore, what beatings and ill-treatment were, Stalin learned in childhood.  Since then, he realized for himself the principle of life - the one who is stronger is right.  This is the course he followed throughout his life. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Stalin takes his first political steps in 1902, organizing a demonstration in Batumi.  Over time, he becomes the leader of the Bolsheviks, makes acquaintance with Lenin and is considered an ardent supporter of his revolutionary ideas.  In 1913, Joseph Dzhugashvili signed for the first time with his new pseudonym, which was assigned to him until the very end of his life.  So Stalin‚Äôs rule is already taking place under a world-famous surname.  And it was preceded by about thirty others, which did not take root. </p><p>  The years of Stalin's rule as sovereign leader of the state begin in 1929 and are accompanied by a period of collectivization, which resulted in famine and numerous deaths.  In 1932, a law was passed, popularly called the ‚ÄúThree Spikelets‚Äù.  In accordance with his standards, if a collective farmer who was dying of hunger stole the wheat spikelets he had grown from the state, he was to be shot.  The saved bread was exported, thus paving the way for industrialization.  With the proceeds, the latest equipment was purchased, produced by various countries not only in Europe but also in America. </p><p>  The years of Stalin's rule are also characterized by numerous repressions that began in 1936, when <span>N.I.</span> was appointed to the post of People's Commissar of Internal Affairs <span>.</span>  <span>Yezhov.</span>  In 1938, Stalin's closest friend, Bukharin, was shot.  This period is characterized by mass executions and exile in the Gulag camps. </p><p>  No matter how cruel the ruler, such a policy is carried out for the good of the state, for its further development.  What are the positive events that have occurred with the country during the years of Stalin's rule? </p><p>  In the period of his power formed the social system of the state, with its economic, political and social institutions;  carried out the modernization of the country, abandoning the NEP policy, and at the expense of the village carried out industrialization;  strategic decisions ensured victory in World War II;  turned the Soviet Union into a superpower.  The USSR has become one of the world powers, a permanent member of the UN Security Council. </p><p>  In 1953, Stalin died.  The end of the era of the reign of Joseph Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili, which was replaced by the changed course of <span>foreign economic policy of</span> N. Khrushchev, came. </p>
