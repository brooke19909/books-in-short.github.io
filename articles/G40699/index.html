    <p>  Golovinsky garden is actually a huge historical architectural and landscape-park massif. </p><p>  It should be noted that it is also considered the first stationary and one of the oldest parks in Russia, which is one of the most famous in Europe.  For example, now not many people know that it was he who once became the prototype for most <span>parks in St. Petersburg.</span> </p><p>  Initially, the palace of Field Marshal F. Golovin, the head of the Foreign Ministry, was built here, which, among other things, was also an associate of the great reformer Peter I. </p><p>  The Golovinsky Palace was built in 1703, and this, no doubt, an important lesson, such as designing and managing work, was entrusted to the then-famous architect D. Ivanov.  The latter built the building on the model of the Versailles ensemble. </p><p>  The park itself got its name in honor of <span>F. Lefort, a</span> famous teacher and friend of Peter I, in the very first years of his reign.  They wanted to hold festivities and arrange receptions in the palace, and around it was a garden, which was personally laid by the emperor. </p><p>  Later, during the reign of Empress Anna Ivanovna (beginning in 1730), the park was called the "Versailles on the Yauz". </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It was then that the architect Francesco Rastrelli designed the Annoieff palace and park ensemble in the Baroque style. </p><p>  It should be noted that Lefortovo Park was considered the largest in Moscow in the XVII century. </p><h2>  What did you manage to save? </h2>

    <p>  By the way, Golovinsky Garden is far from the only name for this territory; in Soviet times it was called the Park of the Moscow Military District.  Already at that time questions like: ‚ÄúAnd where is Lefortovo Park?  How to get to this place? ‚Äù  - did not cause difficulties.  Why?  The thing is that many knew about him, and there was no end to the visitors here. </p><p>  Overgrown ponds, the remains of red brick terraces, a dam bridge that separates the ponds and serves as the basis for the main walkway of Lefortovo Park, lined with linden trees, and once delightful, and now, unfortunately, the collapsing grotto of Rastrelli, have survived here. </p><p>  Not far from the lower pond there is a semicircular arbor, erected in memory of Peter I and recently restored. </p><p>  Many say that a park with such an interesting and impressive history is now in great need of reconstruction and arrangement. </p><h2>  Metropolitan Gondolas </h2>

    <p>  Lefortovo Park (Moscow) is truly unique.  Once on its territory, a special hydraulic system was built, through which Peter I hoped to get from St. Petersburg to Moscow. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Today, specialists are actively working here, more than 50 archaeological work has been carried out, the bottom of the reservoirs has been examined and about 200 m of the Annihuf Canal line have been covered.  The discovery of <span>coastal fortifications</span> built at that far time, embankments on the surface, foundations of arbors, bridges, marinas on the Big Pond and the fountain in front of the Grotto became a real discovery. </p><p>  Another interesting attraction of the park is the half-gondola.  This ancient building with a bust of Peter I was built in 1805 in honor of the place of "rest" of the emperor.  During a severe hurricane that swept in June 1904, unfortunately, it was completely destroyed, but it was possible to restore it, returning to its previous appearance. </p><h2>  What is a park today? </h2>

    <p>  During the restoration of the monument-gazebo in Lefortovo Park, it was rebuilt and made a complete copy of the construction of the XVIII century.  On a high base at the semicircular pavilion with eight highest columns of gray stone, a granite obelisk is installed. </p><p>  On it, the words of Peter the Great were carved that he hoped to get by water from Petersburg to Moscow, said in November 1724, when the construction of a hydro-channel for connecting the two capitals had just begun.  It is perhaps hard to imagine that such a Lefortovo Park station could actually exist.  ‚ÄúHow to get to St. Petersburg?‚Äù  - guests of the city would ask, and Muscovites would recommend them such a picturesque path along the river ... It did not work out. </p><p>  This corner, according to the Dutch style, was created with many dams, ponds, islets, canals and cascades.  Despite the fact that it had to be rebuilt several times, still managed to maintain the original layout. </p><p>  The main compositional axis of the Lefortovo Park runs parallel to the river.  Yauze.  Until our time, three terraces of the 18th century, erected from red brick, a system of canals and flowing ponds that feed from the river survived.  Titmouse, dam bridge connecting the ponds, balustrade and dilapidated picturesque grotto of K. B. Rastrelli. </p><p>  A separate attraction of the park are the Lefortovo Ponds, which are located in the upper and middle reaches of the river.  Titmouse.  Each carries its own name.  Fish are found in them, usually a couple (or even more than one) of white swans and several flocks of ducks swim.  Until today, the unusual dam Venus has been preserved, separating two beautiful ponds. </p><h2>  How to get to the park </h2>

    <p>  Under the supervision of the chief archaeologist of Moscow A.

Thanks to the excavations, the historical basis for the restoration of the territory was provided. </p><p>  Truly unique and unique Lefortovo Park.  The official site willingly shares information that so far more than 50 excavations have been carried out along the entire hydraulic system of the park, the bottom of the reservoirs of the garden and park ensemble of the imperial times of Peter the Great, Anna Ioannovna and Catherine has been examined, about 200 m of the Annengofsky Canal line have been covered, reinforcement has been found coasts, ancient embankments, the foundations of the once popular marinas on the Big Pond, colorful bridges, expertly executed arbors and a fountain in front of the Grotto. </p><h2>  Great place to stay </h2><p>  Few people doubt that Lefortovo Park is actually a great place for walking and distraction from the bustle of the city.  Muscovites, guests of the capital, mothers with prams, young couples in love and pensioners have a rest in it. </p><p>  Historical excursions for the guests of the palace and park ensemble, theatrical performances are systematically arranged here, and on big holidays the brass band plays a variety of military music. </p><p>  Since 1934, there has been a stadium in the park that hosts visitors to this day.  Here it is a must-visit for all sports fans. </p><h2>  The foggy future of the park </h2>

    <p>  Today, the question of the future fate of this palace and park ensemble is very acute.  Why?  The thing is that such a historically valuable architectural object is in very poor condition: it is half built up, partially abandoned, and the original ensemble is completely divided into parts. </p><p>  From the very beginning, both the park and the palace were one.  Now only the green territory can be considered part of the city, and the palace and other ancient buildings are the property of federal authorities and transferred to the military. </p><p>  To save Lefortovo, a cultural-historical, formerly magnificent ensemble, in the beginning  XXI century  Under the territory of the park, a huge city tunnel with a length of up to 3.2 km was built.  It became the fifth longest tunnel in Europe. </p><p>  Hope for a better future for the park is also encouraged by the fact that in 2005, by an order of the Moscow government, it was included in the Moscow State Museum of Public Relations (Moscow State United Museum-Reserve).  And this means that, most likely, the object will still not be allowed to destroy. </p><h2>  Visitors reviews </h2>

    <p>  As they say, how many people, so many opinions.  For example, young people claim that there are very few holidays held in the park, and in addition to a couple of stalls, there are no shops with souvenirs, no restaurants, no cafes where you could eat or buy something for memory. </p><p>  It's a shame, but many people even associate Lefortovo Park with wasteland.  For example, athletes who are engaged in physical training at the stadium report that the building nearby has been empty for about three years. </p><p>  But there are those who are proud of Lefortovo Park.  Among them, as a rule, people who prefer loneliness and calm unhurried walks.  It is actually not crowded, and there is an opportunity to have a good rest from the city rush in the shade of large trees, admiring the quiet backwaters and picturesque ponds. </p>
