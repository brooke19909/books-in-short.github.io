Consider the interest rates on deposits, is there a possibility of replenishment or withdrawal of some part of the funds, as well as how to increase income by issuing an investment product along with the deposit.  Great variability of deposits allows each client to choose the optimal conditions that suit his request. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.m.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bank FC Opening" class="if uuid-2892217" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92610/2892217.jpg"></div><h2>  Contribution “Open” </h2><p>  Otkritie Bank deposit called “Open” has the highest percentage of profitability among the entire range of bank deposits.  The interest rate can reach 9.2% per annum.  Replenishment and partial withdrawal of the amount is not possible.  Interest is paid either every month or at the very end of the term. </p><p>  Let us give an example of calculating this deposit of Otkritie Bank.  The client wishes to deposit 100 thousand rubles for twenty-four months.  The interest rate will be set at 5.7% per annum.  The income on the deposit will amount to 11,400 rubles. </p><p>  When making an investment product, the client can count on an increased interest rate. </p><h2>  Premium deposit </h2><p>  The maximum interest rate on the deposit of Otkritie Bank is 6.9% per annum.  Replenishment and partial withdrawal of funds is not provided.  Interest is paid exclusively at the end of the deposit term. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="eadaily.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bank opening" class="if uuid-2892216" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92610/2892216.jpg"></div><h2>  “Main income” deposit </h2><p>  An interest rate of up to 6.8% per annum is provided for a deposit of Otkritie Bank under the name “Basic Income”.  It is not possible to replenish the deposit, and partial withdrawal of funds is also not provided.  Interest is paid monthly.  Monthly interest capitalization or monthly payment in a manner convenient for the client: to the current account, to the “on demand” account, to a debit card.  It is also worth noting that Otkritie FC Bank deposit can be opened in favor of a third party. </p><p>  Consider interest rates depending on the availability of capitalization, the amount of the deposit and its duration.  For example, a client is going to open a deposit in the amount of 750 thousand rubles for a period of 367 days, in this case the interest rate without capitalization will be 6.5% per annum and with a capitalization of 6.7% per annum.  The second case: the client plans to open a deposit of $ 3,000 for a period of 181 days, the interest rate in this case will be at the level of 0.6% per annum. </p><h2>  Deposit "My piggy bank" </h2><p>  The deposit of Otkritie Bank under the name “My Piggy Bank” is the only product in this line in which replenishment and partial withdrawal of funds from the account is allowed.  Interest is paid monthly.  The maximum interest rate on a deposit can reach 5% per annum. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.vsluh.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Deposits at the Bank Opening" class="if uuid-2892218" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92610/2892218.jpg"></div><p>  The minimum amount for opening a deposit is 10 thousand rubles.  The invoice term is unlimited.  A deposit can be opened both in rubles and in dollars or euros.  My Piggy Bank account is insured by the state deposit insurance system. </p><p>  If the amount on the account is less than 10 thousand rubles, the interest rate will be 0.10% per annum, while the amount over 10 thousand rubles, the interest rate will be set at 5% per annum.  When opening an account in dollars, the interest rate will be set at 0.10% per annum.  When opening an account in euros, the interest rate will be set at 0.01% per annum. </p><p>  My Piggy Bank deposit can be opened in the personal account of the Internet bank, through the mobile application or in any branch of Otkritie Bank.  It is worth noting that opening an account for the Bank’s deposit “Opening” under the name “My piggy bank” in favor of a third party is available only when applying at the bank branch. </p><h2>  Contribution "Free Management" </h2><p>  A deposit that gives the client the possibility of replenishment and partial withdrawal of funds.
