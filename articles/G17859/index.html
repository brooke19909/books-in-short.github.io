    <p>  <span>Hotel Resort</span> De Tio Carmino 2 * is a popular tourist accommodation option in Goa, the smallest of the 28 Indian states. </p><h2>  About the resort </h2><p>  In fact, Goa is a narrow strip of land that separates the sea and mountains.  The nature of the foothills delights many with its wealth: lakes, waterfalls, islands, thickets of mangoes, palm groves with a huge number of wonderful exotic animals.  Together with the presence of beautiful beaches, this has turned the rest here into a golden dream of tourists from different countries. </p><p>  India is a very vast, diverse and unforgettably beautiful country.  Its calm and temperate climate is ensured by the presence of high mountains, and thanks to the rich pine forests and orchards, the air here is clean and fresh. </p><p>  Geographically, the state of Goa is divided into North and South.  Resort De Tio Carmino 2 * is located in the northern part, which is distinguished by a large population and a small number of hotels, mainly 2-3 stars.  Due to the grayish sand covering the local beaches, the sea water off the coast is by no means transparent, therefore trips to North Goa are not expensive.  Mostly budget vacationers, foreign students, and poor Indians come here.  It is for this category of tourists that Resort De Tio Carmino 2 * was built. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In the South, beaches are covered with golden sand, expensive hotels with 4 and 5 stars are built here, surrounded by green gardens.  In such places it is no longer possible to meet a cow standing in the water surrounded by bathing vacationers, as in the resorts of North Goa.  Holidays in the South are relatively expensive, especially by Indian standards. </p><h2>  Resort De Tio Carmino 2 * (India, Calangute): Acquaintance </h2><p>  The northern part of Goa is the exact opposite of the southern.  Rest here is inexpensive (comparatively), democratic and quite noisy.  The numerous villages of North Goa mainly host young American and European tourists, who have spread the fame of this resort around the world. </p><p>  The small comfortable hotel Resort De Tio Carmino 2 * is located in Calangute.  According to the advertisement, the local staff offers vacationers a decent level of service.  The tour desk can arrange exciting excursions.  In addition, the Resort De Tio Carmino 2 * systematically organizes entertainment evenings, plays music (live), provides dry cleaning and laundry services, a currency exchange office and a doctor. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Resort De Tio Carmino 2 *, the photo of which represents the general view of the hotel, as well as the interior decoration in the rooms, is located in the central part of Calangute, a 10-minute walk from Calangute Beach (400 m) and an hour's drive from the airport.  Near the hotel there are famous attractions: forts of Chapora and Aguada.  Nearby there are many shops with noisy and rather annoying sellers, as well as restaurants where you can eat.  In 48 km from Resort De Tio Carmino 2 * is <span>Dabolim (airport).</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  <span>Diet: BB</span> (breakfast).  Food format: buffet.  Cuisine: international, local.  The contingent of vacationers in Resort De Tio Carmino 2 * is made up of adults, youth, parents with children. </p><h2>  Why do tourists choose this hotel? </h2><ul><li>  Reasonable prices. </li><li>  Manage your online reservation. </li><li>  The staff speaks 2 languages. </li><li>  Security. </li></ul><h2>  Nearby Attractions </h2><ul><li>  Football Ground is 2.4 km from the property. </li><li>  To St.  Alex Church - 0.6 km. </li><li>  Tito's Club1 is 8 km away. </li><li>  Casino Palms is 2.3 km away. </li><li>  Shanta Durga Temple is 5.7 km away. </li><li>  Infantaria is 0.4 km away. </li></ul><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Travelers who have left Resort De Tio Carmino 2 * reviews report that they made a choice in favor of the hotel mainly because of its price and convenient location (not in the center). </p><p>  Resort De Tio Carmino 2 * tourists call a very nice hotel, but for those who are used to Egypt and Turkey, a lot of things here will seem strange.  According to reviews, the hotel will be convenient for those who do not expect something special here.  The authors of the reviews report that it is rather far to go to supermarkets, and the road to them, according to them, is terrible: noisy, dusty, narrow, without sidewalk, with endless traffic.  Nearby is a track with an endless stream of scooters, but still the movement here is less than in the center.  On the street you can meet local residents, tourists, merchants, as well as cows and dogs.  But the hotel itself is quiet, since the buildings are located deep in the territory. </p><p>  Describing the hotel, guests mention the noticeable dilapidation of the rooms, as well as equipping them with old furniture and uncomplicated plumbing.  Many relate to the shortcomings of the hotel indulgently: anyway, the hotel only has to spend the night.  Those who only sleep at night in the hotel like everything here.  Some reviewers believe that the hotel does not meet its rating, even for India it is simply "terrible" here.  Such tourists, as a rule, are not advised to relax here, especially with children. </p>

    <p>  According to hotel guests, its territory is quite well-groomed, clean, beautiful, there are many flower beds, flowering plants.  Both buildings overlook the pool, near which there are sun loungers "aged".  The pool is surprisingly cleaned every night.  The hotel is full of homeless cats and small kittens, many tourists feed them.  However, there is no place to sit in the fresh air, vacationers regret.  At the reception, guests also have nothing to do (in a small room, usually all staff watch American football on TV). </p><p>  Many reviewers perceive their stay at the hotel positively.  Rooms, according to vacationers, are cleaned every day.  Trash is taken out regularly; there is always toilet paper in the bathroom.  According to the guests, usually a room is a standard room: 2 beds, wardrobe, 2 armchairs, bedside tables, coffee table, <span>dressing table with mirror,</span> TV (not available in all rooms).  There is also a kitchen, but from the working equipment there may be a refrigerator, and sometimes guests have to defrost on their own. </p><p>  Many note the availability of friendly staff at Resort De Tio Carmino 2 *, who is ready to instantly fulfill any request.  On all issues, you can agree with the hotel staff, there are no problems with mutual understanding, as the reviews indicate. </p><p>  Tourists report that it‚Äôs easy to agree with taxi drivers.  The main thing is to bargain.  Taxi drivers are ready to wait while guests are walking, and payment is made upon return. </p><h2>  Recommendations </h2><ul><li>  Guests of Resort De Tio Carmino 2 * reviewers recommend taking a padlock on the door with them, because there is a suspicion that thieves climb into the rooms with windows overlooking the city and the door closes only a quarter of a turn. </li><li>  You should also take a standard set with you: a knife (two preferably), a set of dishes (disposable), spirals and an aerosol from mosquitoes and ants, a stew, a kettle or a boiler, instant cereals (they can be diluted with boiled water or fresh hot milk, which is served in teapots for breakfast). </li><li>  It is also recommended that you take bags of garbage with you and take it out yourself, without waiting for the hotel staff to pick it up - guests may not wait for this, especially if they use their own lock. </li><li>  Free use of the Internet, authors of reviews warn, it is possible only at the reception. </li></ul>

    <ul><li>  Tourists recommend that those who are going on vacation in Calangute take free, exclusively cotton clothes with them.  It is necessary not to forget drugs for stomach and intestinal diseases, as well as disinfectants.  Drinking and brushing your teeth is recommended exclusively with bottled purchased water, it is better to use it for cooking. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Vacationers are happy to note the many advantages of the hotel: convenient location, friendly staff, affordable price, a large number of greenery and flowers on site.  As cons are usually called a low level of service, poor equipment, lack of repair, noisy patio, poor breakfasts.  But if you do not spend whole days at the hotel, but sunbathe on the beach, visit the sights, go on excursions, then everything is wonderful, the guests share.
