    <h2>  Mythical past </h2><p>  Ancient legends of Greek philosophers claim that it is Cape Meganom (Crimea) that is the entrance to Hades - the mysteriously frightening kingdom of the dead.  In addition, there was a meeting of the one-eyed Cyclops with Odysseus, who, passing through the underground caves, viewed at the time of high tides, entered the kingdom of Hades.  Many locals are afraid to come here, scaring each other with tales of a ‚ÄúMeganom boy‚Äù that carries a traveler to the depths of the sea, or about a bleating lamb located on the very edge of a cliff.  An ancient legend says that the skin of this lamb, caught and sacrificed, has miraculous power: if you sit on it on Meganom, the physical body gains weightlessness, receiving grace from above. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cape Meganom. Crimea" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20418/485949.jpg" width="580"></div>  However, according to the locals, a person who has visited such a ‚Äúvision‚Äù will either die soon or become a skilled healer after a long spiritualizing penance.

Cape quite often becomes a place where you can watch UFOs.  In addition, yellowish rings of unknown origin with a width of about 50 cm regularly appear on the surface of Meganom. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Meganom (cape)" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20418/486009.jpg" width="600"></div>  From a bird's eye view or from an airplane, these rings are visible very well.  Of particular interest is one modern observation: if circles suddenly lose their color intensity, then the people and animals inside them also suddenly feel noticeable malaise and anxiety.

    <h2>  Beach Story on Meganom </h2><p>  However, not mysterious phenomena and not ancient Roman legends, but beautiful landscapes and favorable ecological conditions attract travelers and vacationers on Meganom.  The cape is located so that, sharply wedging into the Black <span>Sea, it</span> divides the bay in half.  And this allows you to vary: even in rough seas, on one side of the cape, on the other, in most cases there will be calm and clear water.  The crystal clear sea and free, not crowded with vacationers beaches - that is what quite naturally attracts regular guests and local residents. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beach Meganom" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20418/486019.jpg" width="350"></div>  Meganoma beaches bring a pleasant variety to your vacation in Sudak, forcing you not only to get banal sun baths, but also to breathe in an amazing combination of steppe grass aromas with the bitter taste of a sea breeze.

In continuation of the amazing miracles occurring here, it should be noted that many travelers in this place have the opportunity to refuse (at least for a while) from the inhaler, breathing a healing fragrance.

The well-preserved remains of the Taurian settlements were found in Rybachy (Kils-Burun), the rock mass closest to Sudak.  The highest and most prominent cape in the sea is Choban-Basti.

    <h2>  Road to the sea </h2><p>  Amazingly beautiful bays were loved by diving fans, more and more often attracting them to Megan Cape.  How to get to the desired places of rest, experienced vacationers know firsthand.  By car, you can go along the highway R-29, connecting Sudak with Feodosia and crossing Koktebel.  About the middle of the road between Sudak and Feodosia is Cape Megan.  The map reliably displays this distance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cape Meganom. Map" class="if" height="325" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20418/485996.jpg" width="467"></div>  In addition, from Sudak you can go to him along the Eastern highway in the direction of the Solar Valley.  You can get onto this highway in Sudak along Kommunalnaya Street, which is located in the eastern part of the city.  Having reached the outskirts, on the "ring" you should turn right and, upon reaching the military camp, you must again turn right.  Further, the lighthouse will be the brightest reference point, leading almost directly to Cape Megan.  How to get to this place by public transport?  The easiest way to check this information with local residents.  In general, regular buses to the ‚ÄúMeganom‚Äù stop from the bus station in Sudak in the direction of the Solar Valley move hourly.  5-km distance from the stop to the cape experienced travelers are happy to overcome on foot, admiring the views of the surrounding landscapes.

Its life-giving breath makes it easier to stay in a semi-desert climate among weathered cliffs, slopes and steep banks, devoid of lush vegetation.

    <h2>  Cape Meganom (Crimea) and wind energy </h2><p>  Residents of neighboring villages and cities, and after them many tourists and visitors to Meganom affectionately call it ‚Äúlocal Tunisia‚Äù.  Organizing holidays in Sudak, avid travelers are sure to plan a visit to this mysterious peninsula. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cape Meganom (photo)" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20418/486021.jpg" width="329"></div>  At the same time, in addition to a wondrously secluded beach holiday, there are tourists waiting for placers of windmills scattered on the surface of the cape.  Unfortunately, wind energy, quite significant in these places, is currently used only 25 percent of the potential power.  The wind farm, serviced by just 4 employees, currently makes a rather depressing impression, although the huge wind resources are the real treasures of Cape Megan.  The cape has long been known for severe storms, battered many ships.  And this means that the proper use of such wealth promises business people a promising business.

    <h2>  Sea beauties and rarities </h2><p>  Really exciting boat trips by sea with the possibility of diving into the amazing depths of the Engraving bays have recently attracted an increasing number of diving enthusiasts at Cape Meganom.  Reviews of the stunning beauty of the seabed, consisting of rock fragments and huge blocks of stone, are fascinating. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest in the Pike perch" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20418/486041.jpg" width="500"></div>  Many fans of historical rarities are interested in the cemetery of anchors.  Their diversity can not be compared with any museum collection.  One of the anchors is striking in its size, weighing at least two tons by the most rough estimates.  It causes a lot of hypotheses about its origin and use.  But the mystery of this anchor still remains unsolved for humanity.

    <h2>  Extreme in the elevator tower </h2><p>  A special type of entertainment for fans of underwater extreme sports is the elevator shaft (or tower), which is hidden in Cape Meganom in its marine surroundings.  Photos of the underwater world, as well as the most stunning landscapes with cliffs cutting through the skies and natural piles surrounded by clouds and sunlight breaking through them, attract the attention of true artists.  An elevator tower is a vertically-vertical hole in a stone rock, the entrance to which is located at a 7-meter depth.  In order to get to the water surface, you must swim down about 8-10 meters and get out through one of the three rocky holes. </p><h2>  Paleontological findings of Capsel Bay </h2><p>  Capsel Bay is very popular with travelers.  Cape Meganom in the east is adjacent to this bay, the modern shape of which arose about 100 millennia ago. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Capsel Bay. Cape Meganom" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20418/486056.jpg" width="600"></div>  In the valley of the same name, traces of a person‚Äôs stay dating back to the 2nd millennium BC were found.  e.  Here, unique evidence of Taurian culture and the ruins of ancient settlements are still found here, many ancient stones of which in the last century were dismantled by local residents for private buildings.  Over ninety stone dolmens (boxes for burial members of the Tauri tribe), as well as three-meter menhirs (roughly processed stone pillars) are scattered throughout the Kapselsky valley.  These places of worship draw attention to themselves and cause a heated debate about their true purpose. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest in the Pike perch" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20418/486010.jpg" width="500"></div>  The development of resort services in this part of Crimea helps to attract vacationers not only to the cities of Yalta, Alushta and Sudak crowded with crowds of tourists.  Cape Meganom, Capsel and Engraver bays, Ghost valleys and Solnechnaya, as well as a great many other secluded (and not so) places, hospitably open their "doors" to travelers from different countries, with a wide variety of tastes and preferences.
