Today, tours to Montenegro are quite comparable in price to holidays in leading European resorts.  For Russians, this wonderful corner is attractive in several ways at once.  In their reviews, our compatriots especially note the amazing combination of natural beauties with unique cultural monuments, beautiful bays and beaches and, of course, <span>Mediterranean cuisine</span> and the friendliness of the local population.

    <p>  Montenegro hotels, regardless of their stardom, offer a European-level service, combined in some cases with a family atmosphere.  This is especially true of mini-hotels, in which those who prefer a quiet, measured rest away from the hustle and bustle prefer to stay. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Tourists who prefer parties in a classic resort performance, go to <span>Budva, Becici</span> or St. Stephen.  And for a vacation with a touch of sophisticated comfort in the midst of stunning landscapes and surrounded by artistic bohemia, you need to go to Herceg Novi. </p>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The sea and the sun - this is exactly why many tourists come here.  And the Russians are no exception.  Since the Stari Hrast 3 * hotel does not have a swimming pool, guests can sunbathe and swim only on the beach.  The seashore is just a five minute walk.  You can visit the municipal free beach, located three hundred meters away, or you can negotiate and use the swimming area belonging to the neighboring hotel. </p><p>  In any case, the sea, which is the same everywhere, will not disappoint tourists.

The hotel has a TV room and a games room.  Those who come here for thrills and do not accept lying for many hours under the sun are invited to rent a catamaran, ride a banana, slide down a water slide.  Many tourists rent a boat and go fishing. </p><p>  Snorkelling in Montenegro come from all over the world.  The underwater landscapes of Becici are truly amazing.  Fans can go diving or windsurfing under the supervision of licensed instructors. </p>

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  The range of attractions available from Becici is wide.  You can go to the canyon of the Tara and Moraca rivers, which is simply huge.  As a protected place, an oasis of pristine nature is listed as a UNESCO heritage site. </p><p>  The tour will be extremely interesting, since it is here that the highest mountain bridge in Europe is located - Djurdjevic Tara.  Just looking at this structure is enough to fully appreciate the courage of its creators. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Stari Hrast is popular with Russians.  And this is evidenced by the impressions of all those who have already managed to rest here.  Why do compatriots choose Stari Hrast?  Reviews are called as the main reason for the excellent ratio of quality of services and the cost of tours.  Guests are particularly happy with the calm, homely atmosphere that prevails at the hotel.  The staff knows everyone by name, treats them as personal guests.  No complaints about the proposed food.  The only thing many are dissatisfied with is the lack of a pool, but the nearby sea completely compensates for this shortcoming. </p>
