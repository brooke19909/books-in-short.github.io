  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Yakhroma resort is a great place for outdoor activities</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In order to visit a ski resort, it is not necessary to go to the Alps, there are several wonderful places in the suburbs.  One of the most famous is the Yakhroma ski resort.  It is located not far from the city of the same name, about 50 kilometers from the Moscow Ring Road, right along Dmitrovskoye Shosse, just not reaching Dmitrov himself.  On the one hand, the location of the Yakhroma resort is very convenient, but leaving for Dmitrovka is one of the most problematic places at the end of the week, and this should be taken into account when planning a weekend.  Of course, in winter the situation here is slightly easier than the summer, but you can still lose more than one hour. </p><p>  The Yakhroma amusement park is located in a very picturesque place near the river on four hills.  This region has always enjoyed a reputation as one of the most beautiful in the middle lane: the north of the Moscow Region is a terrain with a fanciful relief, numerous ravines, rivers and streams, covered with noble and ancient <span>coniferous forests.</span>  Many creative people preferred to live here, inspired by the beauty of these places. </p><p>  The infrastructure of the Yakhroma park is very well developed: there is everything that can interest a person who has chosen out of town in winter.  Firstly, these are two comfortable hotels, one classic 4 *, Boomerang, and the second - an unusual youth, Nirvana plus separate houses and luxury cottages.  The catering is organized as follows: there are two restaurants, Boyarsky and Ya-Pasta, a self-service bistro and several bars of various subjects, the main of which is Birloga, where competitions and events are broadcast.  It should be noted that prices here are far from affordable, even at the most inexpensive institution - the Carousel bistro.  In addition, reviews about the resort of Yakhroma speak of cases of dishonest service, but the choice of dishes is huge, and the quality of food is on the level.  Separately, it is worth mentioning the bath complex "Bear". </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The main thing that the resort of Yakhroma is famous for is, of course, a large selection of sports entertainment.  There are as many as 10 different ski slopes of varying lengths and complexity, and there is a separate slope for snowboarding, which is very convenient.  In the dark, the tracks are lit, including at night.  Even if you don‚Äôt know how to <span>ski,</span> then there is no problem: the Yakhroma resort is a great place to learn.  There is a special school where both adults and children are taught.  In just a few hours, under the guidance of competent instructors, you can learn to get down pretty well.  You can ride either on the equipment you brought with you or on a rental, however, then you will have to take care of the amount of the deposit in advance: it is from 20 thousand here, otherwise you can spend the weekend riding the lift - residents get 50 lifts for free.  There is also an ice climbing track, a rope city, <span>artificial rocks</span> for climbing and much more. </p><p>  In addition to sports entertainment, there are plenty of entertainment attractions.  The most famous is Crazy Toboggan, a kind of roller coaster.  <span>Helicopter</span> and balloon <span>flights</span> , various mazes, various shooting galleries, orienteering grounds, snowmobiles, snowmobiles and ATVs are possible.  The park also houses the Audi quattro camp, where you can learn how to drive extreme sports.  By the way, all the events of the Russian representative office of Audi are traditionally held here. </p><p>  Yakhroma resort should not be considered an exclusively winter resort: in the summer there is also something to do, and the summer program of events is also quite eventful.  The rides are open all year, and in the summer, <span>winter activities</span> are replaced by all kinds of outdoor activities, including rafting and kayaking on artificially created tracks with obstacles of varying difficulty. </p><p>  So, despite a number of shortcomings (prices, service, possible traffic jams when leaving Moscow), it is generally very good that such a place is not far from the capital.  Here you can have a great rest both on weekends and in the middle of the week at any time of the year. </p>
