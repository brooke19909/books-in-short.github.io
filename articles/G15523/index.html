Still good things, spoiled with a speck in a prominent place that does not wash.  Jeans or trousers worn on the knee.  T-shirts and t-shirts bought at the sale.  Perhaps the time has come to sort out your closet with clothes? </p><p>  Perhaps, in the process of analyzing the rubble you will come across things that make you want to pick up sewing accessories and do decoration.  And we offer you a selection of embroidery on T-shirts with their own hands. </p><h2>  What do you need for work? </h2><ol><li>  Actually, a t-shirt.  It is desirable that the thing be monophonic.  Then do-it-yourself embroidery on the T-shirt will stand out and look organically. </li><li>  A sheet of paper and a pencil.  They are needed for transferring circuits.  Choose your favorite pattern, enlarge to the desired size.  Attach the paper to the computer screen and circle the pattern.  Even better if you have a printer at home. </li><li>  Disappearing or washable marker.  It is necessary for marking the template on the fabric. </li><li>  Threads.  Traditionally, floss is used for embroidery.  You can experiment with the types of threads.  Try adding lurex to the floss or embroider the patch with one shiny thread.  Now in the assortment of stores there are lurex of different colors.  Also try to add thin and thick knitting yarns in places. </li><li>  Scissors. <div class="photo" data-original="look-what-i-made.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Materials for work" class="if uuid-3185086" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/132274/3185086.jpg"></div></li><li>  Hoop.  Necessarily required.  Otherwise, the fabric after embroidery will be ‚Äúknitted", that is, gathered in folds. </li><li>  Different size beads, beads, sequins, rhinestones.  Any template can be decorated with these elements.  Pick combinations to your taste, don't be afraid to experiment.  Then at the exit you will get an original designer embroidery of a T-shirt with your own hands. </li><li>  Needles.  It is advisable to choose comfortable needles with a long flat eye.  Threading will be easier. </li></ol><h2>  Next Step: Learn Stitches </h2><p>  There are a lot of types of stitches for embroidery.  A stalk, a ‚Äúforward needle‚Äù, a cross, a half-cross, a Christmas tree, a twig, etc. Watch a training video, because it‚Äôs better to see it once. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="eU-ZVbfAUME" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU-ZVbfAUME" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/6/5/2/0/16520.jpg"></div><p>  Another very interesting and informative video on this topic.  Using a comb, it turns out that you can embroider a volumetric flower.  A great many life hacks and useful tips, see below. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="_MMtmAJdZpo" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MMtmAJdZpo" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/6/5/2/2/16522.jpg"></div><p>  Tip: Try to practice on unnecessary tissue before starting your main job.  The best option for beginner embroiderers is to buy a section of canvas.  This is a fabric with a cellular structure.  When working on the canvas, it‚Äôs easier to sew even and neat stitches.  Invite patience, attentiveness and, most importantly, inspiration to your embroidery company. </p><p>  So, the stitches are worked out, the material is prepared.  Now is the time to choose your own embroidery on a T-shirt.  And in what technique? </p><h2>  Do-it-yourself stitch embroidery on a t-shirt </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY t-shirt embroidery" class="if uuid-3185347" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/132274/3185347.jpg"></div><p>  The technique of this embroidery is simple and complex at the same time.  Used seam pl called "forward needle", uncomplicated in execution.  Craftswomen recommend clearly transferring the contours of the pattern to the fabric in order to confidently make the next stitches.  The surface smooths the picture with a dense layer, the thread lies in one direction.  Sometimes the outline of the pattern is embroidered separately. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The stitches are divided into oblique and straight.  Straight stitches should go clearly in the direction of the thread of the embroidered fabric.  The smooth surface is characterized by such a technique as a smooth surface with flooring.  To do this, the outline of the pattern is performed with the usual stitch, the whole element is filled with it.  After this, the thread, which should be thicker than the main thread, covers the entire pattern.  When using this technique, the embroidery will look voluminous and convex. </p><p>  To get started, try embroidering small elements - small flowers, motifs or simple patterns.  Below is a photo with DIY embroidery on a T-shirt.  It is made smooth: </p><div class="photo" data-original="tatianahandmade.nethouse.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Embroidery on a T-shirt with thread floss" class="if uuid-3185151" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/132274/3185151.jpg"></div><p>  As you can see, volume elements were used here.  Embroidery is assembled from flowers and leaves that are tightly adjacent to each other.  The thread is voluminous, most likely it is not a mouline thread, but something thicker.  For example, cotton threads for knitting. </p><p>  The video tutorial shows how to embroider a flower with a stitch.  Notice how tightly stretched the fabric: </p><p>  The embroidered inscriptions look very interesting.  Like, for example, in this photo. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.themeparkpro.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY embroidery" class="if uuid-3185356" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/132274/3185356.jpg"></div><p>  Look, very beautiful and original.  Here we see how the word hello is embroidered with simple stitches and multi-colored floss threads.  If you give free rein to imagination, you can diversify the embroidery of the inscription on the T-shirt with your own hands.  Add beads, beads or sequins.  Well, of course, pick up a phrase as you wish.  The inscription can be placed under the collar line on one or two sleeves. </p><h2>  And if you try cross-stitch? </h2><p>  Very popular technique.  Known since time immemorial, she has long won the respect of millions of needlewomen.  Countless patterns and elements - and just one kind of stitch.  It is carried out by floss thread.  Do-it-yourself cross-stitch embroidery on a T-shirt opens up great opportunities. </p><p>  You can embroider individual small items. </p><div class="photo" data-original="irinapetrenko.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cross stitch patterns" class="if uuid-3185288" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/132274/3185288.jpg"></div><p>  And you can embroider a whole picture.  These seals are embroidered with a cross, and to give the work volume and realism, the edges are trimmed with long stitches.  They imitate wool.  Very beautiful and interesting idea. </p><div class="photo" data-original="contact.meta.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cross stitch pattern" class="if uuid-3185334" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/132274/3185334.jpg"></div><p>  For this technique, the main thing is to master a simple stitch and correctly transfer the pattern to the fabric.  Recently, programs for creating circuits have appeared.  There are both paid and free.  The main charm is that you can make a diagram according to any picture or photo.  Then print it and embroider. </p><p>  Thus, with the help of such applications, you can even embroider a photo of your family on the fabric.  Or create an original gift - a T-shirt with an image of a birthday person.  Such a present will not go unnoticed. </p><h2>  You can decorate your clothes with embroidery in a free style. </h2><p>  The basis is taken any scheme, drawing or template.  Combining different types of stitches, you can create an individual embroidery, which no one else has.  It all depends on the flight of imagination and creative thought. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.doggystars.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Embroidery with different types of stitches" class="if uuid-3185320" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/132274/3185320.jpg"></div><p>  The photo uses different techniques.  Here, the surface, and the French knot, and the seam "forward needle."  You can leave it as it is.  And you can fill in the empty spaces with small sequins and beads.  They can be of different shapes and sizes - this will give embroidery charm. </p><h2>  Another idea is to combine embroidery and applique work </h2><p>  A very beautiful T-shirt turned out. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Embroidery combined with applique" class="if uuid-3185096" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/132274/3185096.jpg"></div><p>  For this work, it will be necessary to stock up pieces of fabric.  Chiffon or organza will do.  Circles of different sizes are cut from the fabric.  The edges must be treated with a lighter or a candle.  This is done quickly.  You can not scorch the fabric with the edge of the flame, as it smokes. </p><p>  Then a flower is gathered from circles of different sizes and sewn onto a T-shirt.  The center of the flower is filled with beads and beads.  The stems are embroidered. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In conclusion, I would like to mention some nuances. </p><ol><li>  If you will decorate things from knitwear or any other elastic fabric, special needles will be required.  An ordinary needle is not suitable for this purpose. </li><li>  To transfer patterns to fabric, use tracing paper.  Copy the picture to it.  Attach tracing paper to the fabric.  At the end of work, the paper easily comes off and leaves no residue. </li></ol><p>  Now you know how to make embroidery on a T-shirt with your own hands.  We wish you good luck and creative success! </p>
