    <h2>  General characteristics of housing </h2><p>  The private sector in Katkova Slit is represented by <span>mini-hotels, guest houses,</span> as well as houses, turnkey rooms and entire apartments with the owners.  Since the village actually consists of two intersecting large streets - Kurgannaya and Magistralnaya, then all housing is mainly concentrated there or in neighboring lanes.  Food, as a rule, vacationers cook themselves - in shared kitchens or in separate kitchens, which are located directly in the rooms.  Very often, owners have cafes or dining rooms where they feed their guests for a fee.  Many houses are in the garden or lined with palm trees.  Despite the fact that the rooms are located in large buildings or bungalows, the furniture and showers are new, almost everywhere there are suspended ceilings, plasma TVs, there is a laminate on the floor.  But there are also very modest economy class rooms.  Such housing, depending on the price and degree of comfort, is chosen by both wealthy people and those who can only afford a budget vacation. </p><h2>  Katkova Shchel, private sector: ‚ÄúAt the Marina‚Äù </h2><p>  This guest house is located on Kurgannaya Street.  It has a large green area with a garden where ornamental bushes and trees grow.  A lot of flowers and shady places.  Most of the rooms in this house are in the economy category.

There is a guest house "Marina" and accommodation with amenities.  These are triple rooms.  This private property is located on level ground, from the beach you do not have to climb the mountain.
