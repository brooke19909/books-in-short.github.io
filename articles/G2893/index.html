It is carried with you everywhere: at work, on vacation, doing household chores, and, of course, situations when the device falls down are not uncommon.  In most cases, when dropped, the phone remains intact, but what if the iPhone falls and does not turn on? </p><h2>  What to do immediately after the fall? </h2><p>  Depending on the situation in which the fall occurred, some features of the actions are distinguished: </p><ol><li>  If your mobile device falls into the water, you must immediately remove it.  You cannot turn on the smartphone, the battery is removed from it and placed in the sun or battery.  The iPhone must be in a de-energized state for at least 24 hours.  After drying, the battery is inserted into the device and turned on.  If you do not know how to remove the back cover on an iPhone, we suggest that you watch the video below. <div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="egGIr4__aM0" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=164&amp;v=egGIr4__aM0" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/5/6/5/2/15652.jpg"></div></li><li>  If the phone falls on a hard surface, it is lifted and inspected for cracks, scratches, chips and dents.  If the damage is not serious, it can be turned on. </li><li>  If after a fall the smartphone does not turn on, it needs to be shaken slightly in the hands - it is possible that the power cable went away during the impact.  After this manipulation, he can earn.  Another option is to put the iPhone on charge and turn it on after a while. </li><li>  If, as a result of the crash, the device turns on, but does not load further than the Apple logo, the firmware is most likely damaged, you can fix this only in the service center. <div class="photo" data-original="www.imore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone fell and does not turn on what to do" class="if uuid-3145951" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3145951.jpg"></div></li></ol><h2>  Screen problems after crash </h2><p>  If it falls, the screen may crack, partially function, reflect the image, while the sensor does not respond, the display becomes white or black, complete failure with the impossibility of turning it on. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If the screen cracked, but this did not affect the performance of the device, the repair can be postponed and continue to use the iPhone.  Often, damage is exclusively aesthetic.  Sometimes, cracks in the display can expand due to regular vibration, which ultimately leads to image distortion or poor functioning of the sensor.  Therefore, delaying the repair is not worth it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.recode.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone fell and does not turn on" class="if uuid-3145941" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3145941.jpg"></div><p>  If after the fall the iPhone works, but the screen turns black, you can try to restore it yourself: </p><ol><li>  Charge your mobile device. </li><li>  Reboot. </li><li>  Activate silent mode several times and turn it off. </li></ol><p>  If the iPhone fell and does not turn on using the described manipulations, then this is due to internal breakdowns.  The device must be shown to a specialist. </p><p>  If your device has a protective glass and when it falls, it cracks, then simply replace the element. </p><p>  How to remove glass from an iPhone: </p><ol><li>  Due to cracks, the adhesion of the protective screen and glass is reduced, which means that it is not difficult to separate them. </li><li>  To do this, take the dental floss and carefully bring it under the glass.  When the thread has crept, it is necessary to stick a toothpick or piece of paper so that the protection does not stick again. </li><li>  Slowly raise the sheet of paper, gently detaching the remaining protective glass from the screen. </li></ol><p>  Or you can use a special suction cup with a ring, as shown in the photo below. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.creatingreallyawesomefunthings.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone fell and does not turn on when charging" class="if uuid-3145978" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3145978.jpg"></div><h2>  Casing deformation and invisible defects </h2><p>  In the best case, after a strong fall, a dent will appear on the case, which does not affect the functionality of the device.  However, this is rare.  Deformations affecting the refusal to turn on the mobile device, as a rule, damage the internal equipment: processor, microcircuit, cable, control module, board, power supply device, and other details.  It is possible to detect a breakdown on your own by disassembling the gadget, but even when determining a broken element, you can replace it only with special equipment and skills. </p><p>  In some cases, resuscitating a mobile device after a fall is helped by simultaneously pressing the Home key and the power button.  They are held for several seconds until the phone starts to reboot.  Another option is to connect the iPhone to the computer via iTunes and configure the operating system.  If the smartphone is under warranty service and there are no external defects, then it is best to take it to a service center, where under the guarantee they will completely repair the damage. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gigazine.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to remove the back cover on an iphone" class="if uuid-3145953" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3145953.jpg"></div><p>  It is not recommended to independently replace the iPhone case, since the user can not always do it carefully.  Such nuances are often possible: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  seals are not glued correctly; </li><li>  the camera and loops are damaged; </li><li>  the tightness of the structure is not maintained. </li></ul><h2>  Battery problems </h2><p>  All models of "apple" devices have a built-in rechargeable battery, so when it is damaged, the device will have to be opened and the part changed.  What to do, the iPhone fell and does not turn on?  First, consider what can happen to a battery.  The device may close contacts or the matter is only in the departed loop. </p><p>  If the battery is replaced on its own, you need to stock up on a small suction cup with a ring and a five-blade screwdriver, and then follow the step-by-step instructions: </p><ol><li>  Two screws are unscrewed on the sides of the case.  At the bottom of the display, a suction cup is attached and, holding the ring, gently pull the front panel at a right angle.  The display is attached to the main board with three loops using a bracket.  Holding the screen, in turn unscrew the screws and disconnect the bracket and the display wire.  Then the front panel is removed to the side. </li><li>  On the bracket, unscrew the screws and free the wire.  To remove the battery, it is necessary to pull it out with a sharp movement, since during assembly it is glued to the body. </li><li>  Then the battery is replaced with a new one.  Following the steps described above in the opposite direction, assemble the device.  In order not to get confused and not to forget the sequence of actions, during disassembly everyone fixes schematically or photographs. </li></ol><h2>  Charging module </h2><p>  Between the battery and the main board there is a charging module, its function is to supply and distribute energy to all components of the smartphone.  If the iPhone fell while charging and does not turn on, then this may be the case in this component. </p><p>  You can replace it yourself after acquiring the appropriate part or, in order to avoid low-quality repair, entrust the work to a professional.  If you decide to do it yourself, we suggest that you familiarize yourself with the video.  The instruction is presented on the example of ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù 6 models. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="WpGLol6NbKQ" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGLol6NbKQ" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/5/6/5/3/15653.jpg"></div><h2>  Motherboard </h2><p>  One of the most important details in a mobile device is the motherboard, this is a kind of ‚Äúheart‚Äù of an iPhone.  It consists of many parts and modules, each of which has its own functions.  It is possible to identify a specific breakdown only using special equipment.  Therefore, if the iPhone fell and does not turn on in any way, then you should take it to a service center. </p><p>  For example, if a malfunction is associated with a peripheral element, then fixing the system board and restoring device functions are possible.  If the motherboard itself is out of order, the gadget will have to be disposed of.  Of course, you can always purchase a separate part, but its cost and repair services in total will be equal to the price of a new device. </p><p>  In each generation of iPhones, the motherboard has its own degree of strength and the number of modules on it.  At the time of the fall, any of them may suffer and lead to damage to the device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone case replacement" class="if uuid-3145971" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3145971.jpg"></div><h2>  Power button or loop </h2><p>  If the iPhone falls and does not turn on, the power button or related components may be damaged.  Among them: a key mechanism, a loop, spring protection, a power path.  It is only possible to independently determine the breakdown when the phone is on - when you press a key, no reaction occurs. </p><p>  Repairing this malfunction will cost a lot due to the high cost of the parts.  If the device does not respond to attempts to turn on, reboot and charge, then you need to contact a trusted master.  He will diagnose the entire device, including the buttons, restore it, and not offer to replace the module. </p><div class="photo" data-original="irepairtokyo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to remove glass from an iphone" class="if uuid-3145952" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3145952.jpg"></div><p>  Some users are convinced: the higher the cost of the phone, the stronger it is.  In fact, the opposite is true: as a rule, internal parts are quite fragile, and the device itself is technically difficult to arrange.  The more carefully you treat him, the longer he will last. </p>
