  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Living organization levels</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the world that surrounds us, we can distinguish several different interconnected biological levels that obey a single hierarchy.  Depending on their complexity, eight levels of the structural organization of wildlife are distinguished. </p><p>  The first on the list is molecular.  It is with him that the levels of organization of the living begin.  The object of research at this level are molecules of proteins, carbohydrates, fats.  It also includes molecules of lipids, nucleic and <span>deoxyribonucleic acids</span> and other macromolecules that make up any living cell.  It is at the molecular level that the vital processes of even the most complex organism begin: the conversion of energy, the transmission of hereditary traits, metabolism, and so on. </p><p>  Continues the organization levels of the living cellular level.  As you know, a cell is a structural and functional unit, outside of which there is no life, development and reproduction.  It is the unit of development of all living things, both unicellular and multicellular. </p><p>  Levels of organization of living continue tissue level.  Tissue is a combination of <span>intercellular substance</span> and cells that share a common origin and function.  According to one classification, six <span>types of tissues</span> in plant organisms and four in animals are distinguished.  In plants it is: educational, integumentary, mechanical, excretory, conductive and <span>basic tissue.</span>  Animals distinguish between epithelial, muscular, nervous and connective, and each of them has certain properties and performs distinctive functions from others.  For example, nerve tissue communicates organs, tissues and body systems, as well as regulates them.  With its help, signals from the outside world are received, received and transmitted to nerve endings. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The levels of the structural organization of wildlife include the organ level.  By organ is meant a part of a <span>multicellular organism that</span> has a certain shape and performs some function.  This functional unit is most often formed by several types of tissue, of which one prevails.  In addition, only a part isolated from other functional units can be considered an organ.  For example, human organs are: the pituitary gland, stomach, intestines, uterus, adrenal glands, liver, heart, etc. </p><p>  The levels of organization of living organisms continue, which in turn are divided into unicellular and multicellular.  The simplest unicellular organism, as the name implies, consists of a single cell, and a multicellular organism is formed by a combination of tissues and organs. </p><p>  The next level is population-specific.  Under the population understand the totality of individuals or organisms, similar in structure, living in a certain territory, not isolated from other areas, between which crossing is possible.  More than 1.5 million animal species and about 500 thousand plant species have been recorded on the planet today. </p><p>  In the penultimate place is the biogeocenotic level.  Under the biogeocenosis, a historically formed set of different species interacting with their environment is understood.  At this level, the <span>cycle of substances</span> and energy is carried out, in fact it is a self-regulating sustainable ecosystem. </p><p>  The biosphere <span>level of organization of life</span> completes the system <span>.</span>  It globally unites various biogeocenoses.  In the biosphere, all the cycles of energy and substances in the world occur, associated with the life of all organisms that live on the planet. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the levels of organization of the living are divided into eight parts, they are all interconnected.  Moreover, each level has its own characteristics, patterns and research methods. </p>
