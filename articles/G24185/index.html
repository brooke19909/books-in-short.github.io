Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna Romanova became the head of the Family Imperial House. </p><h2>  Biography </h2><p>  The great princesses of the Romanovs at all times were perfectly educated.  Many of them graduated from the most famous higher educational institutions in the world.  Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna was educated at Oxford University.  For some time she lived in France.  Currently, the head of the Imperial House is located in Spain.  The heir to the Throne, Maria Vladimirovna Romanova, whose photo is presented in the article, was proclaimed her father in 1989.

At the same time, Princess Maria Romanova declared her son, George, the heir to the prince. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Marriage </h2><p>  Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna was married to Franz Wilhelm (in Orthodoxy - Mikhail Pavlovich) of Prussia.  In Madrid they had a son (in 1981) - George.  In 1985, the marriage was dissolved, and Prince Franz-Wilhelm returned to Lutheranism again.  Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna and her ex-husband are sister and brother in the sixth tribe.  They are both descendants of Louise Mecklenburg-Strelitzkaya and <span>Friedrich Wilhelm III.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna Romanova" class="if" height="318" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/583737.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Title </h2><p>  Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna calls herself the head of the Imperial (Russian) house.  The legitimacy of the use of the title is controversial for the branch of "Nikolaevich".  A descendant of Queen Victoria of Britain began to voice disagreement.  Nikolai Romanovich also does not recognize the rights of the princess.  The Romanovs, representing the second branch of descendants, point out some difficulties and ambiguities in the issue of the uniformity of marriage, from which, in fact, the head of the Imperial House was born.  However, there are those who do not recognize this marriage as morganatic.  Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna substantiates her rights using the Law on Succession and the Institution On the Imperial Family.  As an argument, she cites article 30, in accordance with which the throne was inherited.  According to the heiress herself, the Imperial House consists of her and her son.  The remaining persons, of whom the Romanov family consists, are considered to be born in <span>morganatic marriages.</span>  This definition should be applied to those whose fathers recognized Cyril as a candidate for the throne in the 1930s and who were granted high titles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Recognition in Russia </h2><p>  The Grand Duchess is recognized as the head of the Imperial House by the Russian Orthodox Church and some <span>socio-political associations.</span>  These include, in particular, the Russian monarchist movement, the Imperial Union-Order, the organization For Faith and Fatherland, as well as the Russian Noble Assembly.  The princess received recognition from the foreign public.  In Russia, the Imperial House still does not have official status.  However, several attempts have been made to obtain it in one form or another.  In December 22, 2011, Smirnov (President of the unrecognized <span>Moldavian (Transnistrian) Republic)</span> signed a decree according to which the Imperial House is recognized as a unique historical institution without legal entity rights on the self-proclaimed territory.  Moreover, the status allows you to take part in the spiritual, moral and patriotic education of citizens of the Republic, preserving the traditions and historical and cultural heritage of Transnistrian society. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Maria Vladimirovna Romanova photo" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/583738.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Social work </h2><p>  Princess Maria since the early 1990s  regularly visits the territory of Russia.  She has been to Georgia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Armenia and Transnistria.  The heir to the throne conducts business related to children's and church charity.  For example, in 2010, she transferred particles of the Lord‚Äôs Cross to St. John‚Äôs Monastery (Karpovka, St. Petersburg), to the Catherine‚Äôs Cathedral of Tsarskoye Selo - a particle of the relics of St.  Catherine.  The princess first visited Russia with her son in 1992, in April.  Then the funeral of her father took place.  Since then, the head of the Romanov dynasty has visited the Fatherland more than fifty times. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Attitude to Russia </h2><p>  In all her statements, the heiress to the throne emphasizes the desire to serve for the good of the Fatherland.  The Grand Duchess declares that in her actions there is no intention to impose a monarchist system on the inhabitants of Russia.  She also notes that she does not plan to show political or opposition activity.  In her activity, Princess Mary is ready to use the entire historical and spiritual potential of the Imperial (Russian) house. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Romanov family" class="if" height="288" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/583743.jpg" width="460"></div>

    <h2>  The issue of rehabilitation of the murdered royal family </h2><p>  In 2005, on December 1, a representative of the Imperial House sent a statement to the Prosecutor General‚Äôs Office of the Russian Federation.  It was a petition for the rehabilitation of the family of the executed Nicholas II, as victims of political repression.  The Prosecutor General‚Äôs Office stated that this case does not comply with a number of provisions of the law.  In particular, rehabilitation is impossible due to the fact that the imperial family was not arrested for political reasons, and the decision to shoot was not made in court.  Despite this, in 2008 the Presidium of the Supreme Court decided to satisfy the requirements of the Imperial House.  In the same 2008, another 52 people from the royal circle were rehabilitated.  This was decided by the Prosecutor General. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna" class="if" height="432" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/583739.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Timeline of some events </h2><p>  Since December 2008, the State Trade Economic University of the Russian Federation has been under the auspices of the Imperial House.  In early July 2011, together with her son, the Grand Duchess was present at secular celebrations and services in Monaco in honor of the marriage of Albert II and Charlene Wittstock.  In 2012, on April 25, the <span>patrol vessel Yaroslav the Wise</span> was transferred under the patronage of the Imperial House <span>.</span>  In 2013, the Grand Duchess became the head of a number of cultural, scientific, charitable and social events abroad and in Russia, which were dedicated to the centenary of the Romanovsky House.  In mid-July of the same year, the heiress to the throne received thanks from the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church for participating in the events.  Since 2014, Princess Maria Vladimirovna has been Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Imperial Cancer Research Foundation. </p><h2>  The opportunity to be present in Russia </h2><p>  In July 28, 2009, the director of the office of the Imperial House of Sunsets conveyed the desire of the head to return to Russia.  As the lawyer explained, since 1917 the organization has been in exile.  And the desire to return to the fatherland is the desire to restore the institution.  As an example, the director of the office cites the Russian Orthodox Church and its status in Russia.  The church in this case is separated from the state, but nevertheless has a certain authority and influence, takes part in public events.  In response to this appeal, Archpriest <span>V. Chaplin</span> spoke <span>.</span>  He said that the status of a religious association, which is the Russian Orthodox Church, is not suitable for the Imperial House, however, through dialogue with representatives of the authorities and society, a form of presence in Russia can be found. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Princess Romanov" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/583740.jpg" width="325"></div>

    <h2>  Views </h2><p>  The Grand Duchess is considered a consistent monarchist.  At one time, she quite actively opposed the restrictions on 2 presidential terms in the Russian Federation.  According to the Grand Duchess, trying on the monarchy to Russia in its present state is premature.  However, it does not exclude the possibility of a revival of the best in Russian traditions.  The heiress to the throne believes that restrictions on staying in power of the President for two terms can be equated to restricting the will of the people.  As for the return of the Imperial House to Russia, the princess believes that this will be possible only after the question of its legal status as a historical association is decided.  Among other things, the heiress is quite principled in the matter of nationalization.  The princess opposed restitution, under no circumstances thought to demand or ask to return anything from the nationalized property.  Moreover, the heiress to the throne in no way recommends this to anyone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Grand Duchesses of the Romanovs" class="if" height="297" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13387/584193.jpg" width="547"></div>
