Canary Islands: attractions, weather, reviews of tourists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Which country does the Canary Islands belong to?  In ancient times, the archipelago was inhabited by the Guanche tribes, who till the arrival of Europeans cultivated land and were engaged in cattle breeding.  In 1334, French sailors visited the islands, and the natives had to make room.  According to the laws of that time, all newly discovered lands fell under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Church. </p><p>  The Vatican in the person of Pope Clement VI presented the Canary Islands to Count Alfonso XI - the ruler of Castile, the largest province on the <span>Iberian Peninsula.</span>  For some time, it became clear to whom the Canary Islands belong. <strong> </strong>  However, Alfonso XI did not know what to do with such a gift.  The natives did not bring any economic benefits, and even vice versa, the ruler was now obliged to improve life on the islands.  The count did not directly dare to abandon the archipelago, but he tried through difficult negotiations to transfer his ownership of the property to other hands.  The question of who owns the Canary Islands literally hung in the air. </p>

    <h2>  Who is the master after all? </h2><p>  It would seem that the answer to the question of which country the Canary Islands belong to lies on the surface.  The owner is Spain, but everything was not so simple. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After half a century, the French decided to seize the islands.  Military ships proceeded along the west African coast, which then approached two islands in the center of the archipelago - Tenerife and Gran Canaria.  The local population languidly resisted annexation. </p><p>  In Gran Canaria, French troops celebrated their victory a few days later, and in Tenerife this happened a little later.  This was followed by periodic landings on the Canary Islands of conquerors of all stripes, from Moroccan soldiers to the British admiral Robert Blake, who conducted a brilliant <span>naval battle</span> near the island of Tenerife in 1657, entering the battle with the Spanish armada.  He emerged victorious from this confrontation, but the islands nonetheless retreated to Spain. </p><p>  After 140 years, the famous Admiral Nelson tried to capture Tenerife, but Santa Cruz, the capital of the Canary Islands, got in his way and he was defeated.  In the end, the British abandoned their imperial ambitions. </p><p>  The question of which country the Canary Islands belong to remained unanswered for a long time, until in 1821 the archipelago finally left Spain.  In 1982, the Canary Islands were proclaimed an autonomous region of the Spanish state, and in 1986 the province of Canary entered the European Union.  Thus, the answer to the question of which country the Canary Islands belong to is now unequivocal.  As a result of numerous renaming and status changes, the right decision was made.  Today, the Canary Islands belong to Spain. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Archipelago today </h2><p>  What is the Canary Islands - a country, a province or some special structure?  The geographic location of the archipelago speaks of its conditional belonging to mainland Spain, however, the islands have autonomy complete and unconditional. </p><p>  Canary Islands - a country, if we keep in mind the social arrangement and the availability of services necessary to comply with the law and order.  These are the police, courts and legal institutions.  Although, on the other hand, all these services are practically inactive, since the Canaries are a zone of supertourism, millions of travelers come to the blessed land to relax, have fun and forget about the hardships of civilization for a while.  No one violates the laws. </p><h2>  Geography </h2><p>  The Canary Islands are just a hundred kilometers from the African continent and seven hundred <span>nautical miles</span> from the coast of Spain.  The archipelago adjoins Africa from the north-west (at the junction of Western Sahara and Morocco). </p><p>  There are only seven large Canary Islands.  The closest to the African coast is Lanzarote, the next island is Fuerteventura, then Gran Canaria is located, followed by Tenerife, Homer, La Palma and Hierro.  These are the largest volcanic formations, but there are still many minor ones. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  A list that includes the most popular Canary Islands, a map of their location, directions, and more - all this information can be obtained at the tourist offices of Spain or upon arrival on about.  Tenerife </p><p>  The islands are not alike; each of them is attractive in its own way.  For example, Lanzarote is ideal for lovers of a calm measured rest, and Gran Canaria is a paradise for surfers and divers.  For tourists arriving in the Canary Islands, a map and guides will help you find the best place to stay.  There are also hotels for every taste - more expensive, more comfortable, economy class hotels with reasonable prices. </p><p>  It is difficult to say how many Canary Islands there are in the archipelago; an exact calculation has not been carried out.  However, it is known that not all of them are inhabited.  At one time, municipal authorities even opened the sale of small islands.  Those who wish could purchase at a reasonable price a small piece of land in the ocean.  Trade went briskly until the Spanish authorities intervened on the mainland.  The capital of the Canary Islands, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, was then forced to give up part of its authority to the city of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. </p>

    <h2>  Most popular places <strong></strong></h2><p>  The best island of the Canary Islands, according to most tourists, is Tenerife.  In second place in popularity - Gran Canaria.  These islands are distinguished by a developed infrastructure, upscale hotels, excellent entertainment complexes for both adults and children. </p><p>  The Canary Islands, photos of which are presented in the article, have long become one of the best places for outdoor activities.  Tourists are attracted by the choice and impeccable service. </p><h2>  Landscape </h2><p>  The Canary Islands, whose photos are amazing, are volcanic formations that appeared over the water millions of years ago.  Until now, on the surface, one can observe bizarre landscapes with frozen lava, which are adjacent to long sand dunes resembling <span>the Sahara desert.</span>  Luxurious beaches are washed by ocean waves, and immediately after them hotel complexes with palm alleys begin.  A warm breeze from the sea stirs the green branches of trees, vacationers feel unity with nature, and this happens throughout the day.  When the time for parting with the Canaries is approaching, nobody wants to leave.  The charm of a paradise remains in the memory for a long time, until the next arrival. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  The climate in the Canary Islands is moderately tropical, dry and hot, but not sultry.  The temperature range is determined by the proximity of the African coast.  Hot trade winds mix with oceanic air masses.  It turns out a kind of airy cocktail, cool and comfortable, which spreads throughout the Canary Islands.  Air masses are continuously updated.  The climate also softens the permanent anticyclone over the Azores, located northwest of the archipelago. </p><p>  The temperature in the Canary Islands is stable throughout the year.  It is 20-30 in the summer and 16-25 degrees Celsius in the winter.  During the year, the relative influence of mountains and hills on climatic conditions is observed, however, the temperature drops are insignificant, they do not exceed 2-3 degrees.  Temperature changes occur mainly on the highest Canary Islands - Gran Canaria, Tenerife and La Palma.  The climate in the rest of the archipelago is practically unchanged. </p><p>  The water temperature in the zone of the islands under consideration is about 20 degrees Celsius.  The equilibrium is achieved due to the Canary current - quite cold, but slow.  In general, the temperature regime on the islands is very comfortable and stable.  In a nutshell, you can characterize the climate in the Canaries as follows: warm and sunny. </p><p>  For tourists who flew to the Canary Islands in winter, the weather in December <strong> </strong>  It differs little from spring - it is just as warm.  Of course, a sharp change in climatic conditions within one day is impressive. </p><p>  Canary Islands (December weather <strong> </strong>  warmer than in the summer in Moscow) continue to surprise visitors. <strong> </strong>  The popularity of a world-famous resort has long known no boundaries, millions of tourists from all over the world fly to Reina Sophia International Airport and choose an island on which they will spend unforgettable days. </p>

    <h2>  Park "Loro" </h2><p>  Initially, these were aviaries with parrots.  Currently, this place is even more amazing.  Now in the park the rarest species of tropical parrots are collected, which are adjacent to orchids blooming all year round, planted throughout the territory (the most beautiful specimens can be admired in the Orchid House).  Also in the Loro park there is a huge aquarium with a whale shark, dolphins, sea lion and other inhabitants of the ocean.  A special place is occupied by a penguinarium with an artificial Arctic climate. </p><h2>  Teide Park </h2><p>  This is a high-mountain entertainment complex, deployed at an altitude of two thousand meters.  The temperature there is kept at forty degrees Celsius.  In the center of the park is a crater of an extinct volcano, whose diameter is 48 kilometers.  You can get to its top on a lift (mountaineering enthusiasts climb on foot). </p><h2>  Hell gorge </h2><p>  In the southern part of Tenerife is the only natural waterfall in the Canary Archipelago, an oasis in the midst of a dry and barren plain.  This cascade of silver jets is called the Gorge of Hell.  Tourists can experience the full power of unbridled elements by entering under the rock from which a waterfall falls. </p><h2>  Guimar Pyramids </h2><p>  These are religious buildings repeating man-made elevations in Peru, Mexico and ancient Mesopotamia.  At first, the pyramids in Guimard were taken for piles of stones piled up by Spanish immigrants when clearing the land for plowing.  However, later a group of researchers, among whom was the famous traveler <span>Thor Heyerdahl,</span> came to the conclusion that six piles of stones are nothing but pyramids. </p><p>  In addition, the Museum of Ethnography "House of Chacone" operates in Guimard Park, which displays a life-size architectural model of King Ra II's palace. </p><h2>  Cliffs of giants </h2><p>  Huge sections of the coast of the island of Tenerife are occupied by grandiose cliffs, closely standing near the water itself, and in some places - ledges descending into the ocean.  Rocks are considered sacred, their constant desire to plunge into the abyss is similar to a divine ritual. </p><p>  You can get to enchanted cliffs only from the sea side on a motor ship or motor boats. </p><h2>  Anaga Mountains </h2><p>  The magnificent hills on the island of Tenerife represent a vast botanical world.  Mountain plateaus called Anaga are an example of environmental cleanliness.  There you can meet locals living in caves. </p><p>  Canary Islands Attractions <strong> </strong>  which are on a par with the world masterpieces of nature and ethnography, attract millions of tourists.  Airlines operate at full load, planes land and take off every minute. </p>

    <h2>  Seven islands as seven wonders of the world </h2><p>  The archipelago in the Atlantic Ocean is remarkable and unique and its pearl is the island of Tenerife.  Spain, Canary Islands - the best vacation spot in the world. </p><p>  Lanzarote is an island of sleeping volcanoes.  Entire fields of frozen lava, unusual landscapes on the plains and mountain slopes, multi-colored petrified streams recreate picturesque panels of extraordinary beauty.

Nowhere in the world is there such freedom as on the beaches of Fuerteventura.  Sea water is surprisingly clean and warm, it glows with turquoise.  The island is ideal for those who prefer a romantic pastime, relaxation away from the hustle and bustle of civilization.  Throughout the day, you can feel like Robinson on a <span>desert island,</span> being in silence and complete loneliness, and in the evening return to a comfortable hotel for dinner. </p><p>  <span>The island of Gran Canaria</span> is famous not only for its magnificent golden beaches, but also for the widest infrastructure.  As an addition to the overall picture of prosperity - the nature of the island, striking in its diversity.  Deep forested gullies alternate with peaks covered with greenery, and all together are combined in a grandiose panorama.  The central part of the island of Gran Canaria is covered with a luxurious plant carpet, in the south there are gently sloping beaches with beaches, and in the north, rocks rise to the sky, bordering small coves with azure water.

After all, you need to have time everywhere - and swim in the purest ocean water, and go on excursions, and visit a sports club, a gym.  Then - again to the beach, ride a water bike, dive, visit the dolphinarium and catch a meal in a restaurant for a great four-course dinner.  It is not surprising that two weeks pass unnoticed.  However, unfortunately, you always have to leave. </p>
