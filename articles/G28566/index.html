    <h2>  <strong>Hera</strong> </h2><p>  This goddess is considered the wife and sister of the main god Zeus.  She is known as the patroness of marriage and personifies marital fidelity.  The ancient goddesses of Greece are described differently in myths.  Hera is portrayed as the guardian of morality.  She punishes her trespassers.  Especially strongly goes to her rivals and even their children.  In ancient Greece, Hera was credited with traits such as vanity and lust for power.  It was they who made her brutally crack down on women who put their own and even someone else's beauty above her own. </p><h2>  <strong>Demeter</strong> </h2><p>  Like other ancient goddesses of Greece, Demeter was responsible for a certain industry.  The Greeks worshiped her very much, as she sent down a good harvest.  Demeter was considered the <span>goddess of fertility.</span>  As a rule, she was depicted in a wreath of poppies or ears and in a long dress.  Another option was ears of corn or poppy heads in one hand, and a torch or sickle in the other.  Demeter's face was sad.  This is due to her periodic separation from her daughter Persephone, who was forced to descend to her husband in the underworld. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  <strong>Aphrodite</strong> </h2><p>  Even if the ancient goddesses of Greece didn’t talk much about any person, probably about everyone they heard about Aphrodite.  According to myths, she was the daughter of Uranus and was born in sea foam near Cyprus, which is why she was called Cyprus.  Aphrodite was a deity of the productive power of nature.  However, in later times, she was considered the daughter of Dione and Zeus and was the goddess of beauty, the personification of earthly love.  However, in ancient Greece, no difference was made between these deities.  In myths, Aphrodite is called the daughter of Zeus, and foamed.  Since she was the <span>goddess of beauty</span> and love, she was portrayed as slightly covered or completely naked.  All the <span>goddesses of Ancient Greece</span> had their <span>own</span> unique attributes <span>.</span>  Pictures with them can be seen in this publication.  The main attribute of Aphrodite’s images was nudity. </p><h2>  <strong>Athena Pallas</strong> </h2><p>  This goddess was Zeus's beloved daughter.  Athena is an ancient Mycenaean deity.  She was born from the head of the main <span>god Olympus.</span>  According to myths, the mind goddess Metis was pregnant from Zeus.  According to predictions, the child had to surpass his father with his soy force. </p>

However, the fetus did not die, but continued its development in the head of the main <span>god Olympus.</span>  Prometheus (Hephaestus, according to other sources) at the request of Zeus cut his head, from which Athena came out in full military equipment.  She controlled many areas of life and natural phenomena.  Athena commanded the heavenly elements, was a healer, a deity of fertility.  According to legend, it was she who taught people to tame horses and build houses.
