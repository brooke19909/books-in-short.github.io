    <h2>  Rides </h2><p>  A great place to relax and have fun is Chelyuskintsev Park <span>in Minsk.</span>  <span>The attractions</span> presented in it will appeal to both adults and kids.  There are a lot of them.  Let's look at them. </p><p>  Attraction "Gingerbread Man" was created for very brave personalities, as within three minutes you will find dizzying upheavals inside the wheel and in a circle. </p><p>  And what is the Ferris Wheel attraction?  This is a huge wheel, from the top of which you can see the whole beauty of the territory.  It has both closed and open cabins.  The first are for children under 14 years old, the second for adults. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Attraction "Jet" was created specifically for the smallest.  <span>This carousel</span> is an airplane that moves in a circle.  Any parent can ride with the baby to insure him. </p><p>  If the child is older than 4 years old, then he will be more interested in the attraction called "Mini-Jet."  This is an analogue of the previous carousel, but is designed for older children, there is a steering wheel with which you can adjust the height of the airplane, the flight speed is higher and you can shoot machine guns at enemies. </p><h2>  Entertainment for children and adults </h2><p>  In addition to the above attractions, there are others.  And which ones?  Let's look at them. </p><ul><li>  Attraction "Swallow".  The huge dinosaur opens its inflatable toothy mouth, swallows the cheerful kids and again releases them back. </li><li>  Attraction "Wave".  An inflatable slide, resembling a wave in its shape, is a rather dangerous slide. </li><li>  Trampoline.  Many people know about him, so he does not require a description. </li><li>  Attraction "Kangaroo", children call it "bungee".  The only drawback of this entertainment is the long lines in the evening and on weekends. </li><li>  "Electric car rental."  You can ride on such electric cars in two places in the Chelyuskintsev park: at the entrance to the park itself and in its center. </li><li>  Attraction "Autodrom".  Cars on this entertainment are rather slow and move for short distances, well suited for kids, adults will be more interested in a ride on the “High-Speed ​​Circuit”.  Its area is twice as large.  Cars move much faster and can make maneuvers. </li><li>  The Merry-Go-Round is a great carousel for the little ones.  Children will be able to ride on beautiful and bright horses. </li><li>  "Room of laughter."  A little-visited attraction in which you can look at yourself in curved mirrors. </li><li>  Attraction "Octopus" is clearly not for the faint of heart.  The tentacle booths will randomly move through the air. </li><li>  The Kolipso attraction operates on the principle of the previous carousel, but is intended for children. </li><li>  “Swan” - this carousel has one distinctive feature: if you press the up button, the swan breaks off so that the whole carousel shakes.  This oddity in the ride will add a thrill. </li></ul><h2>  "Flying" rides </h2>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  What else will Chelyuskintsev park please?  There is a fall tower attraction.  The name of the entertainment speaks for itself: the seats smoothly rise up, and then sharply fall down.  Delight and positive emotions are provided. </p><p>  Attraction "Bench" (flying).  Interesting enough entertainment for children and adults. </p><p>  Attraction "Waltz".  The booths are made in the shape of shells that spin in a waltz. </p><p>  The Flying Saucer ride is very similar to the Rook, it is breathtaking to ride, emotions overwhelm.  True, children under 8 years old are not allowed on it, and from 8 to 12 years old only riding with parents is allowed. </p><p>  Attraction "Clown".  Swing in the form of a clown twists sitting in it 360 degrees.  There is one relative drawback: the carousel freezes upside down for a sufficiently long period of time.  But this is not a problem for extreme lovers and youth. </p><p>  Attraction Super Nova.  This is the most “flashy” entertainment in the park.  People above 140 cm are allowed on it. </p><h2>  Other entertainments </h2><p>  Everyone can try himself as a shooter and visit one of the shooting ranges located in a huge park. </p><p>  There is also a playground.  It is designed for those who still can not ride the rides. </p><p>  Chelyuskintsev Park is equipped with small shops and eateries.  There are artists, they can draw a cartoon or a portrait, as well as a photographer who takes you with a white rabbit. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="amusement park chelyuskintsev in Minsk" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/993331.jpg" width="500"></div></h2><h2>  Chelyuskintsev Park: opening hours </h2><p>  State attractions begin to operate from 11:00, end at 20.00, and private attractions are open from 10.00-10.30 to 20.00-22.00 (depending on the type of carousel). </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Now you know what the Chelyuskintsev park in Minsk is, a photo of it is available for clarity in the article.  We hope you find the information useful. </p>
