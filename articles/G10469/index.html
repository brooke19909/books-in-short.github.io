One of the visitors tells an unpleasant story with a wounded child.  They family skied, and the tourist lost control.  As a result, a wound formed on the forehead of the baby, and therefore the parents immediately rushed to the base.  The guard refused to open the medical center, not paying attention not to the condition in which the child was.  He simply recommended looking for a coach to help in this situation.  The wound was dealt with by outsiders.  The problem is the lack of medical services at the ski base in Togliatti.  Where extreme entertainment is held, such a flaw should be addressed.  Another small drawback is the lack of asphalt tracks for visitors who train in the summer during skiing.  To do this, people have to use the usual city road. </p><div class="photo" data-original="samarasport.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ski resort address in Togliatti" class="if uuid-2419689" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2419689.jpg"></div><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Based on general impressions from all users, it can be concluded that the ski base in Togliatti is suitable for every sports enthusiast, without exception.
