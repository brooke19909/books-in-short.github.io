    <h2>  Is it difficult to get credit cards? </h2><p>  Many users may have a stereotype associated with opening and receiving a card at Sberbank.  According to them, this credit institution resembles an impregnable fortress.  Therefore, it‚Äôs rather difficult to arrange ‚Äúplastic‚Äù here.  But it is not so. </p><p>  For example, you need a credit card of Sberbank Gold.  To receive it, you just need to go to the official website of the bank and fill in the appropriate lines.  The banking service for activating cards located at any branded ATM works similarly.  Also, to get a credit card, you can always personally come to the nearest branch of this financial organization. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the application process, as a rule, you should agree with the processing of personal data, select the appropriate ‚Äúplastic‚Äù and specify the credit limit on a Sberbank card. </p>

    <h2>  What requirements does the bank make? </h2><p>  Despite the fact that you can get a credit card at Sberbank in just a few clicks, not everyone can do it.  In particular, in order to receive banking ‚Äúplastic‚Äù it is necessary to meet the following requirements: </p><ul><li>  Have citizenship of the Russian Federation. </li><li>  To fall into the age range from 21 years to 65 years. </li><li>  Possess temporary or permanent residence in Russia. </li><li>  Have a total work experience of at least 1 year in the previous 5 years, as well as work at least six months at the current place of work. </li></ul><p>  If you are interested in a Sberbank credit card, an online application will help you get it as soon as possible.  But for this it is worth knowing what information is indicated in this form. </p>

    <h2>  What documents are needed to get a credit card? </h2><p>  To fully register a credit card at Sberbank, you need to fill out an application and provide a standard package of documents, which includes: </p><ul><li>  Internal civil passport. </li><li>  Certificate of confirmation of income (in the form of 2-personal income tax or in a simplified form of the employer). </li><li>  Certificate indicating the amount of pension (for potential clients of pensioners). </li><li>  Copies and originals of documents confirming current labor activity (extracts from the labor book, copies of the contract or labor contract, etc.). </li></ul><p>  However, if you already have, for example, a salary card, the number of documents required for paperwork is sharply reduced.  So, you do not have to prove your income and take certificates from the place of work.  It remains only to fill out a questionnaire and discuss with the representative of the organization a credit limit on a Sberbank card, which can be from 20,000 to 500,000 rubles (depending on the card, this limit can also be increased). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  What credit cards can I get at the bank? </h2><p>  Currently, lovers of credit cards at Sberbank offer over 10 different offers.  For example, everyone can apply for premium bank cards with an impressive list of related services and an advantageous condition for their service.  This is exactly what the credit card of Sberbank "Visa Gold" is. </p><p><strong> </strong>  For its registration requires mandatory confirmation of the level of your income.  The interest rate on it is 23.9-27.9% per annum, and the credit limit is 600,000 rubles. </p><p>  This "plastic" is reliably protected by an electronic chip and is perfect for contactless purchases.  Such a Sberbank credit card is issued for 50 days, during which no interest should be paid.  However, after this period, interest will accrue taking into account the current tariff.  The card itself is issued for three years with the subsequent possibility of reissuing it. </p><p>  Among the Gold category, one can also find Give Life and Aeroflot credit cards.  In addition to them, the bank offers to issue cards of the Classic and Premium series.  There is also a Sberbank credit card with an instant solution.  This is not a nominal ‚Äúplastic‚Äù, which is issued and issued in just 10-15 minutes. </p>

    <h2>  What do users say about issuing a credit card? </h2><p>  Many users believe that it would be possible to greatly simplify the process of processing and issuing a Sberbank credit card.  In the reviews (whether it is worth opening it in a given financial institution, you decide) there are many conflicting points.  Because everyone makes a choice on their own.  Many of the reviews are connected with paperwork, which Sberbank still sins. </p><p>  The situation is different if you are already a client of this bank.  In this case, you do not need income certificates and copies of the work book.  In addition, regular customers of the bank can order a card online and, after waiting for confirmation by SMS, pick it up from a representative of the organization. </p><h2>  How long does a card take? </h2><p>  According to user stories, the very consideration of the application for a card takes no more than two days.  In rare cases, this period can be postponed for 7 working days.  The production time of the card also directly depends on the region where it needs to be delivered, and the types of "plastic".  For example, a credit card of Sberbank "Visa Gold" or a registered card can be made in 15-20 days. </p><p>  If there is no desire to wait for so long, there is always the opportunity to order an unnamed "plastic".  That's just most often user complaints are associated with such cards. </p><p>  This is also evidenced by numerous reviews.  The credit card of Sberbank (whether it is worth opening it or not, you can understand from the large number of user comments) without the initials of its holder received a huge number of complaints.  And the thing is that, although it is produced quickly, it has limited capabilities.  This is not like its holders. </p><h2>  Is it possible to get a credit card on preferential terms? </h2><p>  Whatever card you choose, users say, there is always a chance to improve the conditions for its design.  In particular, on preferential rights it‚Äôs realistic to get a bank ‚Äúplastic‚Äù under the following conditions: </p><ul><li>  If you are already a member of Sberbank's salary or pension project (you have salary or pension cards). </li><li>  If you had a debit card open. </li><li>  You have an open contribution to this financial institution. </li><li>  When registering and successfully repaying a current Sberbank consumer loan. </li></ul>

    <p>  As you can see, if at least one of these conditions is met, your Sberbank credit card is almost in your pocket for 50 days.  And you can get it on certain preferential terms.  We will tell about them further. </p><h2>  What do preferential terms suggest? </h2><p>  Under preferential conditions for obtaining a credit card, certain indulgences are meant, which the bank is ready to go for its regular customers.  So, you can count on a slight decrease in the interest rate, setting a personal credit limit (of course, in the direction of increasing it) and discounts on the annual service fee for your ‚Äúplastic‚Äù. </p><h2>  Convenience of operations on the card </h2><p>  Using Sberbank credit cards, many users talk about certain positive aspects.  For example, some of them admire the simplicity of using such a ‚Äúplastic."  With it, it‚Äôs quite simple to make purchases on the Web and real retail outlets.  Due to the large coverage and developed retail network, such cards are easy to replenish and cash. </p><p>  Moreover, many users like the cooperation of Sberbank with other organizations.  For example, Aeroflot.  According to the stories of many users who often buy tickets for this airline, it‚Äôs possible to save significantly due to accumulated points. </p><h2>  Sberbank credit card reviews: is it worth opening </h2><p>  At the moment, you can hear many different opinions in favor of opening credit cards and against them.  However, many reviews refer to a specific example or service of the bank.  For example, some users do not like the fact that withdrawing money from a Sberbank credit card <strong> </strong>  carried out taking into account a large commission.  Most often, the amount of such a fee is 2‚Äì3% of the amount (if cashing is done through the cash desk or ATM of Sberbank) and 4% (when withdrawing money from ATMs of other credit organizations). </p><p>  For the same reason, it is much more profitable not to withdraw money, but to make card payments by bank transfer.  No commission is charged for this.  Some people like having a fifty-day grace period when interest is not accrued.  However, its timing should be kept under strict control.  Otherwise, you run the risk of receiving not only penalties of the bank, but also a commission for late payment. </p><p>  Other users like the small, in their opinion, interest rate.  Although some still consider it slightly overpriced.  Still others compare a credit card with an ordinary bank loan with all the ensuing consequences.  Fourth talk about the possibility of re-issuing and ordering additional cards without commission.  Fifths like a pretty decent credit limit on cards, ranging from 200,000 to 600,000 rubles.  Here are such opinions about Sberbank credit cards. </p>
