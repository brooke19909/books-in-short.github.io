    <p>  Everything you need is present there, which is why it is comfortable and cozy. </p><p>  It is possible to rent a jet ski and the like, and while walking on a boat you can see many of Adler‚Äôs wonders.  Lovers of fresh fish should go fishing, and moreover, if paid separately, all fishing equipment can be given by the administrators of Barracuda Beach (Adler).  There are water slides, a tennis field and many more opportunities for active games, so children and adults are not bored there. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Central beach </h2><p>  The central beach of Adler is a small coastal area near the lighthouse.  The coast itself is pebbled, and the bottom has a smooth decline.  There are a lot of pluses: the railway is far away, but it is easy to get to the beach.  Available rental deck chairs, umbrellas and so on.  Barracuda Beach has the same advantage.  In the summer, trampolines are installed for children on a certain territory of the central coast.  But the free places are hard to find, because there is a lot of traffic, and many consider this a minus. </p>

    <h2>  Beaches of Adler </h2><p>  <em>"Gull"</em> </p><p>  Adler has the longest beach.  It is called the "Seagull."  It has a width of only 40 meters, but its length reaches almost a kilometer.  The shore is semi-sandy and semi-pebble, well-groomed.  "The Seagull" has its own peculiarity: sellers of freshly brewed coffee are located along the coast.  This can only be found on this beach.  Rescuers are on duty there regularly.  In the water there is a site that is fenced specifically for children, circles can be rented.  Also available is an amusement park. </p><p>  <em>"Twinkle"</em> </p><p>  The length of the beach "Spark" is in second place.  Its width is 40 meters and its length is 800. <span>Sochi Airport</span> is located a few kilometers away <span>.</span>  And on the other side of the beach there is a culture park and children's attractions.  It is very reminiscent of "The Seagull", so the government wants to bring them together, and everyone is interested in what it will be called. </p>

    <p>  <em>Lego</em> </p><p>  Tourists who come to Adler often look for less crowded beaches to enjoy the beauty of nature.  Then this option will become a find.  The beach got this name thanks to the constructor Lego due to its specific design.  Next to it is a botanical garden.  They mainly walk there, hiding from the hot sun. </p><h2>  Mandarin Beach </h2><p>  The Mandarin beach (Adler) does not belong to the resort, but the Mandarin entertainment center, and is considered the most expensive in the whole city.  And in terms of purity, it is compared with Barracuda.  But "Mandarin" also has a drawback: the water there is much colder than on other coasts of Adler.  And when it rains, <span>the Mzymta River</span> brings in dirt (often this happens closer to spring, but not in summer). </p><p>  Going to the city of Adler, you need to visit at least a few of these beaches.  Because, having got there, you find yourself in a fairy tale, which you would definitely like to repeat. </p>
