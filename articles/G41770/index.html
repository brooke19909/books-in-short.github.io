    <h2>  Where is the resort "Volginsky" and how to get to it </h2><p>  The health resort is located in the Vladimir region, near the border with Moscow.  Therefore, the journey from the capital does not take much time.  The resort is located in an ecologically clean area.  Nearby there is a pine forest, the clean river Volga flows (it is also called Volgina), which gave its name to the health resort.  She is the left tributary of the Klyazma.  One hundred and ten kilometers from the capital of Russia, 80 km from the MKAD, is where the Volginsky sanatorium (Vladimir region) is located.  How to get to the health resort from Moscow?  From the Kursk station, quite often trains leave for Nizhny Novgorod, Vladimir, Cheboksary.  Take the train to Pokrov station by train.  From the local station, take a taxi or city minibus to the place where the regular bus leaves for the village of Volginsky.  You need to get off at the "Department Store" stop.  You can get to Pokrov from the Moscow <span>bus station Schelkovsky.</span>  Then you will not need to travel around the city to take a flight to Volginsky.  Own vehicles from Moscow are easy to reach.  It is only necessary to taxi to the Moscow Ring Road and take the exit onto the highway to Nizhny Novgorod.  Having passed Pokrov, you should look for the road sign of the Federal State Institution "Center for Rehabilitation of the FSS of the Russian Federation" Volginsky "."  This is a left turn on the highway.  On this road to the resting place is only three kilometers.  If you move from the city of Vladimir, then along the highway Nizhny Novgorod - Moscow to the turn on "Volginsky" about 80 km. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sanatorium Volginsky Vladimir region" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1788619.jpg" width="600"></div>
