    <h2>  1. How to serve the ball </h2><p>  1.1.  Shortly before the start of the game, a draw is carried out using a coin tossed into the air.  The winning team is awarded the right to choose the initial pitch.  But this is not the only option.  In some cases, the command selects part of the field. </p><p>  1.2.  How is the initial feed?  It’s just that any player in the second line introduces the ball into the game. </p><p>  1.3.  The team that needs to complete the first serve must make sure that the opponents are ready for the start of the match.  This is a prerequisite. </p><p>  1.4.  Goals scored by any team immediately after the start by the players of the second line cannot be scored.  It is fundamentally.  Before a hit occurs, it is necessary that the ball touches any player of a team, with the exception of those in the second line.  Only under these conditions will the goal be recognized as valid.  It is not enough to simply know the meaning of the word “kicker”.  You must also follow these simple rules. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  1.5.  After the score is opened, the ball should go to the team whose goal it was scored.  Next, any player in the second line enters </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kicker rules" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18955/406397.jpg" width="200"></div>  him into the game.

    <h2>  2. How to pass the ball? </h2><p>  2.1.  The most important rule.  The ball located in the second-line players cannot be transferred immediately after the filing of those in the third line.  This item cannot be ignored.  First, it is necessary that he hit at least two players on the second line.  Also, during the transfer, it must roll. </p><p>  2.2.  During the competition, it is necessary that the ball moves exclusively under the pins with the players.  He should not fly over them.  Even such an opportunity should be excluded. </p><p>  2.3.  A ball that is outside the playing space after a pass or a kick by a player must be brought into play by an opponent on the defense line.  All these kicker rules are easy enough to remember.  Even a beginner will cope with this task. </p><h2>  3. Account Rules </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="senior kicker" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/408168.jpg" width="510"></div></h2><p>  3.1.  Goals are valid at any time <br>  if the attack is carried out by football players of the first (in other words, defenders) and third line (namely, attackers).  It can also be produced by the goalkeeper. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  3.2.  A goal is deemed valid upon a hit by second-line players, but all of the above conditions must be met. </p><p>  3.3.  Suppose the ball flew into the goal and rolled back.  In this case, the goal is considered valid.  Then the ball goes to the team that scored it.  This rule must be strictly observed. </p><p>  3.4.  As for the qualifying matches of the tournament, they will draw seven goals. </p><h2>  4. Deadband Rules </h2><p>  4.1.  Suppose the ball has completely stopped spinning and rolling, but at the same time, both teams cannot reach it with any of their players.  In this case, it is believed that he was in the dead zone. </p><p>  4.2.  There is one situation when the ball passes to the defense.  This happens when he is in the dead zone between the first line and the goalkeeper.  This rule cannot be ignored. </p><p>  4.3.  In the event that the ball is in the dead zone on any part of the field between the first lines of the players, it passes to the team that introduced it to the game the previous time.  In this situation, the match is resumed, however, it is necessary that everything complies with the rules set out in section 1.5. </p><h2>  Kicker championship </h2><p>  There are different players in the world.  <span>They</span> can easily reproach someone for their addiction to <span>drinking establishments</span> , while others, on the contrary, will only be praised for it.  As it’s not very difficult to guess, we are talking about kicker players.  Recently, an international championship in this sport was held.  Kicker is always fun and great.  Athletes are well aware of this. </p>

    <p>  Probably, many will be surprised to learn this, but the kicker has certain similarities to tennis: championships from the "masters" category are the most responsible, gaming tables have several covers, instead of games they use the word "sets".  Such an event was held recently in the northern capital.  The player Franco Delleani, who lives in Italy, is in a sense dissatisfied with his homeland - he is not satisfied with the kicker rules that are widespread there.  He likes Russia more.  Kicker is his meaning of life.  Many beginners think that the phrase “senior kicker” refers to this game.  This is actually not the case.  It refers to poker and means cards that differ from those of the opponent in the formation of a game combination. </p>

Although in order to win in Russian competitions you need to have enormous potential, he is more than happy with everything.

    <p>  In the domestic kicker, it is girls who show themselves as really strong players.  They occupy a high step in the world ranking.  These are truly experienced and strong athletes.  This is explained by the fact that girls are more fond of traveling.  It should be noted that for some, the kicker is just an excuse to see the world.  Well, maybe there’s nothing wrong with that. </p><p>  Alexandra Krasnitskaya, who won the domestic kicker championship two years ago, shared her observations.  She said that the fair sex, unlike men, is quite easy to climb.  They often participate in international competitions.  And men prefer not to go abroad. </p>
