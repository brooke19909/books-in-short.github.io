The food in them is fresh and tasty, the portions are large.  The prices are low. </p><p>  Pebble beach with sand islands.  The entrance to the water is uniform and gentle.  Waves are rare.  In summer, beautiful weather almost always reigns.  The bright sun shines, and a light breeze blows from the sea.  There are changing cabins, showers and toilets on the shore.  They close after 18:00.  Lanterns next to the bistro and bars are open all night.  Sounds loud music.  Vacationers disperse only closer to the morning. </p><h2>  Neighborhood </h2><p>  In Kemer (Turkey) Nar Hotel 3 * (Kemer center) is located on one of the busiest streets.  It is replete with taverns, pubs and culinary.  The most popular among tourists is Lavash Kebab.  Meat and fish appetizers are prepared in the bistro according to the recipes of European and Turkish cuisines.  Leon is a restaurant.

    <p>  Judging by the photo of Nar Hotel 3 * (Kemer), which were made by vacationers, the hotel is clean.  The staff zealously watches the garden, which is located on site.  Housekeepers order the rooms every day.  Change bath towels on demand. Bed linen - once a week.  But travelers complain about the indifference of the reception staff. </p><p>  It should be late for fifteen minutes, as food will be denied.  This also applies to those arriving at the hotel from the airport.  As a result, tired tourists are forced to independently look for a dining room outside the hotel and eat at their own expense.  Refrigerators on the day of arrival often did not have the promised water bottles.  There was no plastic furniture on the balcony. </p><p>  The hotel experienced power outages.  They turned off hot and cold water.  Air conditioning needed repair, and therefore could not cope with the heat of the day.  The rooms were stuffy and hot even late at night.  Since the beach is common, in August it lacked not only sun loungers, but also space in the sand. </p><p>  The food in the restaurant, they say, was scarce.  For breakfast, boiled eggs and boiled eggs were served day after day.  There were no sweets and pastries.  On a fruit plate was only a watermelon.  A standard dinner is a piece of stewed chicken with stewed vegetables.  All wines and juices were not natural, but powdered.  Sausage made from soy. </p>

    <h2>  Recommendations </h2><p>  If you are offered a room in which someone already lives, and they promise a subsequent resettlement, do not agree.  This is a hotel administration ploy.  No one will provide a separate room.  They won‚Äôt even give a discount.  So claim what you paid for. </p><p>  Want to use a deck chair?  Come to the beach by 08:00.  Already at 09:00 everything will be busy.  Umbrellas are four times less than sun beds.  Many tents are dirty and dusty.  The staff does not care about visitors at all. </p><p>  Rumor has it that the hotel is on a long-term lease from immigrants from Russia.  Therefore, the service in it is very different from the service in other Turkish hotels.  Local travelers are strongly advised not to let children into the pool for travelers with children.  The aquazone is not cleaned, and the water does not go through the disinfection procedure. </p>
