This German ancient feudal family, dating back to 829 and ruled Bavaria from the 13th century until 1918, owned the castle, the construction of which began in the 14th century and continued throughout all 700 years of rule.  During this time, the largest palace complex in Europe grew out of it, and if you decide what to see in Munich in 2 days, then it is better to stock up with a ticket for at least a week.  It is unlikely that they will be able to quickly explore the whole complex, even if they are there from morning to evening. </p><h2>  Five stages of construction </h2><p>  Neuveste is a castle that became the basis of the future palace complex.  Back in 1385, when its construction began, no one could have imagined that every elector and king of Bavaria would consider it his duty to contribute to the process of erecting a dynastic castle. </p><p>  In total there are 5 stages of construction, the result of which was the Munich residence of Wittelsbach: </p><p>  1. After the construction of Neuveste, the next major construction was started by the Duke Albrecht V (1550-1579), during whose reign the Antiquary was erected, which housed the then-largest collection of works of art and relics of antiquity, and the Ballroom, which was not preserved until of our days. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Munich residence" class="if" height="232" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/1740123.jpg" width="600"></div>

The second stage was carried out by decree of William V (1579-1597), thanks to which the Antiquary was decorated and equipped, a courtyard with a grotto and a house with a black hall appeared.  At the same time, the heir‚Äôs chambers and the widow‚Äôs rooms were not preserved. </p><p>  3. In the third stage, thanks to Maximilian I (1598-1651), the Munich residence almost acquired the form that it has now.  During this period were built: </p><ul><li>  Chapel and luxurious chapel. </li><li>  Palace of the emperor and apartments maid of honor. </li><li>  Charlotte corridor, papal rooms and a palace park founded. </li></ul><p>  4. At the fourth stage, the Munich residence (Munich, Residenzstrasse, 1) gained royal luxury thanks to Elector Karl Albrecht, who wanted to become emperor of the Holy Roman Empire.  From 1690 to 1755, the palace was replenished with the Gallery of Ancestors, Luxurious Rooms, the Cabinet of Miniatures and the Cuvilliers Theater. </p><p>  5. The fifth stage is the final decoration of the palace, which today is known as the Munich residence.  From 1817 to 1842 the following were built: </p><ul><li>  Riding school. </li><li>  Royal Theater and National Theater. </li><li>  Church of All Saints, Hall of the Nibelungs and royal chambers. </li><li>  Summer and Winter Gardens (not preserved). </li></ul><p>  The beginning of the 20th century was marked by the holding of heating and electricity in the palace complex "Munich Residence". </p><h2>  From the palace to the museum </h2><p>  When in 1918, Bavaria was declared a free state and control from the Wittelsbach royal family passed to the people's parliament, the last reigning king Ludwig III left the residence, and in 1920 it became a museum. </p><p>  Due to the hostilities of 1944, the complex was badly damaged, but was completely restored by 1979. Today, many tourists, deciding what to see in Germany, go to the hospitable Bavaria, famous for its magnificent beer and the residence of the ancient kings. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Courtyards </h2><p>  After almost 700 years of construction, 10 courtyards appeared in the Wittelsbach palace complex: </p><ul><li>  A pharmacy courtyard was erected on the site of the first ancestral castle of Neuveste at the beginning of the XIX century. </li><li>  The court of the emperor, built under Maximilian I, was divided into 2 parts: guest rooms (Trier and Stone) and the main imperial part for ceremonies. </li><li>  The courtyard with a chapel is located near the building of the same name. </li></ul>

    <p>  In the Treasury you can see <span>luxury goods</span> and jewels of the Wittelsbach dynasty.  Crowns of representatives of different generations, jewelry, which are a work of art, church golden utensils - all this opens the Munich residence to people today.  Opening hours of the Treasury, as well as the entire residence, are daily from 9:00 to 18:00. </p><p>  The antiquary, former under Albrecht IV, by decree of which it was built by the hall for antique sculptures, was subsequently rebuilt into the Banquet.  This is how he appears today to travelers. </p><h2>  Imperial Hall and Ancestral Gallery </h2><p>  Kings and emperors at all times loved magnificent celebrations and solemn events.  The hall for such ceremonies was built under Maximilian I and appears before the guests of the palace in all its glory of its painted walls and ceiling. </p><p>  The Ancestral Gallery looks no less impressive.  Here are collected portraits of all 121 representatives of the Wittelsbach family, starting from Charlemagne, who began this branch.  Karl Albrecht, who created this monument to his ancestors, showed Europe of the 18th century and perpetuated the history of dynastic ties of a kind with the representatives of other royal families. </p>

    <p>  An indelible impression in the memory is left by noble faces looking from these portraits at modern people from the height of their position. </p><h2>  Halls of the complex </h2><p>  If you decide what to see in Germany, you should pay attention to the halls of the Wittelsbach royal residence.  Such a luxury can be seen at Versailles, and it is surprising that they were all used for their intended purpose. </p><p>  There were halls for audiences, separate for balls or celebrations.  Meeting rooms, bedchairs, guest rooms and archbishops - they are all trimmed either with gold or precious woods with the luxury peculiar exclusively to kings. </p>

    <p>  Perhaps the only room that was not used for its intended purpose is the State bedroom.  It was built and luxuriously tidied in the French manner, but not a single king of Bavaria ever slept in it.  Rather, it was a demonstration of eminent wealth, but the modest Bavarian kings did not adopt the habit of the French king to go to bed and wake up in the presence of the courtiers. </p><h2>  Residence Expositions </h2><p>  In addition to visiting the luxurious halls, parks, gardens and courtyards, guests of the complex can visit permanent exhibitions.  The most striking among them are: </p><ul><li>  The porcelain collection is perhaps the most extensive of all, as it contains not only German-made products, but also masters from France, Japan and China.  Sets of 700 items or individual plates, porcelain paintings or figurines - all this amazes with a variety of colors, graceful forms and fragile beauty. </li></ul>
