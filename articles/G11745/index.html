    <h2>  Features of the location of the complex </h2><p>  This hotel is built on a cape in Chalong Bay.  Here is, among other things, the main port of Phuket.  In relation to city infrastructure, the Panwa Beach Resort 4 * hotel is located very well.  In Chalong Bay, several large shopping centers popular with tourists and many shops specializing in the sale of utensils, clothes, souvenirs, etc., have been built. </p><p>  There are many shopping centers in Panva, but, unfortunately, there are no catering establishments on this cape.  Vacationers staying at a hotel can only eat in other areas of Phuket. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Chalong Bay is located on the first coastline.  However, unfortunately, this does not give special advantages to lovers of sunbathing and swimming in the sea, staying at this hotel.  The fact is that the sea in Chalong Bay is very muddy.  At the same time, a truly huge number of fishing boats are sailing here.  That is, swimming in this place is simply uncomfortable.  But Chalong Bay is very popular among scuba diving enthusiasts.  In the sea, the sea lives a lot of outlandish fish and other marine life. </p>

But of course, in addition to the pool, parking, shops, spa, etc., there is also a restaurant on the territory of this complex.  The cooks at the hotel cook, according to many tourists, just great.  Local masters easily manage to please both Asian vacationers and European.  And the tastes of such tourists with regard to food, as you know, pretty much diverge.  Even a standard Thai omelet for breakfast, local chefs prepare, as tourists note, in a special way.  They turn fried eggs into a tube and put cheese in it.

At low tide, in order to get to the depths, tourists have to go in shallow water already for buoys.  At the same time, special shoes should be worn on the feet. </p><p>  On the hotel‚Äôs beach, tourists can rent a kayak, among other things.  On it you can swim to small islands in the sea.

    <h2>  When is the best time to come to a hotel? </h2><p>  The beach season in Phuket lasts all year round.  In principle, you can visit this resort whenever you want.  But the best thing, of course, is to come here in high season.  This period lasts in Thailand from November to May.  At this time, the country stops raining, and the temperature of the water in the sea becomes as comfortable as possible. </p><p>  But in any case, vacationers, of course, can visit Phuket in the low season.  This will save them money.  For example, in October, the weather in Phuket usually already costs very good.  It rains here infrequently at this time.  The prices for accommodation during this period in resort hotels, including Panwa Beach, are slightly lower than in high season. </p><p>  The weather in Phuket in October, therefore, is usually sunny.  The average temperature during the day is 28 ¬∞ C. The water in the sea warms up to 29 ¬∞ C. In the high season, these figures are 27 and 28 ¬∞ C, respectively. That is, you can rest in the middle of autumn at Cape Panva no worse than, for example, in winter . </p>
