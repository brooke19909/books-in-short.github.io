  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Insurance forms</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many relate to insurance with irony.  And in vain.  Insurance services offered to citizens make life much easier by guaranteeing compensation for unforeseen incidents and unfortunates.  To the question: "What do you insure against?"  agents with a smile reply: "From everything."  And indeed: you can insure absolutely everything, starting with your own life and business, ending with your favorite dog. </p><p>  Insurance forms are divided by law into two main ones: <span>voluntary insurance</span> and compulsory. </p><p>  Let's start with the required.  It is impossible to refuse this form of insurance.  The initiator here is the state, obliging both legal entities and individuals to contribute a certain amount, which goes to ensure the interests of the public.  An example is a bus or train ticket: insurance is already included in its price.  If, God forbid, something happens to you on the road, you will be able to make a complaint to the carrier, and he will be obliged, after consideration of the case, to repair the damage.  But in general, the amount "withdrawn" from you when buying a ticket goes to the above-mentioned public interests.  Using the mandatory form of insurance, the state protects both each individual insured and the whole society.  Legislative acts work here, providing for objects subject to this particular type of insurance;  amount of responsibility;  security standards (listing the obligations and rights of the parties);  tariff rates of payments, etc. The law defines the <span>insurance companies</span> involved in compulsory insurance. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition to this form of insurance, there is also another, voluntary, which is a closed account of damages between members of the community, with established legal norms.  The initiators here are individuals and legal entities, business entities.  The main feature of this form of social insurance is voluntariness, confirmed by the contract between the insurer and the insured.  Usually an intermediary acts between them (broker, or agent).  All the nuances are reflected in the insurance policy.  <span>The regulatory framework</span> is created by insurance legislation.  The conditions and rules developed by the insurer must be licensed by state supervisory authorities. </p><p>  Voluntary insurance, unlike compulsory insurance, has, first of all, certain terms, which should be accurately reflected in the concluded contract (the responsibility lies with the insurer only for the specified period).  The contract is concluded only in writing and takes effect after payment of a certain amount <span>(insurance premium).</span>  It should be noted: long-term insurance is associated with regular cash contributions (quarterly, monthly) and expires if contributions are not paid.  <span>Personal insurance,</span> as well as <span>property insurance,</span> is part of legal relations (civil) and is included in reimbursable contractual obligations.  According to the agreement, one party pays a certain amount of contributions, and the other is obliged to provide insurance services (if necessary, to compensate for the consequences of insured events). </p><p>  Insurance can be mutual, joint-stock, cooperative and state. </p><p>  A special form is medical insurance, the purpose of which is to guarantee medical care (according, again, to the insured event).  Assistance is provided through the savings funds of the municipal and state health systems.  The subjects of insurance are the insured, the insurer and medical institutions (clinics, hospitals, etc.). </p><p>  Another independent industry is fire insurance, carried out in two main forms (voluntary and compulsory, carried out by enterprises and foreign legal entities engaged in entrepreneurial activities).  The conditions and procedure for insurance are established by the law of the Federation. </p>
