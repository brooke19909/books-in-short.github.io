What to see in France</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  France is a transcontinental state, the capital is Paris.  About 67 million people live in the country (including the population of the colonies).  Religion is Catholicism. </p><p>  But above all, France is the birthplace of Napoleon, a country with a revolutionary and romantic spirit, with many ancient monuments, the erection of which falls on different periods of the development of civilization. </p><p>  If you do not take Paris into account as the main attraction of France, then the country still has many interesting places: <span>Cote d'Azur,</span> Aquitaine, Languedoc-Roussillon, Provence and others.  There are approximately 5 thousand palace and castle complexes in the country. </p><h2>  10 most visited places of the country </h2><p>  Almost every person in the world seeks to see these sights of France.  And these are really not just popular tourist brands, but unique places and objects. </p><p>  <em>Eiffel Tower</em> </p><p>  Without it, it is already difficult to imagine Paris, although at the time of construction almost the entire population of the city was against its construction.  Even Maupassant and Hugo demanded to remove the structure from the city.  20 years after the construction of the facility, plans appeared for the demolition of the tower, but officials, considering the commercial component, refused to demolish it, because the construction was already a huge success. </p><p>  To date, the tower is the tallest building in the capital and the fifth largest architectural structure in the whole country. </p><p>  <em><span>Chambord Castle</span></em> </p><p>  A grand and extravagant castle complex, a monument of the Renaissance.  There is an opinion that the sketches of the project were created by Leonardo da Vinci. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <em>Mont Saint Michel</em> </p><p>  A natural monument located in Normandy and listed by UNESCO.  This is a unique combination of the sea coast and rocks, a piece of paradise cut off from the outside world by high tides.  The top of the cliff is crowned by the monastery of St. Michael. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wallpaperstudio10.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mont Saint Michel" class="if uuid-2383873" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2383873.jpg"></div><p>  <em>Chantin Castle</em> </p><p>  Despite the fact that the building did not receive such popularity as the Louvre, a collection of paintings is collected here, the second after the Louvre in importance. </p><p>  <em>Princely Palace, Monaco</em> </p><p>  To this day, it is the current princely residence of the rulers of Monaco - Grimaldi - and so has been going on for 700 years. </p><p>  The fortress was built in 1197.  It was periodically completed and strengthened in order to defend itself, if necessary, from the attack of a more powerful neighbor, France. </p><div class="photo" data-original="journeyaroundtheglobe.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Princely Palace of Monaco" class="if uuid-2383815" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2383815.jpg"></div><p>  <em>The louvre museum</em> </p><p>  The largest and most famous art museum in the world.  The number of visitors per year is simply amazing: in 2014 alone, 9.26 million people visited it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This is 160.1 thousand m <sup>2 of</sup> various expositions on the territory of the ancient palace.  The museum collection contains works from all over the world, from different eras and directions. </p><p>  <em>Disneyland Paris</em> </p><p>  What to see in France except paintings and castles?  You can go to Disneyland.  It is located 43 kilometers from the capital, in the city of Marne-la-Valais.  Opened it in 1992.  In the park, there is similarity with the California prototype.  There are 5 thematic zones, and in the center is Sleeping Beauty Castle.  For lazy visitors, a train is provided that travels slowly around the entire territory. </p><p>  <em>Versailles</em> </p><p>  This is a magnificent palace and park complex, built by Louis XIV.  The ensemble is a vivid expression of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãabsolutism.  Already from the end of the 17th century, the palace became the standard for creating residences of monarchs throughout Europe.  Now it‚Äôs not the royal chambers, but a museum where the doors are always open for visitors. </p><p>  The palace signed many significant documents for the country and the world, even an agreement to end the war for American independence in 1783, an agreement to end the First World War. </p><p>  <em>National Center for Arts and Culture.</em>  <em>Georges Pompidou</em> </p><p>  This is a huge cultural center with an exhibition of paintings and works of contemporary artists, a rich library, concert and exhibition halls. </p><p>  <em>Pere Lachaise Cemetery</em> </p><p>  This is a legendary burial place, which is one of the most intriguing sights of France.  Simple and famous people are buried here.  People come here not only to honor the memory of those who have gone to another world, but also walk, as in a park, with children and even have picnics. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In fact, the language does not dare to call ‚ÄúPere Lachaise‚Äù a cemetery, it is a real bright park with a huge number of monuments. </p><p>  Here they found the last refuge of Honore de Balzac, Edith Piaf and other world celebrities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripondemand.io" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pere Lachaise Cemetery" class="if uuid-2383818" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2383818.jpg"></div><h2>  Bordeaux </h2><p>  To fully experience the charm and all the charm of the country, it will not be enough to examine only the top places and see the visiting card of France. </p><p>  The city of Bordeaux is the world-recognized capital of winemaking.  Tourists are offered to visit production facilities, cellars and, of course, taste real wine. </p><p>  In addition, Bordeaux is a port city, interesting for its history, in which there are 362 monuments.  It is imperative to walk along the largest square in all of Europe - Quincones (126 thousand square meters <sup>)</sup> and look at the longest pedestrian street in France - named after St. Catherine.  The city has many ancient buildings: the Bolshoi Theater (XVIII century), St. Andre Cathedral, the old part of which dates from the XI century.  You can visit the base of German submarines, which has been preserved since the Second World War.  The city has many museums, the most popular being the Museum of Fine Arts with paintings by Rubens and Titian. </p><h2>  Nantes </h2><p>  This city is an unusual attraction in France.  Here in a short time you can move from one era to another.  See the historical development of the country from the 15th century to the present, just walking along the streets.  Recommended places to visit: Castle of the Dukes of Breton, Dobre Museum and Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thecrazytourist.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="City of Nantes" class="if uuid-2383822" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2383822.jpg"></div><h2>  Biarritz </h2><p>  This is the real capital of surfing the country.  If you do not know where to go in France, except Paris, and love water sports, then you need to go to Biarritz.  In the evening there are many noisy and fun parties.  There are many golf clubs and sports complexes in the city, so everyone who comes here has a great opportunity to lose extra pounds and have a great time. </p><p>  There are many museums in Biarritz; be sure to go to the lighthouse, which not everyone decides to climb.  After all, it is 248 steps.  The height of the lighthouse is 73 meters. </p><p>  The Imperial Chapel, built in 1864, is very beautiful.  You can visit the Orthodox Church (1892), the icons of which were brought from St. Petersburg.  Visit the Museum of Chocolate and the Museum of the Sea with thousands of species of inhabitants of the water element. </p><h2>  Toulouse </h2><p>  What to see in France?  Fans of aviation and astronautics can go to Toulouse, where the best museum in Europe dedicated to this area of ‚Äã‚Äãhuman activity is located. </p><p>  In the city there are also ancient monuments: the Cathedral of Saint-Etienne, the Basilica of Saint-Sernin, the Palace of Asses and others. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.renfe-sncf.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Toulouse city" class="if uuid-2383869" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2383869.jpg"></div><h2>  Nice </h2><p>  Writing a description of the sights of France - Nice - is very difficult.  This city on the azure coast of the Mediterranean Sea, among the Alpine mountains, is attractive no less than the Eiffel Tower.  But as experienced tourists say, there are several places in the city that everyone should visit when they come here for the first time.  This is the flower market Cours Saleya, the ancient Roman ruins and the Matisse Museum, the Promenade des Anglais and <span>the Marc Chagall Museum.</span> </p><p>  Oddly enough, excursions in France, including a visit to Nice, involve a visit to the Russian Orthodox Cathedral of St. Nicholas (1902-1912).  It would seem, from where?  And everything is very simple: there is a very large Russian diaspora. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ge.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nice resort" class="if uuid-2383853" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2383853.jpg"></div><h2>  Montpellier </h2><p>  It is believed that this is a youth city.  Indeed, it is developing dynamically and offers many opportunities.  Tourists also have something to see here - the old part of the city, separated from the modern pedestrian alley.  The city has a unique Fabre Museum, in it you can see the canvases of great creators - Matisse, Rubens, Renoir, Brueghel and others.  Here is the beautiful cathedral and the Triumphal Gate of Peyrou.  There are many picturesque lakes in the area, and not far from the Mediterranean Sea. </p><h2>  Avignon </h2><p>  Many reviews about France leave tourists who visited the small town of Avignon.  They say that this place is fascinating from the first second.  The central part is completely surrounded by a high fence.  It was built in the XIV century.  You can enter the old city exclusively through one of the eight gates.  Inside the city there is the Papal Palace, which must be visited.  Such a grandiose construction is due to the fact that in the Middle Ages this city was the Catholic capital, and the popes lived here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wanderlust.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Avignon city" class="if uuid-2383861" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2383861.jpg"></div><h2>  Lyon </h2><p>  Many people who have been to Lyon recommend giving him at least a couple of days.  This is a very colorful village, with old quarters that are completely different from each other.  By the way, the old part of the city is on the UNESCO list.  And not in vain, because these lovely streets have not changed their appearance since the Renaissance.  In addition, the city is the capital of Interpol.  It is recommended to visit the Tet d'Or Park, the Amphitheater of the three Gallias, Lyon Cathedral and Croix-Russ. </p><h2>  Lille </h2><p>  This is a small town on the border with Belgium, so they often come here to get to this country.  Although Lille has a lot of interesting places: the Charles de Gaulle House Museum, Notre-Dame-de-la-Trey, the Botanical Garden and the Lille Stock Exchange. </p><p>  And of course, what France is without the Champs Elysees and the Arc de Triomphe.  Seeing them, we can say with confidence: "Yes, I was in France!" </p>
