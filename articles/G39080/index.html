The user comes to the store, selects a model and, having installed a SIM card, can use it right away.  But in this case, the phone will cost you a little more from the initial cost.  If you buy the device directly from the manufacturer, then you may have to ‚Äúsweat‚Äù to set it up correctly and learn how to <span>install the Play Market</span> on Meizu. </p><h2>  Manufacturer </h2><p>  Today we will deal with <span>Meizu smartphones.</span>  This international Chinese company has been operating since 2003 and produces not only smartphones, but also various other digital electronic devices.  Over the past few years, she has managed to break out into a leading position. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to install play market on meizu" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1876487.jpg"></div>

    <p>  For four years, the manufacturer created players, among which were quite popular Meizu E3 models.  Since 2008, began to produce smartphones.  For a long time no one took them seriously.  Still, competing with Nokia, Samsung or Sony was extremely difficult. </p><h2>  Interface </h2><p>  You may have a question how to install the Play Market on Meizu if the phone is purchased in China.  For example, very often users order a smartphone on foreign resources.  This usually comes out cheaper.  Depending on the cost, you can save up to $ 300.  But first, let's look at the Meizu smartphone interface to understand what tools you can use to install the Play Market. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By April 2017, Meizu models should be updated to version Flyme OS 6. But so far not all devices do this.  Even some of the latest M5 Note models still work with OS 5.2.  Therefore, consider the interface with the shell of this version. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to install play market on meizu m3" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1876486.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  So, if you don‚Äôt go into the details of what the lock screen, desktop, and so on looks like, since it has nothing to do with how to install the Play Market on Meizu M3, then it‚Äôs better to pay attention to the software. </p><p>  There are few regular software.  They are all very easy to use, there are no intricate animations or anything else.  This is exactly what the developers wanted to achieve.  The "calendar" turned out to be much simpler than the "Google" counterpart.  Simple and explorer for searches in the system.  The Gallery is also minimalistic, but it shows pictures - and this is the main thing. </p><p>  The "alarm clock" hides in itself not only the setting of the time of awakening, but also the clock, world time and stopwatch.  I was pleased with the "Calculator" because it received additional functions for converting currencies.  In general, everything is really simple, so some may find it boring.  The Flyme shell allows the user to independently configure and install everything that he wants.  But for this he will need the Play Market.  How to install this program on Meizu M3s, we will consider further. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Play market </h2><p>  To be more precise, the software is called Google Play, but until 2008 there was the Android Market.  Hence, such a collective name among the people.  This is a store where you can install games and applications.  They immediately download books and movies, music, widgets, themes, etc. The store is available to all users of smartphones with the Android operating system. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meizu m3 note install play market" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1876481.jpg"></div>

    <p>  To install this service, you can apply two methods.  One involves the use of the built-in installer, the other - downloading the APK-file.  Together with these methods, we learn about some errors that may occur in the user's path. </p><h2>  Built-in installer </h2><p>  This is the easiest way that does not require incredible efforts from you.  Simply enough on the desktop to find a shortcut with the name "Best", or Hot Apps.  It can be said that this is a proprietary Google Play analogue from Meizu.  If you do not like the Play Market, you can use this software to install games and applications.  In general, there is the same choice of software. </p><p>  The label is blue in the middle of which is a white flame.  Click it, and you will see a list of the most popular applications.  Here we select Google Services and install it.  Remember that you need an internet connection to download.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter if it is a wireless connection or a mobile network.  The file weighs 4 MB, so it won‚Äôt require a lot of traffic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  This method is also convenient because after installing this application, the system will ask you to restart your device (M3 or Meizu M5 Note).  How to install Play Market after reboot?  After turning on the phone, you will see the Google Play shortcut on your desktop.  The installer can now be deleted, it will no longer be useful to you.  Unless, if the store will "lag."  Then using Google Services it‚Äôs easy to reinstall it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meizu u10 how to install play market" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1876484.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Download APK </h2><p>  Of course, this rarely happens, but maybe your phone does not want to work with Google Services.  There is another way to install the app store on your smartphone.  In this case, you will have to use a personal PC.  The method involves downloading the installer file to the computer and transferring it to the phone‚Äôs memory. </p><p>  First you need to find "Play Market" on the Internet.  This is not difficult to do.  It can be installed from many sites, and it is absolutely safe.  Then you need to connect the device to the PC.  Now we download the downloaded file to the smartphone system.  You can make it easy to find, create a special folder for this.  Or use Download.  This folder contains all downloaded files. </p><p>  Then you can turn off the smartphone.  Now, for the system to give us a chance to install the APK file, we need to allow this process to happen.  We click on the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù label, in them we are looking for the ‚ÄúSecurity‚Äù section.  There is a line ‚ÄúUnknown sources‚Äù.  You need to allow the phone to install software from the store. </p><p>  Then everything is simple.  We find the file thrown from the PC in the folder and click on it.  The store will automatically install.  If you didn‚Äôt succeed right away, then try to find a couple more files.  Perhaps you are installing a corrupted APK. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meizu m3 mini how to install play market" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1876488.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Renouncement </h2><p>  Knowing how to install the Play Market on Meizu is half the battle.  It happens that some knowledge is not enough.  Google Play applications may not be downloaded.  To do this, you can try to go to "Settings", find the "Applications" tab there.  You will see a list of different files.  Here we find the line with "Device Manager". </p><p>  There will be a lot of information in the window that opens.  Here it is advisable not to touch anything superfluous.  You need to find the line ‚ÄúMemory‚Äù and, on the contrary, click ‚ÄúErase data‚Äù.  Now we return to the store and try again to install the desired application. </p><h2>  Second account </h2><p>  Other errors may occur with your M5 or Meizu M3 Note.  Installing the Play Market is generally easy.  But the mistakes that meet him are not always easy to solve.  If you can‚Äôt install software, but the previous option doesn‚Äôt help, you can try another solution. </p><p>  Create another account.  Go to "Settings", then to "Accounts", here we add a new one for Google.  This is not difficult to do.  But if suddenly you do not know how to create it yourself, just enter your mail and password.  You may need to confirm the creation of a new profile in the mail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to install play market on meizu m3s" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1876483.jpg"></div>

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Now open the "Play Market".  In the application, you need to switch the old account to the created one.  Now you can try to install any application or game.  If all is well, switch to the old profile.  The store must be restored, and all the software can be installed again.  If you do not need a newly created account, you can return and delete it or leave it for such cases. </p><h2>  Updates </h2><p>  There were other problems with the M3, M5 or Meizu U10.  How to install the Play Market is already clear.  But how to cope with all his mistakes is unclear.  Fortunately, developers are trying to find solutions to such problems.  Last year, an update appeared for Flyme, which did not allow the launch of ‚ÄúPlay Market‚Äù if the smartphone did not have a SIM card.  After that, an ‚Äúupdate‚Äù came out, which made it possible to correct errors associated with the installation using the mobile network.  So there was a method with the "Erase Data", which was mentioned earlier. </p><p>  Updates often brought with them new problems.  Those who don‚Äôt have ‚ÄúGoogle services‚Äù after buying a smartphone began to have difficulties installing them.  These errors could not be solved using the built-in installer.  Therefore, it was necessary to use only APK files.  Some users just needed to <span>update the Play Market.</span> </p><h2>  Extreme case </h2><p>  Problems are encountered with different models, including the Meizu M3 Mini.  How to install the Play Market, the owners of this model also want to know.  If all of the above methods did not suit you, you will have to use the extreme method.  In general, there are two of them.  But one is safe and suitable even for inexperienced users, but the second can lead to software failure of the device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meizu m5 note how to install play market" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1876485.jpg" width="600"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  So, the first option is to reset to factory settings (Hard Reset).  Remember that this option will completely clear the memory and delete all user interface settings.  After all this, you get a completely new system. </p><p>  To do this, go to "Settings".  We find "Restore and backup."  Before starting this process, you need to confirm that you are ready to lose all personal data.  It is undesirable to interrupt reset and reboot.  You can start Hard Reset by pressing the buttons.  To do this, use the power key and increase the volume.  After you hold them down, the smartphone will restart.  You can switch with the volume buttons.  Click Clear data and wait for the process to complete. </p><p>  In addition to resetting to factory settings, it is possible to try to ‚Äúreflash‚Äù.  But this is a separate issue.  Inexperienced users can make a lot of mistakes.  The latest options are an extreme case.  When asked about how to install the Play Market on Meizu, it becomes clear that it will be enough to use the built-in installer or the extension file APK. </p>
