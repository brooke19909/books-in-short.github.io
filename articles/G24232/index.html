Magnet motor</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The possibility of obtaining free energy for many scientists in the world is one of the stumbling blocks.  Today, such energy is obtained through alternative energy.  Natural energy is transformed by alternative sources of energy into the heat and electricity familiar to people.  Moreover, such sources have the main drawback - the dependence on weather conditions.  Fuelless engines are deprived of such shortcomings, namely, the Moskvin engine. </p><h2>  Moskvin engine </h2><p>  Moskvin's fuel-free engine is a mechanical device that converts the energy of an external conservative force into kinetic energy, which rotates the working shaft, without consuming electricity or any kind of fuel.  Such devices are actually perpetual motion machines that work infinitely long as long as the force is applied to the levers, and the parts do not wear out during the conversion of free energy.  During the operation of the fuel-free engine, free free energy is generated, the consumption of which is legal when the generator is connected. </p><p>  The new fuel-free engines are universal and environmentally friendly drives for various mechanisms and devices that operate without harmful emissions into the environment and atmosphere. </p><p>  The invention of a fuel-free engine in China prompted skeptics to conduct substantive examination.  Despite the fact that many similar patented inventions are in doubt due to the fact that their operability has not been verified for certain reasons, the fuel-free engine model is fully operational.  A sample device allowed to obtain free energy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Fuelless Magnet Engine </h2><p>  The work of various enterprises and equipment, as well as the everyday life of a modern person, depends on the availability of electrical energy.  Innovative technologies allow you to almost completely abandon the use of such energy and eliminate the attachment to a specific place.  One of these technologies has allowed the creation of a fuel-free permanent magnet engine. </p><h2>  The principle of operation of the magnetic generator </h2><p>  Perpetual motion machines are divided into two categories: first and second order.  The first type means equipment capable of generating energy from the air stream.  Second-order engines require the supply of natural energy ‚Äî water, sunlight, or wind ‚Äî which is converted into electric current.  Despite the existing laws of physics, scientists were able to create a perpetual fuel-free engine in China, which operates due to the energy produced by the magnetic field. </p><h2>  Varieties of Magnetic Motors </h2><p>  At the moment, several types of magnetic motors are distinguished, each of which requires a magnetic field.  The only difference between them is the design and principle of operation.  Magnet motors cannot last forever, since any magnets lose their properties after several hundred years. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The simplest model is the Lorentz engine, which can be assembled at home.  It is characterized by an anti-gravity property.  The engine design is based on two disks with different charges, which are connected by a power source.  Install it in a hemispherical screen, which begins to rotate.  Such a superconductor makes it easy and quick to create a magnetic field. </p><p>  A more sophisticated design is the Searl magnetic motor. </p>

    <h2>  Asynchronous magnetic motor </h2><p>  The creator of the asynchronous magnetic motor was Tesla.  His work is based on a rotating magnetic field, which allows you to convert the resulting energy stream into an electric current.  An insulated metal plate is mounted at maximum height.  A similar plate is buried in the soil layer to a considerable depth.  A wire is passed through the capacitor, which, on the one hand, passes through the plate, and on the other, is attached to its base and connected to the capacitor on the other hand.  In this design, the capacitor acts as a reservoir in which negative energy charges are accumulated. </p><h2>  Lazarev engine </h2><p>  The only working today VD2 is a powerful rotary ring - an engine created by Lazarev.  The scientist‚Äôs invention has a simple design, so it can be assembled at home using improvised means.  According to the fuel-free engine scheme, the capacity used to create it is divided into two equal parts by means of a special partition - a ceramic disk to which the tube is attached.  Inside the tank should be liquid - gasoline or ordinary water.  The operation of electric generators of this type is based on the transition of liquid into the lower zone of the tank through the partition and its gradual flow upward.  The movement of the solution is carried out without environmental influences.  A prerequisite for the design is that a small wheel should be placed under the dripping liquid.  This technology formed the basis of the simplest model of an electric motor with magnets.  The design of such an engine implies the presence of a wheel under a dropper with small magnets fixed on its blades.  A magnetic field occurs only if the fluid is pumped by the wheel at high speed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Shkondin Engine </h2><p>  A significant step in the evolution of technology was the creation of a linear motor by Shkondin.  Its design is a wheel in a wheel, which is widely used in the transport industry.  The principle of the system is based on absolute repulsion.  Such a neodymium magnet motor can be installed in any car. </p><h2>  Perendev engine </h2><p>  The high-quality alternative engine was created by Perendev and was a device that used only magnets to produce energy.  The design of such an engine includes a static and dynamic circles on which magnets are mounted.  The inner circle rotates continuously due to self-repelling free force.  In this regard, the fuel-free engine on magnets of this type is considered the most profitable in operation. </p><h2>  Creating a magnetic motor at home </h2><p>  A magnetic generator can be assembled at home.  To create it, three shafts are used, connected to each other.  The shaft located in the center necessarily rotates to the other two perpendicularly.  A special four-inch diameter lucite disk is attached to the middle of the shaft.  Similar shafts of smaller diameter are attached to other shafts.  They place magnets on them: eight in the middle and four on each side.  The basis of the design can be an aluminum block, which speeds up the engine. </p>

    <h2>  Engine Alekseenko </h2><p>  Alekseenko received a patent for a fuelless engine in 1999 from the Russian Agency for Trademarks and Patents.  The engine does not require fuel to operate - neither oil nor gas.  The functioning of the generator is based on the <span>energy of magnetic</span> fields created by permanent magnets.  An ordinary kilogram magnet can attract and repel about 50‚Äì100 kilograms of mass, while barium oxide analogues can affect five thousand kilograms of mass.  The inventor of a non-fuel magnet notes that magnets so powerful are not required to create a generator.  The usual ones are best - one in a hundred or one in fifty.  Magnets of this power are enough to operate the engine at 20 thousand revolutions per minute.  Power will be extinguished by the transmitting device.  Permanent magnets are located on it, the energy of which drives the engine in motion.  Owing to its own magnetic field, the rotor pushes away from the stator and begins to move, which is gradually accelerated due to the influence of the stator magnetic field.  This principle of action allows you to develop tremendous power.  The engine analog Alekseenko can be used, for example, in a washing machine, where its rotation will be provided by small magnets. </p>

    <h2>  Fuelless Generators </h2><p>  Special equipment for automobile engines, which allows cars to move only on water without the use of hydrocarbon additives.  Many Russian cars are equipped with such consoles today.  The use of such equipment allows motorists to save on gasoline and reduce the amount of harmful emissions into the atmosphere.  To create the prefix, Bakaev needed to discover a new type of splitting, which was used in his invention. </p><p>  Bolotov, a 20th-century scientist, developed a car engine that requires literally one drop of fuel to start.  The design of such an engine does not imply cylinders, a crankshaft and any other rubbing parts - they are replaced by two bearing disks with small clearances between them.  Fuel is ordinary air, which breaks down into nitrogen and oxygen at high speeds.  Nitrogen under the influence of a temperature of 90 ¬∞ C burns in oxygen, which allows the engine to develop a power of 300 horsepower.  Russian scientists, in addition to the fuel-free engine scheme, have developed and proposed modifications of many other engines, for the operation of which fundamentally new sources of energy are required - for example, vacuum energy. </p>

    <h2>  Scientists say: creating a fuel-free generator is impossible </h2><p>  New developments of innovative fuel-free engines received original names and became the promise of revolutionary prospects in the future.  The creators of the generators reported their first successes in the early stages of testing.  Despite this, the scientific community is still skeptical of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãfuel-free engines, and many scientists express their doubts about this.  One of the opponents and main skeptics is a scientist from the University of California, physicist and mathematician Phil Plate. </p><p>  Scientists from the opposing camp are of the opinion that the very concept of an engine that does not require fuel for operation contradicts the classical laws of physics.  The balance of forces inside the engine must be maintained all the time that traction is created inside it, and according to the law of momentum, this is impossible without the use of fuel.  Phil Plate has repeatedly noted that in order to talk about creating such a generator, you have to refute the whole law of conservation of momentum, which is unrealistic to do.  Simply put, creating a fuel-free engine requires a revolutionary breakthrough in fundamental science, and the level of modern technology leaves no chance for the very concept of this type of generator to be taken seriously. </p><p>  The general situation regarding this type of engine also leads to a similar opinion.  Today, a working model of the generator does not exist, and the theoretical calculations and characteristics of the experimental device do not carry any significant information.  The measurements showed that the thrust is about 16 millinewtons.  In the following measurements, this indicator increased to 50 millinewtons. </p><p>  The British, Roger Shawer, back in 2003, presented an experimental model of the fuelless engine EmDrive, the developer of which he was.  To create microwaves, the generator needed electricity from solar energy.  This development has again stirred up in the scientific community talk of a perpetual motion machine. </p><p>  Scientists' development has been mixed at NASA.  Experts noted the uniqueness, innovativeness and originality of the engine design, but at the same time claimed that significant results and efficient operation could be achieved only if the generator was operated in a quantum vacuum. </p>
