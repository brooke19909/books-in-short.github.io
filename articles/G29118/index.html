It is located on the very shore of the ocean, in the midst of a real tropical garden.  What is not a dream that attracts us from TV screens and advertising pages?  But this vision can be realized simply by settling in this Phan Thiet hotel with 4 * status.  Ocean Star Resort is highly rated by vacationers, especially tourists from Russia.  Below we decided to tell you about this beach hotel, based on the specific reviews of tourists who were there.  After all, it is not the starryness of hotels, but these responses that are often the main source of knowledge for travelers who are going on vacation to Asia. </p>

    <h2>  What is the Vietnamese Quartet </h2><p>  Hotels of this rank in almost all countries of the Far East have a list of services and the quality of rooms is higher than in the corresponding European 4 * hotels.  Ocean Star Resort 4 * demonstrates this very well, and we will see it below.  The level of such hotels can be compared with that of institutions in Thailand.  The Quartet is the prevailing type of tourist and beach hotel in Vietnam.  The cost of living with them, as a rule, includes rich and varied breakfasts.  Hotels have their own beaches, well equipped, with sun loungers and mattresses.  However, this also depends on the resort.  For example, only fives have their own beaches in Nha Trang, while guests of the fours and threes go to municipal beaches.  Almost everywhere in the rooms there are kettles and disposable bags for making hot drinks.  In each such hotel, Wi-Fi is free.  Only its coverage in hotels is different - it depends on the concept. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vietnam Hotel Ocean Star Resort 4" class="if" height="329" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1107244.jpg" width="492"></div>

Most of them (especially in winter) choose Phan Thiet when they come to Vietnam.  <span>The Ocean Star Resort</span> 4 * <span>hotel</span> , which is discussed in our article, is one of the best offers in these places.  But, like any resort region, Phan Thiet has its own characteristics.  Most of its hotels have their own beaches and are located near the sea, but there is practically no nightlife here.  The hotels also lack animation.  For children, Phan Thiet hotels have a maximum of playgrounds and special pools. </p><h2>  Territory, infrastructure, where is </h2><p>  Coconut palms, dropping fruits on the white sand of the ocean ... Which of us would not like to live in such a hotel?  And if his "stardom" is only 4?  Ocean Star Resort, however, is just the perfect place to spend time at sea.  The hotel buildings are beautiful, with mosaics made of wild stone.  Parking, a beautiful garden, a conference room, a spa, a swimming pool, a children's playground, a beauty salon - there is everything that a hotel of this rank should have.  And for Vietnam, this hotel generally has a very high level of services and a variety of services.  It even has its own souvenir shop.  The territory, as vacationers write, is very large, green and well-groomed.  Stone walkways, Japanese-style ponds with fish.  The road to this hotel, of course, takes a lot of time, because the nearest airport is in Nha Trang (Cam Ranh).  The location of the hotel itself is simply perfect.  Walking along the coast, you can go to Mui Ne, Bok and many other interesting places of this resort area. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ocean Star Resort 4 pics" class="if" height="316" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1107254.jpg" width="487"></div>

It has eighty-seven rooms and separate bungalows.  It does not matter where exactly you stay at the <span>Ocean Star Resort 4 *</span> hotel (Vietnam).  The rooms are well equipped.  There is a refrigerator and a flat-screen TV on the wall, and a digital telephone, a kettle, and a hairdryer.  One Russian channel works.  The rooms are beautifully air-conditioned.  Settled quickly.  The rooms are spacious, clean, beautiful.  Refrigerator, air conditioning and plumbing workers.  Large balconies with sun loungers.  Most tourists have no complaints about cleaning.  The linen is clean, without spots.  Towels, including beach towels, are changed daily.  The rooms of different categories - Superior, Deluxe ... There are even two levels.  Every day, small bottles of drinking water are brought into the room and bags of tea and coffee are placed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ocean Star Resort 4 Vietnam rooms" class="if" height="323" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1107266.jpg" width="489"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Like many 4 * hotels, Ocean Star Resort has its own restaurant.  At the hotel you can have breakfast, lunch and dinner.  It offers delicious dishes of both European and local cuisine.  Great seafood - just lick your fingers!  Breakfast is usually included in the room rate.  It is served as a buffet - there are always six to eight dishes to choose from, including Pho soup.  Fresh juices are served at nine in the morning.  If you do not leave the hotel during the day, then use the snack bar to grab a bite to eat.  But most tourists, as usual in Vietnam, still prefer to eat in different coastal cafes to compare food quality and prices.  Due to the location of the hotel, vacationers can simply walk along the sea and go to restaurants and shops to choose an institution to their liking.  Most recommend a cafe in Boke.  You can get there on foot (walk about an hour), and by taxi.  According to tourists, there are cheap prices and a huge selection of seafood, fish and various fresh exotic goodies.  You will try crocodile, and shark, and stingrays, and shrimp, and oysters, and scallops, and shrimps of various sizes, and lobster, and <span>tortoise soup ...</span> Of local alcohol, they recommend Saigon beer, wine from Dalat and, of course rum. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="4 Ocean Star Resort 4" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1107252.jpg" width="497"></div>

    <h2>  Services </h2><p>  We can say that this hotel is somewhat reminiscent of Turkish or Egyptian.  Than?  A kind of club holiday concept.  Indeed, for you there is almost anything you want, so if you wish, you don‚Äôt have to leave the hotel at all (well, maybe go to the beach) and use its services - both paid and included in the stay.  At the hotel, tourists with their own transport can park their cars.  As usual in such hotels, a laundry service is available.  Want to get well?  Go to the sauna and enjoy a massage.  There are also entertainments for athletes.  The hotel has good tennis courts.  You can play billiards.  There is an own travel agency, as well as an office renting cars and motorbikes.  For children - a good playground.  Wi-Fi catches in the entire hotel and even in the rooms.  But its speed depends on the time of day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ocean Star Resort 4 traveler reviews" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1107250.jpg" width="590"></div>

    <h2>  Sea, pool, beach </h2><p>  The sea is just a stone's throw from the rooms, the closest are bungalows.  You have to go down - and now you are already on a gorgeous beach.  It is wide, sandy, just like on the mural.  Many sunbeds, they are enough for everyone.  There are sun loungers.  On the beds - mattresses.  The entrance is convenient, but there are often waves at sea.  Not very dangerous, but you must be able to swim.  Such a vacation is perfect for those who like to jump on the waves, do kitesurfing.  The beach is guarded.  There is a fresh water shower at the exit.  The hotel has a swimming pool with a jacuzzi. </p><h2>  Ocean Star Resort 4 *: tourist reviews </h2><p>  This hotel is like vacationers.  There are especially many praises for its location - both with respect to the beach and the village of Mui Ne.  After all, this is the very center of the resort area. On the other hand, it is calm and excellent relaxation.  At ten in the evening, all cafes and karaoke are closed, and complete silence falls on the village.  In short, if you want ‚Äútwo in one‚Äù - both entertainment and peace, then choose Ocean Star Resort 4 *.  Guests often post photos of this hotel near reviews.  After all, its territory is so beautiful!  It serves as an ideal place for photo shoots.  The attitude of the staff towards the vacationers is very friendly, just sincere.  The cost of tours is adequate.  In addition, the hotel is a good starting point for various excursions.  Tourists are advised to buy them at a bureau on the street. </p>
