To visit the continent and not see the Iguazu Falls is an unforgivable oversight.  After all, they are famous not only on the mainland.  The fame of them has long spread throughout the world.  Waterfalls are rightfully considered the real pearl of the continent.  Tourists note that visiting an amazing place gives incomparable sensations.  The grandiose beauty of nature is striking in its strength and power.  You can talk a lot about Iguazu Falls, but words cannot convey their beauty.  Of course, it‚Äôs better to see it all with your own eyes. </p><h2>  Natural complex of waterfalls </h2><p>  Iguazu Falls is a beautiful region on the border of Brazil and Argentina.  It is for their sake that many travelers decide to go to South America.  The scale of the natural complex is evidenced by the fact that waterfalls are listed as natural wonders.  And that says a lot.  Waterfalls are part of the National Park, in which rare plants and animals grow.  By the way, the park itself has long become one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wanderingwagars.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Iguazu in Argentina" class="if uuid-2260984" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2260984.jpg"></div><p>  It‚Äôs hard to imagine how many waterfalls an Iguazu complex consists of.  And there are 275 of them. The number is really impressive.  But no less impressive is their height.  If we talk about how many meters Iguazu Falls are tall, then the maximum value is 82 meters.  Most of the cascades do not exceed 60 meters in height.  But this was far from always. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  From Brazil, water flows appear in all their pristine beauty.  A fabulous picture is complemented by a cloud of spray, which is always there.  The Iguazu complex is twice as wide and much higher than the famous Niagara Falls. </p><h2>  Location of the water complex </h2><p>  There are Iguazu waterfalls on the river of the same name.  About 24 kilometers from the confluence of the Iguazu in Parana.  The water complex is located right on the border of Argentina and Brazil.  Iguazu Falls divide the river into lower and upper parts.  They are located in the national parks of both countries. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="-25.6852717" data-lng="-54.44447969999999" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="15"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/7/5/9/759.png"></div><p>  The Iguazu River itself originates off the coast of the Atlantic Ocean, south of Sao Paulo.  It flows deep into the mainland to the west.  Its length is 1320 kilometers.  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe water complex, the width of the river is about four kilometers.  And over the entire width of the water falls from a high cliff, which in shape resembles a crescent. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The place where Iguazu Falls is located once changed its terrain due to the eruption of the volcano.  A huge hollow formed in the earth's surface.  Here is such an amazing story.  As a result of the disaster, a real world-wide miracle appeared. </p><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.wanderingwagars.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Water complex" class="if uuid-2260993" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2260993.jpg"></div><p>  No less interesting is the history of the origin of the name of the Iguazu Falls.  What does the name of the complex mean in the language of the Indians who lived in these places?  Translated from the dialect of guarani, it sounds only as "big water", which describes the water complex as accurately as possible.  The first to discover waterfalls was a Spaniard named Alvar Cabeze de Vaca in 1541.  He went to the jungle in search of adventure and gold.  His detachment landed on the coast of modern Brazil and began to move west.  Travelers crossed the Brazilian Highlands and from afar heard a rumble.  It was strange sounds that brought people to the waterfalls.  The Spanish conqueror was extremely surprised and amazed at what he saw.  He called the Salto de Santa Maria water complex, which means ‚Äújump of St.  Mary. "  But this name did not take root.  The traveler reported on his discovery to Madrid.  But the royal court was not very interested in natural resources.  After all, the colonialists were sent to America for the sake of gold.  Therefore, waterfalls have sunk into oblivion for several centuries.  They were safely forgotten and not remembered for a long time. </p><p>  It was only in the nineteenth century that Iguazu Falls in South America was once again discovered by explorer Boselli.  Until 1864, the water complex belonged to Paraguay.  However, Argentina and Brazil actively claimed the territory.  And so a military conflict erupted.  Thus began the <span>most bloody war</span> in South America, known as the Triple Alliance conflict.  Paraguay lost the fight, so the country was forced to make significant territorial changes, as a result of which the northern bank of the river went to Brazil, and the southern - to Argentina. </p><p>  The first map of the region was made at the end of the nineteenth century. </p><p>  Since 1991, the power and strength of water flows has served man.  Paraguay and Brazil opened <span>Itaipu's</span> largest <span>hydropower plant.</span>  The amount of electricity received is 40% of the energy consumption of the two countries.  This power plant can safely be called one of the most outstanding modern achievements of mankind. </p><h2>  Legend </h2><p>  An old legend says that once God wanted to marry a very beautiful Aboriginal woman, whose name was Naipu.  But the girl ran away with her loved one in a canoe.  An angry God created waterfalls on the river, dooming the lovers to an imminent fall.  So the young man turned into a rock, and the girl into a lonely palm.  Periodically, a rainbow appears in this place.  They say that it is lovers with tenderness hug each other. </p><h2>  The origin of the natural miracle </h2><p>  Legend is a legend, but scientists believe that Iguazu Falls were formed a long time ago, more than 150 million years ago.  The reason for their appearance was a powerful eruption of volcanoes.  As a result, a tremendous cleft appeared in the earth.  In southern Brazil, the river flows along a basalt platform that abruptly ends where the lava flow has frozen.  Initially (approximately 20,000 years ago), the waterfalls were at the junction of <span>the Parana</span> and Iguazu <span>rivers</span> , but later, due to erosion, they retreated as much as 28 kilometers to their present location.  Scientists say that annually the flows recede by three millimeters. </p><h2>  Description of the water complex </h2><p>  The height of the Iguazu Falls (in meters) reaches 80. But this is the maximum value.  Across the entire width of the complex, water flows from different heights.  The deepest point of the waterfall is called the "Devil's Throat".  In a second, the Iguazu River overthrows from a height of 1700 m3.  water.  Numerous waterfalls are located both streams and cascades. </p><p>  During the dry season, tourists can see two separate crescent-shaped streams.  The width of each is 732 meters.  And in the rainy period, both crescents form a single whole. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wanderingwagars.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Viewpoint" class="if uuid-2261011" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2261011.jpg"></div><p>  Most of the water flows reach a height of 60-70 meters.  And only a few - 80. The most famous waterfall is the formidable name "Devil's Throat."  So, it has the shape of a horseshoe.  Its height is 82 meters and its width reaches 150 meters.  The waterfall is located at the very border of Brazil and Argentina. If all its flows were a single whole, then the water complex would be called the widest in the world.  But this is not so.  The widest continuous waterfall is Victoria in Africa. </p><p>  Large water streams Iguazu rush down, and then split into a series of smaller ones.  And those, in turn, breaking thresholds, form clouds of spray and fog.  Sunlight complements the picture, creating a magnificent rainbow, and not just one, but much more. </p><h2>  The name of the waterfalls </h2><p>  An interesting fact is that in different countries Iguazu Falls are called differently.  In Argentina, he is called Rivadavia, Belgrano, Arayagaray, Two and Three Musketeers, etc. But in Brazil - Salto Floriano, Benjamin Constant. </p><h2>  National park </h2><p>  The surrounding areas of Iguazu are part of the national park.  On its territory guests can see natural beauties and unique animals.  Especially for tourists, boat trips are conducted (we will talk about them later in the article). </p><p>  The national park is located on the border of Paraguay, Brazil and Argentina.  It is called "Iguazu".  The protected area from Brazil is 180 thousand hectares.  This is the largest reserve in the country.  And at the same time one of the largest in the world.  From Argentina, Iguazu Falls border the country's national park, which occupies 55 thousand hectares. </p><p>  The nature of the region and climatic conditions are close to the Amazonian forests.  The park is dominated by multi-level forests.  Here orchids grow on tree trunks.  The lush nature of the tropics combined with the beauty of waterfalls makes an indelible impression on tourists.  The national park is filled with exotic plants.  Over 2 thousand species of plants grow on its territory and about 400 species of birds inhabit. </p><h2>  When is it better to come to the waterfalls? </h2><p>  Waterfalls are beautiful in any season.  But still, it makes sense to take into account some features of the local climate.  The best time to travel is from January to February.  The rainy season lasts from November to March.  It was during this period that the river is most full-flowing, and therefore more spectacular.  But walking in such a period is not too pleasant due to dampness. </p><div class="photo" data-original="first2board.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cascades of waterfalls" class="if uuid-2261018" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2261018.jpg"></div><p>  In the winter months, from June to August, the area is cool.  It is better to visit the waterfalls in sunny time to fully enjoy the local beauties and enjoy the rainbows.  Wandering around under the spray in hot weather is a pleasure.  And the photos are incredibly colorful. </p><h2>  How to get to Iguazu Falls? </h2><p>  How and how you will get to the right place depends on which country you want to visit the waterfalls in.

Admire the Iguazu aerial view is possible only in Brazil. </p><h2>  Air Tours </h2><p>  The Brazilian side offers the best view of the waterfalls.

The flight duration is approximately 12 minutes.  The cost of an air tour is 11 thousand rubles.  According to tourists, a spectacular sight and indescribable sensations can not be compared with anything.

However, you must correctly calculate your strength, leaving them at the waterfalls.  But you also need to walk along the paths of the park.  Local nature and animals will give you a lot of impressions. </p><p>  The reserve has a bird park.  It is so beautiful that it is worth a visit.

There are signs on all the tracks, so getting lost is simply impossible.  The area is decorated with artificial ponds and ponds with wooden bridges.  And all around are fragrant flowers.  If you want a snack, you can do it in a cafe.  Tourists recommend watching a bird park before the waterfalls, since then there is no strength anymore, and the perception is not so bright. </p><h2>  Waterfalls </h2><p>  Tourists in the park are delivered to observation platforms near waterfalls by special buses.  But the most interesting is ahead.  It is not for nothing that such beauties as the Iguazu Falls and the Great Barrier Reef are called natural wonders of a world scale.  Being here, you understand that these natural attractions are really worthy of such a title.  An amazing and striking combination of seething white streams of water with greenery of the jungle is striking.  The huge width of the water complex and its height remain in memory forever. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.intrepidtravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Viewpoint" class="if uuid-2261048" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2261048.jpg"></div><p> To the center of the attraction are stone paths, fenced with a railing for safety.  It also sells raincoats.  But it‚Äôs much more pleasant to feel drops of water on yourself than to hide in the heat in a plastic wrap.  Raccoons run along all the tracks, not being afraid of crowds of tourists. </p><p>  Waterfalls from different sides open completely different.  It seems that with approaching them they become even more beautiful and larger.  Numerous bright butterflies fly right next to the water.  At the central observation deck, you find yourself in a veil of fog from water droplets.  And a bright rainbow opens to the eye.  The breath away from such beauty.  This is exactly how the waterfalls look from the Brazilian side. </p>
