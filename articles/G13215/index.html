A successful combination of sandy beaches and picturesque nature becomes the key to a great time on the shores of the warm sea.  Moreover, there are great opportunities for outdoor activities, lovers of historical attractions, and young people can perfectly unwind at the resort‚Äôs numerous entertainment and dance floors. </p><h2>  History and Modernity </h2><p>  Marmaris is one of the most beautiful cities in Turkey.  It is well located in a bay surrounded by the Niamara Peninsula and is additionally covered by an island that protects the coast from strong winds and waves.  Even when a storm rages in the open sea, it is usually calm and warm.  The town is a kind of junction, where the Mediterranean and Aegean seas meet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Marmaris beaches" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45109/1935011.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  First of all, the resort is considered the center of entertaining life in Turkey, a kind of Ibiza, where nightlife is seething and young people are breaking out with might and main.  However, the sandy beaches of Marmaris can attract a huge number of people who prefer a relaxing family vacation. </p><p>  Good location attracted people here long before the new story.  The first settlement was founded here almost three thousand years ago and bore the name Fiskos.  In 1425, the city was conquered by the Turkish Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, who built the Marmara-Kalesi fortress here.  Until the eighties of the last century, there was only a place for a seedy fishing village, however, the rapid development of the tourism industry turned Marmaris into an attractive resort for European tourists. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Climate and landscape </h2><p>  The climate here is typically Mediterranean, but the location of the city brings its own characteristics.  The Aegean Sea suggests a drier climate than in the southern resorts of Turkey, which is especially good for people suffering from heart and lung problems. </p><p>  The sun on the beaches of Marmaris is a regular guest, it shines here three hundred days a year.  However, this does not mean suffocating heat, a light breeze from the sea brings a pleasant coolness. </p><p>  The water here is gradually heated, only by August its temperature reaches 25 degrees.  In September and October, the velvet season begins.  The column of the thermometer in the shade drops to a mark of 30 degrees, while the sea heats up to a maximum, which is typical for a country like Turkey. </p><p>  The beaches of Marmaris are located in a closed bay, which should be taken into account by lovers of the vast expanses.  The open sea can be seen only from one place through a narrow strait.  However, the landscape here is quite picturesque, the resort is surrounded by small islands covered with coniferous and deciduous forests.  On the beaches of Marmaris, sand or pebbles are heated and retain heat for a long time.  This allows you to spend time ashore even at night. </p><h2>  Turkish Ibiza </h2><p>  Reviews of the beaches of Marmaris have a wide range of ratings, which can be confusing for an ordinary tourist.  This is due to the fact that there is a fairly wide selection of places for a beach holiday, each of which has its own characteristics. </p><p>  The center of the resort is Marmaris itself.  The shore is within walking distance of the historic city center.  For Marmaris hotels of the first line, a private beach is an indispensable condition.  There are many hotels here, they maintain their recreation areas in good condition, constantly import good sand. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There are separate beaches in the city for those who come to Marmaris for music and dancing.  Young people throw noisy parties with lots of loud music and dancing. </p><h2>  Usunali </h2><p>  There is also a public beach called Uzunyaly (the "long road").  It is quite narrow, its width does not exceed 5-6 meters.  Life here is in full swing, there are a huge number of bars and restaurants, water equipment rental points.  The beach is quite well equipped, here you can find showers and changing cabins.  However, chaise lounges in the municipal zone are a luxury, you should come with your own bedspreads. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sandy beaches of marmaris" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45109/1935013.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  Those who wish to sunbathe in comfort can go to coastal areas assigned to cafes and restaurants.  There are sun loungers that are free, you just need to order something from food or drinks.  Having bought a bottle of water for a couple of lire, a tourist can calmly relax at least all day, however, it is necessary to steadfastly withstand the burning eyes of managers. </p><p>  The best beaches of Marmaris Uzunyala can be attributed with a big stretch.  Here you can find individual piles of garbage, numerous vacationers raise turbidity from the muddy bottom, the coastal strip is rather narrow and cramped. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Icmeler </h2><p>  Fans of a relaxing holiday and supporters of unity with nature, the noisy beaches of Marmaris can be alienated, but there is a great alternative to them.  Just eight kilometers from the city is the village of Icmeler, which is not so overrun by European tourists.  Previously, it was part of the main complex, but today it is gaining popularity as an independent and original recreation area. </p><p>  Hotels and beaches of Icmeler are rated much higher than in Marmaris.  This is due to the fact that the infrastructure here developed later than in the center, and hotels were built based on modern requirements. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Marmaris hotels first line private beach" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45109/1935016.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The main advantage of the village is still considered its beaches.  They are clean and unusual here.  Thanks to the rocky bottom, the water here is unusually clear.  The beaches themselves are equally composed of pebbles and sand, so you can relax here with children. </p><p>  Fans of scuba diving, divers especially appreciate Icmeler, as its clean and clear water allows you to fully enjoy the underwater scenery and gawk at the many marine inhabitants, which are represented here by corals, octopuses, tuna, turtles and many others. </p><h2>  Turunc </h2><p>  Among the best beaches not only Marmaris, but also the whole Mediterranean coast is near the small village of Turunca.  It is marked with a special sign - the blue flag.  This is the world standard for the quality of beaches, indicating that local sand and water are in almost perfect condition and are especially clean. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="marmaris turkey beaches" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45109/1935019.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Turunch is comfortably sandwiched in a small bay, the coast is only 500 meters long and is surrounded by cliffs.  It is located 25 kilometers from Marmaris itself, so there are not so many tourists here.  This will be appreciated by lovers of a relaxing and secluded vacation.  There are many caves, the underwater world is replete with labyrinths, where marine inhabitants hide, which diving enthusiasts will especially appreciate. </p><h2>  Kumbuluk and Gunnuzhek </h2><p>  Near Turunch are the beaches of Kumbuluk.  The village is characterized by a picturesque landscape, stripes of sandy and pebble beaches alternate here.  The flat terrain smoothly passes into the hills, lovers of hiking will have a good time here. </p><p>  Fishing traditions are still strong here, you can find many restaurants where a tired tourist can make a choice of seafood dishes.  Kumbuluk is a quiet, calm village, ideal for tourists exhausted by the hectic life of the resort center. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="marmaris beaches reviews" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/1935245.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  There are not many tourists here, and the sea water is very clean.  Walking yachts often stop here, from where lovers of secluded beaches land.  The rocky shores are rich in underwater caves, which attracts diving enthusiasts here. </p><h2>  Kizkumu </h2><p>  Folklore lovers can be attracted by a beautiful legend associated with Kizkumu beach (the "girl's braid").  It is located thirty kilometers from Marmaris and borders the Gulf of Hisaronu.  According to legend, there lived a girl who was forced to cross the sea every night to get to her beloved.  For the sake of this, she faithfully lined the bottom with the sand she wore in the apron. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Marmaris beaches sand or pebbles" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45109/1935020.jpg" width="600"></div>  Like it or not, but the sea here is really very shallow off the coast.  From a distance, it might seem that vacationers are walking right along the water surface in the middle of the sea.
