In addition to significant savings, the resources of the planet are protected and the atmosphere of the Earth is not clogged.  Plastic bottles are a very convenient material for the manufacture of various products.  These are vases and flower beds in a summer cottage, devices for picking berries in the garden.  They make decorative elements in the garden, toys for children.  One of the applications for plastic bottles is the manufacture of furniture.  Masters make beds and armchairs, coffee tables and sofas.  To get started, let's try to figure out how to make a ottoman from plastic bottles. </p><p>  The article has a detailed description of the work on the manufacture of this type of furniture.  It is possible to arrange in this way a ottoman for a summer residence or for domestic use in a private house.  However, if you sew a beautiful cover, then you can create a ottoman from plastic bottles for a city apartment.  It looks quite usual and with the quality design of the crafts, it will be completely impossible to distinguish it from ordinary plywood furniture. </p><h2>  Necessary material for work </h2><p>  In order not to be distracted during the search for the necessary materials, you need to prepare in advance everything that can come in handy. </p><ul><li>  Transparent adhesive tape. </li><li>  Plastic bottles - the amount depends on the size of the ottoman. </li><li>  Scissors. </li><li>  Sintepon or foam rubber. </li><li>  Corrugated cardboard packaging or two plywood circles. </li><li>  Stationery knife for cutting foam. </li><li>  Thread, needle or sewing machine. </li><li>  Sheathing material.  The fabric is taken finishing, durable. </li><li>  Elastic. </li></ul><h2>  Beginning of work </h2><p>  If you are planning to make furniture from plastic bottles, then first you need to collect a lot of identical containers.  Depending on the size of the craft, you need to prepare 20-30 bottles.  Suitable for 1.5- or 2-liter containers.  In order for the ottoman from plastic bottles to be smooth and not to press on the fifth point of the seated person, you need to cover the neck in each product. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.socreativethings.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect bottles" class="if uuid-2368504" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2368504.jpg"></div><p>  To do this, one bottom bottle is cut off with a bottom.  Then the workpiece is put on top of the whole bottle, closing the sharp part with the neck.  It turns out a bottle in which the bottom and top - a rounded bottom.  Thus, all containers are prepared and stacked side by side.  Then, with adhesive tape, carefully wrap the required number of bottles together several times.  Workpieces are laid out in a checkerboard pattern.  One bottle upside down, the other up.  It turns out a rigid structure. </p><h2>  Temporary option </h2><p>  If you make a padded stool of plastic bottles for temporary use, then you can not try so hard and leave the containers in their original form.  For some time they will bear the weight of the person sitting on them.  In this case, the bottlenecks should look down, and it‚Äôs more convenient to sit on the bottoms. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wonderfuldiy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a ottoman" class="if uuid-2368446" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2368446.jpg"></div><p>  The principle of preparing the base for furniture is the same as before.  Bottles are added either in a circle, as in the photo above, or a square ottoman is made.  For this option, the containers are folded in even rows, as in the sale.  After fastening with tape, you need to strengthen the surface from above and from below with corrugated cardboard packaging.  This will strengthen the design and make the product softer for the seated. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  So that the entire structure does not move to the side and does not move away from the person‚Äôs weight, use cling film.  It is better to wrap it all together several times. </p><h2>  Add softness </h2><p>  Making a <span>ottoman with your own hands</span> from plastic bottles is only the beginning of the work.  Next, you need to make the product soft so that it is pleasant to sit on it.  To do this, you can use several layers of synthetic winterizer or dense foam.  To correctly make a pattern, you must use the template.  First, on the cardboard sheet, circle the bottom of the ottoman and cut along the contours with scissors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="forum.hawahome.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="soft part" class="if uuid-2368468" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2368468.jpg"></div><p>  The cut-out circle is placed on top of the cardboard and fastened around the entire perimeter with tape.  It is best to stick it on the diagonals, making several winding sectors.  Next, you need to measure the length of the side of the ottoman from plastic bottles with a soft meter.  Then a rectangle is cut out of sintepon or foam rubber and wrapped around a cylinder. </p><div class="photo" data-original="manualni.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="synthetic winterizer wrap" class="if uuid-2368471" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2368471.jpg"></div><p>  It is better to do this procedure twice.  The second time you need to start winding from the other side so that the joint is not felt at all.  Adhesive tape is stretched several times around the circumference of the cylinder. </p><h2>  What can replace a synthetic winterizer? </h2><p>  If you do not have a synthetic winterizer at hand, but there is an old cotton blanket in the country, you can use it as a soft layer.  You can cut a circle and a rectangle by cutting the blanket into pieces.  Edges of parts can be sewn together.  You get a comfortable thick cover that you can put on and take off as needed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="spider-puppeta.blogspot.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://spider-puppeta.blogspot.com/2013/05/blog-post_26.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="decoration with foam and blanket" class="if uuid-2368478" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2368478.jpg"></div><p>  You can combine the cover with a blanket and the existing foam, which is good to tighten the sides of the ottoman from plastic bottles (the photo shows how best to do this). </p><h2>  Pattern ottoman cover </h2><p>  After measurements are taken, a pattern of the future cover is drawn.  It can be made whole, which will be worn by pulling the fabric on a craft, or you can make a cover with a zipper, then you can remove and wash it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern of a cover on a ottoman from bottles" class="if uuid-2368716" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2368716.jpg"></div><p>  The drawing shows that the pattern consists of two parts. </p><ul><li>  The first is a circle, the dimensions of which correspond to the seat of the ottoman.  The dashed line shows that 2 cm should be left around the seams. </li><li>  The second part is the rectangle.  Its height is equal to the distance from the seat to the floor.  The length is equal to measuring the circumference of the cylinder.  On the sides you need to leave 2 cm at the seams.  Below, as seen in the pattern, a greater distance is left.  This is necessary for bending the fabric for the elastic.  Instead of an elastic band at the bottom, insert a rope and tie it to a bow.  This will help to easier pull the sewn cover from the ottoman out of plastic bottles. </li></ul><p>  The master who performs the sewing must determine in advance the style and material.  If the zipper will be sewn, then it can be placed on the side seam of the rectangle or around the circumference of the seat. </p><h2>  Sewing a cover on a pattern </h2><p>  After the pattern is drawn on paper, it is transferred to a fabric laid out on a flat surface.  Then, on the wrong side, the parts are sewn together with internal seams.  If you have a sewing machine, then it is best to make all the seams on it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tousledday.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="made ottoman from bottles" class="if uuid-2368485" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2368485.jpg"></div><p>  First, a circle is sewn to the rectangular part, then a side seam is sewn.  At the end, work is done on the lower hem of the fabric.  It is best to bend it twice.  Then the threads will not be visible and it will be possible to insert an elastic band.  This is most conveniently done with a safety pin.  After the gum is completely threaded, its edges are tied to a knot, and the excess ends are trimmed. </p><h2>  Ottoman options </h2><p>  The article describes in detail how to make ottomans from plastic bottles with your own hands (with photo).  This is a general description, which, if desired, can be supplemented with various details.  Varieties of ottomans are chosen depending on their location.  If the ottoman is placed on the dressing table, then it must be done low and round.  If it is intended for playing the piano, then it is better to give it a rectangular shape. </p><p>  In the nursery, padded stools are made out small, but with a cover of bright fabric with a beautiful print depicting a cartoon hero or favorite toy.  You can make pockets for little things on the sides.  Looks nice ottoman, depicting a little animal with a muzzle and ears.  You can sew a fluffy tail. </p><p>  For lovers of knitting it will not be difficult to knit a cover of bright yarn crocheted or knitting.  You can decorate it with flowers or applique. </p><p>  I hope this article will help in the manufacture of furniture from plastic bottles.  It is fast, convenient and cheap. </p>
