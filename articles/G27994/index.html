    <h2>  general characteristics </h2><p>  New buildings in Shcherbinka are currently represented in sufficient abundance.  Many of them have already been commissioned, others have just begun to rebuild.  Developers prefer large housing complexes with autonomous communications, developed infrastructure and transport accessibility.  Currently, among potential buyers of real estate in Moscow, those options that are far from a noisy metropolis, are located in an ecologically clean zone, are at the same time not isolated from the capital, and are in close proximity to it and all its attractions.  An excellent option in this case will be Shcherbinka.  New buildings from the developer - a real opportunity to save money and buy the apartment that meets the wishes, requirements and fits into the planned budget. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Among the presented <span>residential complexes,</span> you can find apartments with a standard and individual layout, a large and spacious kitchen, isolated rooms - there are a lot of options.
