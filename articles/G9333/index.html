  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Who is an alpha female and what are her main characteristics?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The concepts ‚Äúalpha-individual‚Äù, ‚Äúalpha-male‚Äù and ‚Äúalpha-female‚Äù were introduced into use by ethologists - scientists who study the behavior of pack animals.  For the first time, a chicken flock was examined for a <span>hierarchical structure</span> within a community of animals of one species.  Scientists have revealed (although the peasants knew this long before them) that a tight social hierarchy reigns in the chicken coop, where each member has his own ‚Äúbiosocial rank‚Äù.  In addition to this term, another fashionable expression - ‚Äúpecking order‚Äù - has entered into everyday and unscientific everyday life.  The term "alpha individual" was introduced by David L. Meh, who studied the behavior of wolves within a pack. </p><p>  Scientists have found that what the animal will become - alpha, beta, gamma or omega, is laid down from birth and depends on a specific set of hormones.  Experienced dog handlers advise those who want to choose a dog with fighting qualities to ring the keys loudly before brooding the puppies: who does not get scared, but growls and rushes at the keys, he is an alpha individual.  Observations of the wolf pack showed that alpha males contain a harem of several "prestigious" bitches.  In the division of prey, the alpha male is the first to take the tidbits and treat them to his females.  Then beta and then gamma individuals come up, omega individuals get leftovers.  But there are frequent cases when an alpha female dominates in a pack.  Who is this? </p><p>  It will be erroneous to extrapolate onto her the visible qualities of an alpha male.  Such a female does not have a harem of males or promiscuous sexual intercourse.  Yes, she does not need this.  An alpha individual is, above all, a leader who has power and authority in his community.  The main sign of an animal leader is not the amount of sexual intercourse, but a certain status.  The main thing for males (Mother Nature so ordered) is to throw their seed into as many maternal wombs as possible, and thus transfer their set of genes.  Therefore, the male biologically always tries to acquire a harem, but it turns out that this is not for everyone, but only for alpha males.  Females are interested not in quantity, but in quality: to choose the most optimal genotype that can be passed on to their children.  Therefore, the alpha female chooses the male herself.  This is not necessarily an alpha male, but he is her choice. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It will be erroneous to think that alpha is the most beautiful (in the understanding of males) female.  On the contrary, external attractiveness is a sign of fertility.  Beta and gamma individuals take advantage of their beauty to lodge in the harem of a leader, an alpha male, and, having achieved what they want, rest on their laurels: they don‚Äôt need more.  The alpha female is not one.  She is not content with the role of the pet, which gets the crumbs of her master's mercy - she herself seeks to be mistress. </p><p>  It is also wrong to think that the alpha female is the most feisty and vociferous animal in the pack.  Nervous, hysterical behavior is, rather, a sign of inner uncertainty, a desire to improve one‚Äôs low-natured status by means of ‚Äúhitting‚Äù and humiliating even weaker ones.  This is how gamma individuals behave, recouping on unrequited rogue omega.  It is easy to recognize an alpha female by a confident manner of holding and a good-natured <span>expression on her face.</span>  She looks calm even in the most ridiculous situations and well-groomed, even if the pack is going through hard days. </p><p>  Can the definition of "alpha-individual" be transferred to the human community?  On the one hand, we all left the animal world, and a certain set of chromosomes, which is responsible for <span>leadership qualities,</span> is also present in us.  On the other hand, the hierarchical structures of human society are much more complex than in an animal herd.  Each person plays different roles in various micro-communities - in the family, at work, with friends, in the club of interests.  In everyday speech, the name "alpha male" is ingrained, used for macho, the conqueror of female hearts.  However, the female person, being an "alpha", does not need men to gain social status - she reaches it with her mind, assertiveness, acquiring her own authority. </p>
