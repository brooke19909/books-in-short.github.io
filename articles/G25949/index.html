    <p>  Visiting the Bahamas is the dream of every person, especially girls.  This place is very often visited by newlyweds.  It is quiet, comfortable, calm and very beautiful.  The nature on the islands is truly fabulous.  And for sports lovers here is the cleanest place for diving.  But the <span>pink beach</span> on Harbor Island (Bahamas) deserves special attention.  In some sources, it is called Pink Sands Beach. </p><p>  This name came from crushed shells whose shells have bright pink or red tones.  These shells are called foraminifera.  Such unicellular organisms are large clusters on the bottom of reefs and in caves on the ocean floor.  Also, a huge amount of red corals can be seen near the coast.  Particles of reefs and foraminifers mix with sand.  From this, the beach area acquires an unusual shade.  Harbor Island (Bahamas) for this reason is the most popular among tourists.  But the rest here can not be called cheap.  But there are also reasons for this. </p>

    <p>  As tourists note, to see all corners of the Bahamas, you can go for a ferry ride and stop in the wildest areas of the Bahamas.  In addition to the beach, you must visit the island of Eleuthera.  According to vacationers, his main pride is the "Glass Window".  This name was given to a rocky strip 10 meters wide, which separates the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.  If you decide to go there you need to carefully consider the weather.  The waves of the Atlantic Ocean can surge and take away not only human lives, but also vehicles.  Due to periodic hurricanes, you can often observe the destroyed roads, which are constantly being repaired. </p><p>  Tourists with admiration tell that on the left bank there is a natural depression, from which water sometimes rises.  This is an amazing sight. </p><p>  Tourists note the attention of another unforgettable place on the island of North Eleuthera - the Cave of the Priest.  At the beginning of the 18th century, people settled in this place.  According to legend, there was a shipwreck in which European mariners were hit.  Among the survivors was a priest who volunteered to read prayers, and since then this place has been considered holy and clean. </p><p>  In Dunmore Town, according to vacationers, the following buildings deserve special attention - the old Sugar Mill, an old prison built in the 18th century, the shipyard and the summer residence of the Governor of the Bahamas. </p><h2>  Harbor Island is the perfect honeymoon destination </h2>
