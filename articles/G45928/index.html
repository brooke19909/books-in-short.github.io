    <p>  Propionic acid is a food preservative.  Outwardly, it looks like an oily liquid of a pale yellowish color or without one at all. </p><p>  Propionic acid has a sour taste and pungent odor.  The chemical formula of the substance is C2H5COOH. </p><p>  Propionic Acid Preparation </p><p>  The substance E280 is naturally found in oil and as a by-product of an enzymatic product in individual plants.  During carbohydrate fermentation, propionic acid is also formed.  Biological production is the metabolic decomposition of fatty acids, which contain odd amounts of carbon atoms, and the decomposition of individual amino acids. </p><p>  Bacteria from the genus Propioni bacterium produce a substance as the final product of anaerobic metabolism.  Since these bacteria are often present in the stomach of ruminants, some varieties of cheese have a specific flavor. </p><p>  Under industrial conditions, propionic acid is formed during carbonylation by the Reppe reaction of ethylene, during catalytic oxidation (in the presence of manganese or cobalt ions) of propionic aldehyde.  In addition, the substance is produced as a by-product in the process of vapor-phase oxidation of C4-C10 hydrocarbons. </p><p>  Propionic acid used to be released as a by-product in the production of acetic acid.  However, modern technologies in the manufacture of the latter pushed aside the previous method of releasing a preservative into the background. </p><p>  Propionic acid is allowed to be used in the form of a preservative in an amount of up to three grams per kilogram in cheeses (processed) products, as well as those made from them, in combination with sorbic acid, its salts or individually.  It is also possible to use a preservative in wheat (sliced ‚Äã‚Äãpre-packaged), rye for long-term storage, as well as bread with reduced energy value.  Propionic acid is approved for use in flour confectionery, pastry. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Due to the inhibition (retardation) of certain enzymes, the preservative is able to exert a nonspecific inhibitory effect on bacteria of many species, mold and yeast, and some species can absorb or produce it. </p><p>  Limiting the amount of propionic acid used is not practical.  This is due to the fact that at a concentration of 0.3%, the preservative significantly changes the smell and taste of the product.  In this regard, in the food industry propionic acid is used in the form of <span>calcium</span> and sodium <span>propionates</span> almost exclusively in the process of preserving bakery products. </p><p>  <span>Preservative E280</span> is able to inhibit (slow down) the development of serum and milk microorganisms.  In this regard, propionic acid is used in the preservation of <span>whey</span> for the purpose of storage and transportation.  Moreover, this substance is used to protect excessively wet grain from mold (with insufficiently powerful dryers). </p><p>  The use of propionic acid is quite common in other industries.  So, a preservative used in the production of pharmaceuticals (Fenobolina, ibuprofen and others), aromatic substances <span>(geranyl propionate, phenylpropionate</span> , and others) and plastics (polivinilpropionata) vinilplastifikatorov, solvent (propyl propionate, propyl propionate and others). </p><p>  The main danger that E280 can pose is chemical burns, the occurrence of which is likely in contact with concentrated acid.  In a number of studies, it was not revealed that the preservative has toxicity, carcinogenicity and the ability to negatively affect the reproductive organs. </p><p>  The body undergoes rapid oxidation of propionic acid; excretion is carried out in the form of carbon dioxide in <span>the Krebs cycle.</span> </p>
