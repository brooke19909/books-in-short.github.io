What needs to be considered before a visit to Georgia?  What should I be prepared for and what should I visit in this country?  About all this further. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="42.315407" data-lng="43.356892000000016" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="6"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/8/4/1/7/18417.png"></div><h2>  When to go to rest </h2><p>  Georgia for tourists from Russia is an amazing region, which is beautiful at any time of the year.  The optimal time for the trip depends on what type of vacation you are a fan of.  So, if you like descents from the steep mountain slopes, which are many in the country, then you need to go here from December to March.  Winters here are quite warm, but it is worth considering that in the popular resorts of Bakuriani and Gudauri, cover is formed only by mid-January. </p><p>  Fans of relaxation on the beach should gather in this sunny country no earlier than May.  The holiday season on the coast here lasts until September.  If you do not plan to swim in the sea and sunbathe on the beach, but just want to get acquainted with the sights and visit the most interesting places, then in this case you should go to Georgia in May or June - during this period it is still not so hot, but the surroundings are encouraging its unimaginable beauty.  By the way, from September to November, the country is actively harvesting fruit, which can be purchased for nothing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.summer.harvard.edu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sea in Georgia reviews of tourists" class="if uuid-3259383" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/3259383.jpg"></div><h2>  What to bring with you from your clothes </h2><p>  Speaking about holidays in Georgia, tourists often list a certain list of things that they should take with them on a planned trip in the councils. </p><p>  To relax in the summer, a tourist should definitely put things intended for cloudy and rainy weather in his suitcase, since you will definitely have to face it.  Waterproof shoes also will not be superfluous.  In reviews of vacations at Georgian resorts, it is often noted that sometimes you have to move along a military road and go to caves - for this you definitely need to bring a warm sweater or a lightweight sports jacket. </p><p>  Tourists who travel to Georgia for winter resorts are advised not to dress very warmly - just take a light jacket for walking with you. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Where in this country is the best to spend the beach season?  In the reviews of tourists about the sea in Georgia, you can sometimes read that the best coastal zones are in resort cities such as Batumi, Kobuleti, Kvariati, Ureki, Gonio, as well as Chakvi.  In these cities, all beaches are washed by the clean and warm Black Sea. </p><p>  Many comments of tourists say that staying on the Georgian coast in high season leaves only pleasant memories.  Here, infrastructure is actively developing around, there are many places for recreation and entertainment and, best of all, swimming and staying on the beach can be alternated with visits to amazing sights. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is noted that in recent years, beach vacations in Georgia have reached a new level, which cannot but please tourists from various countries of the world, including Russia. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.choicehotels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Georgia for tourists" class="if uuid-3259390" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/3259390.jpg"></div><h2>  Where to stay </h2><p>  In the reviews of tourists about holidays in Georgia, it is often said that there are no tourists in this country - only guests are here.  The population is distinguished by special hospitality, as well as cordiality.  Therefore, if you are not planning a business trip, it is best to forget about the hotel - you need to live closer to the private sector, in guest houses, where, believe me, excellent conditions are created for people of any age. </p><p>  If you plan to relax in Batumi or Tbilisi, you can book a cheap room in a hotel located closer to the main attractions.  When choosing housing in large cities, you should not focus on those places that are located in the very center - it is better to give preference to remote regions, because it is much calmer there, and the prices are much lower. </p><h2>  The main attractions that you must visit </h2><p>  It is worth noting that in Georgia there are not so many legendary sights as it might seem at first glance.  Having been in this small country, fans of beautiful views should definitely visit the Caucasus Mountains, which in height are barely inferior to the Himalayas. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Surely everyone heard about the legendary Georgian wines.  In order to taste the best of them, it is worth looking into Kakheti, which is famous as a wine-making region. </p><p>  In the summer, Georgia for tourists is primarily a resort region.  Fans of relaxation on the beach must visit Batumi.  To date, this city is considered the most progressive Black Sea resort. </p><p>  Fans of sightseeing and visiting interesting places should definitely visit Jvari and Mtskheta - these cities are described in Lermontov's legendary poem "Mtsyri".  There is definitely something to see for guests from Russia. </p><p>  What other attractions can Georgia boast about?  These include: </p><ul><li>  Ananuri fortress; </li><li>  David Gareji Monastery; </li><li>  Burn; </li><li>  Uplistsikhe; </li><li>  Vardzia; </li><li>  Kutaisi. </li></ul><p>  Of course, people vacationing in Georgia should not miss the opportunity to visit the area of ‚Äã‚Äãpopular mineral springs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pt.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What tourists bring from Georgia" class="if uuid-3259386" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/3259386.jpg"></div><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Who has not heard of Georgian national cuisine?  If you relax in this picturesque country, you should definitely try the traditional dishes of local cuisine, which are offered at every step. </p><p>  The recommendations of tourists often say that, having arrived in Georgia on vacation, you should definitely visit the local markets, which offer home-cooked food, as well as natural food and fresh fruits grown in home gardens, the price of which is pleasantly surprising. </p><p>  As for going to restaurants, they are relatively inexpensive.  Practice shows that in high-class catering establishments for a full lunch, which will include both the first and second courses, as well as beer and tarragon, you will have to leave about 60 lari, which in translation into Russian currency will be about 1400 rubles. </p><p>  Practice shows that when traveling together in Georgia, the item of food expenses should be calculated on the basis of 100 GEL per day (2380 rubles), but this is provided that tourists do not know the word "savings". </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinnaclecabinrentals.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Georgia photo tourists" class="if uuid-3259387" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/3259387.jpg"></div><h2>  Do I need to take a car? </h2><p>  Having decided what to see in Georgia, a tourist begins to think about whether he needs to take a car in order to travel to local attractions.  In the reviews of Russians, it is often noted that the presence of a vehicle significantly reduces waste in the event that travelers planned to attend excursions over long distances.  Moreover, independent trips by car allow you to explore the sights at your own pace, without focusing on anyone, as always happens in the case of group excursions. </p><p>  In the event that a long stay in the country is planned, within the framework of which a trip from city to city will be carried out, it is still worth taking a car with you. </p><p>  If a tourist does not have his own car, he can easily rent a vehicle only by crossing the state border.  The cost of renting a car here costs about 20-35 euros per day, depending on the brand of car. </p><h2>  How long to go </h2><p>  Travelers from Russia strongly recommend not to go to Georgia for long - 3-4 days are enough to carry out an interesting study.  During this time, you can arrange several excursions to the most interesting destinations concentrated in a particular region. </p><p>  If a tourist sets himself the goal of exploring the whole country, then a couple of weeks will be quite enough for this.  So, a week is enough to thoroughly explore Tbilisi and Batumi, and the rest of the time can be spent on other regions. </p><h2>  What to bring with you </h2><p>  By tradition, it turned out that tourists, leaving for some countries, buy souvenirs there for relatives and friends.  What do tourists bring from Georgia? </p><p>  In reviews of this country, it is often noted that the country offers in its markets a real abundance of souvenir products.  Here you can find unique horns, daggers, carpets, incredible beauty handmade jewelry and much more.  Experienced travelers notice that when choosing a souvenir, it is important to pay attention to its authenticity, because in reality there are often cases when tourists buy knives and daggers made not by hand, as well as horns from ordinary, but quite durable plastic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.holidayme.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest in Georgia; reviews of tourists" class="if uuid-3259389" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/3259389.jpg"></div><p>  The most popular souvenir from Georgia is wine.  Moreover, it is considered popular as a home-made drink, as well as purchased at eminent wineries.  Tourists should pay special attention to the local moonshine, which, according to seasoned travelers, cannot be compared even with the best brandy in terms of strength and taste.  This drink is made from grapes, and sold at almost every step. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.itinari.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Georgia for tourists from Russia" class="if uuid-3259388" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/3259388.jpg"></div><h2>  How much is the rest </h2><p>  In the reviews of tourists about holidays in Georgia, it is often said that people like this country for their acceptable vacation prices.  According to vacationers, the main item of waste is transportation costs.  In the recommendations of experienced tourists, it is noted that it is best to go to this wonderful country by plane. </p><p>  In their reviews, Russians who visited Georgia very often advise visiting this country as part of individual excursions.  It is not recommended to take group tours, as they do not allow exploring this state in the way that a tourist really wants. </p><p>  Practice shows that to stay together in a country for a couple of weeks, it is enough to take about 1100 GEL with you, which is equivalent to 26,000 rubles.  True, this amount, given as an example, is indicated without taking into account transportation costs and taking into account the fact that the couple will go on trips every other day and only at medium distances. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.standard.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Georgia vacation travel tips" class="if uuid-3259384" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/3259384.jpg"></div><h2>  In what currency should I take money with me to Georgia </h2><p>  In the framework of the topic ‚ÄúWhat tourists need to know about Georgia‚Äù, it is imperative to mention in what currency the funds should be taken with you on a trip. </p><p>  It is worth noting that in any local city there are exchange points where a tourist can receive lari - funds in local currency.  By the way, these points accept a huge number of types of currencies, including rubles and dollars, therefore, most likely, there will be no problems with the exchange. </p><p>  It is worth noting that in Georgian cities, settlements are often made in rubles, but the rate here is not very pleasant, so you should still stock up on GEL. </p><p>  In the reviews of the country in question, it is often mentioned that a tourist can travel across Georgia with an international format card - it allows you to pay securely in stores, transport, when buying tickets, etc. Of course, if you are relaxing in the mountains, then the map is here a tourist is not an assistant - you must have cash with you, and in local currency - GEL. </p><p>  From a photo of tourists in Georgia, one can judge how wonderful and versatile this country is.  It is interesting to visit for people of different ages and for owners of different income levels.  The first thing you should definitely go here is the local wine, which can be found everywhere! </p>
