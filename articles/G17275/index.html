  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why Vertu phones are so expensive: features of the manufacturing process</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Surely every person is surprised why Vertu phones are so expensive.  Are there really any unique features in these models that differ significantly from the options of standard smartphones?  And even if there are a number of additional features, is it really worth such a huge amount of money? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mobile-review.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Four phones" class="if uuid-2601146" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/2601146.jpg"></div><p>  In fact, speaking about why Vertu phones are so expensive, it is worth noting that these devices do not have any secret lines or additional features.  Phones of this brand were designed as a means of communication for very influential people who are used to buying everything only exclusive and for crazy money.  By and large, this is not a way of communication, but a demonstration of the status of the owner of such equipment. </p><h2>  Production Features </h2><p>  The production of expensive phones began 20 years ago at one of Nokia's factories, which was opened in England.  A world-famous manufacturer decided to launch a line of luxury phones for "special" users. </p><p>  When answering the question why all Vertu phones are so expensive, first of all, it is worth considering that each device is assembled manually.  After that, the expensive gadget goes to a modern testing laboratory, where the device goes through ‚Äúall the circles of hell‚Äù to prove its quality.  This is understandable, because if a person buys a phone that costs the same as a sports car, then he wants to get a unit that will work even on the Moon. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If a defect or defect is detected at one of the production stages, then a council of developers is going to solve the problem or withdraw the entire batch.  Moreover, all this happens with the use of ultramodern equipment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Vertu on the table" class="if uuid-2601151" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/2601151.jpg"></div><p>  Speaking about why Vertu phones are so expensive, just consider the process of attaching sapphire crystal to the LCD screen of the gadget in more detail.  All manipulations are carried out in an isolated laboratory so that even the smallest dust particle cannot get between the layers.  If this happens, then an expensive gadget may be discarded.  In this case, the air must be renewed at a frequency of 10 minutes. </p><h2>  Quality checking </h2><p>  If you still have a question, why Vertu phones are so expensive, then it is worth considering how thorough tests are conducted to create this model.  First, a prototype is made, which is dropped, torn, bent, subjected to sharp freezing, etc. A 200-gram piece of metal is even dropped onto the screen of the gadget.  If the device withstands all "bullying", then only after that it is sent to mass production. </p><p>  However, even after that, quality control continues.  From each batch, specialists select one random apparatus and re-check it for impact resistance. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Jewelry </h2><p>  If you look at the photo of the Vertu phone, why these models are so expensive, it becomes extremely clear. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thememo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Diamonds on the case" class="if uuid-2601140" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/2601140.jpg"></div><p>  Firstly, the product design was developed by the best specialists in this field.  Initially, the phone is not decorated with jewelry, but most millionaires want their gadget to be different from the rest.  Therefore, an individual order is created.  At the request of the client, Vertu can be decorated with white gold, platinum, titanium alloy and, of course, diamonds.  Additionally, a top-quality leather case and much more can be made.  Each pebble is set in its place by the craftsmen manually.  Some people order monograms or want to get a copy of the original painting on the device‚Äôs cover. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.luxuryvertu.cn" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Covered in leather" class="if uuid-2601154" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/2601154.jpg"></div><h2>  Why are all Vertu phone models so expensive </h2><p>  If we talk about the functionality of these expensive gadgets, then there is nothing special about them.  Moreover, the functionality of the phone can even be called rather meager.  Therefore, those who cannot buy even one screw from Vertu should not be upset. </p><p>  Such a high cost is explained by expensive materials, decorations and the process of manufacturing devices.  In all other respects, such gadgets are noticeably inferior to smartphones.  However, a millionaire is unlikely to try to work on the phone or read documents in Word.  Status is much more important for him and so that he can make calls from anywhere in the world.  Therefore, in these models you can not find Hi-Tech technologies or first-class resolution cameras.  So do not despair if you could not get hold of this expensive "toy." </p>
