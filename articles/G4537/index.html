    <p>  The rich cultural heritage and varied excursion program attract all travelers who choose a picturesque island as their vacation spot.  Paphos is considered the birthplace of Aphrodite, and its most beautiful corners are connected with the goddess. </p><p>  The bay, where, according to legend, the ever-young daughter of the great Zeus came out of the foam, is the most popular place for city guests, and it seems that the local landscape has not changed for several centuries, and the grotto, in which the lady took baths, is amazingly beautiful.  Tourists seek to swim on the beach next to a natural attraction in order to get a gift from the beautiful goddess - beauty and youth. </p><h2>  Ancient burial places </h2><p>  An interesting excursion to the tombs, in which local aristocrats were buried, will appeal to connoisseurs of ancient history.  Burials made before our era are hollowed out right in the hill and look like underground chambers.  Because of their special luxury, they were called royal.  Spacious halls decorated with carved columns and frescoes, the legendary island is incredibly proud.  <span>Paphos (Cyprus)</span> takes care of preserving for the descendants of the world's oldest tombs.  Now archaeological work is being carried out, bringing annually new finds. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="island cyprus city paphos" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1400934.jpg" width="600"></div>
