But not only this attracts tourists and avid fishermen, because the coast of the river, drowning in greenery, is simply mesmerizing with its virgin beauty.  It is very easy to approach the river, and only in places you can meet swampy, swamp-covered areas. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The Mga River flows on the territory of one of the districts of the Leningrad Region - Kirovsky.  The length of this picturesque river is about 93 km.  Although now it is considered one of the tributaries of the Neva, earlier, even before the formation of the Neva River, the Mga flowed into Lake Ladoga. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kirovsk-portal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The beauty of the Mga River" class="if uuid-2906814" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93625/2906814.jpg"></div><p>  The Mga River originates from Lake Maluksinsky, and then, combining with tributaries, it gains its unique grandeur.  In total, this river has about 10 tributaries: </p><ol><li>  Voitolovka. </li><li>  Yurina. </li><li>  Rocky. </li><li>  Carbuselka. </li><li>  Squeaky. </li><li>  Birch. </li><li>  Strelkovsky. </li><li>  Vyazemsky. </li><li>  Staroselsky. </li><li>  Oak. </li></ol><p>  Each of these tributaries flowing into the Mga River flows in the locality of the same name, from where the name of each of them came from.  The size of the river basin is about 754 km2, which allows feeding a total of more than 13-15 settlements: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Pogoste. </li><li>  Belogolovo. </li><li>  Yerzunovo. </li><li>  Muya. </li><li>  Turyshkino. </li><li>  Petrovo. </li><li>  Lezier. </li><li>  Sologubovka. </li><li>  Pukholovo. </li><li>  Mga. </li><li>  The mountains. </li><li>  Country. </li><li>  Pavlovo-on-Neva. </li></ol><p>  But not only this is famous for the river Mga.  During the Second World War, the river ran along the front line, due to which it is considered one of the rivers with a rich history, which is either sung in poems and songs, or films made during the war years are shot on its territory.  And no wonder, because on the left bank of the river post-war trenches, dilapidated dugouts and an old cemetery with burial places of German soldiers are still preserved. </p><h2>  Climatic features </h2><p>  Due to the Atlantic-continental climate of the Leningrad Region and frequent precipitation in the form of rain in the spring-summer period, as well as snow in the autumn-winter period, the Mga River increases the basin area even more.  However, despite heavy rainfall in the form of snow and rain, the general climate is considered moderate with not very cold winters and not very hot summers.  This, in turn, has a very beneficial effect on the river and its river inhabitants. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mga river" class="if uuid-2906808" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93625/2906808.jpg"></div><h2>  Variety of river fish </h2><p>  The river Mga of the Leningrad region is very rich in fish.  Here you can find both ordinary river fish, and more valuable, listed in the Red Book.  The favorable ecology of the river attracts river inhabitants, as if with a magnet, and there are many of them.  According to general estimates, about 20 species of individuals live in the river, namely: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Bream. </li><li>  Pike. </li><li>  Zander. </li><li>  Roach. </li><li>  Perch. </li><li>  Catfish. </li><li>  Gustera. </li><li>  Dace. </li><li>  Ide. </li><li>  Burbot. </li><li>  Bleak. </li><li>  Grayling. </li><li>  Krasnoperka. </li><li>  Gudgeon. </li><li>  Chub. </li><li>  Lamprey and others. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Mga River Fish" class="if uuid-2906816" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93625/2906816.jpg"></div><p>  But not only this river is rich in fish, in some areas you can also find crustaceans.  The river is not always clean, sometimes you can notice water pollution by industrial waste, as a result of which sometimes the fish die. </p><h2>  Fishing feature </h2><p>  <span>You can fish on the Mga River both in the spring-summer period and in the autumn-winter period.</span>  <span>The abundance of fish affects even the most fastidious fishermen.</span>  <span>Basically, they use both a net and an ordinary fishing rod to catch it on the Mga River.</span>  <span>Although experienced fishermen are advised to opt for spinning.</span> </p><p>  <span>Particular attention should be paid to the choice of bait, it should not be very large or, conversely, too small.</span>  <span>The best option is 5-7 cm bait in the form of a wobbler or jig.</span>  <span>Although you can use the more traditional method, fishing on an earthworm or salt dough.</span> </p><p>  <span>Do not forget about the right time for fishing.</span>  <span>It was traditionally believed that the best time for fishing is around 4-5 in the morning.</span>  <span>But since the river is in the Leningrad Region, and the dawn comes much later, especially in the autumn-winter time, it is best to start fishing at 7-8 a.m.</span>  <span>Although there are craftsmen who can fish in the afternoon and evening.</span> </p><p>  <span>Not only the size of the catch, but also the size of the fish itself will depend on the choice of fishing location.</span>  <span>Usually, only small and medium-sized fish are found on the Mga River, and larger specimens can be caught closer to the Neva.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="vsereki.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mga river landscape" class="if uuid-2906818" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93625/2906818.jpg"></div><p>  <span>However, it is not always possible to fish in this river, since there are certain days when fishing is prohibited, this is the period of spawning.</span>  <span>So before you go fishing, you should know in advance whether fishing is allowed during this period or not.</span> </p><h2>  Best fishing spots </h2><p>  For those who are interested where the best place is, it should be noted that fishing on the Mga River of the Leningrad Region will be successful everywhere, and all because it is simply teeming with fish.  Anyone can choose a place for fishing at their discretion, it can be both a place near the bridge and the coast.  Although experienced fishermen still prefer to fish from a boat, as this is the only way to get to really "fish" places. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nevnov.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mga river in summer" class="if uuid-2906820" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93625/2906820.jpg"></div><h2>  Travel Guide </h2><p>  Surely fishing enthusiasts are interested in how to get to the Mga River and which method of transportation should be chosen.  By far, the train is considered the best transport for the trip.  So, in order to get to the Mga River, you will need to catch a train from the Pogost station to the Mga station, and from there you can easily reach the river.  However, for those who like to travel on their own transport, it will not be difficult to overcome this route, for this it will be necessary to overcome about 70 km in just 1-1.5 hours along the P-41 highway.  More experienced fishermen prefer to overcome this route by swimming along the Neva River up to the Mga River. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="59.6717064" data-lng="31.1949889" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="9"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/0/3/2/3/10323.png"></div><p>  It doesn't matter which way you choose to get to the river, the main thing is to choose the right time and place for fishing.  And then for sure your catch will be the envy of many seasoned fishermen. </p>
