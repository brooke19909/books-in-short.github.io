Hotel sites often do not provide an opportunity to create an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe location of the hotel.  Reviews of tourists are too subjective.  Not the fact that what they liked will please you, and vice versa.  But the pictures ... Of course, and they can be processed in Photoshop, but in the case of such an incredibly beautiful country like Malaysia, this is not necessary.  What is there?  Bright butterflies, lush greenery of the jungle, <span>tea plantations</span> on the mountain slopes, covered with fog, snow-white beaches, megalopolises sparkling with neon lights, ancient temples and noisy bazaars - all this is Malaysia.  The photos seem to fascinate you and attract you to see everything with your own eyes.  So let's take this virtual journey to the land of tropical dreams! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Malaysia photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/455442.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Malaysia Map </h2><p>  For starters - a few dry facts about this country.  The territory of Malaysia occupies part of the mainland, and also many islands, of which each is unique in its own way.  There are humid <span>tropical forests,</span> and mountains, and beaches.  The capital of the state is the city of Kuala Lumpur.  This is not the only metropolis in the country.  If you miss the urban lifestyle, welcome to Johor Bahru, Georgetown or Kuantan.  But the real rest in Malaysia, photos are presented from completely different places: Sipadan, Penang, Langkawi.  Looking at these pictures, one involuntarily doubts: is it possible in our 21st century to find somewhere in the world such sparsely populated beaches with the purest, like icing sugar, sand, such turquoise lagoons with clear water?  Yes, it is a fact.  While in Goa, the resorts of Thailand or Vietnam, there is nowhere for an apple to fall, patriarchal bucolics remained in Malaysia.  Local residents, mainly Muslims, have not yet experienced the corrupting influence of Western culture.  Therefore, when visiting temples or villages, you should dress more modestly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Malaysia kuala lumpur photo" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/455445.jpg" width="600"></div>

From Moscow, Novosibirsk and Yekaterinburg to Kuala Lumpur only charters fly during the peak season, which falls on the winter months and even on <span>May holidays.</span>  But it should be remembered that there are places in Malaysia where there is no pronounced rainy season, and you can relax there all year round.  This is the west coast, as well as the islands of Pangkor, Penang and Langkawi.  And in the eastern part of the country it is most comfortable to relax from May to September.  You can get to Malaysia with regular flights with <span>transfers in Doha</span> or Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Beijing or Tashkent, Bangkok or Singapore.  You can use the services of European air carriers - KLM, Air France or Lufthansa.  Then connecting flights will be to <span>Amsterdam, Paris</span> or Frankfurt.  Travel time varies from fourteen hours to a day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Malaysia capital photo" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/455462.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur </h2><p>  Photos of tourists usually represent the country as a place of quiet idyllic relaxation.  And so it is.  Those who like foam discos on the beach are best off to Ibiza in Spain, the Indian state of Goa or Thailand, to Koh Phangan Island.  However, in Malaysia, nightlife lovers can find what they need.  Meet Kuala Lumpur, the greenest capital of Asia!  The megalopolis received this title for the abundance of parks.  Unlike Bangkok, it is extremely easy to breathe here, but shady on the streets.  At the same time, the metropolis is rich in ultra-modern buildings.  Photos and postcards are obligatory presented by the twin towers of the Petronas Twin Towers.  They have 88 floors.  Between the buildings at the 41st level there is a bridge that serves as an observation deck.  The tour program also includes visits to the Royal Palace, Sri Mahamariam Temple, butterfly and orchid parks and Chinatown.  Well, after <span>sunset</span> you can light up in the morning in one of the night clubs.  The most popular are The Beach and Bollywood.  Both are on P. Ramlee Street.  Always fun in El Nino, near the Nikko Hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Malaysia vacation photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/455465.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Bazaars, souvenirs, shopping </h2><p>  Only in spontaneous bazaars you can feel the whole eastern flavor of the country of Malaysia.  The photos show the endless rows of batik, silver and gold jewelry, woven from straws and graceful carvings carved from wood.  Fans of shopping can also ask for completely European goods: electronics, watches, household appliances.  Real Malay souvenirs should be found in the labyrinths of the Chinatown of the capital, as well as on the streets of Masjid India and Jalan Melayu.  The shopping artery of Kuala Lumpur Petaling Street is also known for its shopping centers.  You can buy not only in the capital, but even in the smallest resort in the country. </p><h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  The hotel base is well developed in Penang, Langkawi, as well as in that part of the <span>island of Kalimantan (Borneo),</span> which is occupied by Malaysia.  Rest - the photos demonstrate this in all evidence - it will be idyllic.  If you like hotels with large buildings, choose Penang.  In other places, hotels consisting of bungalows predominate.  There are hotels of three, four and five stars.  In Borneo, vacation is a little cheaper.  Budget hotels are classified into "bed and breakfast", "guesthouse", "resthouse", small hotels and pensions.  The plugs here are of the English type.  The adapter can be bought at the store or taken at the reception. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Malaysia photo beaches" class="if" height="364" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/455466.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Malaysia: photo of the beaches </h2><p>  No matter where the hotel is located, on the first line or away from the sea, and the beaches are still common.  This is a plus (you can choose a place for tanning to taste) and a minus (no one is responsible for missing things).  However, the risk of losing a wallet in Malaysia is minimal - the crime rate is low here.  Wherever you go in Malaysia, you have a great beach vacation.  But the Langkawi archipelago is still famous for its true healing sand.  It is located in <span>the Strait of Malacca.</span>  Only four of the 99 islands are inhabited.  These are Pulau-Langkawi, Dayyang-Bunting, Singa and Tuba.  There are many minerals in the volcanic sand here.  It treats osteochondrosis and rheumatism.  In addition, the beaches here are colorful: the sand on the Black Sands is blue-black, on the Wet Rice - snow-white, and on the Payar - pink.  The most picturesque place in Langkawi is Tanjong Rhu.  And the beach of Pasir Hitam is interesting in that white and black grains of sand are mixed here. </p><h2>  Malacca </h2><p>  Want to feel the atmosphere of old Malaysia?  Then you will find the ancient capital of the country of Malacca.  This city is located 150 kilometers from Kuala Lumpur.  Here you will find everything Malaysia is famous for.  The capital, whose photos are very interesting, is known for its ancient temples.  In Malacca, the oldest Chinese monastery complex, Cheng Hong Teng, is also located.  There is also a Christian shrine - the church of St. Paul.  It rises not far from the mighty fortress of Athamos.  To get to know the sights of Malacca, just stay at the resort of Port Dickson.  There are wonderful beaches and excellent tourist infrastructure. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Malaysia photo" class="if" height="376" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/455470.jpg" width="515"></div>

    <h2>  Penang </h2><p>  This island near Malacca has long been connected to the mainland by bridges.  There are many Buddhist and Hindu temples.  But they are the hallmark of the country of Malaysia.  Photos of the temples of the Serpents (poisonous reptiles lie there right on the altar), the <span>Dragon of the Mountains,</span> Black Water or Ten Thousand Buddhas are replicated on postcards and posters.  In the center of the island is Mount Penang with a viewing platform on top.  The main city, Georgetown, recalls British rule.  It was built on the site of the Cornwallis military fort.  Christians can visit the church of St. George.  There is also a Chinese temple, Kuan Yin Teng. </p>
