    <p>  The economy in our country required some stabilization, the development of sustainable and timely growth, however, this was only possible under the policy of the NEP.  The qualitative stage of development could begin only thanks to a new industrial upsurge, in particular in the military sphere.  The NEP foresaw all possible ways of becoming, but they went against the ideas of a communist society, which ultimately led to the emergence of concepts such as industrialization and collectivization. </p><p>  Industrialization in the USSR originates in December 1925 after the Fourteenth Party Congress.  Consider this concept in more detail.  Industrialization is the process of forming large-scale machine production, which is aimed at all sectors of economic activity.  In fact, only a village could be a serious investment source for a reversal of such a mass event.  Industrialization and collectivization together represented a competent state policy, where the first is aimed at development, while the second directly outlined the non-economic methods of forcing peasants to work.  And although there was a general reduction in agricultural production, revenues for the state were colossal. </p><p>  An additional motive power was the <span>Great Depression of</span> 1929-33, which was occurring in the West.  The crisis simply forced Europeans to seek new product markets, and the Soviet Union was the most suitable place with unlimited financial opportunities.  As a result, during the period of the main stage of industrialization (from 1928 to 1938), three quarters of all equipment was already imported.  Thus, both industrialization and collectivization fully justified themselves in the eyes of the country's political figures. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is worth noting that the technology for implementing industrialization was new.  It was based on five-year plans for the development of the national economy in the USSR.  It is worth saying that before the <span>start of the war</span> , five such plans were adopted.  In the sphere of development of the entire national economy, all methods created a certain advantage, however, in fact, the planned development framework was not implemented.  Due to the <span>planned economy,</span> it was possible to concentrate immediately on the promotion of strategically important industries, for example, on <span>heavy industry,</span> transport, defense industry, energy and others.  Already during the years of the <span>first five-year plan,</span> industrialization and collectivization have yielded results: more than 1.5 thousand different factories and plants have been built.  In the second five-year period, the number reaches 4.5 thousand.  Thus, by the thirties, the Soviet Union became a powerful industrialized power that imposes competition on the prosperous states of the West. </p><p>  Industrialization brought a lot of positive aspects, not counting progress in industry: unemployment in the country was eliminated, highly skilled workers appeared, engineers were actively trained, progress began in terms of general education.  Social horizons were greatly increased, and people began to strive to make their careers.  But all this hit another area - the village, which paid for everything. </p><p>  Collectivization was aimed at the elimination of the individual economy, at the emergence of a new social economy.  The free use of manufactured products was excluded; all of it was shipped to the state.  As a result, there were problems with food.  Mass collectivization starts in 1929.  Since this period, for a couple of months there are already 2.4 million farms on collective farms that have entered there, which significantly exceeded the figure of the past 12th anniversary.  Naturally, the village perceives such orders with hostility, but the state responds firmly and irrevocably, sending out a detachment of "twenty-five thousandths."  Punitive organs come to the fore. </p><p>  A collectivization schedule is also being formed, which sets the pace of economic development.  It is worth noting the emergence of a certain spirit of competition, when leaders had a desire to exceed their schedule.  The repressive measures were tightened in order to suppress mass resistance.  It is here that there is a need for a passport system, which the state introduces, but it does not apply to peasants.  As a result, they again lose some freedom, since they cannot move anywhere without a passport (they turn out to be attached to a particular site).  It is easy to guess who was again humiliated and offended.  Subsequently, in 1932, mass famine begins. </p>
