Today, it, in essence, is partly a pedestrian street, and its name has become synonymous with the top leadership of our country.  This article will tell you what Old Square in Moscow is famous for, how to get there and what <span>sights of the capital</span> there are. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><div class="photo" data-original="tournavigator.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="monument to the heroes of Plevna" class="if uuid-2359408" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2359408.jpg"></div><p>  Kitay Gorod in Moscow is a historical district of the Russian capital.  In the 1530s, it was enclosed by the Kitay-Gorod fortress wall and was built up within its borders. </p><p>  The fire of 1812 destroyed China Town.  When restoring the area, wide driveways along the fortress wall were cleared.  As a result, Old Square appeared in Kitay-Gorod and Kitaygorodsky passage. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.7552299" data-lng="37.63162360000001" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/8/6/3/1863.png"></div><p>  At the end of the 19th century, the Moscow authorities demolished the bustling market, which was located near the fortress walls, and carried out a large-scale reconstruction of Kitai Gorod.  14 years before the start of World War I, there were built: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  a hotel and, as they would say today, the Boyarsky Dvor business center at the Barbarian Gate; </li><li>  apartment building on the corner of st.  Ilyinki; </li><li>  business center, which in the Soviet period was the Central Committee of the CPSU (b) / CPSU. </li></ul><h2>  Hotel "Boyarsky Dvor" </h2><p>  This is perhaps one of the most interesting buildings on the Old Square in Moscow. </p><p>  The five-story impressive house on the hill was built in the years 1901-1903 by architects Shekhtel and Galetsky.  The project‚Äôs customers were the metropolitan fire insurance company and Morozov‚Äôs Bogorodsk-Glukhov manufactory.  The first 3 floors of the building, which were not visible due to the massive wall of Kitai Gorod, were devoid of any architectural decorations and were originally intended to accommodate retail premises and offices.  The 4th and 5th floors, towering above the wall, were decorated like an ancient fortress and housed the rooms of the Boyarsky Dvor hotel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rutraveller.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ilyinsky Square" class="if uuid-2359410" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2359410.jpg"></div><h2>  Church of the Nativity of John the Baptist </h2><p>  This temple is on the corner with Varvarka.  It was built in 1741 on the site of a pre-existing church with the money of the manufacturer F. Podsevalshchikov.  The most spectacular parts of this structure were its completion.  In the future, they even served as a model for the construction of the upper part of the Church of the Introduction to the Temple of the Pyatnitsky Monastery in Sergiev Posad.  The walls were decorated with platbands of complex shape, and above them there were octagonal horizontal windows with their own design. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After the October Revolution, the temple was rebuilt.  Fortunately, he escaped demolition, although he lost his domes and was closed in the late 1920s.  Then they began to use it as housing and for economic purposes. </p><p>  In the early 2000s, the restoration of the Church of the <span>Nativity of John the Baptist began.</span>  In 2014, the restoration of the bell tower was completed.  At the moment, restoration work is ongoing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.photo-moskva.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Building on Old Square" class="if uuid-2359412" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2359412.jpg"></div><h2>  Other attractions on the Old Square in Moscow </h2><p>  Those who first appeared in the capital should also get acquainted with other attractions located in this part of Kitai Gorod.  It: </p><ul><li>  <span>Monument-chapel to the heroes of Plevna.</span>  <span>The monument</span> was erected in Kitay-Gorod in the city of Moscow at the end of the 19th century in honor of the anniversary of the battle, in which hundreds of Russian fighters gave their lives.  It was built on the voluntary donations of citizens.  Initially, the chapel was to be installed in Bulgaria.  However, when relations with this country worsened in 1885, they decided to leave her in Moscow.  Today, the chapel is open only on holidays, so it‚Äôs not always possible to enter and admire the interior of the monument. </li></ul><ul><li>  Trading house of the Armand family.  The building was built by architect V.V. Sherwood.  As a result of numerous alterations today, both features of St. Petersburg classicism and the Stalinist Empire are visible in his appearance. </li></ul><ul><li>  <span>Ilyinsky square.</span>  This corner of the Old Square in Moscow is a favorite place for walks of residents of nearby residential buildings.  There are always many mothers with babies and senior citizens. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.mmsk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Part of the old square" class="if uuid-2359413" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2359413.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  It is easiest to get to the Old Square in Moscow by metro.  Directly under Ilyinsky Square is the Kitay-Gorod metro station, which was formerly called the Nogin Square.  It has several exits, including directly to the Old Square.  Trains running along the Kaluga-Riga and Tagansko-Krasnopresnenskaya lines run through this station. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wikimapia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="administration building" class="if uuid-2359474" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2359474.jpg"></div><p>  Now you know what sights are on the Old Square in Kitay-Gorod in the city of Moscow.  They allow you to feel the spirit of merchant antiquity, which is on the verge of extinction. </p>
