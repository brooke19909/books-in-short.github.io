Of course, they all deserve our attention, but there are those that need to be seen at least once in a lifetime by every person.  By the way, the name of ancient castles is often very harmonious, causing a desire to admire the ancient strongholds of knights and kings.  In order not to be unfounded, let us consider some as an example. </p><h2>  Austria.  Mirabell Castle </h2><p>  In ancient times, almost everything was done out of love.  Feats were accomplished, wars began, and castles were created - ancient and unusual today.  Beautiful stone structures were often presented to their lovers as a wedding gift or as a sign of eternal love.  And Mirabell Castle, which is located in Austria, is no exception.  It was built in 1606 by order of Archbishop Wolf Dietrich, who later gave the fortress to a lady to whom he had tender feelings.  After the death of the archbishop, Mirabell Castle fell into very different hands.  Its new owners did everything possible to change and rebuild the structure, therefore, to this day the fortress practically did not retain its original appearance.  But even this did not prevent Mirabelle from becoming one of the most colorful and magnificent castles in Europe.  And this is by no means an exaggeration.  Despite the fact that the castles - ancient, beautiful and unusual - are quite common throughout Austria, it was Mirabel that became the pearl of the Crassic baroque in Salzburg. </p>

    <h2>  Germany.  Leo Castle </h2><p>  If you have visited Germany at least once, in particular the city of Kassel, it means that you have certainly visited one of the most popular routes here, called the German Fairy Tale Road.  On it you can meet the medieval castle of Leo, which could easily become a great place for the adaptation of some fantastic story.  For some time the fortress was even called the second Disneyland.  Many believe that ancient castles were built in the Middle Ages, and when you look at this building it seems that it could become the pearl of that era.  But it is interesting that the Leo Castle was built only in the XVIII century.  The architect, who was engaged in design and construction, traveled to England before starting work.  There he studied the ruins of numerous fortresses with a romantic history, then to build a real masterpiece.  During World War II, Leo Castle was severely destroyed, but despite this, tourists from all over the world like it very much. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Germany: Neuschwanstein </h2><p>  Ancient and unusual castles are found all over the world, but perhaps Neuschwanstein, which is located on the territory of the same Germany, can be called the craziest embodiment of human imagination.  It was built at the request of King Ludwig, who from childhood had so hated the noisy and dusty of Munich and only dreamed of quickly leaving from there to his own palace.  As soon as he had such an opportunity, Ludwig immediately ordered the construction of a real work of art from stone.  To build the fortress of his dreams, the king spared neither effort nor finances.  The result was Neuschwanstein - the most beautiful and unusual castle in Europe.  Today, thousands of tourists from all over the world come here to take a look at this masterpiece with just one eye.  Unfortunately, the king himself never once saw his dream - he died long before the end of construction. </p>

    <h2>  Czech Republic, Trosky fortress </h2><p>  When visiting the Czech Republic, you should definitely see the castle-fortress, which is called Trosky.  It is located on the territory of the Czech Paradise Nature Reserve.  This name is not accidental, because such landscapes as here are few where you can see.  To date, no one really knows who exactly built the fortress.  But the majority believes that it was the military leader Chenek Wartenberg, who built it in the XIV century.  The view from the castle is so amazing that you cannot forget it for the rest of your life. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Portugal: Pena Castle </h2><p>  Despite the fact that in Portugal there are practically no fortifications that would remain unharmed until today, one fortress still excites the imagination of hundreds of thousands of tourists from all over the world.  Foam doors do not adorn ancient <span>padlocks;</span> it does not welcome guests with the cold of stone; this castle is special.  Its history begins with a chapel, which was built here in the Middle Ages.  Time passed, and around the chapel began to build a monastery.  Unfortunately, it has not survived to our days, as it was completely destroyed in the XVIII century by a strong earthquake.  Until 1838, no one remembered these ruins, until the place caught the eye of Ferdinand II.  It was here that he decided to build his suburban residence. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="old castles" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/486318.jpg" width="500"></div>  Pena Fortress is made in two styles: Islamic Gothic, eclecticism and Neo-Renaissance.  Around a <span>beautiful garden</span> with exotic trees and flowers.  The castle is notable for unusual coloring and architectural details.  At first glance it is difficult to figure out that you see in front of you a fortification that could withstand the onslaught of enemies.  The walls of Foam rise above the city.  It offers an unforgettable view of the streets of Sintra.
