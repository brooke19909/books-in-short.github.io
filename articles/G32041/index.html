Finds related to the life of our ancestors are one of the most interesting components of the modern archaeological process.  However, <span>material evidence of</span> culture plays a special role for historians: witnesses to dances and ceremonies, a lifestyle outside working hours.  Gradually, with the development of thinking, people learned to create truly stunning masterpieces.  We are talking about such a creation as an architectural structure.  Many of them left a memory of themselves only in the annals.  Some still delight tourists with their unusual appearance. </p>

    <p>  At the moment, mankind knows a huge number of amazing masterpieces in its execution.  The first <span>architectural structures,</span> which were created long before the <span>advent of Christianity,</span> were mostly devoted to religious issues.  Faith and love for the gods endowed these buildings with unprecedented power, which allowed them to go through the ages and remain untouched by time.  These are Buddhist temples in Le Ladakh, singing the Eros art of the Kamasutra temples in India, the Inca city in the Peruvian Machu Picchu and many others. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  It is worth noting that a huge number of cultural objects was devoted to love.  In <span>monumental art,</span> the existence of the magnificent Taj Mahal Palace is evidence of this.  This huge architectural structure was erected in the 17th century AD on the territory of India, in the city of Agra.  This masterpiece was built on the orders of the distant descendant of Tamerlane - the emperor Shah Jahan - in honor of the endless love for his third wife Mumtaz-Mahal.  His beautiful wife died during childbirth - their thirteenth child brought the death of his mother.  After her death, Mumtaz Shah turned gray in a matter of days.  In order that his love was always with him, and in honor of the fact that he would never forget about his chosen one, the emperor built the palace. </p><p>  Under the Taj Mahal are two tombs - the emperor and, accordingly, his wife.  The mausoleum, built of white marble, is located on the banks of the Yamuna River.  The construction of this complex lasted more than 20 years.  There is genuine evidence that Shah Jahan wanted to build a similar architectural structure on the opposite bank of the river, but already from black marble.  Through the pond, two complexes were planned to be connected by a bridge.  However, he failed to realize his desire: the emperor was ousted from the throne by his son. </p><p>  This mausoleum is considered the "pearl of India."  Every year it is visited by millions of tourists from all over the world.  Currently, <span>restoration work is</span> underway at the palace <span>,</span> so some of the complex is closed to visitors.  In the 20th century (more precisely in 1983), this architectural structure was recognized as a <span>UNESCO World Heritage</span> Site.  In addition, this mausoleum is one of the seven wonders of the world. </p>

    <p>  Currently, architects around the world are striving to outdo each other, creating the most unusual and sometimes far from practical building.  Everyone is trying to stand out without thinking about the life expectancy of their offspring.  If modern buildings are full of curvature of lines, an excess of details, then ancient architectural structures speak of the greatness of nations, tell of religion and art, carry the banner of greatness and eternity.  Ancient Roman aqueducts, Egyptian pyramids, cathedrals of Europe, temples of Asia - more than one generation will enjoy the beauty and power of the created masterpieces, with varying success trying to translate something more beautiful into reality. </p>
