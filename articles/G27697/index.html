But not so long ago the hotel went through redecoration, so the rooms look like new.

And we will try to create an objective picture of the service that is offered to vacationers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Blue Velvet Hotel 3 *" class="if uuid-2287157" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2287157.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get that near </h2><p>  From the airport to the hotel Blue Velvet Hotel 3 * (Turkey), even with a transfer you need to get about three hours.

To do this, you cross the road (through the underpass).  But the hotel has its own beach, which not every Turkish ‚Äúfour‚Äù can boast of, which is not on the first line.  And this means that sunbeds and umbrellas near the sea are free for guests. </p><p>  The beach is pebble, clean.  There are enough deck chairs and umbrellas, enough for everyone.  The beach is guarded, strangers are not allowed.  The sea is clean and warm, although the entrance to the water is difficult.  Towels are not given, you need to take your own.  The village stands out of the blue, so hotel guests do not need to go down the hill and climb back. </p><p>  The water is warm, clear.  The caretaker on the shore will always help to find a place, bring a sunbed and give you tea.  Often there are waves, so this beach is not suitable for children at such a time. </p><p>  However, the hotel has an outdoor pool for adults with a slide.  There is also a mini pond for children.  The "paddling pool" is very good, the kids are thrilled.  On the beach itself, there are small pebbles, but at the entrance to the water there are plates and large boulders.  If the sea is calm, but you can find a place where children can frolic.  There pebbles are so small, almost like sand.  There are balls on the beach for children, and volleyball courts for adults. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fostertravel.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Blue Velvet Hotel 3 Turkey Alanya" class="if uuid-2287210" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2287210.jpg"></div><h2>  Where to go and what to see </h2><p>  What do you think that they choose 90 percent of Blue Velvet Hotel 3 * hotel guests as a tour object?  Alanya!  They perceive Mahmutlar as such a "sleeping area."  But there are many interesting sights nearby. </p><p>  Lovers of antiquity will surely like the ancient cities of Siedra and Laertes.  For those who prefer natural beauty, experienced tourists are advised to go to the Dimchay River.  There are amazing caves with salt lakes, stalactites and stalagmites.  And here fish restaurants are open, where they cook the most delicious river trout in Turkey. </p><p>  But after exploring the nearby attractions, you can, of course, go to Alanya on your own, ride a pirate yacht, explore the medieval docks and the ancient fortress, and also visit the famous Cleopatra beach with natural yellow sand. </p><p>  Excursion in Pamukkale is quite popular from long trips.  But keep in mind that you will have to travel 6 or more hours, and if you are in Alanya at the height of summer, this is not too pleasant.  In Pamukkale itself you will spend no more than 3 hours.  So keep this in mind if you decide on a trip.  And of course, excursions are best purchased not in the hotel itself, but in street travel agencies.  You will be provided with the same services, but much cheaper. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.holidaycheck.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Blue Velvet Hotel 3 * beach" class="if uuid-2287154" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2287154.jpg"></div><h2>  Blue Velvet Hotel 3 *: tourist reviews </h2><p>  Travelers write that this hotel has excellent management and a very conscientious host.  He likes to talk with guests and often gives them useful tips.  True, a small repair in the lobby would not hurt the hotel. </p><p>  The restaurant is also cramped, which creates lines.  But the rooms are quite comfortable, the food is delicious, if something ends, they always report.  The staff is friendly, cleaned every day. </p><p>  The positive reviews about the Blue Velvet Hotel 3 * hotel, which tourists post on their trip reports, often refer to the hospitality and friendliness of the hosts.  This holiday complex is very cozy and truly homely.  The food, like for three stars, is just great.  You should not expect receptions and seafood from the hotel, and then everything will fall into place. </p><p>  Many recommend this hotel to others and promise to come next year.  Children especially like this hotel, and all its negative aspects are completely overlapped by positive. </p>
