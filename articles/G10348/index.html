But it cannot be said that this is a kind of ‚Äúterra incognita‚Äù.  Despite the almost complete absence of tourist infrastructure, New Zealanders like to relax here, as well as a small number of Canadians and residents of the United States.  But these are mostly extreme people who want to try themselves in the role of modern Miklouho-Maclay.  Because the fatal breath of globalization only barely reaches this island, lost in the vastness of the Pacific Ocean.  Most of its territory is impenetrable jungle.  There is only a ring road along the coast (sometimes three and a half meters wide), and two routes connecting the eastern and western parts of the island.  In this dwarf state, there is only one town - Alofi (aka the capital), which is two merged villages.  What are tourists looking for in Niue?  How to get there, where to settle and what to see, read in this article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Niue Country Photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/778311.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Where is Niue located </h2><p>  Niue is an island country, or rather, a raised coral atoll.  The dwarf state is located in Polynesia, in the Pacific Ocean, between the equator and the South Tropic.  The island is quite remote from other archipelagos.  The nearest islands of Tonga lie 480 kilometers west.  In the east is the Cook archipelago.  Rarotong Island closest to Niue is 930 kilometers away.  In the northwest is the Samoa archipelago.  Niue is an independent public entity that is part of a free association with New Zealand.  In addition to land, the state also owns three underwater <span>coral reefs:</span> Beveridge, Antiope and Harens.  They are exposed only at low tide.  The area of ‚Äã‚ÄãNiue Island is 261.46 square kilometers.  The highest point (without a name, near the village of Mutalau) reaches 68 meters above sea level.  These figures put Niue in the record: the largest single and highest atoll in the world. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Niue country" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/778310.jpg"></div>

The atoll became populated in the first centuries <span>BC by</span> immigrants from Polynesia.  The first European to come to the shores of the island was James Cook (in 1774).  The natives met him with hostility, which is why the navigator gave the atoll the name "Savage" - "Savages".  In 1900, the <span>British Empire</span> took the island under its protectorate.  But a year later, New Zealand annexed it.  When it became not prestigious to have colonies in the second half of the 20th century, the metropolis gave Niue freedom of self-government.  At the same time, the inhabitants of the atoll have the right to New Zealand citizenship.  Since 1974, Niue is a self-governing state entity in partnership with the former colonialist.  Niue is a country composed of the South Pacific Commission and the Polynesian Islands Forum.  As for the state system, this is a constitutional monarchy. </p><h2>  How to get where to settle </h2><p>  Until recently, not one of the Russian tour operators sent travelers to rest in Niue.  The country, whose photos look like illustrations for an earthly paradise, is not experiencing an influx of foreigners.  It is interesting that eighteen and a half thousand Niueans live in New Zealand, while the population of the island is only 1,600 people (according to this indicator, Niue is the third most sparsely populated country in the world after Tokelau and Pitcairn).  But what kind of people they are!  The only flight from Auckland that the local airport is capable of accepting is met by the population with songs and dances.  Before the eyes of a few discouraged tourists, a real show is played out.  And it includes passengers from local, who returned to their homeland from the "mainland".  There are two good hotels on the atoll: Matawai and Namukulu Cottages.  You need to book them in advance.  There are several other simpler hotels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Niue Country Dollar" class="if" height="253" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/778333.jpg" width="457"></div>

Those tourists who visited the atoll recommend stocking up in cash before departing from Auckland, heading to Niue.  A country whose money is <span>New Zealand dollar</span> does not have a single ATM on its territory.  Public transport, by the way, is also.  In good hotels, guests get bicycles for free.  Broadband is available throughout Niue.  But wifi in hotels costs ten New Zealand dollars a day.  All local students in schools are given laptops.  So in the field of IT technology, the Nieuans are ahead of the rest.  Tourists should not have a language barrier.  On the atoll, both young and old speaks excellent English.  It is the second official language. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Niue country money" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/778315.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Climate </h2><p>  Niue is an island located in equatorial latitudes.  Therefore, the climate here is hot and humid.  There are two seasons in a year.  Summer is from November to March.  It is hot and very humid.  Tropical cyclones often fly through, damaging the already underdeveloped infrastructure of the island.  The most destructive was the typhoon Geta, from whom Niue (country) was hit hard in 2005.  The dollar has not fallen so much during the global <span>economic crisis</span> as temperatures are falling during the dry season (April-October).  The atoll lies in the path of the southeast trade winds.  Strong winds blow the sea, strong storms begin.  This period is characterized by sunny and warm days, but rather cool nights.  Beach holidays are not particularly developed on the atoll, since there are few bays, the bottom is shallow and coral, you can swim only in special shoes.  By the way, there are no rivers, nor even streams on the island.  All <span>fresh water</span> comes from <span>artesian wells.</span>  It can be drunk even from the tap. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Niue currency" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/778336.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Attractions Niue </h2><p>  The main wealth of the country is its paradise nature.  The government pays great attention to its protection.  There are several nature reserves on the tiny atoll.  Tourists recommend a trip to Huvalu - this is a virgin forest with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã54 square meters.  km  It occupies the central and eastern parts of the island and is located between the villages of Hakupu and Liku.  Further south begins another park - Hakupu Heritage and Cultural Park.  It is included in the list of the cultural heritage of mankind, since burials and the remains of the dwellings of the ancient inhabitants of the island are located here.  The water area from Cape Macapu is also under state protection.  The currency of Niue - the New Zealand dollar - should not mislead you about prices.  In this former colony, everything is somewhat more expensive than in the metropolis.  And this is justified: products (except coconuts, taro and cassava) arrive on the atoll by plane. </p>
