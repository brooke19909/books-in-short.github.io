Knitting patterns for mittens with needles (photo)</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It is unlikely that our harsh winters can do without mittens.  They are simply irreplaceable in the winter, they keep hands warm much better, than any leather gloves.  However, you can knit them in different ways.  Bright ornament and unusual pattern will make them a beautiful and effective element of the wardrobe.  Let's figure out <span>how to knit mittens</span> with a pattern. </p><h2>  A bit of history <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mittens patterns" class="if" height="404" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13524/348098.jpg" width="350"></div></h2><p>  Mittens with drawings were knitted in ancient times.  Then the pattern on the mittens had a certain meaning.  For example, a chain of rhombs protected from dark forces and served as a "tree of life."  Fish promised fertility next year, and also brought good.  The talisman served as drawings in the form of triangles, stars or birds.  All kinds of crosses meant fire and sun.  The ‚Äúrope‚Äù pattern promised longevity to the owner of such mittens.  At that time, various ornaments were treated with great respect and reverence.  It was a kind of language transmitted from generation to generation.  Such patterns for mittens - amulets - are there today, only people are not always aware of what they mean. </p><h2>  Cooking material </h2><p>  First you need to stock up with yarn for products.  Wool, acrylic, angora, mohair and so on will do.  A plain thread and <span>melange yarn of</span> various colors are suitable.  However, if you want a <span>jacquard pattern,</span> then you need monophonic threads of two colors.  Depending on the pattern, the yarn consumption will be different.  It also depends on the density of the thread.  Approximately one pair will need from 40 to 150 grams of yarn.  You also need thin knitting needles - five pieces.  You can also knit the base of the mittens on two knitting needles, but three more are needed for the finger. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What are the patterns for mittens <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting patterns for mittens" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13524/348101.jpg?1394031804087" width="600"></div></h2><p>  If we talk about patterns, then most often they make a strip, ornament or jacquard.  Of the relief patterns, braids and bumps are especially popular, a little less often - fringe and others.  Mittens with ornaments are especially in demand.  They present an <span>ethnic style</span> or native Russian traditions - depending on the chosen pattern.  And the ornament itself is as follows: </p><p>  1) A large drawing of a simple appearance, made with a contrasting thread in relation to the background. </p><p>  2) Several motifs that are staggered or linear on top of each other. </p><p>  3) Stripes on a single-color canvas. </p><p>  At the same time, threads are always used in contrasting colors: black and white, dark red and yellow, and so on.  Red-white and yellow-black patterns for mittens today at the height of fashion.  Often used and embroidery on top of a simple smooth surface with the addition of beads and sequins. </p><h2>  For beginners <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to knit mittens with a pattern" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13524/348097.jpg?1394031932741" width="594"></div></h2><p>  If you knit mittens for the first time, then resorting to complex patterns is not worth it.  The easiest way to tie the product with one thread of mottled color.  So the pattern will turn out automatically.  You can use a strip or study <span>patterns for mittens.</span>  <span>The</span> ‚Äúcross elastic‚Äù is easily knitted with <span>needles</span> - this is the simplest pattern.  You will need to knit 3 rows of purl, and then 3 rows of facial.  The drawing will turn out voluminous and outstanding.  You can decorate mittens even after knitting, for example, sew funny pompons from the same thread or threads of a contrasting color.  If you are applying for a more complex pattern, use no more than two threads and start with a checkerboard pattern.  It is very simple to perform: you knit three loops with a thread of one color, three loops of another and so on.  After three rows, swap colors. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Children's models <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern for mittens scheme" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13524/348100.jpg?1394031834291" width="600"></div></h2><p>  To make the mittens warmer, they can be made bilateral.  If you knit for a child, then the inside can be knitted from yarn of the "grass" type.  So you imitate animal fur or a pleasant touch of fur.  And at the same time and insulate the finished product.  Do not forget to make a mittens by sewing knitted eyes on it, embroidering a nose and mouth with woolen threads.  If you have enough imagination, you can even tie up the ears, like a mouse.  Eyes can be made from buttons or small beads.  In such jewelry, even a child can help you.  Not required and patterns patterns for mittens.  Knitting needles can be connected with very simple, but original models. </p><h2>  Simple patterns for mittens </h2><p>  It is easier to make a mitten if you connect the palm and back parts separately, and then simply stitch them around the edge.  Here you will use only the <span>front surface</span> and elastic on the cuffs.  One of the simplest patterns can be called "lazy jacquard."  For him, you knit two rows from different balls.  However, you will not get a simple strip, as it seems at first glance.  You will draw the loops from the previous row in the desired alternation, which will give an unusual picture.  Unlike a regular jacquard pattern, the loops will not be pulled back, which will not reduce the size of the mittens during the knitting process.  Finally, if you want to further simplify knitting, tie the entire mitten with a regular rubber band.  It is possible and not quite ordinary, for example, French, Polish, oblique or any other.  In this case, the mittens are suitable for any size, it is very convenient to wear, as it fits tightly on the hand. </p><h2>  Summer options <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting patterns for mittens" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13524/348099.jpg?1394031872872" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Today mittens are also summer, these are lace mitts that are knitted from a thin thread.  The thread may be cotton or silk.  It is important to choose a lace pattern.  However, you can crochet such a model.  Today, wedding models made in this vein are also popular.  Such an accessory will make your ceremony unforgettable and spectacular. </p><h2>  The basic principle of knitting mittens </h2><p>  Usually they fit on four knitting needles.  First, for 5-6 centimeters, you knit with an ordinary rubber band, then any pattern you choose for mittens (the patterns may be different) goes to the base of the thumb.  To tie it, remove 8 loops on a pin, continue knitting in a circle.  3 centimeters before the completion of the mitten, begin to decrease on the sides, making them evenly in each row, until there are only 8 loops.  Now it's time to tie a finger.  To do this, put the loops from the pin on the knitting needles and dial the same number of loops on top and 3 on the sides.  Knit in a circle until you reach the middle of the nail.  Now you need to make the reduction on the sides, until there are 4 loops.  Knit them together.  In the process of knitting, do not forget to try on mittens so that in the final version they fit you well. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Mittens are not as difficult to knit as it might seem.  Start with the front surface to master the form, and then move on to more complex patterns.  Remember that you can decorate finished mittens, for example, crocheted flowers.  Patterns for knitting mittens with knitting needles do not end with those that we have already described, their countless number. </p>
