The DJI Phantom 3 drone was presented to the general public more than a year ago in two versions and very quickly gained popularity around the world, however, Chinese manufacturers decided to go further. </p><p>  Manufacturers launched a new quadrocopter modification - DJI Phantom 3 Standard, which was very different from professional and Advanced models: the two-kilometer communication range was reduced and the camera with video recording in 4K resolution was removed.  Despite the fact that the official manufacturer refers to his new model as Standard, in many media and on third-party resources the name is written through T - Standart. </p><p>  What is the difference between the new DJI Phantom 3 Standard quadrocopter from its predecessors and what features does it have? </p>

    <h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  DJI Phantom 3 Standard is delivered in a cardboard box in the following configuration: </p><ul data-id="5cf8e39c03d7b"><li>  Quadcopter DJI Phantom 3. </li><li>  Battery Li-Pol. </li><li>  Charger with 57W power. </li><li>  Remote control with a radius of 500 meters. </li><li>  4 pieces of spare propellers. </li><li>  Instructions for DJI Phantom 3 Standard, a cover for storing and transporting propellers, an envelope with special stickers on the body. </li><li>  Cable for synchronization with a computer. </li></ul><p>  The package bundle of the new model is practically the same as the one in the DJI Phantom 3 Advanced version.  The only update is the remote control.  A powerful charger is included only in the professional version of the quadrocopter. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Design and specifications DJI Phantom 3 Standard </h2><p>  The case of Phantom 3 Standard, like previous models, is made of high-strength white plastic, resistant to mechanical and physical stresses.  The pure white color of the quadrocopter in some places is blocked by inscriptions and stickers.  Some details of the DJI Phantom 3 Standard - for example, a nameplate with a name and a suspension on the camera module - are made of metal.  Compared with previous models, the new Standard has a lower weight - the quadrocopter is 64 grams lighter, which is a significant improvement by the standards of aircraft construction.  Users in their reviews of the DJI Phantom 3 Standard note that outwardly the drone has not changed much.  The developers improved the internal layout of the case and replaced some metal parts with plastic ones. </p><p>  Externally, the DJI Phantom 3 Standard differs from the Advanced and Pro versions in the shade of stickers on the case.  The strips of the Standard are red, the professional model is golden and the Advanced model is silver.  There are no other external differences in these modifications of quadrocopters. </p>

    <h2>  Power supply </h2><p>  The power of the quadrocopter remained unchanged.  A battery with a capacity of 4480 mAh acts as a battery for the drone.  Despite the fact that the weight of the Standard was reduced, the duration of the flight remained unchanged: the maximum time during which the quadrocopter can be in the air is only 23 minutes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The battery weighs 365 grams.  The battery is being charged from a low-power charger.  The manufacturer assures that the battery of the copter is intelligent and fully charged in over an hour.  On the manufacturer‚Äôs official website, you can buy a 100W charger, which will reduce the battery charging time to one hour.  Users in reviews of DJI Phantom 3 Standard recommend that the battery be completely cooled before charging and the flight field, and only then be charged, since the manufacturer has not been able to solve the problem of its heating during operation.  The ideal option is to purchase an additional battery.  A new battery will cost about $ 149, a charger - $ 85. </p><h2>  Quadrocopter camera </h2><p>  A new modification of Standard was released by the manufacturer due to the fact that many users could not purchase previous top models because of their high cost.  The developers solved this problem by releasing a new version of Phantom 3 - a simpler, but equipped with a better camera than the one that was installed on Advanced. </p><p>  The DJI Phantom 3 Standard's specs are pretty good: Sony‚Äôs twelve-megapixel EXMOR sensor is held by a three-axis metal mount that stabilizes the camera and protects it from gusts of wind.  The camera module itself remained with the same characteristics: a viewing angle of 94 degrees, an eight-inch matrix, saving photos in RAW and JPG formats with a resolution of 4000 x 3000 pixels, auto exposure bracketing.  You can shoot UltraHD video and time-lapse video.  Judging by the reviews of the DJI Phantom 3 Standard, the camera in the new model represents a cross between those in the Advanced and Pro versions: in the first recording is carried out in FullHD resolution, in the second - in 4K. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  All captured videos can be recorded on microSD and SDHX memory cards.  The function of broadcasting high-definition video streaming to a smartphone connected to the control panel via Wi-Fi is also available. </p>

    <h2>  Differences between Advanced, Standard and Professional </h2><p>  Modifications of DJI quadrocopters differ from each other not only in strip colors, but also in the following characteristics: </p><ul data-id="636d4dccf3969"><li>  Recorded video resolution: 2.7K for DJI Phantom 3 Standard, Advanced - FullHD, Professional - 4K. </li><li>  The professional model is equipped with a 100W charger, while the advanced and standard versions are equipped with conventional 57W charging. </li><li>  The Standard control panel is much easier to use. </li><li>  DJI Phantom 3 Standard has a communication range and flight altitude 4 times lower than similar characteristics for the Pro and Advanced versions. </li><li>  Standard does not support the GLONASS system and does not have the Overflow function. </li></ul><h2>  Drone control and advanced features </h2><p>  The flight range of the DJI Phantom 3 Standard was cut by the manufacturer to 500 meters, although previously it was two kilometers.  However, the return function to the Return Home statement has remained unchanged.  In the model, all the functions that were available in previous versions are also available: Follow Me - autopilot, "Beginner" mode and soft landing.  The flight range of the DJI Phantom 3 Standard in Beginner mode is 30 meters, so the user can learn how to control the drone.  The manufacturer also reduced the height to 120 meters, which is why it will not be possible to take panoramic pictures from a bird's eye view. </p><p>  The control panel remained the same ergonomic, however, the developer reduced the number of buttons on it, leaving only three-position switches for modes and cameras and a couple of sticks.  The horizontal movement of the drone is controlled by the right stick, the rotation around the axis and the vertical movement by the left.  The holder for the smartphone and the metal bracket for attaching the remote control remained in the same places. </p>

    <h2>  Remote Control </h2><p>  In the upper corners of the Phantom 3 Standard control panel, there are two sticks that control the drone.  The flight mode is selected using the three-position switches: determining the direction and stabilization of the flight.  If Phantom loses the signal, it will automatically return to the owner after pressing the corresponding key on the smartphone. </p><p>  The return coordinates are determined using GPS.  On the left side is the wheel that controls the camera.  The front panel also houses a battery indicator and a power lever. </p><p>  A smartphone is attached to the metal bracket of the control panel using the holder.  If you use this design carefully, it is reliable, but with sudden movements, the gadget flies easily. </p><p>  The first flight is advisable to conduct only making sure that the remote control and the battery are fully charged. </p>

    <h2>  Charger </h2><p>  The inputs for charging the remote control and the battery are disconnected after removing the charger from the package.  On the side of the battery there is a special socket into which the charging plug is inserted. </p><p>  The remote control is charged using a special USB cable that connects to the transmitter. </p><p>  During charging, the indicators light up in red, which changes to green when the remote control is fully charged.  After that, it can be disconnected from the power source. </p><h2>  Quadrocopter Features </h2><p>  In reviews of DJI Phantom 3 Standard, users note the following features of the drone: </p><ul data-id="22669b50ce148"><li>  The maximum flight speed is 16 km / h. </li><li>  4 motors. </li><li>  Twelve megapixel camera. </li><li>  Light weight - 1200 grams. </li><li>  Flight duration - 23 minutes. </li><li>  A full battery charge lasts for an hour and a half. </li><li>  The maximum take-off speed is 5 m / s. </li><li>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãduring descent - 3 m / s. </li><li>  68 Wh Li-ion Battery </li><li>  Autopilot mode and GPS support. </li><li>  Manufacturer - China. </li><li>  Warranty from the manufacturer - one year. </li></ul><p>  Among modern quadrocopter models, DJI Phantom 3 Standard has the best technical characteristics, including horizontal and vertical speeds of 16 m / s and 3-5 m / s, respectively. </p><p>  For those who are using a quadrocopter for the first time, a limitation of altitude and speed of flight is provided.  The maximum flight altitude is 120 meters, speed - 30 m / s.  Over time, indicators increase: for example, the flight range is 500 meters. </p><p>  The equipment integrated in Standard allows you to fly along a pre-laid route.  The quadrocopter navigation system remembers the route and adjusts the direction of the drone.  When you enable special mode, you can launch Phantom 3 to fly over these points. </p><p>  The ‚ÄúInteresting Object‚Äù mode allows you to fix both the quadrocopter itself and its camera on a specific object.  The user can fly around the object of interest to him, considering it from all sides. </p><p>  On a smartphone or tablet, you can activate the ‚ÄúFly for the operator‚Äù mode, in which the drone will focus on the device used as a beacon. </p><p>  Assembling a quadrocopter is very easy: the whole process is described in detail in the instruction manual.  All parts and accessories are easy to remove, making the Phantom 3 transportable. </p>

    <h2>  Mobile phone connection </h2><p>  The manufacturer, when developing a new model of the third generation of the quadrocopter, relied on the possibility of piloting the drone out of sight and flight range.  This was possible thanks to the built-in camera and the function of transmitting streaming video to a smartphone. </p><p>  The developer releases a special DJI GO application for Android and iOS, with which you can synchronize your smartphone with the quadrocopter control panel.  Connecting to the phone is required mainly for tracking sensor readings and controlling the camera, while you can pilot a drone without this function.  For this reason, flights without the use of a smartphone are preferably carried out over short distances. </p><p>  The camera broadcasts a high-quality image on almost the entire screen of the smartphone.  Buttons for recording and saving videos are located on the side.  In the lower left corner there is a small window in which you can track the current location of the quadrocopter in the presence of a GPS signal. </p><p>  The selected flight mode, battery charge, GPS signal strength and other parameters are displayed at the top of the screen.  Altitude and flight speed are indicated at the bottom of the display. </p>
