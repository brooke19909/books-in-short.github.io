(at Jena and at the <span>Battle of Austerlitz)</span> on the one hand and the historical battle at Trafalgar in the autumn of 1805 on the other formed a peculiar situation.  Confirming the status of <span>"Lady of the Seas",</span> Britain became an obstacle to the French invasion of the British Isles.  At the same time, the Napoleonic victories during the battles deprived England of its main allies in Europe - Prussia, Austria and Russia - and, as a result, the opportunity to wage a further struggle. </p><p>  By the second half of the 18th century, Britain was the main <span>external trading</span> partner of Russia.  During the confrontation between revolutionary, and subsequently Napoleonic France, these two powers (Russia and England) were in some ways "natural allies."  <span>The Russian armed forces were</span> supported by the actions of the English fleet and subsidies.  But in the course of military events between the allied countries, contradictions of both a political and economic nature began to arise. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  France sought dominance in Europe.  However, the methods by which this could be achieved should have been radically different from the measures previously applied with respect to England. </p><p>  The main objective of Napoleonic politics at that time was the desire to strike a blow at the UK economy.  Thus, the continental blockade of England was undertaken.  This measure prohibited the flow of goods from the UK to other countries.  However, the continental blockade could be effective only in the context of coordinated action by the major European powers. </p><p>  It should be noted that the UK by the mid-19th century was several times better developed economically than most countries.  However, its economic superiority did not contribute to the development of military-political dominance in the world.  Great Britain had only a powerful fleet, and the <span>ground forces</span> were not sufficiently developed.  In addition, according to historians, England did not seek dominance then. </p><p>  France, having tried for almost ten years various methods of conquering Great Britain, is making an attempt to directly occupy the space of Europe. </p><p>  The continental blockade very clearly reflected the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãNapoleon.  The French ruler sought as soon as possible to close Europe from the advanced industry of the British Isles, slowing down the development of the UK economy. </p><p>  In the years 1810-12.  in England, an acute economic crisis began.  Significantly decreased exports, the situation inside the country has become much aggravated.  From 1811 to 1813, the Ludd movement acquired enormous proportions, the main purpose of which was the destruction of the basis of the power of England - looms. </p><p>  In 1812, America entered into an alliance with France against Great Britain. </p><p>  However, before the final victory over England, Napoleon had to conquer the entire European continent.  That is why the French army marched non-stop, conquering countries in its path. </p><p>  It should be noted that the continental blockade destroyed not only the UK economy.  All Europe suffered, including France.  The customs tariffs set by Napoleon between European countries caused discontent.  Thus, France acquired many new enemies. </p><p>  Of great importance in this situation were the actions of the Russian government.  <span>First Alexander</span> first violated all the conditions of the blockade, then banned the import of luxury goods from France.  Napoleon, meanwhile, undertakes a campaign to the East, intending to force Russia to take part in the continental blockade.  However, his campaign ended in the complete collapse of the French Empire. </p>
