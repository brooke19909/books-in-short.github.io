So consider because this doll is probably the only one of the existing types of dolls, the purpose of which is so ambiguous.  On the one hand, a porcelain doll was once a children's toy.  But over time, she somehow lost this function and gradually migrated to the category of antiques, collectibles and interior accessories.  Today, a porcelain doll is also a "toy", but in most cases only for adults.

    <p>  Where and when did the first dolls appear </p><p>  Porcelain doll, whose history began in the middle of the XVIII century, was first made in Europe, namely in countries such as Italy, France and Germany.  The first copies were born in 1730.  The next 2 centuries were the heyday and spread around the world of fashion for such toys.  The peak of production (so to speak, because dolls were first made only by hand) fell on the period from 1750 to 1930.  A porcelain doll of these years is today considered a valuable antique item. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Distribution of porcelain dolls around the world </p><p>  The most active puppets were occupied by German and French masters.  Each of them was initially made exclusively by hand and was thus exclusive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="porcelain doll story" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14575/221909.jpg" width="366"></div>  However, then, in order to satisfy demand, dolls began to be produced industrially.  But even this did not deprive these beauties of their inherent charm.  Such dolls became toys for children from many countries, and adults bought them for their collections.  French and <span>German dolls</span> were in great demand, and were known far beyond their homeland.  Puppet masters from France amazed with their creations, presenting them in expensive luxurious furnishings.  German colleagues, perhaps, were more restrained in this regard, but the strength, reliability and quality of their dolls were more popular with buyers than French immodest luxury.

    <p>  Doll story </p><p>  With the help of porcelain dolls, the fashion for outfits and accessories was popularized among the general population.  There were such instances to which, in addition to one piece of furniture, several more interchangeable items were attached, as well as cosmetics and other jewelry.  Particularly fashionable and popular were dolls equipped with a whole "dowry": complete with them was a whole doll house with furniture, utensils, a replaceable wardrobe, cosmetics, umbrellas, bags, etc. Moreover, these items were almost real, only very small .  And the outfits from the wardrobe strictly corresponded to the fashion of those years.  In addition, doll dresses were very different: for balls, for dinners and dinners, and even for receiving guests - in short, for all occasions.  The hostess herself was anatomically surprisingly like a real lady: porcelain made it possible to create completely naturalistic facial features, and it was not difficult to decorate such material.  The effect was enhanced by the eyes of the dolls: they were made of glass.  Moreover, for each young lady they were different, since the color of the iris was not repeated. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="porcelain dolls in Moscow" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14575/221908.jpg" width="396"></div>

    <p>  Dolls in Russia </p><p>  Dowry dolls were toys not only for children from wealthy families.  Often parents or even childless people bought doll houses for themselves.  At the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th centuries, this phenomenon became unusually fashionable in Russia.  This is confirmed by the fact that many famous representatives of the nobility, merchants and intelligentsia had porcelain dolls in Moscow.  And mostly they were men.  Today, the demand for the porcelain doll is returning.  As before, handwork and the naturalism of the image are appreciated.  Such instances sometimes cost more than one thousand dollars.  But there are less expensive dolls.  Regardless of the price, they will always be a wonderful gift or interior decoration. </p>
