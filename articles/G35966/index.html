  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The concept of "personality": approaches in psychology</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The concept of "personality" has several approaches in psychological science. </p><p>  First, the personality is described in terms of its aspirations and motives, which make up the unique content of the personal world.  The concept of "personality" in this sense includes individual ways of ordering external and internal images in the human mind. </p><p>  Secondly, a personalized approach.  In its framework, the concept of "personality" is interpreted as a system of special features - stable and externally manifested characteristics of an individual.  They are expressed in a person’s judgments about himself and other people’s judgments about him. </p><p>  Thirdly, the sociological concept of personality.  In this approach, considerable attention is paid to its functioning in society.  Therefore, the <span>process of socialization, the</span> formation of norms and values ​​becomes very important. </p><p>  Fourth, the concept of “personality” includes the active “I” of the subject as a system of relations, plans, semantic formations and orientation. </p><p>  Based on these approaches, a number of key points have been developed: </p><p>  1. The concept of “personality” is a social generalization that includes everything that is in a person of nature.  Therefore, it is not innate, but arises as a result of cultural and social development. </p><p>  2. A person becomes a person who has his own position in life, formed as a result of conscious and very large work.  He is able to show independence of thoughts, unbanality of feelings and special composure. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  3. A person is a specifically human entity, formed by a system of social relations into which an individual can enter into his activity.  Its development is a process that does not directly coincide with the intravital, natural properties of man when he adapts to the external environment. </p><p>  4. The concept of “personality” is such a purposeful, self-organizing particle of society that has a special function.  It is about implementing an individual way of functioning.  The regulator of her behavior will be abilities, character, orientation and worldview. </p><p>  5. A person is a self-organizing system, the object of attention and activity of which is both the outside world and herself.  As a result of its formation, the “I” appears, which includes self-esteem, self-image, a program of self-improvement, the ability to self-observation, self-regulation and introspection. </p><p>  But any concept of personality includes the fact that it should: </p><ul><li>  have an active lifestyle and a desire to achieve your goals; </li><li>  be able to make choices in situations of similar need; </li><li>  be able to assess the consequences of the decision; </li><li>  hold accountable for actions before society and itself; </li><li>  to form value orientations and a motivational-need sphere; </li><li>  own an arsenal of means, methods and techniques by which you can master your own behavior and subordinate it to yourself; </li><li>  have the freedom of choice. </li></ul><p>  In psychology, there are a large number of attempts to identify the central core of the personality.  As a result of numerous studies, a number of conclusions were made: </p><p>  1. The personality includes a system of psychological traits and qualities that relate to the sphere of morality, morality and self-improvement. </p><p>  2. The inner core in ontogenesis takes shape quite late.  This becomes possible when the full formation of the "I" has occurred - usually in adolescence. </p><p>  3. Most scientists agree that a personality cannot arise as a result of passive actions from outside on a growing person.  It develops only in the process of its own activities. </p>
