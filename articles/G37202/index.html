    <p>  There is not much to expect from the design of the PocketBook 622.  The case is made of ordinary plastic.  For greater comfort in use, the back of the reader is rubberized.  Thus, in the hand the device holds a little better. </p><p>  All external features are sheltered at the bottom end of the PocketBook 622. Here is the headphone input, power button, reset, USB port, as well as a slot for a flash card. </p><p>  Perhaps the location of all the elements in one place is an interesting solution, but it does not look the best way. </p><p>  The front side of the device is equipped with a 6-inch screen and buttons designed for control.  Functional elements use Soft Touch coating technology. </p><p>  I would like to note that the device is quite lightweight, only 195 g. Actually, working with the device will be convenient with one hand. </p><h2>  Screen </h2>

    <p>  The 622 is the first of the PocketBook series to use a Pearl display.  The fact that the screen is touch only adds a twist.  Unfortunately, the resolution, as in the previous version of the device, is 800 by 600 pixels.  Although this is quite enough for a diagonal of only 6 inches. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The PocketBook 622 screen is pleasing to the eye even after prolonged use.  In the sun, the device will show its best side. </p><p>  The installed sensor also functions flawlessly.  The reaction to touch is instant, which makes using the book a pleasant experience. </p><p>  Unfortunately, after prolonged use, the display of the device gradually loses contrast.  There is a solution to the problem, and it is quite simple: you need to configure updates for the screen in PocketBook 622. </p><h2>  Hardware </h2>

    <p>  This is a pretty good e-book in its filling.  PocketBook 622 is equipped with a Freescale processor, and its frequency is as much as 800 GHz.  Some 128 MB of RAM installed are a little disappointing, but the device copes with its task without difficulty. </p><p>  Also, only 2 GB of memory built into PocketBook 622 will become an unpleasant detail. In fact, only 1 GB in the reader, the second half is occupied by the Linux system.  It is possible to supplement the memory with a flash drive with a capacity of up to 32 GB. </p><p>  Excellent performance will smooth the unpleasant sides.  Despite not very impressive characteristics, the device copes with several actions simultaneously.  Without any freezes, you can simultaneously work with the network and at the same time listen to music. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The book is able to run all the most popular <span>file formats.</span>  This list includes as many as 15 text, as well as 4 types of images.  Unfortunately, some formats work with minor restrictions. </p><h2>  Book abilities </h2><p>  In addition to direct duties, the reader may surprise with some features.  In the program menu of the device, among the usual hours, calendar, as well as a calculator, there is a Wi-Fi and a browser.  Do not forget about the simple player.  By the way, you can play sound only in the headphones.  A speaker is not provided in PocketBook.  The owner will definitely be dependent on the headphones in both the music and audiobook situations. </p><p>  Having a network connection without problems will allow you to update the system of the device.  The downloaded new version will be installed on the reader by itself. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2>

    <p>  The package includes PocketBook 622, manual, USB cable.  Surprisingly, headphones are not included with the expensive device. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The battery has 1100 maH capacity, which is very good support for the device.  The standby time of the device reaches a month, but with the active use of the battery, it will last for two weeks. </p><p>  Half a month may not seem like the best result.  However, given the use of Wi-Fi and a browser, this time is quite adequate. </p><h2>  Advantages </h2><p>  An undoubted advantage of the device is the support of a huge number of formats.  Working with all types of text makes the device an excellent choice as a reader. </p><p>  Convenient settings also will not leave the user indifferent.  Intuitively, you can adjust the device for yourself, without even using the instructions. </p><p>  A powerful processor capable of supporting multiple tasks at one time is also a definite plus. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  A more catchy minus of the device is the lack of speaker.  Given that there are no headphones in the kit, a huge misunderstanding arises.  For music and audio books, you will definitely have to buy the required accessory. </p><p>  Elements located on one side are also introduced into a stupor.  If most of the details can be omitted, there is a problem with the power button.  The bottom end is not the best place for such an element. </p><p>  Compared to competitors and including all the shortcomings, the cost of the device is somewhat overpriced.  Of course, the proposed advantages partially smooth out the unpleasant sides, but even in this case the price is high. </p><h2>  User Feedback </h2><p>  When studying the PocketBook 622, reviews are one of the main sources.  From the opinions of people, useful facts about the work and behavior of the reader can be made. </p><p>  Owners are happy with the device in almost everything.  The exception is poor equipment and lack of dynamics.  But in operation, the device realizes itself perfectly, which is confirmed by users. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  Compared with competitors, the device wins only due to the large number of supported formats.  Otherwise, the characteristics of the readers are similar.  Of course, the final choice is provided solely to the buyer. </p>
