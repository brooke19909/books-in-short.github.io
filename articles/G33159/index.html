    <h2>  Comments of tourists about the number of rooms, location and territory of the Olympic Cosma Hotel </h2><p>  In general, most of the guests were quite satisfied with the rooms provided to them.  True, experienced travelers advise if possible to settle in rooms whose windows do not open onto the pool, since during the day it can be quite noisy.

According to our compatriots, here you will not find torn sheets and pillowcases. </p><p>  A small minus was considered by some tourists the fact that the elevators in the buildings run only between the first and fourth floors.  Thus, the guests, who were placed on the second and third floors, are forced to overcome one passage on foot.  This is not very convenient, especially during check-in and check-out, as you have to carry heavy suitcases.  However, experienced travelers advise when checking in to ask the receptionist to help with the luggage transfer.  In this case, the hotel employee will deliver your things to the room itself.  It is also recommended to do when leaving the hotel. </p><p>  Travelers also respond positively to the location of Hotel Olympic Kosma 3 *.  So, due to the fact that it is located almost on the outskirts of the village, it is quite quiet here, and no noise from the central streets will prevent a quiet rest.  At the same time, all tourist infrastructure facilities are located literally within walking distance.  Also, guests of the hotel were pleased with the proximity of the beach.  So, the distance to it is only a couple of hundred meters.  The beach closest to the hotel is sandy.  As already noted, the entrance to the water is gentle, at the bottom there are small pebbles.  However, some tourists found this beach too dirty and chose to relax on the neighboring one.  You can also reach it in just a few minutes. </p>
