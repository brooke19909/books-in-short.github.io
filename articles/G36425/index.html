    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  When planning a trip, do not neglect the information about the negative features of the Medplaya Hotel Calypso 3 * resort.  reviews contain such negative comments: </p><ul><li>  entertainment shows are held until late at night, which prevent guests from falling asleep; </li><li>  very cramped rooms with shabby furniture and old renovations; </li><li>  there is ceramic tile on the floor in the room, on which it is cold to walk barefoot; </li><li>  besides toilet soap, no hygiene items are provided; </li><li>  paid use of the safe (in addition, you must additionally leave a deposit of 50 euros); </li><li>  to use a hairdryer, you need to make a cash deposit; </li><li>  the hotel‚Äôs restaurant tastes bad about cooking fish; </li><li>  hotel tour operator prices for excursions are too high; </li><li>  walls are too thin, due to which everything in the room can be heard what is happening in the corridor and in the neighboring rooms; </li><li>  too slow wireless Internet, which also constantly disconnects if many people try to use it; </li><li>  food in the hotel is quite expensive, and therefore it is better to eat in neighboring institutions; </li><li>  animation is conducted only in English and Spanish; </li><li>  given the large number of vacationers with children, in the halls and in the restaurant it is always very noisy; </li><li>  there is no clothes dryer on the balcony; </li><li>  guests are rather negligent to the requests and complaints of guests; </li><li>  the hotel does not have its own parking, and for the use of the public one has to pay extra; </li><li>  cool water in the pool; </li><li>  there is no refrigerator in the room; </li><li>  maids do not wash the floors on the balcony and do not wipe the plastic furniture; </li><li>  huge lines always line up at the elevator; </li><li>  the restaurant does not have enough tables for all guests; </li><li>  having booked a specific room, guests cannot be completely sure that they will be settled there; </li><li>  too soft mattresses on the beds. </li></ul><p>  This hotel is a good option for a family vacation in hot Spain.  It has everything you need for a bright vacation - and comfortable rooms, and fun entertainment, and delicious food, and quality service.  Some complaints are caused by the condition of the number of rooms (the repair is quite old, and the furniture is not in the best condition).  The location is quite convenient, but it is worth considering that the hotel is located on a hill. </p>
