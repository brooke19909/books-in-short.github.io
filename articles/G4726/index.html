After graduating from high school, he enters the Physics and Mathematics Department of St. Petersburg University.  In general, a short biography of Mendeleev of this period fits into the canons of the biographies of Russian intellectuals of that time.

Short biography: the beginning of a career </p><p>  At the end of his studies, the young Mendeleev tried for some time to prove himself on the literary field, which was facilitated by the golden age of Russian poetry, in which he had a chance to live.  He gave private lessons.  However soon due </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="q and mendeleev brief biography" class="if" height="451" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/292559.jpg" width="332"></div>  health problems was forced to move to Odessa.  Here Dmitry Ivanovich takes a teaching position in a gymnasium, which was kept at the Richelieu Lyceum.  However, a year later he returned to Petersburg, where he defended his <span>master's thesis</span> and received the right to teach organic chemistry at the university.  In 1859-1861, a young scientist lives in German Heidelberg, where he undergoes a scientific internship.  Upon returning to his homeland, he wrote the first textbook on organic chemistry in Russian history.

    <p>  In 1865, a young scientist defended his <span>doctoral dissertation.</span>  It has already laid the foundations for a new look at organic solutions.  Now he becomes a professor at St. Petersburg University.  At the same time, his activity is not limited to the walls of Alma mater only.  In the same year, he acquired the estate in the village of Boblovo, in the Moscow province.  Here he enthusiastically takes up research in the field of agriculture and agricultural chemistry. </p><p>  In 1869, the event took place in the life of Mendeleev, thanks to which he is now widely known in Russia and around the world: he formulated and ordered a periodic table of chemical elements.  By 1871, the work ‚ÄúFoundations of Chemistry‚Äù, which later became a classic, came out of his pen.  In 1880, Mendeleev was promoted to academician, however, the candidacy of the scientist did not pass, which caused a storm of public indignation.  For the next ten years, the scientist continued to work in research and teaching in the walls of his native university, but in 1890 he left him, protesting against the oppression of the rights and freedoms of students. </p><p>  A short biography of Mendeleev: recent years </p><p>  At the end of his life, a recognized scientist worked for some time as a consultant in the Ministry of the Sea.  Later, he even became the organizer and first director of the State Chamber of Weights and Measures.  It was in this position that he worked and even death.  Dmitry Ivanovich died on February 2, 1907 in the capital. </p>
