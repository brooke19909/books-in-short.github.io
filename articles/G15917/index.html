    <h2>  Types of Settlement </h2><p>  In practice, two main types of payments are used - cash and cashless.  Cash, as a rule, is used for small amounts of cash flow - these are lump-sum payments that can be made through the cash desk of the company.  For small enterprises with low turnover and modest income, the use of cash is the best option.  Large companies often adopt a cashless system;  as shown by the results of its use, it is much more efficient, faster and cheaper than working with large amounts of cash.  Therefore, today 98% of all payments are carried out through the banking system, by non-cash principle. </p><h2>  The reflection of the cashless system in accounting </h2><p>  For analysis, planning, accounting, moving non-cash, the company opens a synthetic, balance-sheet <span>accounting account</span> 51. It is active, which means reflecting incoming funds on a debit, the expenditure of financial resources on a loan.  51 accounts were created to account for the most mobile of the enterprise‚Äôs assets - non-cash funds.  It is reflected in the balance sheet in a generalized form, the balance (balance) is determined daily for the operational management of finances.  Analytical accounting is conducted for each item of income and expense separately.  An organization may simultaneously open the required number of accounts in one or more credit institutions.  Regardless of their number, all information on the movement of cashless funds is summarized and posted to 51 accounts.  The balance (balance) is formed by the formula: balance at the beginning + turnover on the debit of the account - turnover on the loan.  The result obtained is the sum of available (currently) funds.  It is credited to 51 accounts as the initial debit balance for the next period. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Types of cashless payments </h2><p>  All settlement and payment transactions are carried out by the bank with which the organization has concluded an account maintenance agreement.  The basis for making withdrawals or transfers of funds is a written notice to the owner, which is checked by <span>bank employees</span> for compliance with legal standards and unified forms.  The organization that owns the funds chooses the non-cash payment form on its own, based on the contractual obligations of specific contractors.  Most often, the payer company, using the appropriate document, gives the bank an order to withdraw (write off, transfer) non-cash funds from the account in favor of the specified counterparty.  Unconditional write-offs are less common, confirmation of which is not required from the owner of the assets.  Cash withdrawals for own needs are made by the organization using checks.  Account holders at the bank receive the required limit of checks based on the application.  Checkbook pages filled out and certified by appropriate signatures and seals can also serve as settlements for the account holder company with contracting organizations, suppliers, etc. In this case, the check is written to the organization or individual (its representative) and cashed upon presentation at the bank payer. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Document flow on the current account </h2><p>  51 accounts are maintained on the basis of a bank statement.  Documents must be attached to it, which serve as an order for the movement of funds on a specific account of the enterprise.  All write-offs, transfers that the owner of the assets made during the statement period are confirmed by a copy of the outgoing payment order or requirement.  The spine of the check justifies the withdrawal of cash.  The crediting of the received amounts from the owner company (handing over part of the proceeds in cash) is fixed by a bank order.  Funds received from buyers and other debtors, as part of their contractual obligations, are confirmed by a copy of the incoming payment order of the paying organization.  All documents on the transfer of non-cash money are drawn up in strict accordance with the unified forms and requirements of the bank, certified by the signatures of authorized persons and the seal of the organization. </p>
