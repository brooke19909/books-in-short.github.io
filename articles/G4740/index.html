    <p>  Pets are strictly prohibited. </p><p>  Estimated time of arrival and departure from the hotel - 12.00.  The first day of arrival is at 14.00. </p><h2>  Features of accommodation </h2><p>  Mandatory documents for placement and registration on the territory of the hotel complex "Anacopia Club" (Abkhazia): a civil passport or passport, for children - a birth certificate or travel document for the child, ticket and medical insurance policy for all vacationers. </p><p>  We accept Visa, MasterCard and Maestro credit cards.  Cash settlement works.  The price includes accommodation in a paid room, breakfast, use of your own beach and everything that is there (umbrellas, a canopy and a sun lounger), use of the Internet.  Everything else is at an additional cost. </p><p>  They will help to better make sure of the excellent service that Anakopia Club (Abkhazia) provides its guests, reviews of 2016. </p><h2>  Guest Comments </h2><p>  You can safely go here with the whole family.  Not only children will be satisfied, but also the elderly.  Sunny Abkhazia always welcomes its guests.  "Anacopia Club" - a hotel by the sea - one of the best places to stay in the resort.  The proximity of the coast is a huge advantage.  Just strolling through the hotel, drowning in thickets of eucalyptus, breathing in the aroma of the sea breeze, you can improve your nervous system in just a few days. </p><h2>  About beach vacation </h2><p>  The beach is equipped with free sunbeds that can be moved wherever you need.  It is even possible to install them in wooden arbors located on the waterfront.  Pebbles on the beach are warming up quickly.  A trip to the sea is equivalent to a full foot massage.  Those who are embarrassed can purchase special shoes. </p><p>  The protected area is fenced.  It is noticeable that staff with special awe cares about green spaces and cleanliness. </p><p>  The security system is top notch.  You will be watched not only on the territory, but also on the floors.  Therefore, do not worry about your valuables or children. </p><h2>  Children </h2><p>  Young tourists should also like Abkhazia.  Anacopia Club (2016 is coming to an end, and the hotel will be glad to see guests in the next) took care of their comfort.  On the territory there is a playground, in the middle of which a healing eucalyptus grows.  In the gazebo are tables and chairs.  Children here can paint or make something.  Everything necessary for this is available.  Of course, children's leisure will not be complete without swings and trampolines.  Fortunately, all of this is here. </p><p>  Adults can play various active games (volleyball or soccer).  On neatly paved paths, children can ride bicycles or scooters.  Adults can also use bicycles. </p><p>  The hotel staff is always ready to help in solving various issues.  Very friendly people. </p><p>  Room service is just wonderful.  Bed linen is changed three times a week.  Towels - almost every day. </p><h2>  Room Service </h2><p>  The hotel is new, with good decoration, plumbing, furniture and other attributes.  I am glad that the apartment has many outlets.  Even several people can charge their gadgets at the same time, and you don‚Äôt even need to turn off the refrigerator or TV, as in other hotels of this level.  Each room has a spacious balcony and all the necessary toiletries (soap, shampoo, gel, toilet paper).  Everything is of good quality. </p><p>  Internet can be used for free, but a good signal only when everyone is sleeping.  As a rule, early in the morning or late in the evening. </p>

    <p>  You can arrange a full meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner) or buy half board, which is enough, because you still want to eat delicious in local restaurants.  You definitely won‚Äôt stay hungry here. </p><p>  Breakfast includes a variety of cereals with milk, scrambled eggs, sausages, cheesecakes, sandwiches with sausage, butter and cheese.  From drinks - milk, tea or coffee.  However, guests are advised not to eat sausages, as they are of dubious quality.  But everything else is very tasty. </p><p>  Half board also includes dinner.

    <p>  For an additional fee, you can go diving, go sailing, swim in the waves.  Transport runs to Abkhazia. </p><p>  Most tourists went to New Athos.  Travel is free, but the bus clogs to the limit.  From New Athos it is easy to get to other equally interesting sights.  Tours are not cheap, but you can see some places on their own almost for nothing. </p><p>  An incredibly beautiful country - Abkhazia.  Anacopia Club offers excellent conditions for a comfortable stay in it. </p>
