It's hard to answer here.  After all, everyone has different opportunities, desires and needs.  Nevertheless, this question cannot be left without attention and answer.  In any case, there are some points that can sometimes be eliminated from life in order for money to appear.  And vice versa, to spend money on something once seriously, but so that it is for a long time.  So what can not be saved during repairs, purchases and in other areas of human life?  Let's try to understand this difficult question. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what can not be saved" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/976836.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  For woman </h2><p>  A woman is the <span>guardian of the hearth.</span>  And often she needs to properly allocate the budget.  What can not be saved for a woman?  Perhaps on myself.  Many will be surprised (especially men): how so?  From the point of view of psychology, if a woman saves on herself and lives to her own detriment, then she becomes terrible.  And in character, and in appearance, and in habits.  And next to such a person is simply unpleasant to be.  From here arises eternally discontent, nudezh and so on. </p><p>  Men are not drawn to women who save on themselves.  But with all this, if a lady provides herself or receives a certain amount from her husband / boyfriend, then the male sex constantly requires savings.  And this applies to everything: from cosmetics to underwear.  And then the men wonder why the woman next to them became such a bitch.  All this is due to the psychology of economy.  A woman just feels flawed.  Yes, everywhere you need to know the measure.  But you need to spend money on yourself.  Only wisely. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  What can not be saved yet?  For example, on technology.  Now technologies are developing rapidly and rapidly.  But many still try to buy appliances (especially kitchen and household) for a long time.  In a crisis, prices are rising.  And sometimes you need to really spend big money (on a new stove, TV, refrigerator, washing machine and so on), then to forget about big purchases for the next 10-15 years. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what can not be saved for a woman" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/976837.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The only thing you can really save on is gadgets.  Tablets, phones and communicators.  You should not buy such devices for more than 20,000 rubles.  Computer is another matter.  Such a machine on average will cost you 30-40 thousand, but it will work for a long time.  So, it is possible and even necessary to fork out for it. </p><h2>  Food </h2><p>  What can not be saved in life?  For example, on food.  This does not mean that you need to eat in high-end restaurants and buy products exclusively in exclusive supermarkets.  On the contrary, this should not be done.  But what are we talking about? </p><p>  For example, it is worth making purchases at wholesale trading bases.  There the cost is reduced by 3-4 times.  So, it will be possible to buy more products at a lower price.  Many just live in a crisis.  And with all this, they eat better than those who are purchased in ordinary supermarkets.  Indeed, at wholesale bases, for example, 900 grams of Raffaello sweets costs 200 rubles, and in a store - 1000. The difference is obvious.  Thus, if purchased this way, then you should not save.  It is simply not permissible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what can not be saved during repairs" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/976838.jpg"></div>

In general, there are many options.  But there are still particularly important ones.  And they include clothes.  It should not be saved.  But throwing money away is not worth it.  So, you will have to forget about branded stores. </p><p>  Good things can be bought at sales, as well as at second-hand or thrift stores.  In small clothing stores, you can also find something of high quality.  Especially when you already have experience.  Sometimes those who try to approach their purchases wisely can save money and look a hundred times better than people who dress in company stores. </p><h2>  Cosmetics </h2><p>  Many people are interested in what can not be saved in a crisis in addition to the options already listed.  To be honest, you can just spend your money wisely.  And then you do not have to save.  In cases where you do not know how to do this, you can somewhere to "shrink".  But certainly not with regard to cosmetics.  Especially if you have skin or hair problems. </p><p>  Makeup should be good.  And she, as you know, is quite expensive.  If you want to save money, you can choose a less well-known manufacturer, but with exactly the same composition.  But in general, there is no need to constantly save.  After all, cheap and low-quality cosmetics can bring a lot of trouble.  So everywhere you need to learn to find a middle ground.  Creams and masks can be expensive.  Medical cosmetics, too.  But the shadows, powder, pencil for eyebrows or eyes can be purchased at a lower cost.  For example, not in a company store.  This will save money and teach you to choose a cheaper, but no less high-quality product. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what can not be saved in life" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/976839.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Repairs </h2><p>  If you are still wondering what you can‚Äôt save on, then all of the items listed can also include repairs.  This process does not tolerate savings.  Especially if you are dealing with private firms or wage laborers.  Sometimes low wages can simply come to your side.  Services will be provided, but with flaws, of poor quality.  Sometimes it‚Äôs even so bad that you have to redo everything.  And this is an extra waste. </p><p>  Of course, you do not need to choose the most expensive when repairing.  Price is not a guarantee of quality.  It is better to read reviews about something, ask the opinions of other people, and only then make a decision on the purchase or hiring of workers.  But in general, repair is a rather expensive process.  And there‚Äôs no getting around it.  Try to choose a not very expensive option for the provision of services (or not the most expensive goods), but at the same time, those that are very popular among people. </p><h2>  Savings Rules </h2><p>  In order not to constantly have to deny yourself something, you just need to learn how to distribute the budget.  And then you will not need to think about saving.  But few have such skills.  Nevertheless, they can be learned. </p><p>  To get started, write on a piece of paper all your current expenses.  Start with the most necessary - travel, products (full list), utility bills and so on.  Now cross out one thing you can easily live without.  For example, trim your entertainment ‚Äî going to the theater, cinema, and so on.  This will save quite a lot of money. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what you can not save in a crisis" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/976840.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Go to stores and wholesale outlets with only a shopping list.  In principle, if you have chosen a base, then you can do without it.  After all, you can save already.  Plus, buy more frozen foods.  They are stored for a long time.  This is a very profitable investment. </p><p>  Do not also have a snack in eateries and restaurants.  And give up shopping at expensive clothing stores.  Learn to look for cheaper, but no less high-quality options.  Only in this way you can not damage the budget. </p>
