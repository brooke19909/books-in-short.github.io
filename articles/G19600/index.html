Two-thirds of the lake belongs to Montenegro, the rest - to Albania. </p><p>  <span>The length of the lake</span> is 43 km long and 26 km wide.  The coastline is about 170 km long.  With an average depth of 5‚Äì7 m, Skadar Lake is famous for having about thirty <span>karst funnels</span> (also called ‚Äúeyes‚Äù or underwater keys), the depth of which can exceed 60 meters. </p><p>  According to scientists, the reservoir was formed as a result of dissolution of limestone rocks in the tectonic basin and was once the gulf of the <span>Adriatic Sea,</span> from which it is now separated by an isthmus.  His age is approximately 65 million years. </p><p>  Skadar Lake is filled with both river waters (the largest of which are Morach and Tsrnoevich), as well as waters coming from the depths of the earth's interior. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="skadar lake" class="if" height="260" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12502/276253.jpg" width="590"></div>

    <p>  On the shores of the reservoir is about sixty settlements.  The largest are Rijeka Crnoevich and Virpazar.  Founded by the king of Montenegro Ivan Crnoevich (in whose honor she got her name), Rijeka Crnoevich became the first capital of this Balkan state.  Only the ruins of a pearl factory where fish pearls were made, and the old Konak Perianik restaurant, famous for the fact that it once used to prepare the most exquisite dishes served to the royal table, remind of those times today.  By the way, the restaurant still flourishes, and its owner belongs to the Tsar dynasty Tsrnoevich. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Virpazar is famous for the fact that the Turkish fortress Grmozur, formerly once a border outpost, was located nearby.  Today, the former fortress has become home to numerous bird populations. </p><p>  <strong>Flora and fauna</strong> </p><p>  With its rich diversity, the local plant world includes 25 rare endangered species.  Reeds, reeds, chilli, and casaronia grow along the shores of the lake.  Water lilies, egg capsules, as well as lilies, which come here in two colors - yellow and white, give a special charm to the reservoir.  A very rare Skadar oak grows in the flooded delta, and relict chestnuts can be found on the southern shores. </p><p>  In the waters there are about fifty species of fish, some of which can be found only here.  Fishing enthusiasts can purchase a special fishing license. </p><p>  Skadar Lake is a local habitat, as well as a parking lot for a large number of <span>migratory birds.</span>  At different times of the year, more than two hundred different species of birds can be counted here, but cormorants and curly pelicans are considered the most famous.  The latter, by the way, are a symbol of the local National Park. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="skadar lake excursion" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12502/276254.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Skadar Lake: how to get there?</strong> </p><p>  For those who want to visit these places, you can use the services of comfortable sightseeing buses.  The fare (along with the services of a guide) depends on the starting point of the route and usually ranges from 35 to 60 ‚Ç¨.  Buses depart from almost all major cities of Montenegro.  You can get to the lake and by car.  The Podgorica ‚Äì Petrovac highway is nearby.  The cost of a rental car, for example, in Montenegro, will cost from 30 ‚Ç¨.  It should be borne in mind that local roads are in the mountains and are a continuous serpentine, which is difficult to handle even for an experienced driver.  Therefore, it is better to use a taxi, although it will cost a little more. </p>
