Thermal springs: rest at any time of the year</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the Absheron region of the Krasnodar Territory, on the banks <span>of the Kurdzhips River,</span> at the entrance to the Guam Gorge, there is a small village of Guamka.  From the city of Apsheronsk it is separated by a distance of 50 kilometers.  The village, like the gorge, got its name from the Guam ridge, which is part of the northern border of the Lago-Naki Highlands and extends between the Kurdzhips and Belaya rivers from west to east. </p><h2>  Guam gorge </h2><p>  One of the most picturesque places is the Guam Gorge, which is a unique natural monument.  Here you can enjoy unique landscapes, look into the mysterious crevices and grottoes, and appreciate such a magnificent creation of nature.  But not only this is famous for Guamka.  Thermal springs are what attract many tourists here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="guamka thermal springs" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/347571.jpg" width="214"></div>

    <h2></h2><h2>  Guamki Hot Springs </h2><p>  <span>Thermal springs</span> are located 15 kilometers from the Guam Gorge and the village of Guamka.  Wells appeared here in Soviet times, since it was necessary to heat the greenhouses, which in the 90s were almost the only place for earning money by those who lived in the village of Guamka.  Thermal springs are located 200 meters from these greenhouses.  It was here that recreation centers were founded. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Guamka, the thermal springs of which made the village popular from year to year, offers to visit such bases as Niagara and Aquarius, which blend in perfectly with the Kurdzhips river valley.  From the village, which is located higher in the valley, they are separated by a distance of 8 kilometers.  You can get here through the city of Apsheronsk, from where you can head towards the village of Nizhny Novgorod.  3-4 kilometers in front of the village and the base. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="base aquarius guamka" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/347570.jpg?1393953154975" width="320"></div>

    <p>  Thermal springs are a place where you can not only improve your health, but also enjoy the surrounding views.  It is nice to dive into the pool and feel how the heat spreads through the body, and then swim in warm water and have fun. </p><h2>  Base "Aquarius" </h2><p>  If you decide to visit the village of Guamka, the thermal springs of the Aquarius base will be the best place to relax.  For vacationers, there are 3 pools: 1 large, the depth of which reaches 1.5 meters, 2 small ones.  Hot water is supplied from wells with a depth of more than 1 kilometer.  Since the pools are built in such a way that hot and cold water is supplied on the one hand, and the outlet is on the other hand, the water in them is flowing.  The regulation of hot and cold flow is carried out in such a way that the water temperature is kept at about 38 degrees heat.  This is clearly seen in cool weather, as there is steam around the pools.  For swimming in the pools, it is recommended to follow a certain regime, according to which, after 15 minutes in the water, it is necessary to rest on land for 5 minutes.  At the same time, special attention is paid not so much to the time schedule as to the well-being of the vacationer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="holidays in guamka thermal springs" class="if" height="214" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/347572.jpg?1393953189879" width="320"></div>
