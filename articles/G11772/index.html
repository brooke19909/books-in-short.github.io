    <h2>  So tighter </h2><p>  Art historians never tire of admiring him.  After all, this magnificent building, made in the Gothic style, is distinguished by impeccable symmetry.  Initially, on the spot where the stone church in Gervyaty is now located, there was a wooden building.  Permission for its construction was obtained from Bishop Jan of Vilnius in 1526.  After several centuries, the lands on which the wooden temple was located began to belong to the princes Domeyko.  They also began the construction of the church in Gervyaty in 1899.  The construction was carried out with high quality.  Maybe that's why the Church in Gervyaty survived in the first and second world war.  Even the organ has been preserved.  Although it was installed at the beginning of the 20th century.  Outwardly, the church in Gervyaty also did not change. </p><h2>  Seen from everywhere </h2><p>  The building was built in the shape of a cross.  The bell tower is located at its base.  For the Trinity Church in Gervyaty to stand for so long, the architects had to work hard, drawing up a project and making calculations.  Therefore, the arkbutans and buttresses located on the sides of the building not only decorate the temple, but also give it extraordinary stability.  It is these elements that make the church look like Notre Dame Cathedral.  The height of the bell tower spire reaches 65 meters, so it is visible to everyone who comes to Gervyaty.  The Church of the Holy Trinity is surrounded by a park, which is decorated with carved crosses and figures of the apostles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Do it yourself </h2><p>  To build a magnificent temple, it took a lot of building materials.  Therefore, it was decided to build a brick factory near it.  Also needed lime.  It was made from lime stones, which were mined from the bottom of the Losha River.  In order for it to be strong, it was necessary to mix chicken eggs.  It took them several thousand.  The eggs were handed over by local residents.  But the tiles were ordered in Germany.  The architect A.I. worked on the project of the Trinity Church.  Alshalovsky and architect V. Mikhnevich.  In order to carry out such a large-scale work, the daily work of 70 workers for four years was required. </p><h2>  Like everyone </h2><p>  The interior of the temple is distinguished by its modesty.  But at the same time it is cozy and beautiful.  Inside the temple is amazing acoustics, so listening to the organ is a pleasure.  Services in the Church of the Holy Trinity are still ongoing.  Moreover, they are conducted in three languages.  This is because the church unites three Catholic parishes under its roof - Lithuanian, Polish and Belarusian. </p>

    <h2>  Not own land </h2><p>  I would like to talk about the fact that Gervyaty, the Church of the Holy Trinity is located there, belong to the Ostrovets district of the <span>Grodno region.</span>  Namely, in this western part, the majority of the population professes Catholicism.  Therefore, the temple, which hosts regular services, is loved and revered by parishioners.  By the way, Gervyaty are considered Lithuanian territory, although they are located in Belarus.  Therefore, residents have Lithuanian passports.  This explains the decor elements of the temple, for example, carved crosses that remind us of Lithuanian culture. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Arboretum </h2><p>  Interestingly, about thirty years ago, the Church of the Holy Trinity was not a tourist attraction.  It all started with the fact that the local priests decided to ennoble the territory of the temple and plant an arboretum around it.  Moreover, each parishioner also had to contribute to this matter.  The priest brought all kinds of seedlings and cuttings, including thuja.  It was believed that the thuja will not be able to grow in Belarusian conditions and will die in the winter.  Surprisingly, the trees survived.  After all, parishioners took care of each, who were also supposed to look after a certain piece of land around "their" tree.  The priest was also involved in the restoration of the temple.  Then he brought and erected the statues of the twelve apostles.  As a result, a few years later the temple was registered as a tourist attraction and people began to come to the village to see the amazing historical building, as well as admire the arboretum. </p>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  So you found out about the church in Gervyaty.  How to get to where it is?  This is easy to do.  It can be reached by public transport or by car.  First you need to get to the capital of Belarus, Minsk.  If you are traveling by car, then you will need to move towards Molodechno, then to Smorgon, then to Ostrovets.  From it, head to the village of Vorniany, from it you will have to drive 5 kilometers to Gervyat.  Traveling on the Belarusian land will take place along the routes P28, P 106, P 63, P 48. </p><h2>  That's more interesting </h2><p>  If you travel by public transport, then in Minsk you will need to take the Minsk-Gudogai diesel engine.  He leaves early in the morning at 6 hours 10 minutes.  When you get to Gudogai, you will need to transfer by bus to Ostrovets.  There is a bus from him to the village of Vornjany.  But it is better to take the one that will bring you immediately to Gervyaty, so as not to make an extra transplant. </p>
