    <h2>  Hotel History </h2><p>  It all started back in 1987 - then the foundation of the hotel was barely laid.  Two years later, in 1989, the hotel began to work.  Initially, it was a very small, compact complex that accommodated only a few people.  But this, of course, was not enough, as the tourism business developed rapidly.  People found out about the hotel and began to actively book rooms there.  Because I had to expand.  In 1994, a new complex was erected.  13 years ago a repair was carried out, and not an elementary cosmetic one.  A three-star hotel has become a four-star hotel - it has become much more modern, plumbing has been changed, new furniture bought.  But the largest reconstruction took place between 2007 and 2008 - then the brand new Flegra Palace Hotel 4 * appeared in front of tourists.  Photos of the old and modern hotel are very different from each other.  Thus, the small hotel, which was planned as a family business, has become one of the most visited hotels in Greece. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  A picturesque place away from noise </h2><p>  Flegra <span>Palace Hotel 4 *</span> is located on the Kassandra Peninsula (western part of Halkidiki).  The place where the hotel is located is, on the one hand, very advantageous, and on the other hand, not quite.  Here are picturesque landscapes, beautiful reefs, cliffs, endless expanses of sea, peace and quiet.  But, on the other hand, the hotel is still quite far from the airport - it is 105 kilometers from it.  Even if this means that in these places it is very calm and quiet, still after the flight you want to get to your hotel as soon as possible.  However, this minus fades against the background of the advantages that the hotel complex boasts.  It is surrounded by an evergreen magnificent garden, and only a few 150 meters from it is a sandy beach.  In addition, if you walk around the surroundings, you can see numerous shops and Greek taverns, which are definitely worth a visit, treat yourself to shopping and purchase gifts for friends and relatives. </p><h2>  Fun and relaxation </h2><p>  The Flegra Palace Hotel 4 * (Pefkohori) offers a wide variety of entertainment - from the outdoor swimming pool to the terrace.  Those who enjoy an active lifestyle can play table tennis or billiards, go diving or rent a bicycle and enjoy the scenic surroundings.  By the way, on the territory of the complex there is a gym equipped with everything that is necessary for truly full-fledged training.  If you want to relax, you can take a hot tub.  And, of course, while on vacation in Greece, you can not ignore water and beach sports. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Accommodation cost </h2><p>  If we talk about which hotel clearly wins in terms of a combination of price and quality indicators, then the Flegra Palace Hotel 4 *, reviews of which guests leave with great pleasure, will be in the forefront.  Of course, this is not a very economical option, but the fact that it is budgetary can be said with confidence.  For example, a double comfortable room for seven nights and eight days will cost 62 thousand rubles (for two).  And this is taking into account all taxes and breakfast.  If you take the same apartment, but for one, you will have to pay 45,000 rubles.  When pre-booking, by the way, you can indicate your wishes regarding which bed will be in the room - a double or two single.  And now the most important thing is how much the executive suite costs.  A week of rest in such apartments will cost only 75 thousand rubles for two.  For special conditions this is a very low price.  Probably because of this, the hotel is never empty.  Therefore, having decided to choose this hotel as a temporary residence, it is worth considering the issue of booking at least a month before check-in. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  A few words should be said about how developed in the Flegra Palace Hotel 4 * restaurant service.  The first thing to note is the Titanes restaurant.  It is located in a cozy place surrounded by greenery.  A pleasant atmosphere, conducive to a delicious dinner, a decent contingent, polite waiters and amazing Mediterranean cuisine - all this is here.  In addition, guests can indulge in traditional Greek delicacies.  And, of course, there is a bar with a huge assortment of light snacks, cocktails and drinks. </p>
