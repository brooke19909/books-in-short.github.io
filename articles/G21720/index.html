  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The procedure for calculating vacation allowances and payments</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Payments of various kinds are an integral part of accounting work.  Holidays and temporary disability benefits are ubiquitous.  Workers often also want to know exactly how the calculation is made.  Therefore, it is necessary not only to understand for ourselves what, according to the current legislation, is the correct procedure for calculating vacation allowances, for temporary incapacity for work in 2017.  It should also be borne in mind that this directly depends on the legislation of the country in which the calculations and accruals are made.  So, in Russia or Belarus, the calculations will be different, although the general algorithms are preserved. </p><h2>  Holidays and their varieties </h2><p>  There are several types of vacations an accountant has to deal with.  The main types include: </p><ul><li>  <em>Annual basic paid vacation</em> .  As the name implies, it is given for the worked year.  However, the employee may receive the first part, in the amount of fourteen calendar days, after he has worked for at least six months at the enterprise.  It does not matter if he changed his position or not.  In general, the number of vacation days cannot be less than 28. More is possible.  Thus, the procedure for calculating vacation pay in budgetary institutions does not differ from commercial ones, however, the number of vacation days is 56. </li><li>  <em>Extra vacation</em> .  The most common option is extra days for mischief.  This is the name of the number of days, for example, fourteen, which the employee can count on if his work is associated with dangerous or unhealthy working conditions. </li><li>  <em>Free or administrative leave</em> .  This type is interesting only to employees of the personnel department, since payment for it, as can be seen from its name, is not made.  It is issued to the employee if he does not have vacation days, but they are extremely necessary for him.  Administrative leave can be arranged for a month or for a couple of days, depending on the need. </li><li>  <em>Student leave</em> .  According to the Labor Code of the Russian Federation, it relies on those who study by correspondence education, receive education for the first time.  At the same time, the session is paid at both the higher and secondary educational institutions.  There is a strict limit on the number of paid days.  So, in the first year, the calendar sum of the days of a session cannot exceed forty-five.  Otherwise, days beyond this rate are not paid by the company.  However, they are not absenteeism.  That is, on the basis of a certificate-call, the employee has the right to administrative leave for unpaid days in excess of student leave.  Also, before defending a diploma, an employee is entitled to four paid months.  The procedure for calculating vacation pay in 2017 in this sense has not changed. </li></ul>

This is necessary in order to calculate the number of days that an employee must rest, and also for this period, wage amounts can be taken for calculation. </li><li>  The amount of vacation pay, which is calculated by an accounting officer. </li><li>  Tax payments.  Holidays are usually transferred to an employee, net of taxes and other deductions. </li></ul><p>  Of course, before the employee can get his vacation, time will pass.  However, vacation pay is transferred no later than three days before the onset of vacation.  The procedure for calculating and paying vacation pay in this regard is strict.  If the employee received the money later, he has the right to write a complaint.  As a result, the company will pay a fine. </p><p>  However, the employee should also remember that the vacation schedule is prepared in advance, and the vacation application must be signed fourteen days before it begins. </p>

    <h2>  Estimated vacation period </h2><p>  The procedure for calculating vacation pay is closely related to such a concept as a billing period.  Roughly speaking, this is the period during which the employee takes a vacation.  That is, if an employee has worked the prescribed six months, then he is entitled to fourteen calendar days of vacation.  It should be noted that if an employee is involved in hazardous production with full workload, then it may additionally take him another seven days.  Thus, the employee is entitled to twenty-one paid vacation days.  Also, the calculation will be made on the basis of his salary for these previous six months. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, if the employee has not taken the next year for a long time, more than 12 months, the procedure for calculating and accruing vacation pay is such that the previous year will be taken to calculate the amount of benefits. </p><h2>  Practical example </h2><p>  If the employee Petrov V.V. came to the enterprise on January 1, 2015, and went on vacation only in March 2016, then his estimated period will be the interval from January to December 2015.  That is, during this time he is entitled to 28 calendar days of vacation, taking into account that he is not involved in harmful production. </p><p>  However, despite the billing period, vacation payings to V.V. Petrov will be calculated from wages for the interval from March 2015 to February 2016.  Since it is he who precedes the date of his stay in the next vacation.  The procedure for calculating vacation pay in 2017 does not bear any changes in this regard. </p>

    <h2>  Calculation of vacation pay.  main parameters </h2><p>  Holidays are calculated from the employee's wages for the billing period.  The number of days worked by him in each month is also taken into account. </p><p>  According to Russian law, the procedure for calculating vacation pay is such that for every month a worker has worked for him, he counts 29.3 days.  This is the average number of working days per year, excluding holidays. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  That is, if a person worked for the whole year, all twelve months, then the total number of days worked for calculating vacation pay would be: 351.6 days. </p><h2>  What periods are deducted from the calculation </h2><p>  The procedure for accruing vacation pay, which is followed by an accountant, suggests that the calculation of benefits does not include periods in which the employee: </p><ul><li>  was on another vacation; </li><li>  Received maternity allowance; </li><li>  Received temporary disability benefits </li><li>  was on a business trip; </li><li>  took formal administrative leave. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Examples of vacation pay </h2><p>  Employee Petrov V.V., who spent the year preceding the vacation at the enterprise, worked all months except January 2016.  During this period, he took a sheet on temporary disability for ten calendar days. </p><p>  Thus, the accountant must calculate vacation pay as follows: for eleven months V. Petrov worked 322.3 calendar days. </p><p>  In January he worked out: (31-10) * 29.3.  The amount received is divided into 31 calendar days.  Total - 19.85.  That is, the number of days worked by the employee for the billing period was 342.15 days. </p>

    <h2>  Amounts that are not taken into account vacation pay </h2><p>  The procedure for accruing benefits, vacation pay, suggests that not all amounts are involved in the calculation.  So, usually remove the following <span>types of payments</span> : </p><ul><li>  Payment of those periods that are not taken into account.  That is, if the employee was on a business trip, then the trip days and the amounts paid for being in it are not taken into account. </li><li>  <span>Material assistance to the employee,</span> that is, those payments that are designed to improve the <span>financial situation of the</span> employee, or to stimulate his work.  So, this may include financial assistance for the birth of a child or on the eighth of March. </li><li>  One-time bonuses.  For example, a bonus to the day of the power engineer for those associated with this holiday. </li></ul><h2>  An example of calculating vacation pay.  Amounts </h2><p>  Worker Petrov V.V. receives a salary of 30,000 rubles each month.  However, in December 2015, he received a bonus for the New Year in the amount of 5,000 rubles.  This type of payment is not taken into account in the calculation, since it contradicts the procedure for calculating vacation pay, so that the wage that is taken to calculate Petrov V.'s allowance is 30,000 * 12 months.  Total: 360,000 rubles. </p><p>  The amount of employee's vacation for one day is: 360,000 / 342.15 = 1,052 rubles 17 kopecks. </p><p>  For 28 calendar days Petrov V. In will be charged 29,460 rubles.  76 kopecks </p><p>  However, the employee will receive on hand the amount minus 13 percent, since this is a tax on the income of this person.  The procedure for calculating and recording vacation pay implies that for each of these actions the accountant will subsequently draw up a corresponding entry. </p>

    <h2>  Disability Allowance </h2><p>  Calculation of benefits for temporary disability or sick leave has a different look.  So, the calculation takes into account the two previous years, regardless of whether the employee worked at that time or not.  So, the employee Petrov V.V. in the absence of seniority and, accordingly, and wages, will have a minimum amount of disability. </p><p>  So, when leaving for sick leave in January 2016, 2014 and 2015 are taken.  The employee had a salary only in 2015 in the amount of 360,000 for the entire period.  However, this amount will be divided by 730 days. </p><p>  Thus, the amount of payment for one day will be: 360000/730 = 493 rubles 15 kopecks. </p><p>  However, an employee‚Äôs seniority also plays a role.  So, if an employee has an experience of up to five years, then he is paid only 60 percent of the accrued, that is, 295 rubles 89 kopecks.  Of course, taxes are also levied on this amount. </p>

    <h2>  Interesting facts on temporary disability benefits </h2><p>  Temporary disability benefits can be obtained within six months of the onset of the disease.  This does not mean that the employee who gave the sick leave to the employer will wait so much.  No, he has the right to present this document within six months, and he does not have the right to refuse. </p><p>  As for the terms of payment, now, from 2015, a pilot project of the Social Insurance Fund has entered into force in most regions.  According to him, the employer after taking the sick leave has five calendar days to send data on him in social insurance. </p><p>  In turn, this organization within ten days checks the correctness of the sheet and calculations, and then two days for transfer.  On average, an employee waits for his money for about two weeks.  More often listed before this deadline. </p><p>  It is also worth remembering that women who have just left parental leave have the right to choose for themselves for what period to take wages.  Namely: if in the year that is taken into account, there is at least one day spent on maternity benefits, then this year can be replaced by another.  This is to ensure that women are not infringed on their rights. </p><h2>  Other accounting methods: countries </h2><p>  Often, from beginner accountants you can hear questions regarding the procedure for calculating vacation pay in Belarus or other countries.  Everything here is individual and depends on the legislation in force in this country. </p><p>  In this case, similar algorithms are used.  However, a different calculation of the number of vacation days is taken.  Also, the average number of days is 29.7 days, not 29.3.  The rest of the algorithm is similar.  The average monthly wage is divided by the average number of days per month.  The total is multiplied by the number of vacation days. </p><p>  Calculation of vacation pay and temporary disability benefits are the things that every accounting employee faces.  You should rely directly on the current legislation of the country in which the organization operates.  However, there are convenient formulas that help the calculations. </p>
