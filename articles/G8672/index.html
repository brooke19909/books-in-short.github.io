    <h2>  Hotel reviews </h2><p>  A lot of people planning a vacation both in Turkey and in other countries, when choosing a hotel, try to study, if possible, all available reviews about other tourists staying in it.  Therefore, today we decided to summarize the comments of travelers who spent their holidays at the Magic Life Waterward Imperial hotel complex in Belek. </p><p>  Most tourists agree that this hotel is very good for outdoor enthusiasts.  Almost every traveler noted the excellent sports and entertainment infrastructure of the hotel complex.  After all, there are several tennis courts, five-a-side football fields, a basketball court, etc. In one word, this hotel literally provokes vacationers to go in for sports, which is a big plus. </p><p>  Guests also spoke positively about entertainment.  So, everyone with pleasure (both adults and children) rode the slides in the local water park.  Many also liked the possibility of free rides on a "banana" on the beach. </p><p>  Many controversial comments related to nutrition at Magic Life Waterworld.  Someone considered the menu varied enough, and the dishes were tasty, and someone was sure that the food here was not quite up to the proper level (5 stars). </p><p>  As for the rooms themselves, some of the guests were confused by the humidity in the rooms.  Although most tourists did not show such complaints.  Some travelers were a little unhappy with the fact that at night they turned on the <span>central air conditioning</span> in ventilation mode in order to save electricity.  In this regard, at night in the rooms sometimes it happened stuffy.  As for cleaning the rooms and changing linen and towels, there is no problem with this at the hotel. </p><p>  Another point that a number of tourists have complained about is that the Magic Life Waterward hotel is mainly aimed at travelers from Germany, who make up about 80% of all guests here.  In this regard, the hotel staff practically does not speak Russian.  However, if you speak English at least at the school curriculum level, you will not have any communication problems. </p><p>  In general, most tourists were satisfied with their stay at the Magic Life Waterward and would recommend this hotel to their friends and acquaintances. </p>

    <h2>  Belek: resort description </h2><p>  Belek is a young, but very dynamically developing resort, located on the Turkish coast of the Mediterranean Sea.  The first tourists to this region, famous today for its cedar, eucalyptus and pine groves, pristine sandy beaches and the warm sea, arrived in the eighties of the last century.  Today, Belek is the most respectable, and therefore the most expensive resort in the entire Republic of Turkey. </p><p>  Due to the fact that the settlements here began to appear relatively recently, in Belek you will not find any historical sights.  However, due to its favorable geographical location, from here you can make fascinating trips to the most interesting monuments of the entire province of Antalya. </p><p>  So, for example, if you want to touch history, then after spending only fifteen minutes on the road, you will find yourself in the ancient city of Aspendos.  Particularly noteworthy here is the well-preserved amphitheater.  In the summer, various concerts are even held here, visiting of which will leave an indelible impression.  Also, about twenty minutes from Belek, there are the ruins of two more ancient cities - Sillon and Perge. </p><p>  Nature lovers should definitely visit the Koprulu Canyon National Park.  Here you will enjoy picturesque views.  In addition, a bridge erected by the ancient Romans was thrown over it.  On the river, passing along the bottom of the canyon, you can go rafting. </p><p>  In addition, Belek is one of the world famous golf centers.  So, here is the National Golf Club, international competitions are held.  Beginners can also try their hand at this aristocratic game in numerous venues. </p><p>  The magnificent beaches of Belek stretch for twenty kilometers.  All of them are sandy, clean and even.  The entrance to the water is flat everywhere, without stones.  All beaches have the necessary infrastructure to make your stay enjoyable and comfortable. </p><p>  As for restaurants and cafes, there are not so many of them in Belek.  Indeed, in this region there are mainly four- and five-star hotels offering all-inclusive meals to their guests.  Thus, tourists prefer to have lunch and dinner in the restaurants of their hotel complexes.  A similar situation has developed with the nightlife of the city.  There are several discos and nightclubs, but in terms of their scope they, of course, cannot be compared with Antalya or Istanbul.  This is explained by the fact that each luxury <span>Belek hotel</span> offers its guests an extensive entertainment program, including discos.  Thus, tourists do not need to look for additional entertainment outside their hotel. </p><p>  It should be noted that the rest in Belek is mostly designed for wealthy people who are used to staying in luxurious comfortable five-star hotels.  In this regard, you are unlikely to find cheerful companies of noisy youth here.  This resort meets the highest international quality standards and is perfect for a respectable family holiday by the sea. </p>
