Over time, devices such as the Sony Ericsson Xperia Neo, which were based on Android, began to come out. </p><p>  In the wake of the great popularity of this operating system, many companies tried to succeed (and not unsuccessfully), which released their flagship devices on its basis.  The plans for Sony Ericsson Xperia Neo from the manufacturer were exactly the same, as a result of which, in addition to this device, three other smartphones from a rather high price segment were announced. </p><h2>  History </h2>

    <p>  It is worth noting the fact that, by coincidence, the demonstration of this device was delayed in Japan, despite the fact that at that time it was one of the most massive devices in the future.  Initially, the company planned to launch this device in April, that is, to launch deliveries of Sony Ericsson Xperia Neo and Xperia Arc at the same time, but rightly decided that in the situation of a serious shortage of components, it is best to give priority to the production of more expensive devices that are currently sold at a price of approximately 25 000 rubles.  It is worth noting that the cost of Neo was planned in the region of 19,000 rubles, and for this cost this mobile phone could be called a very balanced device, the characteristics of which it practically did not concede to its flagship counterparts, apart from another design and not so big display. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How relevant is it? </h2><p>  For most users, the Sony Ericsson Xperia Neo represents a middle ground, since it is hardly possible to find at least one more such device, which at its price would have approximately the same characteristics.  For example, if you take into account the HTC Desire S, the technical characteristics of which are close to this model, then its price is 22,000 rubles, and smartphones from Samsung also have approximately the same cost. </p><h2>  Design </h2>

    <p>  Due to the fact that the Sony Ericsson Xperia Neo phone is equipped with a 3.7-inch screen with a ratio of 16: 9, it can be called a fairly compact device, as a result of which it will definitely appeal to those people who are not used to carrying too large mobile phones.  The width of the case of this phone reaches 57 mm, making it especially common, since similar models from other manufacturers were at least 1 cm wider, which is not such a small difference for most people. </p><p>  If you look in more detail at what Sony Ericsson Xperia Neo features, you can pay special attention to the case thickness of 13 mm, which is especially smoothed out by an oval profile and beveled ends.  In principle, there are no wrangles with regard to the design of this device, since it is a slightly modernized design of the Vivaz phone, which was somewhat modified with the help of very, very successful elements.  In the end, we got a very good device that stands out from other smartphones that use this operating system. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Housing </h2>

    <p>  Smartphone Sony Ericsson Xperia Neo has a body, which was called Human Curvature, that is, its main advantage is that it fully corresponds to the shape of a human hand.  This case is made of specialized smooth plastic, while the range of the phone includes several colors: red, black and silver.  It is worth noting that about Sony Ericsson Xperia Neo user reviews separately note the blackness of the black phone of this model, while the red and silver devices are more stable in this case.  Perhaps that is why the phones of this red model are most widely used, since they do not have any fingerprints. </p><h2>  Control </h2>

    <p>  The controls are almost the same as those used in the previously released Vivaz device, that is, there is a round button on the right side, designed to lock or turn off the phone, and there is a long button, which can be used to adjust the volume if necessary.  In the upper end you can find all the necessary outputs (HDMI, micro-USB, 3.5 mm headphone output).  It is worth noting the fact that the headphone jack in the similar flagship Arc is located on the side, so the ability to more conveniently connect headphones in this phone can be called its additional advantage. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Below the screen are three buttons that are known to many users by Arc.  If you give a quick overview of Sony Ericsson Xperia Neo, you can see that there is no separate button for searching, which will be an advantage for some people, and a certain disadvantage for others.  Above the screen there is exactly the same set of components - these are light and proximity sensors, as well as a standard conversational speaker. </p><h2>  Front-camera </h2><p>  It is immediately evident that the <span>front camera</span> has a rather large lens, and this can be called another advantage compared to the flagship model of the time Arc, because in principle such a camera was completely absent on it.  This camera has 1.3 megapixels, that is, it is quite enough to make video calls with acceptable quality, and if at that time video calls were not so much in demand, then today the use of such a device is quite relevant and can hardly be called a simple tribute to fashion . </p><h2>  Screen </h2>

    <p>  It is worth noting that Sony Ericsson at that time could hardly be called a leader in terms of the quality of the screens used, because it did not produce any models that would use an AMOLED display.  On the Sony Ericsson Xperia Neo photo you can see that the company began to use specialized software solutions, such as the Sony Bravia Mobile Engine, which have shown themselves quite successfully in the televisions of this company, where they were used for signal preprocessing.  Thus, the overall quality of images and videos during viewing is significantly improved. </p><p>  If you take into account the fact that the device uses a specialized Live Color filter, the picture of this smartphone is much more contrast, clear and realistic, but you should not forget that this feature of this device is not hardware, but software, so you can turn it on or off in the settings, and at the same time it works exclusively with graphics, that is, in the menu you will not notice any changes. </p><h2>  Neo and AMOLED </h2><p>  Of course, it is worth noting that the image quality on this screen can hardly be compared in principle with what modern AMOLED cranes and displays on the iPhone provide, but progress is present, and the overall impression of the device is much better than what could be observed on the previous Xperia X10.  It is worth noting that in this model there are far from the largest viewing angles, as a result of which the image on the phone fades significantly when tilted, but this is a completely standard limitation for all TFT displays. </p><h2>  Hardware platform </h2>

    <p>  In Sony Ericsson Xperia Neo, the instruction says that on the hardware platform this device is similar to the flagship Arc, which is its undoubted advantage, given its cost.  The platform in this device is Qualcomm QDS8255, the frequency of which is 1 GHz.  Theoretically, the difference is due to low power consumption, as well as more efficient optimization, but in fact, practice has shown that, in principle, there is practically no difference.  Regardless of any additional conditions, Arc was compared by the manufacturer with the most modern dual-core competitors, so for Neo such a hardware platform is more than optimal. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  For any smartphone, which is based on the Android operating system, energy consumption is a particularly sore subject, and with the growth of characteristics, everything only worsens.  The situation regarding the energy consumption of these smartphones looks a little better, and at the same time, in practice, the device shows a longer performance compared to competitors with similar parameters.  Most likely, this is also due to the use of updated screen technology, as well as a simpler interface, however, in case of fairly intense loads, the operating time of this smartphone lasts throughout the daylight hours, and this is quite normal for Android. </p><h2>  Memory </h2>

    <p>  The initial memory capacity reaches 512 MB, of which slightly more than 300 MB remain free, that is, among the analogues, these indicators are not advanced, but at the same time are quite normal.  Moreover, if the RAM in this device is enough, then using an additional array of internal memory would be a good solution.  In Android 2.2 and higher, you can install all kinds of applications directly on the memory card, but in fact this memory is seriously lacking.  Similar devices from Samsung, Nokia and Motorola have a built-in 8-16 GB array, while the Sony Ericsson Xperia Neo differs only in the presence of an 8 GB memory card, which is standard in the kit. </p><p>  Thus, this model stands out quite well even among the predominant majority of modern phones, especially when you consider the cost of this smartphone today.  According to the technical characteristics, a smartphone can compete with many modern devices, although its only drawback in which it is definitely inferior even to the devices of its time is its display, since the company could already use a more modern type of screen. </p>
