    <h2>  How to get to the island of entertainment? </h2><p>  First of all, you will have to make a flight to Nyachang.  From here you can already see the wonderful island of Hong Che, which is located 3 km from the city.  You can get to it by water or air.  It is worth noting that the boat carries tourists around the clock and for free, and the cable car from 09:00 to 21:00.  You can‚Äôt bring food and drinks with you, apparently, because of the habit of tourists to leave trash after themselves. </p><p>  The cable car is a separate, most beautiful attraction that runs over the sea.  The length of the cable car is 3320 meters, height - 70 meters, it is listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the longest in the world.  Each booth is designed for 6-8 people, and that tourists do not get bored on the road, peppy music plays.  The funicular is supported by five huge columns, which are illuminated in the evening, forming a magic bridge.  Once on the island, you can begin to inspect it, this will help you with the card that is handed over when buying a ticket. </p>

    <h2>  Ticket price </h2><p>  The price of admission to the park is 450,000 dong.  It seems to be not so small, but the price includes visiting any attractions, slot machines, 3D cinemas, climbing Mount Winperl in small cars and all other entertainment facilities on the island.  Vacationers at the hotel "Winperl Resort &amp; SPA" visit the park for free. </p><p>  The cost of a trip by <span>cable car</span> is included in the price of the admission ticket, this is approximately $ 22.  If the fear of heights prevents you from enjoying this wonderful attraction, then you can cross the water.  Traveling by boat will cost a little more (600,000 dong, about $ 35).  If you are going to arrange an excursion to an amusement park, then try to choose a weekday, because all tourists note a large influx of local residents on the weekend, and after all, no one likes to stand in line. </p>

    <h2>  Attractions for adults and children </h2><p>  Just for the sake of it it is worth visiting Vietnam.  Amusement Park "Winperl" is famous all over the world.  Right next to the entrance you will see the Roller Coaster.  Steep turns, endless climbs and rapid descents, on which, as if falling into the abyss, will give many pleasant memories.  There are age restrictions, for the smallest you need to come up with another entertainment.  Fans of free flight will be conquered by the "Flying Swings".  They hover at high altitude in three directions.  Children will enjoy all kinds of attractions with animals: "flying elephants", "horses" and many others. </p><p>  Love extreme sports - then for you "flying bicycles".  This is a difficult track, with many dizzying slopes, steep pikes and turns, but you are not sitting in the usual booth, but in the saddle of a bicycle.  When the time comes for the "dead loop", the <span>heart goes into heels.</span>  Another interesting attraction is the descent from the mountain.  You get into the ‚Äútypewriter‚Äù, on the cable it is lifted to the top, and vice versa, independently adjusting the speed at sharp turns, you rush down.  And for family vacations, Winperl Park (Vietnam) offers a ride on the Ferris Wheel.  A leisurely move allows you to explore everything around, admiring the surrounding views. </p>

    <h2>  Aquapark </h2><p>  It is quite impressive in size, occupies 60,000 m2.  Largely thanks to him, we became so visited in Vietnam.  Waterpark "Winperl" is located on the seashore.  It differs from a number of water attractions in the country, because it is freshwater.  Not only children, but also adults enthusiastically fly here from the slides and splash around in the pools.  Here the so-called lazy river flows, in which you can arrange races on inflatable rafts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vietnam Waterpark Waterpark" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/470351.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <p>  The children's area is a ‚Äúpaddling pool‚Äù with small slides and shallow pools.  Further more interesting slides begin, which can give the most vivid impressions, one especially made in the shape of the letter ‚Äúu‚Äù is especially popular.  Rolling down from the extreme right point, you arrive at the opposite upper edge at such a speed that only the sides keep from not flying out.  And so from edge to edge to the very bottom.  There are many water slides, you can ride on them with pillows, circles, mattresses, bananas.  There is even a zone with artificial waves.  You can stay here all day, returning to childhood and get a great mood. </p><p>  And finally, the beach itself.  He is very beautiful here, with snow-white, fine sand.  The cleanliness of the sea near the water park is in question, judging by the reviews, it varies depending on the season, but you can sunbathe for fun. </p><h2>  Oceanarium </h2><p>  If in your city there is no such institution, then you will be subdued.  It doesn‚Äôt matter if you ever liked to watch fish, you won‚Äôt want to leave this place for sure.  Basically, there are fish that are typical for these places, a kind of underwater Vietnam.  "Winperl" (whose photo can be found on any tourist site) has collected a collection of 300 interesting fish.  This is a real work of art, in front of which even European aquariums fade. </p><p>  The aquarium is grandiose, it occupies a separate building, the size of 2 floors.  Interesting design, original lighting makes the visit a real journey into the unknown.  First, we advise you to go to the second floor, there is a number of aquariums of various sizes, and get acquainted with its inhabitants.  But the most important miracle awaits you ahead.  The entire lower floor is a huge aquarium, through which there is a tunnel with an escalator.  You can go and slowly look at the real underwater world, a giant ramp flutters, and a majestic and unhurried shark swims nearby.  Usually, tourists are not limited to one circle; one wants to watch the life of mysterious creatures for hours. </p>

    <h2>  Slot machine park </h2><p>  Children, and most adults, cannot be pulled out of here until the end of the day.  If you arrived on a package tour, then you can spend some time on this fascinating activity.  Compared to most entertainment centers, where the largest amount is left on the slot machines, everything has already been paid at the entrance.  This is what makes Winperl (Vietnam) famous.  Reviews of tourists sing praises of the opportunity to fulfill a childhood dream and play on all available machines. </p><p>  This park occupies a huge three-story building.  There are also 4D cinemas, a huge hall with all the electric cars loved by everyone, as well as a spinning bull - for those who want to feel like a bullfighter. </p><p>  When you find yourself in such expanse, your eyes run wide, you want to try everything in a row, the clock flies just unnoticed.  If you came to the park only for one day, it is better to bypass this place, leaving the next time, otherwise you will not have time for anything else. </p><h2>  Small amphitheater </h2><p>  It is usually deserted during the day, you can only admire the original, beautifully designed building.  But by the evening miracles begin to happen.  Like the ancient Romans, sitting on stone lodges, one can observe the amazing performance of trained dogs and cats, a small circus with monkeys.  In addition, small groups show incendiary dance numbers.  And finally, the most spectacular and colorful performance begins at 19:00, and lasts 30 minutes.  This is a show of fountains, a multi-colored musical action that fascinates and delights. </p>
