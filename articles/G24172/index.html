  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Italy - a huge museum under the sky dome</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Are there any people in the world who would not dream of visiting Italy?  Of course have!  These are residents of Italy itself, a hospitable, luxurious country, caressed by sea breezes and the sun, which gave birth to titans of art, gave inspiration to creators and has been dreaming for many conquerors for centuries.  Italy is a huge museum under the heavenly dome, which can rightfully be called the historical and cultural treasury of Europe: the lion's share of the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the continent is here, among the sights of the country. </p><p>  The main attraction of Italy and its heart is the majestic and beautiful Rome.  The eternal city welcomes guests with a scattering of ancient squares, cathedrals and relics of ancient antiquity.  Among the many architectural monuments, the leading places are occupied by the Palatine, the ruins of the Forum, the cradle of the capital - the Capitol and, of course, the Colosseum - the most famous ruin of the world.  It is considered the peak of the architectural art of Rome and its main symbol.  Many travelers make their way to its territory at night to wander through the scanty moonlight through the wreckage of the galleries and while no one bothers to concentrate, imagine how the gladiators fought here, animals rushed, blood was pouring. </p><p>  Thanks to the fact that today <noindex>  <span>hotel booking in Italy</span> </noindex>  can be made via the Internet, many travelers seek to visit not only the capital of Italy, but also other famous cities of the country, in particular Naples.  Acquaintance with this expressive city usually begins with its historical center, which covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã17 km¬≤.  On the main square of the Piazza del Plebescitobo, a huge number of buildings have been built, which today are historical monuments.  Among them - the Palazzo Reale, the church of San Francesco, the pompous building of the gallery-passage Umberto I. </p><p>  A few kilometers from Naples many centuries ago was the ancient city of Pompeii, known to everyone today.  During the eruption of Vesuvius, he was buried under a thick layer of ash and lava.  During numerous excavations, the houses of the inhabitants of the city and several temples were found, including the temples of Jupiter, Apollo and Therma. </p><p>  Travelers and Venice are happy to visit.  This city is famous not only for its many canals, without which Venice would not be called Venice, but also monuments of architecture.  Among them is the oldest private church in Ateneo San Basso, built in 1076.  After several fires in 1105 and 1661, the building was restored and today it hosts classical music concerts. </p></div></article>
