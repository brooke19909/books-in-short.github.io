    <h2>  Hotel Policies </h2><p>  In accordance with the internal rules of the Royal Adam and Eve hotel complex (Belek, Turkey), check-in of travelers to their reserved rooms starts at two in the afternoon.  However, if you arrive at the hotel earlier than the indicated time, the administration will do everything possible to accommodate you right away.  But keep in mind that sometimes this is not possible (in the case when the hotel is full "to the eyeballs").  As a rule, such a situation happens at the height of the tourist season or during symposia and other business events.  In this case, you will be asked to leave your bulky items in the luggage storage room and stroll through the picturesque hotel grounds, have a snack, swim in the pool or go to the beach.  On the day of departure, your room should be vacated before noon.  Then it is necessary to pay for the entire period of stay at the hotel, as well as for the use of additional services.  If you previously paid for your room with a travel agency, then at check out you will only have to pay for services not included in the price of the tour, if you resorted to them.  As for pets, it is possible in the rooms located in the villas.  But prior coordination with the hotel complex is required. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  As mentioned above, the luxurious Royal Adam &amp; Eve Hotel 5 * has 434 rooms located in the main large six-story building, as well as 24 one-story villas.

So, we offer you the following approximate price order for a seven-day stay in a hotel complex in August: double designer room - from 140 thousand rubles, triple designer room - from 188 thousand rubles, family room - from 280 thousand rubles.  In other months, the cost will be slightly lower. </p><h2>  Hotel reviews </h2><p>  In order to find out what this hotel complex actually offers guests, we summarized the comments of our compatriots who had already visited Royal Adam &amp; Eve (Belek, Turkey).  Hotels whose accommodation prices really correspond to the highest quality of service stated in their description are not so common.  However, in the case of Adam and Eve, this, judging by the reviews of tourists, is indeed so. </p><p>  First of all, almost all travelers were pleasantly surprised by the original design of the hotel.  Many in their comments mention comfortable furniture in the rooms and an abundance of large luxurious mirrors.  There were no complaints about the cleanliness and regularity of cleaning and changing linen in the rooms. </p><p>  As for nutrition, here our compatriots are for the most part unanimous: the cooks of ‚ÄúAdam and Eve‚Äù work wonderfully and are true professionals in their field;  the choice of food and drinks here is simply huge, and everything is exceptionally high-quality and tasty. </p><p>  Despite the fact that in summer the hotel is almost 100% full, both in restaurants and in other places, it is always not crowded.  Tourists really liked the beach with a fine clean sand, comfortable sun loungers and tents, a magnificent pier and a gentle entry into the water. </p><p>  Of particular note is the animation in this hotel.  However, according to tourists, it is designed mainly for young people.  But couples with children, our compatriots believe, will not be very comfortable here. </p><p>  In general, the vast majority of travelers were more than happy with their choice of hotel.  They had exceptionally pleasant memories of their holidays in ‚ÄúAdam and Eve‚Äù (Belek), and they are ready to return here again, as well as recommend the hotel to their friends and relatives. </p>
