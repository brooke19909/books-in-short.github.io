    <h2>  Why bother? </h2><p>  The reason is the fact that the document is not always purchased at the office of the insurance company.  Often insurance is extended through an agent who is not on the staff of the organization, and his earnings depend on the percentage.  It may happen that such an ‚Äúemployee‚Äù turns out to be a fraudster, who, along with real policies, ‚Äúdraws up‚Äù fake ones.  For this, falsified forms of an existing insurer or genuine, but owned by a bankrupt company, are used. </p><p>  You can also be contacted by a bankrupt insurer company that will offer a policy at a huge discount.  This should be alarming, since discounts are not possible in the OSAGO sphere, except for <span>the bonus-malus coefficient,</span> because prices are regulated by the Central Bank.  Therefore, it is likely that they are trying to sell you a fake. </p><p>  The offer to issue the policy retroactively should also raise suspicion.  Most likely, the license was revoked from the insurer, but the company is trying to earn at least something in the end.  Her forms, of course, are no longer valid. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  PCA test </h2><p>  So, how to check the insurance policy by last name, registration plate, driver‚Äôs license number or insurance number? </p><p>  You can do this quickly and for free using the website of the <span>Russian Union of Auto Insurers (RSA).</span>  A number of other resources also offer such an opportunity, but they still request information from the PCA database. </p><p>  It is enough to enter the form number, and you will receive information about the date of its issue, the name of the company for which it is registered, and the status of its license. </p>

    <p>  Well, if the question of how to check the MTPL policy, you take care before the purchase, and not after.  Therefore, it is desirable that your mobile phone or tablet has access to the Internet.  Ask the insurance agent for the form in which he intends to enter your data, and break through his number on the PCA database.  It is clear that if a document with the status of ‚Äúdamaged‚Äù, ‚Äústolen‚Äù, ‚Äúlost‚Äù, and also if the name of the insurance company does not match, then you can‚Äôt buy such a policy. </p><h2>  Visual inspection </h2><p>  How to check if the insurance policy is valid if there is no Internet access at hand?  Carefully inspect the document.  Goznak prints forms of policies, so they have signs of protection.  If you wish, you can "expose" even a very high-quality fake. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  The form should be 9-10 mm longer than a regular sheet of A4 paper. </li><li>  Feel, stroke the front surface of the policy.  The original has a special fabric texture (like a banknote) and differs to ordinary paper by touch. </li><li>  Bring the form to the light source to find out if there are watermarks on it.  You should see a large PCA logo. </li><li>  Examine the back of the document and find a <span>metallized thread</span> 2 mm wide.  It should be diving and not feel to the touch.  If the thread is simply glued or it is easy to feel, you have a fake in your hands. </li><li>  Upon careful inspection, you will see small red villi on the surface of the form.  They glow in the ultraviolet.  It is clear that you most likely do not have a special lamp, but note that it is almost impossible to recreate these fibers. </li><li>  The small guilloche pattern, which forms the green background of the policy, is too complicated for a conventional printer; moreover, it is carried out by the intaglio method - the lines are as if pressed into the paper.  If you draw along the pattern on the original with your finger, you can feel the relief. </li><li>  The document must be green and have an EEE series.  Starting May 1, 2015, the green BBB series letterhead is no longer in use, and the blue AAA series letterhead is an outdated version. </li><li>  The ten-digit number must have a relief and be felt. </li></ol><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to check who is issued an insurance policy" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14798/997987.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Compliance Procedure </h2><p>  It is useful not only to know how to check the policy for compulsory motor third-party liability insurance, but also how the registration procedure looks like in general. </p><p>  If you are cooperating with an agent, be sure to ask to show the contract with the insurer that he represents and the power of attorney to sign the contracts.  Make sure that after completing the transaction you have received all the necessary documents: </p><ul><li>  policy; </li><li>  policy rules; </li><li>  sticker on the windshield; </li><li>  copy of payment receipt; </li><li>  <span>accident notification forms</span> ; </li><li>  list of branches of the insurer. </li></ul><p>  Before that, it would be nice to check if the license of the insurance company is valid.  This can be done on the website of the Central Bank. </p>

    <h2>  If the fake is noticed too late? </h2><p>  What to do if the question of how to check the CTP policy is taken care of you too late - after you have been sold the fake insurance. </p><p>  If the worst has not happened, get a real policy as soon as possible, and take the linden to the police and write a statement.  Then you will not be attracted for falsifying documents. </p><p>  If an accident occurred, and it is your fault, be prepared for the fact that you have to pay the damage yourself.  Theoretically, you can also contact the police.  If those who sold you the fake are found, then you can try to recover the amount of damage caused in the accident from these persons. </p><p>  Now you know how to check the OSAGO policy using the SAR database and carefully examining the form for the presence of protective signs on it. </p>
