    <p>  In Crimea, there are many places for recreation for people with various needs and financial opportunities.  The most popular destination for summer vacations is the <span>southern coast of Crimea (South Coast).</span>  All the beauty of these places is difficult to describe in words.  It is better to go to resort towns and villages of the Crimea and see all this charm with your own eyes. </p><p>  The main cities of the South Coast are Yalta and Alushta.  The region is famous for its natural resources, healing air, saturated minerals and essential oils of juniper and pine needles.  It has a subtropical climate, and the landscape resembles Greece.  Near Yalta and Alushta, there are resort villages of the Crimea with developed infrastructure. </p><p>  In the eastern part of Crimea are the resort towns of Sudak, Koktebel, Feodosia.  This part of the region is completely different from the South Coast.  There are not so many green spaces, but there are beautiful golden sandy beaches. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The western part of the peninsula is a <span>recreational area.</span>  Here are the hospital cities of Evpatoria and Saki.  There is also the legendary hero city of Sevastopol, the famous village of Popovka, where Kazantip passes. </p><p>  Almost all resort villages of Crimea are famous for their developed infrastructure and special hospitality of local residents.  Below will be described the features of rest in a particular place. </p><h2>  Resort Village </h2>

    <p>  On the Black Sea coast in the southeastern part of Crimea, there is a small village of Kurortnoye.  Judging by the name, we can talk about the appointment of this place.  The village of Kurortnoye (Crimea) took a secluded spot in the Otuz Valley, surrounded by mountains on all sides.  This is one of the most picturesque places.  It is here that the most beautiful and powerful volcano Kara-Dag is located.  Between Koktebel and Kurortny there is a unique <span>reserve Kara-Dag,</span> which still has not lost its value. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The village of Kurortnoe (Crimea) is constantly developing and every year provides vacationers with all the best conditions.  Picturesque nature, clean air and local hospitality make it one of the most visited places in this part of the peninsula.  For a relaxing family vacation, there is no better place.  There is no fuss and noise.  Locals are simple and good-natured.  The noise of the surf and the mountain peaks contribute to relaxation and good rest.  Perhaps, the infrastructure is not as developed here, as, for example, in Koktebel, but then there is the peace that is so lacking in large resort cities. </p><h2>  Rest in the village Resort (Crimea) </h2><p>  In the village there is a scientific biological station, where dolphins were first placed in the pool.  Today the station does not work, but it is from here that you can go on a tour of Karadag.  There is also a dolphinarium where you can watch performances with dolphins. </p><p>  There are plenty of options for living in Kurortny.  There are comfortable hotels and private pensions.  You can also inexpensively rent housing in the private sector. </p><p>  Rest in the village of Resort (Crimea) can be not only interesting, but also comfortable.  Some sections of the coast are strewn with beautiful villas with an elite level of service. </p><h2>  Pension "Crimean Primorye" </h2>

    <p>  Belyaus is a scythe strewn from the beginning to the end with beaches.  We can say that this is a solid beach.  This place is not so popular among tourists, so there is a special atmosphere.  The water is crystal clear, since neither rivers nor sewage run into the sea at this point.  The bottom consists of heavy sand mass.  The sea is never dirty, even when it storms, so relaxing here is a pleasure.  Since this place is not very popular, there are not so many amenities.  Belyaus is ideal for a savage vacation, away from the hustle and bustle of entertainment.  But you can visit here in more comfortable conditions. </p><h2>  Village Golden Crimea </h2><p>  The resort village of Golden Crimea on Belyaus is a cozy place on the Black Sea coast.  The village is located near the spit Belyaus.  Nearby are the settlements of Medvedev and Znamenskoye. </p><p>  The village of Golden Crimea is located between two water channels: the Black Sea and <span>Lake Donuzlav.</span>  On <span>the seashore,</span> you can relax with the whole family.  White sandy beach and clear sea water are the property of these places.  The shallow sea and well-developed entertainment infrastructure are perfect for families with children.  There are water slides, and boats with catamarans, and jet skis. </p><h2>  Features of rest </h2><p>  Connoisseurs of history and archeology can visit the city of the ancient Scythians Belyaus.  It is constantly studied by archaeologists, excavations are carried out now.  Today the whole city is already on the surface, and any tourist can visit it. </p><p>  <span>Scuba diving is</span> especially popular in these places <span>.</span>  The underwater world of this region is so diverse that it may surprise even the most experienced diver.  Especially breathtaking is the contemplation of underwater grottoes and tunnels. </p><p>  The resort villages of Crimea, in particular the Golden Crimea, have a developed infrastructure.  A tourist with any income can find here suitable accommodation and entertainment.  In the village there are private houses for spa guests, and small hotels.  The resort village of Golden Crimea is becoming more and more popular every year.  Therefore, while this place is still not distinguished by mass tourism, it is necessary to have time to admire the wildlife and a quiet relaxing holiday. </p><h2>  Nikolaevka </h2>

    <p>  The resort village of Nikolaevka (Crimea) is located between Sevastopol and Yevpatoria on the coast of the <span>Kalamitsky Gulf.</span>  Once upon a time, this part of Crimea was inhabited by sailors who defended Sevastopol in the Crimean War. </p><p>  Today Nikolaevka is <span>a village</span> with a developed infrastructure, ideal for a good rest.  The bottom of the sea in these places is ideal for children's swimming.  It is gently sloping and sandy, so among vacationers you can often find mothers with small children.  Another positive point is the lack of industrial facilities.  In the immediate environment there are no highways, no port.  Therefore, the air here is crystal clear, filled with aromas of the steppe and sea breeze. </p><h2>  Sea coast </h2><p>  The sea is shallow, warms up quickly.  Therefore, the swimming season begins much earlier than in other <span>resorts of the Crimea.</span> </p><p>  Water activities are present in full.  For tourists, a wide variety of housing types are provided, ranging from hotels to the private sector with affordable prices.  From cultural entertainment, you can choose interesting excursions on historical subjects. </p><p>  Nikolaevka is located near Simferopol, so this is a favorite vacation spot of the capital's inhabitants. </p><h2>  Village Lyubimovka </h2>

    <p>  Crimea resort villages are scattered throughout the peninsula.  Lyubimovka is located near the city of Sevastopol.  This is a great place for a relaxing beach holiday.  There is no fuss and noise inherent in large resort cities.  The provincial atmosphere of measured calm life is attractive to connoisseurs of silence.  There are endless clean beaches with golden sand.  For those who have not yet learned to swim, this is the best place to relax. </p><p>  Among housing, the private sector is the most popular.  There are hotels for every taste and affluence. </p><p>  The village of Lyubimovka is a budget holiday offer, but nevertheless this does not affect comfort.  Inexpensive housing and quality service - these are Lyubimovka business cards.  The infrastructure here is not so developed.  But you can feel all the power of Mother Nature and be filled with healing energy for the whole year. </p><p>  If you do not have enough impressions, from here you can go on an informative tour of the local beauties or in the hero city of Sevastopol. </p>
