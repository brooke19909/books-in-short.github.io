The popularity of this tourist destination is associated with a high level of development of thalassotherapy, as well as a rich excursion program in this country.  The bulk of vacationers come here from Western Europe, especially France.  Tunisia was once a French colony, so the locals communicate perfectly in the languages ‚Äã‚Äãof Balzac and Hugo.  Tours to this country with Russian tourists have become popular relatively recently.  They are attracted by the excellent combination of ‚Äúprice-quality‚Äù, which can be found in three-star hotels in Tunisia, for example, in Chiraz Thalasso 3 *, as well as low prices for thalassotherapy compared to European ones. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="chiraz thalasso 3" class="if" height="235" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/473977.jpg" width="312"></div>

    <h2>  How to get to Tunisia? </h2><p>  The Tunisian government is very interested in attracting large flows of Russian tourists, therefore, an agreement on visa-free entry (for a period of 90 days) of tourists from Russia to the territory of Tunisia was signed between the two states.  For several years now direct regular flights have been made from Moscow to the capital of this <span>African country.</span>  In the summer, there are charter flights to other <span>cities of Tunisia.</span>  If you bought a tour to the Chiraz Thalasso 3 * hotel, then it is most convenient for you to go either to Monastir or Enfid.  The flight duration from Moscow to Tunisia is just over 4 hours.  Both airports are approximately the same distance from the Skanes resort.  It is here that on the first beach line is Chiraz Thalasso Resort 3 *.  Usually, the price of the tour includes a transfer, and tourists are met by the hotel staff upon arrival and comfortably delivered to the hotel complex.  However, if this service was not agreed in advance, then you can get to Skanes by yellow taxi or regular bus.  The first option, of course, is more convenient and faster.  And here is the hotel address: Skanes Monastir 5000, Tunisia, Zone Touristique Dkhila 3 Chiraz Thalasso Monastir. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="chiraz thalasso 3 tunisia" class="if" height="265" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/473984.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Skanes - the best tourist area of ‚Äã‚ÄãMonastira (Tunisia) </h2><p>  This tourist area is located between the two famous Tunisian resorts of Sousse and Monastir.  It is in this area that the best centers of thalassotherapy are located.  There are practically no attractions in Skanes itself, but tourists can always send them on excursions to other areas.  But here there is everything for a comfortable stay: water parks, various water activities, a diving school, golf courses, etc. All along the coastline are hotels of various categories, from deluxe to the simplest two.  Chiraz Thalasso 3 *, although it is considered an economy class hotel, however, the service here is quite decent.  True, some Russian tourists who visited this hotel, upon return, write negative reviews about it, forgetting that you can not demand too much from a 3 * hotel.  Here, in comparison with the three-star hotels in Europe, there are much more services, and the rooms are more spacious.  And it remains for the most demanding tourists to advise them not to spare money and buy tours to more expensive hotels, and not to Chiraz Thalasso 3 *.  Reviews of Russian tourists about three-star hotels, as a rule, are not always flattering.  The same goes for this Tunisian hotel.  Although, from the point of view of the ratio ‚Äúprice-quality‚Äù, everything is in order here.  So, for example, the minimum cost of a 10-day tour to this hotel is 550 US dollars. </p><h2>  Hotel Chiraz Thalasso 3 *: general description </h2><p>  The three-story building of the hotel was built in 1995.  By the way, for Tunisia this is a pretty young hotel.  After all, most of the hotels on the local coast were opened in the seventies of the last century and have never undergone reconstruction or modernization.  Until June 2013, the hotel belonged to the Prime Life hotel chain and was called Prima Life Skanes 4 *, Chiraz Club.  However, today it is simply called Chiraz Thalasso 3 *, and not 4, but 3 stars flaunt over the facade.  It is likely that recently the service at the hotel has ceased to correspond to the level of this brand, and they have stopped working with it.  However, this establishment at first glance leaves the impression of a quite respectable hotel complex: a vast green area, several beautiful swimming pools (adults and children) with sea water and a mini water park, tennis courts, restaurants, cafes and bars, as well as its own comfortable beach with a full range beach and water activities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="chiraz thalasso resort 3" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/473976.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Hotel Chiraz Thalasso 3 * (Tunisia / Monastir) operates on an all-inclusive basis, but some tourists choose either half board (breakfast + dinner) or breakfast only.

In addition, you can use the restaurant "a la carte", which operates at the hotel "Shirs Talasso". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="3 chiraz thalasso monastir" class="if" height="312" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/473980.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Since this hotel is located on the first beach line, the distance to the sea is only 200-250 meters.  In the resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSkanes, each of the hotels has its own sandy beach, where tourists are provided with free umbrellas and sun loungers.  In addition, there is a wide selection of beach activities.  However, tourists sometimes complain of mud in the sea and a large number of jellyfish, which prevent them from being quiet in the water.
