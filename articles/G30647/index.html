And if, the previous generation didn‚Äôt have much opportunity to change the situation for the better, then the current 40-45-year-old citizens (or younger, why not) have the opportunity to form their pension now, since the payments guaranteed by the state , most Russians barely have enough to pay for housing and a minimum <span>grocery basket.</span>  Everything else - medicines, items of clothing, rest, will have to be paid from other sources, unless, of course, you make sure that these sources are in time.  Therefore, about where to place the <span>pension savings,</span> you need to think in advance.  This article will discuss how to increase pension savings using the programs that Sberbank's individual pension plan offers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="individual pension plan of Sberbank" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59177/2121355.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What is NPF? </h2><p>  This is an open-type fund that has existed since March 17, 1995 and offers participants a wide selection of pension programs for individual or corporate use, including a state <span>-sponsored pension co-financing program</span> .  During its work, this pension fund has received many prestigious awards.  For example, the year 2014 was marked for the fund by receiving the prize ‚ÄúFinancial Elite of Russia‚Äù in the category ‚ÄúGrand Prix of the NPF of the Year‚Äù.  In addition, the fund has the highest rating among similar organizations in our country, which is well deserved.  According to the national rating agency, the Sberbank Pension Fund was assigned an ‚Äúexceptionally high reliability rating‚Äù (‚ÄúA ++‚Äù). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  We will review the reviews on Sberbank's individual pension plan in this article. </p><h2>  Features of the investment policy of NPFs </h2><p>  The employees of this pension fund adhere to the most cautious investment strategy, which is characterized by the optimal ratio of profitability and reliability.  The approximate structure of the investment portfolio of pension savings is as follows: about a third of all invested funds are invested in the banking sector, 11% of investments are directed to the financial sector, another 11% - to government debt, about 7% goes to the fuel industry. </p><p>  The profitability of the <span>individual pension</span> plan of Sberbank is of interest to many. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="universal universal pension plan in Sberbank" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59177/2121340.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The balance of investment funds is distributed between the most promising sectors of the Russian economy, such as energy, mining, transport, telecommunications, etc. If we talk about financial instruments, the choice is made in favor of the most reliable and liquid assets.  About 60% of the investment funds available in the Sberbank fund are invested in corporate bonds, 15% is placed on deposits, approximately 20% of the funds used to purchase sub-federal / municipal loan bonds and federal bonds, and only 5% are placed in shares of various companies. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The following management companies are engaged in investing financial resources: Kapital, Pension Accumulations, EsM Region and TKB BNP Pariba, Investment, Partners.  One of the most interesting offers of Sberbank is an individual pension plan. </p><h2>  What it is? </h2><p>  Many Russians mistakenly believe that drawing up an individual pension plan will replace the state pension that is familiar to everyone.  This is by no means the case.  This is a kind of supplement to the main amount of the pension that the state pays.  The pensioner has the opportunity to form the size of this surcharge on his own, using the capabilities of a non-state pension fund.  What are the advantages of such a method of <span>accumulating funds?</span>  Let's consider in more detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank Individual Retirement Plan reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59177/2121341.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What are the benefits? </h2><p>  In accordance with the individual pension plan of Sberbank (we will consider the interest below), the client has the right to use a social tax deduction.  In addition, all pension savings will bequeath to the heirs.  The profitability of this program far outweighs rising inflation.  In addition, the procedure for registering pension savings is as simple and convenient as possible.  This can be done in the nearest branch of the bank, here you can get the accumulated pension. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The client can make contributions both through the department and with the help of the employer: the accountant will deduct the agreed amount to the fund.  In addition, you can issue a payment order once, with the help of which the deposit will be automatically transferred to the fund from the client‚Äôs account.  You can receive information on the status of your account on the organization‚Äôs website.  The provision of this service is free of charge.  An individual pension plan is drawn up by signing an agreement.  Throughout the entire period while the agreement is in force, the investor will receive information on the performance of the fund every year, including the yield on Sberbank's individual pension plan. </p><h2>  How is the accumulation of funds? </h2><p>  Contributions that go to the bank are placed in securities in order to receive a steady investment income.  With the onset of retirement age, the client receives monthly payments from his ‚Äúearned‚Äù pension, the amount of this payment depends on the scheme that was chosen.  This may be a fixed contribution option.  In this case, the contributions are paid either at a time when drawing up an individual pension plan (if the accumulation period is less than 24 months), or by several payments in the order convenient for the client.  The depositor determines the amount of the initial pension contribution independently, but it must be at least 60,000 rubles (if the accumulation period is less than 24 months) or 1,500 rubles for each subsequent contribution, that is, each next installment must be equal to 1,500 rubles or more than this amount. </p>

    <p>  You can calculate the individual pension plan of Sberbank at any branch. </p><h2>  Payment Amount </h2><p>  If we talk about the size of future monthly payments, then it depends on the amount that has accumulated in the account and the results of the fund.  This scheme involves the payment of savings over a period of seven years.  You can draw up a contract in favor of another person or assign a payment of pension savings to your spouse or spouse if he or she survived the person who made the contract.  Opening a contract with a fixed size of payments implies a different scheme.  With this option, contributions are paid every month, every quarter, or at a time. </p><p>  What is the profitability of Sberbank's individual pension plan?  It depends on many factors. </p><p>  The amount of the contribution determines the future pension.  It is chosen by the client independently, or depending on a specific pension scheme.  Under the terms of the contract, pension payments are made for ten or fifteen years or for the remaining life.  In this case, the accumulated funds are either not subject to inheritance, or are partially inherited.  These conditions are discussed with bank employees during the execution of the contract. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank contribution individual pension plan" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59177/2121343.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  How are payments made? </h2><p>  Payments are assigned upon retirement age and are transferred to the card or to the client‚Äôs account with Sberbank or any other bank.  Currently, the following types of individual plans are available: universal, guaranteed and comprehensive.  With a universal plan, the size and schedule of depositing funds is arbitrary, a non-state pension is paid at the expense of obtaining investment income.  Early return of savings is possible under certain conditions.  With a guaranteed plan, you determine the amount of the pension paid and its duration.  In accordance with this, the specialist calculates the size and schedule of contributions.  The funded pension must be in the pension fund of Sberbank, payments are made in an arbitrary amount. </p>

    <h2>  Yield calculation procedure </h2><p>  Let us consider in more detail the individual universal pension plan in Sberbank.  Profitability in the <span>non-state pension fund</span> for 2016 amounted to 9.04%, which is a very good indicator.  A higher percentage is not guaranteed to you by any other non-state pension fund.  Let us consider a concrete example of what payments can be expected by filling out a contribution to Sberbank - an individual pension plan.  For example, a 40-year-old woman who has been working since 1996 with a monthly salary of 22,000 rubles has drawn up an agreement with Sberbank's non-state pension fund, intending to replenish her account every month by 1,540 rubles (7% of the salary).  Based on these data, the total pension payments will amount to 9,808 rubles, 5,171 rubles under a private pension agreement, and the funded part will add another 4,637 rubles, while the term for paying a private pension is 10 years.  In total, by retirement a woman will be the owner of the amount of 227 135 rubles.  This is a very average calculation.  You can make much more accurate calculations on the Sberbank website using a pension calculator or with a personal visit to a bank branch. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="individual pension plan of Sberbank percentage" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59177/2121345.jpg"></div>
