    <p>  Given that there are many shops and cafes around the hotel, we can say that not a single tourist will remain hungry. </p><h2>  Additional Information </h2><p>  When planning to stay in a place like Hotel Fragata (Spain), every tourist should know the date of arrival and departure.  Guests enter the room from 14:00, check out until 12:00.  The hotel has rooms for smokers and non-smokers.  Rooms for guests with reduced mobility are also available.  It is strictly forbidden to stay at the hotel with pets. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Hotel Fragata 3 (Spain) gets good reviews.  The quality corresponds to the stardom of the hotel and the prices present.  But, like all hotels, Fragata also earned negative reviews from travelers.  However, these are just a few of the hundreds of pluses.  It is clear that travelers come here to walk around the city, go to Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãdo some shopping in the capital, swim in the sea, sunbathe on the beach. </p><p>  Most of the negative reviews are due to the fact that the rooms do not have air conditioning.  This is indicated immediately.  Many are embarrassed that bedding changes 1-2 times a week.  But it is worth remembering that this is not a 5-star hotel in Egypt or Turkey.  There are only 3 stars. </p><p>  As for the positive reviews, the guests are satisfied with almost everything.  Some even consider the hotel ideal, according to the price they paid.  The rooms are always clean and comfortable.  Hotel staff seeks to prevent the slightest scandal by resolving problems.  Friendly and polite English-speaking workers liked everyone. </p><p>  The only significant minus among all the reviews is the nearby hotel located nearby.  It turns out they placed windows in windows.  This may confuse some, but the rooms have curtains that can be covered if desired. </p>
