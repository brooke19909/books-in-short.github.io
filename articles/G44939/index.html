    <p>  In general, it is worth paying attention to the fact that many reviews on a particular product are sometimes just bought.  That is, they are written to order.  And so you have to constantly conduct a clear analysis of all the reviews we found.  Sometimes it‚Äôs very difficult to distinguish truth from lies.  Especially regarding phones.  After all, copyright photographs in this case are rare.  It is possible to verify the authenticity of the spoken words only after all the possibilities and characteristics of a particular model become known.  So, we are starting to study the Lenovo Vibe Z2 Pro. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Operating system and processor </h2><p>  Where does the choice of a modern phone begin?  Someone will say that with the price.  But actually it is not.  The price tag, as you know, must match the capabilities of the equipment.  So it should be considered only after all the characteristics and features of the device are known. </p><p>  Many now begin their search with the selection of the operating system and processor.

If necessary, you can easily and simply update the operating system without harming your data. </p><p>  It is also worth paying attention to the processor of the device.  He is responsible for many of the features and capabilities of the model.  Lenovo Vibe Z2 Pro, to be honest, is currently equipped with one of the most powerful processors.  It has a large clock frequency, many cores in the composition.  This phone has a 4-core processor with a frequency of 2.5 GHz.  For a modern smartphone, these are very good indicators.  Especially when you consider that now many models support only 4 cores and power up to 1.8 GHz.  And only some devices are found with 2-2.5 GHz. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  With this smartphone, you can be sure that you will be available to launch all the latest innovations in the gaming mobile industry, as well as the most powerful and feature-rich applications.  So the Lenovo Vibe Z2 Pro, the review of which we have just begun to conduct, is perfect for those who are used to keeping up with the times.  After all, this particular model is capable of giving a powerful phone with a good operating system and processor. </p><p>  You can pay attention to another feature of the smartphone.  The thing is that there is the possibility of a complete change of interface.  Which one?  You can easily and simply switch from the usual design of Android to Google.  Sometimes it is very convenient.  Although this feature is not so important, it is often isolated to emphasize the versatility of a mobile phone. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The second important component is the screen of the smartphone.  Now many people like to play games for such devices.  And on a small display it is not very convenient.  And large models have their drawbacks.  For example, using calls is uncomfortable in many cases.  Therefore, it is always important to find a middle ground. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lenovo vibe z2 pro review" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/954257.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  True, Lenovo Vibe Z2 Pro, the review of which we continue, cannot be called miniature.  The thing is that our today's smartphone is quite large.  Screen size is 6 inches.  For a modern device, this is a lot.  Sometimes only tablets are comparable to this indicator.  Some jokingly call the Lenovo Vibe Z2 Pro (K920) a small tablet with phone features.  In terms of power and some features, this is indeed so. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It is also important to pay attention to such an item as display resolution.  It is believed that the more points in it, the better.  And this is quite logical.  On a device with a good resolution, you can easily play colorful games, as well as watch high-quality films and videos in Full-HD format.  At Lenovo Vibe Z2 Pro (K920) these indicators are at the highest level.  After all, the resolution is 2560 by 1440 pixels.  Only a few can boast of such characteristics.  And, to be honest, this fact is extremely pleasing to buyers.  Especially for those for whom the screen plays an almost paramount role.  For example, for gamers or movie lovers.  Of course, this new model also supports 16 million colors.  The image on the display will be beautiful, clear and bright. </p><p>  It is also worth noting the fact that the phone Lenovo Vibe Z2 Pro (K920) has a touch screen with IPS technology.  In addition, this model is equipped with a good protective glass.  It is able to prevent the appearance of scratches and abrasions on the display when dropped even from a great height.  For this feature, the smartphone receives huge advantages in its address.  As in most analogs, there is a function to automatically rotate the screen depending on the position of the device.  If you do not need it, then you can always disable this feature.  And then reconnect if necessary. </p><h2>  Space </h2><p>  What else is important for the phone?  Yes, and for any modern device, too.  Of course, this is nothing but a memory.  It can be operational (system) or normal.  The first is necessary to ensure the operability of the operating system on a computer, tablet or phone.  And the second is responsible for the ability to store a certain amount of information.  And between all the characteristics of the phone there should be harmony.  Otherwise, the power of the mobile will drop along with its performance several times.  Not the best blow to the reputation of the manufacturer. </p><p>  How are things going with a Lenovo Vibe Z2 Pro phone?  To be honest, there is more than enough RAM here - as much as 3 GB.  For comparison: most smartphones are made with a memory of 1-2 GB.  And only a few with 3-4.  For a processor with 4 cores and a clock frequency of 2.5 GHz, the selected indicator is ideal.  It allows you to use all the resources of the device to ensure the speed and power of the system. </p><p>  But after the RAM is selected, it is worth paying attention to the usual place on the smartphone.  Lenovo Vibe Z2 Pro mobile phone offers us 30 GB of space for personal data.  In general, the built-in memory in this model is 32 GB, but 2 of them are occupied by the operating system.  In principle, now many people have enough of this amount of space.  This applies to the average buyer, who is important to just stay in touch.  But cheaper models are better for them.  But active users are often not particularly pretty 30 GB of space.  After all, this is so little.  Especially if you are used to (or planning to) play games, as well as watch high-quality films / videos and listen to a lot of music. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lenovo vibe z2 pro reviews" class="if" height="297" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/954256.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  What to do in this case?  Usually, buyers choose the way to purchase an additional memory card.  It is inserted into almost any phone and, if necessary, is easily and simply transferred to a new device.  Smartphone Lenovo Vibe Z2 Pro, unfortunately, does not have a slot for connecting a card.  And this is a significant minus of the model.  After all, you have to severely limit yourself in space.  This is especially bad when you are an extremely active gamer and music lover concurrently a fan of watching videos and films on the phone, as well as reading books for this equipment.  This fact greatly discourages potential buyers. </p><h2>  Communication support </h2><p>  What were the phones originally created for?  Of course, in order to talk.  That is, receive and make calls.  Now there are so many different types of networks.  And every good phone should support them. </p><p>  The Lenovo Vibe Z2 Pro (K920) smartphone has many networking options.  There is already an outdated 2G signal, and GPRS, and GPS.  Also in this model there is support for 3G and even 4G networks.  The latter option, by the way, is most appreciated.  After all, it is he who allows providing customers with fast, reliable and high-quality communication.  In particular, this applies to the Internet. </p><p>  Among other things, there is Wi-Fi, as well as Bluetooth 4.0.  This trip provides the smartphone with access to a wireless Internet network, as well as to similar data transfer from one device to another with high speed.  Just what many are looking for.  True, the "bluetooth" technology is now slowly fading into the background.  Nevertheless, a smartphone without this feature is considered obsolete, bad, unpopular and low-quality.  You can say the last century, not a cell.  And without the ‚ÄúBluetooth‚Äù smartphones are usually not bought. </p><p>  In addition, the phone Lenovo Vibe Z2 Pro K920 receives positive reviews from customers and because it allows you to use two numbers simultaneously.  That is, it is a smartphone for several SIM cards.  A very popular reception among modern manufacturers.  In fact, it is extremely convenient.  Now you can combine a work phone with a home phone in one device.  And this fact cannot but rejoice. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lenovo vibe z2 pro k920" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/954255.jpg" width="560"></div>

    <p>  But there are also drawbacks.  Many buyers doubt the quality of using two SIM cards at the same time.  Especially different mobile operators.  Previously, in this case, a variety of network and smartphone system failures were observed.  But now such fears are in vain - modern models of communication devices with the outside world have long stopped all problems.  So you can safely buy a Lenovo Vibe Z2 Pro mobile phone and enjoy all its features. </p><p>  The last thing to consider is the format of the SIM cards.  After all, it can now be of three types: </p><ul><li>  ordinary (old big cards); </li><li>  micro; </li><li>  nano. </li></ul><p>  If you have a large SIM card, then you can crop it to the desired size.  But it would be better to replace it with a mobile operator without losing the number.  Micro can also be reduced.  But the ‚Äúnano" is not subject to any correction.  Only a complete change of number and SIM card.  Lenovo Vibe Z2 Pro K920 gets good reviews because there are 2 connectors for connecting and using a micro-sim.  It is quite comfortable and good.  After all, if necessary, it will be possible to "trim" "SIM cards" to the size of "nano".  In addition, it is this option that is now most common among mobile operators. </p><h2>  Capture Mode </h2><p>  The telephone is now not just a means of communication between people.  This device now plays the role of many additional technologies - a camera, camera, navigator, alarm clock, organizer and so on.  So quite a few give preference to models with a good camera.  After all, it is very convenient to have a good and multi-functional camera on hand which you can call and not only. </p><p>  Lenovo K920 Vibe Z2 Pro, the review of which we study carefully and thoroughly, is equipped with several cameras.  A popular welcome from the best manufacturers.  There is a front camera and rear.  The first makes it easy and simple to take selfies, as well as talk using a video call.  And the rear is an ordinary camera, which is needed in order to take photos and shoot videos.  This fact already pleases many buyers. </p><p>  The quality of the cameras is also at a decent level.  Frontal has 5 megapixels.  This is a very high rate.  In order to understand how high-quality images you will receive, pay attention to computer webcams.  On average, they have only 2-3 megapixels available.  So the difference is significant. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lenovo vibe z2 pro k920 reviews" class="if" height="329" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/954254.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The rear camera is almost 3 times more powerful.  It has 16 megapixels available.  In addition, there is a function of autofocus, flash and image stabilization.  With these features, you will be able to record video in Ultra HD format, as well as get high-quality, vivid and unforgettable photos without streaks, ‚Äúsmudges‚Äù and other flaws. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  Lenovo Vibe Z2 Pro features, as you see, are at a fairly high level.  But what can be said about such an important moment as battery operation?  The thing is that this particular feature excites so many buyers.  Why?  Initially, the phone was invented in order to communicate with the outside world.  So, such a device should work well and for a long time.  And it is right. </p><p>  Only now, modern buyers are accustomed to actively use all the opportunities offered to them.  It‚Äôs also logical - the price has been paid, why not?  Only this affects the phone‚Äôs battery life.  Lenovo K920 Vibe Z2 Pro, the firmware of which pleases everyone without a doubt, to be honest, has far from the best performance in the field of its work without recharging.  To be honest, you can find such models that will last a longer period of time. </p><p>  What exactly is it about?  The whole problem is that in standby mode this smartphone works for about 40 days.  This is all provided that you will not use even an alarm clock on the device.  But when answering some calls (inactive use), you can only count on 2 weeks of work.  Are you an active player or user who likes to watch movies, listen to music and surf the Internet?  Then you can be sure that your phone will require charging after 3 days at most.  Typically, Lenovo Vibe Z2 Pro operates in this mode for 2.5 days. </p><p>  Fortunately, it charges quickly - only 1.5-2 hours.  And then you can work with the device again.  Charges the smartphone by wire.  That is, familiar to many.  Although some potential buyers are looking specifically for <span>wireless chargers.</span>  Unfortunately, such a function now exists except for Nokia Lumiya. </p><h2>  Additional functions </h2><p>  Functionality is also a rather important point, which is worth paying attention to.  Sometimes the additional features of the device can help you in many situations.  Especially if you are used to not parting with the phone. </p><p>  Lenovo Vibe Z2 Pro gets very positive reviews in this regard.  The thing is that this model is equipped with numerous functions.  Here you can find voice control, and a navigator, and an alarm clock, and a compass.  But that is not all.  In addition to the entire "standard set", you can find a sensor for acceleration, movement and screen orientation.  This also includes the proximity program, radio and <span>light sensor.</span> </p>

    <p>  In principle, for the characteristics of the phone, this is not so important.  But buyers want the smartphones on offer to be multifunctional.  And this is normal - progress does not stand still.  Technology is constantly evolving, and human needs are growing every day more and more. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  What is included in the package of goods (especially equipment) interests customers very much.  Indeed, there are frequent cases when shops extracted some components from a set in order to profit from their sale.  No one wants to be cheated.  And even more so, to pay twice for what should already be included with the phone. </p><p>  What is included with the Lenovo K920 Vibe Z2 Pro, the review of which we are completing?  For example, unconditionally, you will find in the box with the device a <span>warranty card,</span> check, USB cable, as well as an instruction manual.  Plus, the kit also includes a charger.  But this is far from all.  After all, having bought this smartphone, you will also need to receive a wired headset as a gift.  Sometimes in the box you can find a keychain for a phone or even a case and a protective film.  But such a "complete set", as a rule, is not for sale in Russia.  In this country you will only need to find a headset in addition to the standard set. </p><h2>  Price tag </h2><p>  Price is one of the most important indicators that affect the final decision when making a purchase.  As already mentioned, it must correspond to the characteristics of the device.  In other words, there is no point in overpaying for an outdated, low-quality, low-power smartphone model. </p><p>  How are things with the Lenovo Vibe Z2 Pro (K920)?  We can say, not as good as we would like.  After all, the price for this phone is quite high - 30,000 rubles.  And he has significant flaws.  For example, a weak battery or the lack of the ability to connect additional memory.  This all leaves its mark on the <span>rating of the smartphone.</span> </p><p>  Nevertheless, the advantages of this option are much greater.  And it is for them that buyers are ready to give 30 thousand rubles a month.  But, to be honest, often people think about choosing a cheaper and no less powerful phone.  In principle, this is the right decision if you do not pursue the latest innovations. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  So, now it's time to take stock of our talk today, and also decide whether to buy Lenovo Vibe Z2.  In general, everyone decides for himself.  And, to be honest, you need to look at the model.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Especially if the budget allows you to do this. </font></font></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone lenovo vibe z2 pro k920" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/954252.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p> If you just need a powerful smartphone, then it is better to find a cheaper analogue for yourself.  For example, take a look at Huawei or Samsung.  But in cases where you are not just an average user, but a person who likes to use the phone "in full", then, of course, it is worth paying attention to Lenovo.  As you can see, Lenovo Vibe Z2 Pro reviews are pretty good in many ways.  But such a model is expensive. </p><p>  In addition, it is not recommended to buy this smartphone for children and women with small handles.  Using a 6-inch phone will be simply inconvenient.  But if there is a desire and opportunity, then it is worth purchasing this model.  But first, weigh carefully all the pros and cons of the characteristics of the device. </p>
