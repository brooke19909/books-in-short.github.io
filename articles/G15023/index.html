    <p>  As a rule, vacationers choose the all-inclusive option, but you can take half board or a continental breakfast.  All Inclusive, unfortunately, does not include any drinks, so they must be purchased in a restaurant at a decent price. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel beach </h2><p>  Don Juan Tossa Hotel 4 * (hotel photos are given in the article) is located near the beach (200-300 meters).  On the shore there are sun loungers and umbrellas, but they are paid.  But this does not stop being placed directly on the sand. </p><h2>  A bit about the resort </h2><p>  Don Juan Tossa Hotel 4 * (Spain, Tossa), as we have already mentioned, is located in Tossa de Marr.  It is a small town in the east of Spain.  It belongs to Catalonia and is one of the most beautiful places on the Costa Brava.  The city is surrounded by greenery and amazes tourists with warmth and tranquility.  For a long time it was known as a favorite vacation spot of wealthy Europeans.  As a resort, Tossa de Marr began to develop in the mid-twentieth century. </p><p>  The city is in a cozy bay, and the coast is indented with cliffs.  High cliffs form very beautiful deep grottoes and narrow straits. </p><h2>  Attractions and entertainment </h2><p>  Resting at Don Juan Tossa Hotel 4 * (photos are given in the article), you should definitely take the opportunity to see all the most interesting places, but there are a lot of them. </p><p>  Tourists love to visit the medieval fortified city called Villa Vella, built in the twelfth century to protect against pirates, on the rocky coast of Tossa de Mar.  To this day, towers and ramparts are very well preserved.  The castle houses a museum of modern art. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="don juan tossa hotel 4 hotel photos" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1475994.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Fans of museum exhibits will be interested in visiting the lighthouse, the ruins of the ancient Roman Villa, the historical museum on the shore, and ancient churches.  Vacationers can walk along the well-known walking route along a stone staircase that leads to Villa Vella, and then up along the winding walking paths you can climb to the site and look at the surroundings and the sea.  There is a place for viewing on the tower of the Moors in the fortress.  And along the way there are many cafes offering food and relaxation, enjoying Spanish motives. </p><p>  In addition, tourists can stroll along the Costa Blanca, wander through the streets of the Old Town, visit the botanical park "Sa Riaera".  The town is still famous for its national festivals.  Such holidays demonstrate the historical traditions of the region. </p><p>  Resting in Tossa de Mar, tourists try to definitely visit Barcelona.  It is a terrific city worth seeing.  It is world famous for its fountains built on Mount Montjuic.  They have long been the most visited place in Barcelona.  Once fountains were built by Carles Bugyas, and then reconstructed in 1992 for the Olympics.  They impress with their beauty all the guests of the Catalan capital.  An amazing combination of music, water and light is an unforgettable sight. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="don juan tossa hotel 4 description" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1475996.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  A beautiful show begins after sunset, to the sounds of classical music, the jets take a variety of shapes and colors, they soar upward, then scatter millions of drops.  To create such a colorful effect, 50 various shades are used.  The harmonious combination of light, music and water is the key to the success of this show.  Each year, an amazing musical pyrotechnic show is also held here in honor of the end of the famous Catalan festival. </p><h2>  Don Juan Tossa Hotel 4 *: reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, I want to discuss the reviews of tourists who managed to visit here.  Hotel Don Juan Tossa 4 * (Costa Brava) is one of the complexes with a bit of controversial reviews.  I would like to note that this is an economy class hotel.  Vacationers come here to not only relax on the sea and enjoy the local scenery, but also to see Catalonia, which is famous for its beautiful and interesting places.  Tourists note that in the hotel, as in the city itself, a lot of Spanish pensioners are resting.  Periodically, teenage groups lodge in the hotel, who have something like our camps here.  They are settled in the building behind the main building. </p><p>  The hotel always has a quiet and calm environment, as in the whole city.  There is a night disco next to the main building - everyone can go to it.  In general, the hotel is not aimed at youth.  People come here far from night parties.  Active young people will probably be bored here, and therefore it is better to look for a city with a richer nightlife. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="don juan tossa hotel 4 pics" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1475997.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  I would like to pay special attention to hotel rooms.  They are not small, but with shabby furniture.  Particularly picky holidaymakers note that they need to be repaired for a long time, and the furniture should be replaced with newer.  The apartments are cleaned daily and pretty good.  Tipping the maid can not leave.  Towels are changed daily, and bed linen a couple of times a week.  Soap, gel, shampoos staff refills as needed.  But bathing caps, sticks and cotton pads are not here. </p><p>  Food is the most interesting topic, causing heated debate among tourists.  Moreover, as a rule, reviews about the same place can be very controversial.  This also applies to Don Juan Tossa Hotel 4 * (Tossa de Mar).  However, I want to note that most of the vacationers are very pleased with the food. </p><p>  For breakfast, for example, eggs, omelet, cheese, sliced, sausage, breakfast cereals, numerous fruits, milk are served.  From drinks offer juices, coffee, tea. </p><p>  For lunch and dinner, it offers a larger assortment: fish, meat, soups, sweets, fruits (peaches, watermelon, pears, apples, grapes, oranges, grapefruits, kiwi, bananas, pineapples) and vegetables, ice cream. </p><p>  Meat dishes are quite diverse: there is turkey, chicken, pork, jamon.  Seafood is sometimes served for dinner.  There are always tablecloths on the tables, everything is well decorated. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="don juan tossa hotel 4 spain tossa" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1475998.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel operates on an all-inclusive basis.  However, tourists can choose other options.  For example, continental breakfast or breakfast and dinner.  In principle, it is more profitable to choose All Inclusive, since the price is not too different.  The only drawback is the situation with all drinks.  Even ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù does not qualify for free tea or juice.  All drinks must be paid separately.  And this is inconvenient.  And the prices in the restaurant are considerable. </p><h2>  Entertaining activities </h2><p>  The hotel hosts evening programs for vacationers, but they are designed for the older generation.  Active youth may not like them.  A club is open for children from ten in the morning until five in the evening.  It has only one educator. </p><p>  On the roof of the hotel there is a small pool, a bar and a relaxation area with sunbeds and umbrellas.  Of course, with such a close location of the sea, the pool is not much needed.  But it is worth a visit, as it offers stunning views from above.  Tourists here like to be photographed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel don juan tossa 4 costa brava" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1475999.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Vacationers very often go for walks or go on excursions.  At the hotel, you can book trips with a travel agency representative.  The sights of Tossa de Mar can be seen on their own.  The small town is enough for two or three days to see it all without haste.  If you plan to go to Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãthen there is a direct city bus that will take you there.  In addition, you can go diving on the coast, which is very popular here.  A very interesting attraction was invented for vacationers - riding along the coast in a boat with a transparent bottom.  You can see the underwater world and its inhabitants, even those tourists who are not enthusiastic about diving. </p><p>  The hotel can quickly and simply rent a car for trips.  This is very convenient, because you take it and leave it near the hotel, you do not need to take it anywhere, and it is enough to leave the keys at the reception.  With a car on hand, you can travel to all nearby small towns and see them.  Yes, and to get to Barcelona is very simple. </p><p>  If you book an excursion or are planning any trip yourself, and at the same time understand that you skip lunch or dinner, then you need to notify the reception desk administrator in advance at the reception.  Then you will be provided with a special lunch package. </p><p>  Near the hotel there is a bus station.  From it you can get not only to Barcelona (ticket costs 12-14 euros), but also to Loret del Mar, Girona.  However, before the trip, you should carefully study the timetable, if you walk until late, you can skip the bus and then you will have to get only by taxi.  If you want to go to Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãit is better to take a ticket at once in both directions.  Sometimes there are no tickets for the return trip.  In Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãdouble-decker sightseeing buses run, you can enter and exit almost anywhere.  The fare is 25 euros.  In it you will be given a book with discount coupons for visiting museums, cafes, shops.  This will save a lot.  The fare practically pays off. </p><p>  The town of Tossa de Mar itself is small, but very beautiful and cozy.  You can return to it many times.  At 22.00 everything is already falling asleep here.  For example, in restaurants you can‚Äôt order anything.  The town was once a fishing village, and therefore famous for dishes of freshly prepared fish.  You should definitely visit the local cafes or restaurants and try one of them. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  Concluding the conversation about the hotel, I want to emphasize the advantages of Don Juan Tossa Hotel 4 *.  Tours offered by agencies are cheap enough, which is tempting.  The hotel has a good location and is perfect for an economical vacation option.  Its advantage is that the prices for accommodation are quite reasonable, food is good, the sea is close by, and getting to the most interesting places in Catalonia is easy.  The complex is not suitable for those people who value comfort and furnishings above all else.  But making excessive demands on a four-star hotel is illogical. </p>
