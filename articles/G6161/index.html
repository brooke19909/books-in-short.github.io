Recreation and fishing on the lake Tavatuy, Sverdlovsk region</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  On the Russian land there are many fabulously beautiful reservoirs.  Lake Tavatuy (Sverdlovsk region) is one of the most famous.  Mamin-Sibiryak wrote about him, the famous films ‚ÄúUgryum River‚Äù and ‚ÄúDemidovs‚Äù were shot on its banks.  Now around it there are several tourist camps, providing everyone with a vacation for every taste.  Here you can spend your whole vacation or just a weekend, celebrate an anniversary or organize a wedding banquet, enjoy fishing or just relax in nature, enjoying fantastic views of the surrounding landscapes. </p><h2>  Where is </h2><p>  On the slope of the Ural Mountains, framed by evergreen spruce and white-birch birch trees, the famous beauty of the Sverdlovsk region - Lake Tavatuy - splashes.  From Yekaterinburg it is in the north-west side, the mileage is about 40-50 km (depending on which point to count).  About 250 km from Chelyabinsk to the lake, 100 from Nizhny Tagil, 400 from Perm, 370 from Tyumen, 550 km from Ufa.  On the shores of Tavatuya there are very wild places where a person‚Äôs foot rarely steps. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tawatui lake" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/870220.jpg" width="359"></div>  But most of the territory is inhabited and ennobled.  In addition to tourist centers and health resorts there are three settlements - the same name with Lake Tavatuy, modern Kalinovo and the very tiny Priozerny, as well as an orphanage and a fish factory.  Within three to five kilometers of the lake runs a railway line connecting Yekaterinburg with Nizhny Tagil.  There are two stations convenient for those who wish to come here - Tavatuy and Kalinovo.

On the way not far from the highway there are two other lakes: Baltym near the village of Sanatorny and Isetskoye, on the banks of which the city of Sredneuralsk grew.  We pass these settlements, and, before reaching the Tavatuy sign, turn left.  About 300-400 meters there will be a forest road, which in 3-4 km will lead to the village of Tavatuy.  From Nizhny Tagil you can get to the lake through Verkh-Neyvinsky and Murzinka to Kalinovo or along the R-352 highway to the right turn to Tavatuy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake Tavatuy" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/870210.jpg" width="424"></div>

    <h2>  By bus and train </h2><p>  Getting to Lake Tavatuy is very easy and by public transport. </p><p>  The first way is to take the train to the Tavatuy station by train.  From there to the lake about 5 km.  An asphalt road leads to the village of Priozerny, and a forest trail, which you need to turn near the power transmission line, leads to Cape Sukharny.  Here you can pitch a tent and relax savage.  If you get off the train at Kalinovo station, there will be only 3 km to the lake, which you can walk or take the bus.  Electric trains from Yekaterinburg to Nizhny Tagil depart daily (10 flights).  Travel time is just over an hour, and from Nizhny Tagil - about 2 hours. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The second way is to go from Yekaterinburg by bus number 147.  You can get on it at the railway station.  The road will take about an hour and a half.  Departure time is at 07-15 in the morning and at 16-00.  You can catch this bus at other stops in the city, for example, at UZTM Square, but the departure time is not fixed there. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake Tavatuy rest" class="if" height="290" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/870223.jpg" width="472"></div>

    <h2>  Geographical Description </h2><p>  Tavatuy is a relatively young lake.  It was formed only 10-15 millennia ago due to the tectonic movements of the earth's crust.  In terms of size, the reservoir is considered one of the largest in the region.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe mirror of its waters is 21.2 square meters.  km, the maximum depth is 9 meters, from north to south the length is 10 km, and almost 3.5 km from west to east. </p><p>  The water in the lake is cool, crystal clear, almost everywhere (except for the deepest places) the bottom is clearly visible.  Unusually, one can say, fabulously picturesque Lake Tavatuy.  Photos show its coast, framed by a spruce-birch forest.  In many areas, they are decorated with boulders of the most bizarre shape.  Three dozen streams and rivers carry their waters to Tavatuy, the names of many of which are known only to local residents.  The most full-flowing and widely known are the Big Shamanikha (not to be confused with the Yakut Shamanikha), Kazachikha, Kamennaya, Kalinovka and Big Vitilka. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The geographical position of Lake Tavatuy is such that in summer it is about 1-2 degrees cooler than in the vicinity, and in winter it is just as warmer.  From the end of June, water off the coast warms up to 23-24 degrees.  From the end of October to May, the lake is covered with ice. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake Tavatuy Sverdlovskaya" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/870230.jpg" width="391"></div>

    <h2>  Villages </h2><p>  About 200-300 years ago, only wolves and bears wandered near Lake Tavatuy.  At the end of the 17th century, Old Believers fled here, fleeing from the repressions of Peter I.  They founded the village of Tavatuy.  Since then, the lake has slowly become ennobled.  Now in the village of Tavatuy there are shops, the Kristina Hotel, a cafe and a free beach.  It practically does not differ from paid ones located at recreation centers.  There is a cafe (open on weekends and holidays), toilets (paid), gazebos and barbecue facilities (free), a stretched net for playing ball, a rental point for boats.  The beach soil is clean sand, followed by a carpet of green grass. </p><p>  The most modern and largest (about 2500 local residents) is the village of Kalinovo.  To the railway of the same name  the station is 3 km from it, and to Murzinka - 8.5.  Geographically, it is located on the opposite shore from the village of Tavatuy.  There are two attractions here - a monument to the soldiers-liberators of the Second World War with shells filled with earth from each hero city, and a unique natural monument in the form of a phantasmagoric pile of stones. </p><p>  Eight and a few kilometers from the Tavatuy railway station is the tiny (13 inhabitants) village Priozerny. </p>

    <p>  Another base is Bear Stone.  Before her from the village of "Tavatuy" a little more than 3 km.  It works only on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  On other days by appointment.  The advantages of this base are sparsely populated and perfect cleanliness.  Here you can rent a comfortable house and / or a gazebo and a place of rest, where there is a spot for a fire, tables and benches.  Firewood is bought and costs from 200 rubles per set.

Fishing here is one of the most exciting activities.  Previously, fish in the lake were visible and invisible.  Now, of course, this is no longer the case, but the fishermen have a sin to complain about.  Crucian carp, ide, ruff, perch, pike, chebak, burbot, whitefish and ripus are caught from the boat and from the shore.  Perch pecks in the whole water area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe reservoir, but experts go after it to Kalinovo.  There, it is caught better at the plains.  There are many pikes in the southern part of Tavatuy and near the river Big Shamanikha.  On the north coast, they also peck excellently, and pike, roach, and perch.  In winter, experienced fishermen prefer the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe mouth of Vitimka, where ruffs and perches are perfectly caught from the ice.  But even if you are not very lucky and the catch is small, the time spent on Lake Tavatui will give a lot of unforgettable sensations. </p>
