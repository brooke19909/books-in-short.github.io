    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The resort is located in the coastal area between high mountains and the sea.  It should be noted that it is Kemer that is the most popular holiday destination among our compatriots.  For this reason, the hotel staff has long understood the Russian language.  The main street of the resort is Liman.  All kinds of shops and shops are concentrated on it.  There are many bars and restaurants in the resort center, and nightlife lovers can visit clubs, the most popular of which are Buddha, Inferno and Aura. </p><p>  If you want to see the resort, then you have to use local transport.  The most popular of them can be considered the famous Turkish dolmushi.  They travel not only around the city, but also ply between neighboring villages. </p><p>  If you do not want to use public transport, then literally at every turn you can take a taxi.  However, it is worth remembering that at night, local taxi drivers double the cost of the trip. </p><p>  Kemer has gained popularity among vacationers due to its wide pebble beaches.  Many five-star complexes have even equipped their own loose sandy beaches.  Directly in the city there are two beaches - "Lunar" and urban. </p><p>  Kemer is incredibly popular for diving, so a large number of diving centers operate in the resort.  The main attraction for divers is the bay called "Three Islands", located near the village of Tekirovo.  It has many beautiful underwater caves, which are inhabited by marine inhabitants.  They say that with luck, here you can even see dolphins and sea turtles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fame residence kemer spa entertainment" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1983185.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As a rule, beginner divers go to the Aquarium and Mayak bays, as they are protected from the wind, which means they are safer for beginners. </p><h2>  Fame Residence Kemer Spa: reviews </h2><p>  Continuing the review of the hotel, of course, it is worth looking at the reviews of tourists who rested in it in 2017.  It is worth noting that tours to the Fame Residence Kemer Spa 5 * are popular among holidaymakers.  Numerous positive reviews are a direct confirmation of this. </p><p>  The hotel has a fairly convenient location.  Five night walks include nightclubs, a promenade, restaurants and bars.  For those who are looking for a city complex, Fame Residence Kemer Spa (Kemer) may be a perfectly acceptable option.  Walking around the resort is quite safe.  The hotel itself is closed on all sides and has its own security, so strangers are not allowed into the territory. </p><p>  The hotel's rooms are decorated in pleasant pastel colors in a modern laconic style.  The Fame Residence Kemer Spa apartments (see room description for the rooms) have a fire and central air conditioning system.  All equipment in the rooms is working properly and without complaints.  Clean mattresses and linen are very pleasing to guests.  All apartments are equipped with large LCD televisions with a huge selection of channels, among which there are Russians.  The rooms have kettles and small sets for making hot drinks - tea and coffee.  In the evenings, you can always enjoy tea with Turkish sweets.  The rooms work well enough wireless Internet.  Its speed is enough for social networks and communication with relatives on Skype.  Sometimes, of course, the connection is interrupted, but it is not so critical. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fame residence kemer spa service" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1983187.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In general, it is worth noting that the design and equipment of the rooms are up to standard, so a comfortable stay is simply guaranteed.  Of course, there are some disadvantages.  It is noticeable that the number of rooms is tired and needs at least cosmetic repairs.  Is it worth noting such nuances, you decide. </p><p>  Special attention is paid to the service at the Fame Residence Kemer Spa.  The maids do the cleaning daily; not everyone is happy with its quality, but overall the order in the rooms is maintained.  Towels and bed linen are changed according to the schedule.  In the bathroom there are branded cosmetics of quite acceptable quality, so it‚Äôs not necessary to purchase your own.  As for tips, then, according to tourists, their presence does not have a special impact on the quality of cleaning. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the hotel complex is built in the form of the letter "p".  If you want to have a view of the coast, then in any case your room will go into the hotel courtyard, so in the evenings you will hear music from animation to eleven o'clock.  At night, there are no extraneous noises, so no one will disturb your sleep. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  Dining at Fame Residence Kemer Spa is organized according to an all-inclusive concept.  The main restaurant is quite small, but there are few people in the hotel.  Water is usually placed on tables, and all other drinks are served by waiters.  In fact, they are difficult to get through, so it‚Äôs sometimes easier to go to the bar on your own and order the right drink.  Tourists note that the staff treats European tourists better, they do not always hear requests from representatives of the post-Soviet space. </p><p>  The restaurant is equipped with tables designed for six people, so if you are relaxing together, then it is likely that someone will sit down to you.  The waiters work nimble enough and quickly clean the dirty dishes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fame residence kemer spa food" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1983188.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As for the assortment of dishes, there are many of them.  On the tables there is always chicken, turkey, meatballs, meatballs, a variety of salads, snacks, grilled vegetables, fruits.  The local chef cooks sweets very well, their choice is also rich.  But fish dishes are practically not represented.  Very nice that there is diet steamed food.  But the children's menu is nuggets, french fries, onion rings.  In general, children are offered everything that we, as a rule, do not give to our children. </p><p>  In general, the food at the hotel is very decent and tasty, so no one will be able to stay hungry. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  The hotel makes a pretty good impression.  Of course, the territory of the complex is very small.  There is only a pool in front of the building, and then the beach begins.  But due to the fact that a beautiful sea splashes ahead, it seems that the territory is limitless. </p><p>  The hotel's beach, although small, is well equipped and clean.  Of course, as elsewhere, at eight in the morning, almost all sun loungers are occupied with towels.  But beach fights skillfully fight this phenomenon.  Three times a day, they go through the entire beach and take photos of empty sunbeds, on which there is only a towel or cap.  Thirty minutes later they return, and if the owner was not found, they simply empty the deck chair.  This is a very reasonable decision, since people who occupy places in this way do not even appear on the coast later. </p><p>  There is a bar on the beach with drinks and beer, and from 11 a.m. snacks and a cold watermelon cut in the shape of hearts appear.  Convenient slopes to the sea are built on the shore for those who do not want to enter the water on pebbles.  The beach is very beautiful and comfortable for a great vacation. </p><p>  The only thing worth emphasizing is the lack of a long gentle slope into the sea, which would be convenient for children.  Here the depth begins rather quickly and abruptly, therefore this option is not suitable for kids. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fame residence kemer spa room description" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1983189.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As for the animation, it is rather mediocre, according to tourists.  There is a mini club for children, but there are few events in it.  In general, this hotel is not worth considering for couples with kids.  Entertainment events for adults are also not very many.  Young people who are looking for discos and clubs are saved by the fact that the complex is located in the city center.  And therefore there are many similar institutions nearby. </p><p>  The hotel is suitable for those tourists who want a quiet and relaxing holiday or devote time to trips to attractions. </p><p>  The staff of the establishment is friendly, but among the workers, there are unpleasant exceptions.  Service, in principle, is at an average level, if not for minor flaws.  In general, the hotel is considered one of the best in Kemer.  However, service and food, according to vacationers, still do not reach the level of a solid five.  Those tourists who previously rested in hotels note that earlier the situation was much better.  And now the flaws are very striking. </p><h2>  Kemer Attractions </h2><p>  Resting in the center of Kemer, simply obliges you to see not only the entire resort, but also the nearest attractions.  Tourists are usually attracted by the ancient ruins and natural beauties of these places.  In the north of the resort is the Yoruk Park, which is an authentic village.  It recreated a series of expositions of everyday life of Turkish tribes.  A visit to the park is accompanied not only by viewing costumes and household items, but also by refreshments with traditional dishes of local cuisine.  Entire dwellings and workshops of nomads were recreated on the territory of the complex. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fame residence kemer spa 5 tours" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1983204.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Near Kemer is the ancient city of Phaselis.  If you believe the legends, it was founded a long time ago, back in the seventh century BC.  At one time, the city was very large and had three harbors.  Over the course of his long history, he changed rulers many times, among which was Alexander the Great.  And later, Phaselis fell under the rule of Rome, after which the heyday of the city lasted for three hundred years.  Currently, the ruins of buildings that date back to the Byzantine and Roman periods have been preserved. </p><p>  Another ancient city worthy of the attention of tourists is Olympos.  It was he who was first mentioned in the ancient Lycian annals.  Olympos was founded in the second century BC near modern Kemer.  Initially, it was inhabited by pirates, and later the Roman warriors took the land, joining them to their vast empire.  In Olympos you can see the ruins of the temple of Hephaestus, the bridge and the amphitheater.  Today the city is included in the National Park.  It is poorly preserved, but still worth seeing the ancient monuments of architecture. </p><p>  A very interesting sight is Yanartash - "burning mountain" in translation.  On the mountain, flames erupt in places from the ground, and burning does not stop, which is why the area is shrouded in smoke.  According to scientists, the reason for this interesting phenomenon is natural gas, which comes to the surface and when combined with oxygen, a flame arises.  Of course, there is a more fantastic explanation for the phenomenon.  An ancient legend says that Bellefront (the Greek hero) killed the monster Chimera, who burned everything with his fire, and threw it into the mountains.  That is why fire to this day comes from the Chimera.  Of course, this is just a beautiful legend, but an amazing phenomenon is worth a look. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fame residence kemer spa reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1983206.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  A very interesting cave complex near Kemer called Beldibi.  The picturesque place is surrounded by coniferous forests.  Here the bugle river begins, there is a waterfall.  In ancient times, caves served as a place of shelter from the elements for people and animals.  In the last century, archaeologists carefully studied the underground galleries and discovered a lot of interesting things in them - fragments of household items, cave paintings, tools.  In general, the caves are very interesting, but you can‚Äôt go to them yourself, because there is a very deep cliff near the entrance. </p>
