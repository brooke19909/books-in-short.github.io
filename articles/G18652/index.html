  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Outpatient treatment for computer addiction and other diseases</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The health of each person, first of all, depends on himself and is in his hands.  But most recall this only when their health worsens, and the symptoms of the disease manifest themselves.  Do not wait for it to pass or self-medicate.  It is easier to prevent any disease or to carry out prophylaxis, to undergo a thorough <span>examination of the body.</span>  This can be done in any modern clinic. </p><p>  Outpatient treatment is the organization of medical care for patients coming to a <span>medical institution</span> to carry out certain activities.  It can be carried out at home or the patient arrives at the hospital on his own: a polyclinic or hospital, a rehabilitation center.  Unlike inpatient, undergoing outpatient treatment, patients do not go to the clinic.  They belong to the category of ‚Äúlungs‚Äù of patients who are able to move around without the help of third parties or are in the stage of the disease that allows them such movement.  This does not include patients presenting a danger to society who have open forms of infectious diseases. </p><p>  Actually outpatient treatment in the treatment of a relatively new disease - computer addiction.  This term was proposed not so long ago.  Its author is Dr. Golberg from the United States.  This definition refers to the irresistible craving for a computer, in particular, for the Internet, which ultimately has a detrimental effect on the working, domestic, educational and social sphere of activity.  According to recent data, about 5% of Web users are susceptible to this disease.  At the stage when the Internet begins to replace social communication, a person becomes addicted and needs adequate therapy. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Ambulatory treatment can be successfully used in people with computer addiction.  This requires the patient's desire.  Each person uses an exclusively individual approach.  Visiting a competent specialist psychotherapist, you can forever get rid of the excitement that pulls you to computer games and the Internet as a whole.  After the sessions you will have an absolutely indifferent attitude to the game.  During the treatment process, a forbidden - behavioral sustainable motivation is formed that provides positive and psychological comfort in real life. </p><p>  With the method of emotional stress therapy, such patients undergo outpatient treatment.  This will not cause a <span>depressive syndrome,</span> since this approach is not traumatic for the psyche.  A person receives a stable guaranteed positive result.  The only condition is to visit a specialist at the appointed time and adherence to the treatment plan. </p><p>  Sometimes outpatient treatment of <span>computer addiction is</span> carried out by several specialists at the same time, since in severe cases it is necessary to use several types of therapy at the same time.  For these purposes, a hypnotic effect, a set of physiotherapeutic measures, and psychotropic drugs, tranquilizers are successfully used. </p><p>  An interesting approach to the treatment of addictions of a different nature was invented by the Chinese.  Doctors of the "Middle Kingdom" practice electroshock therapy in cases where other methods are not effective enough.  Naturally, safe and harmless doses are used, which in no way can have negative side effects.  In our country, this method has not yet been developed. </p><p>  Outpatient care is one of the main forms of treatment for the population.  It is very common in all states.  She does not require a hospital stay, which is also important from the point of view of economy.  Her organization is very different from each other, depending on who is specifically involved in its provision: the state, public organizations and departments, philanthropic or insurance organizations.  Outpatient care is suitable for adults who do not want to interrupt their activities.  <span>The key factors for the success of</span> this treatment are the close cooperation of clinics and rehabilitation centers with inpatient units. </p>
