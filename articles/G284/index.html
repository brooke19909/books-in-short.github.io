    <p>  According to many rating agencies of the country, the reliability rating of Mast Bank is relatively high.  At the first stages, the institution had a high credit rating - at level A, at the end of 2014 this rating was lowered to B ++, which is also a worthy indicator of the institution's reliability.  Agency forecasts previously defined this commercial enterprise as developing, today it has been given stable status. </p><h2>  Prestigious membership </h2><p>  A member of the Moscow Interbank Exchange, a member of the Association of Russian Banks, an authorized representative of payment systems such as MasterCard Worldwide and VISA International - all this is Mast-Bank.  Revoked the license of this institution?  Fortunately, this is erroneous information, they have nothing to do with this financial institution.  The company both worked and works, is a member of the interbank financial communications community.  Moreover, the institution is a partner of such money transfer systems as Unistream and Contact, Migom and Western Union. </p><h2>  How did temporary difficulties begin? </h2>

From official sources, it became known that the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the FSB checked the bank, as it was suspected of involvement in the illegal theft of funds from the budget.  On December 16, representatives of authorized bodies completely seized all the servers of the financial institution, from where all the information was copied. </p><p>  Panic arose because of a criminal case about the theft of funds for the construction of an aquarium on Russky Island, which was handled by the Directorate for Construction in the Far Eastern Federal District, and the construction of the <span>Russian bridge</span> over the Vostochny Bosphorus, which was entrusted to Mostovik NGO.  Andrei Poplavsky and Oleg Shishov, managers of construction companies, were detained by representatives of the Investigative Committee, they were also clients of the bank in question. </p><h2>  Unreasonable panic </h2><p>  In the period from December 16 to December 17, against the backdrop of a general crisis and a sharp increase in the dollar exchange rate among investors, a panic began.  The main office did not work for just one day, and depositors and partner banks began to actively withdraw their funds.  Although the bank representatives said that the financial institution was not working due to lack of electricity, it did not play a big role.  As a result, long queues formed, and a large flow of applications caused some overlaps in the work. </p>

    <p>  Rumors circulated that the Mast-Bank financial institution had its license revoked and that the bank was trying to borrow a large amount of funds in rubles at the Interbank Market at 30% per annum.  Both statements were soon refuted.  The metropolitan print media announced that only a few days were left before the license was revoked, since the Central Bank of the Russian Federation deprives the bank of the right to offer services in the domestic financial market due to illegal transfer of budget funds to accounts of other organizations. </p><h2>  How did it end? </h2><p>  The situation was completely resolved already on December 29, when representatives of authorized bodies stated that they had no complaints about the activities of the Mast Bank organization.  Reviews about the bank at this particular moment in time began to appear negative.  In accordance with the documentation that was withdrawn from the organization, she did not ask for loans at 30% per annum, she had no difficulties with partner banks.  The resentment was due to the fact that the financial institution could not pay dollar deposits.  As an alternative, he proposed the removal of a foreign currency deposit in rubles. </p><p>  The situation in the state financial market, when dozens of banks simply refused to fulfill their obligations and declared bankrupt, makes it clear that the work of the institute (at an interest rate of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation of 17%) remained at a fairly high level, albeit not at the perfect level.  Authorized representatives of the bank confirmed the fact that during the period from December 17 to 22, the offices of OJSC CB Mast-Bank were really crowded with customers.  The reason for the phenomenon was not the temporary difficulties and suspicions of the government, but a sharp jump in the ruble exchange rate and desperate attempts by depositors to save at least part of their savings.  At peak times, work was carried out as normal as possible. </p>

    <h2>  Incredibly advantageous offer </h2><p>  From December 2014 to March 2015, despite the controversial situation, Mast-Bank increased its deposits by almost 43%.  The total investment of individuals amounted to 15.4 billion rubles.  This figure contains the <span>financial report of the</span> institution.  Private deposits with a duration of 91 to 180 days increased by almost 3.5 billion rubles.  The situation became the reason for the fact that the rating of Mast-Bank was increased (reference from the official website of the institution).  The reason for the tide of funds was a high <span>interest rate</span> at 22%. </p><h2>  Favorable credit conditions </h2><p>  After the investigation, all services of the bank were resumed.  Good feedback on a partnership with a financial institution is left by borrowers.  According to them, the partnership scheme is very flexible.  Depending on the lending program, an interest rate of 23% to 33% is available.  The loan term is from 36 to 42 months.  The maximum available size of a consumer loan corresponds to 250 thousand rubles.  There are unique programs for entrepreneurs and businessmen. </p>

    <h2>  Restrictions by the CBR, or How the government regulates the flow of deposits </h2><p>  Due to the large influx of funds, the CBR imposed a moratorium on the activities of a financial institution.  The Bank is forbidden to accept new deposits and replenish existing ones.  This preventive measure is temporary.  The restriction entered into force on April 17, and its expiration date is scheduled for late May. </p><p>  On the official website of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation there is a prescription that at the moment the financial institution has a valid license.  At the same time, we note that today, for each of the agreements, an automatic extension is in effect in accordance with the previous terms of the partnership. </p>

    <p>  According to official figures, by April 1, 2015, the volume of net assets amounted to 24.17 billion rubles.  This indicator brought the bank to 159 position in Russia.  Equity is 3.2 billion.  This indicator is calculated by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.  The loan portfolio is 16.36 billion dollars.  The volume of obligations to the population corresponds to 15.38 billion.  Based on the above, it is possible to note the good performance indicators that Mast-Bank has.  Deposits, loans, reviews of which set up a partnership, continue to attract consumers.  It is too early to say what will happen after the moratorium has been lifted from the bank.  It remains to wait for the end of May and monitor the further development of events. </p>
