    <h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  In Krasnoyarsk, the <span>Central Park</span> was founded in 1828.  At that time, the basis of the city park was a partially virgin pine forest.  Most of the landscaping work was carried out from 1845 to 1861.  During this time, a pavilion for evening cultural events and a building for public gatherings with a buffet were erected. </p><p>  With the advent of Soviet Power, in 1934, the City Garden received a new name - "A. Gorky Park of Culture and Rest".  Then the whole territory was divided into two parts: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  active, where the attractions were located; </li><li>  quiet, where rare species of trees that remained at that time remained to grow. </li></ul><p>  In 2002, the authorities of Krasnoyarsk transferred the Central Park to private hands - for rent for a period of 25 years. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Central Park Krasnoyarsk" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2226712.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Opening hours and how to get </h2><p>  Today, the former City Garden has 4 entrances: from Karl Marx, Dzerzhinsky, Gorky and from the embankment.  The park is open to visitors from 11:00 to 23:00, admission is free. </p><p>  The nearest public transport stops to the main entrance on Karl Marx Street are the stop of the same name, Organ Hall and Luch Cinema.  Many buses pass through this part of the city: No. 1, 2, 11, 24, 32, 49, 55, 64, 80 and others.  Trolleybuses are also passing - No. 7, 8 and 15. </p><p>  You can drive to the park by your own vehicle, there is free parking near the main entrance.  Having left in the center of Krasnoyarsk, you need to move in the direction of Dubrovsky street, then go along Karl Marx along Lenin or Mira street (there is one-way traffic). </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Central Park Krasnoyarsk photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2226726.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Small railway </h2><p>  In the Central Park of Krasnoyarsk in the summer (from 11:30, except Monday), a small railway operates, which launched its first train back in 1936.  The entire rolling stock of the road is specially made, which is unique to our country.  There are 2 stations “Yubileinaya” and “Dream” by the railway.  The train runs in a ring through the entire park. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="scheme of the central park Krasnoyarsk" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2226706.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Attractions and park scheme </h2><p>  What a leisure park can do without carousels.  Naturally, Krasnoyarsk Central Park could not do without them.  Here are entertainment designed for any age, including extreme carousels. </p><p>  On the left side of the main entrance is a cafe and trampoline area.  And on the right side there is a room of laughter and fear, behind which there is immediately a playground. </p><p>  If you go directly along the main alley of the Central Park of Krasnoyarsk, you get to the observation deck of the city.  It offers a magnificent view of the Yenisei River, surrounded by mountains.  Here on the promenade is another attraction of the city - the bench of lovers, overlooking the Wedding House.  The peculiarity of the shop is that even if you sit on the very edges, the pair will still slide to the center. </p><p>  On the left side of the park, closer to the exit near the cinema "Luch" and on Dzerzhinsky street behind the monument to Gorky M., there is a motor racing track for children and a family entertainment platform, where there are attractions for young visitors.  Behind them is immediately a tennis court. </p><p>  If you move along the Central Alley and turn left before entering the Embankment, here you can find a Ferris wheel and a merry-go-round for fun with the whole family.  These are Crazy Bass, Rocking-Tang and others.  On the scheme of the Central Park of Krasnoyarsk, which can be viewed on the official website, all the rides and entertainment venues are detailed.  And just before the exit to Dzerzhinsky Street, there is a zoo of exotic animals and a shooting gallery. </p><p>  On the right side (behind the monument to Pushkin A. and the dance floor) there is an autodrome for adults with extreme attractions.  This is “Hip-Hop”, “Cotton Club”, “Surprise” and others.  And closer to the entrance to Gorky Street is a chess club. </p><p>  According to local residents, it is impossible to come to our region without even taking a photo of the Krasnoyarsk Central Park as a keepsake.  It is here that the spirit of the old city “hovers”. </p>
