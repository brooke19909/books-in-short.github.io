  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Fusing at home in the microwave.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Doing fusing with your own hands or sintering glass, you can make glass stained-glass windows of various shapes, thicknesses and textures.  They can be used as a variety of interior elements, for example, a stained-glass window in a door or window, in the form of inserts in the wall, as a countertop, for decorating <span>mirrors and decorative</span> panels.  The manufactured elements, using DIY fusing technology, can be used as inserts in the door, window, screen, make decorative dishes, lampshades, architectural elements, watch dials.  fusing stained-glass windows are currently very popular because they look very modern and aesthetically pleasing. </p><p>  Fusing technology is one of the oldest <span>glass processing</span> techniques <span>.</span>  Repeatedly found objects made of sintered glass in the graves of various peoples, as well as in Egyptian tombs. </p><p>  <strong>Fusing</strong> translated from English means smelting, sintering, reflow.  This concept includes a number of technologies for processing warm glass, performed at a temperature of 600 - 900 ¬∞ C. </p><p>  What is fusing at home? <strong> </strong>  - This is a thermal fusion, fusion of various glass elements into a whole.  The glass softens, heating to a certain temperature, causing sintering of the parts among themselves, practically without changing their relative position and shape. </p><p>  <strong>In essence,</strong> fusing at home consists in collecting a drawing of a conceived stained-glass window from various pieces of colored glass on glass.  As soon as the stained-glass window is laid out, the glass is heated in a special oven to the desired temperature, while sintering the disparate elements into a single layer.  Despite the complexity, fusing at home is becoming increasingly popular, helping to create your own unique interior and serve as a source of income, as a home business. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Depending on the temperature conditions and on the idea, the layers can be spread out or, on the contrary, they can be left unchanged.  The colors of the picture, as well, can mix or maintain their clear outlines.  The pattern can be made convex and voluminous. </p><p>  When performing fusing at home, it is important to choose the right types of glass and temperature conditions for heating.  Thanks to this, you can achieve an amazing decorative effect, as well as high strength of the finished product. </p><p>  Very beautiful and spectacular look works performed on this technology on the mirrors. </p><p><br>  Creating interesting and beautiful works of glass is possible with the use of technology such as fusing, i.e.  by sintering it in a special furnace. </p><p>  Modern special furnaces allow you to produce a huge number of a wide variety of <span>decorative panels,</span> door <span>panels</span> , as well as glass panels. </p><p>  If you fuse in the microwave, sintering the glass is the most safe and harmless way at home.  Glass in the microwave is melted thanks to the stove, the temperature inside which with microwaves rises to the temperatures necessary for fusing.  When fusing in the microwave with the help of a stove, it is fashionable to work with various glasses.  <span>Heating furnaces</span> for such work can give the glass a consistency similar to plasticine. </p><p>  Such microwave ovens work with a minimum power of 800W.  It is better to remove the glass plate from the microwave or turn it upside down so that it cannot spin.  For the first time using the stove, you need to read the instructions and warm the oven in the microwave, as recommended in the instructions. </p><p>  For independent work at home, you must have: a microwave, an oven, gloves, heat-resistant fusing paper, glass cutters and multi-colored glass. <br>  It is not recommended to use an <span>oil glass cutter</span> during such work <span>,</span> since the glass will burst when heated.  When working with glass, it is necessary to wear glasses to protect the eyes from splinters. </p>
