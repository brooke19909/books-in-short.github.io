The history and meaning of jargon</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Money, money, money ... No matter how much they spoke about them, there is no way without bills and coins in our world.  With their appearance, trade acquired a completely different meaning.  At the same time, various names for money began to appear, including informal ones.  Often, someone said a well-aimed word went to the people, and the history of his appearance has been lost for centuries.  Everyone is familiar with such names as the chervonets, five-hut and mowers.  How many rubles it is and where did such "nicknames" come from, few know.  But not everything is as simple as it seems at first glance. </p><h2>  The meaning of jargon "mowing" </h2><p>  The <span>colloquial</span> word "mowing" is most often found in <span>colloquial speech</span> .  And this is no coincidence.  The fact is that this is a thousand-ruble note, and it is one of the most common today.  But why exactly "mowing"?  How much was it at different times, did this slang word always mean exactly a thousand rubles? </p><p>  Philologists suggest that such a designation first appeared in the 20s of the last century.  Then, notes were issued in denominations of 1 thousand rubles, the inscription on which was made obliquely.  Hence the name: "oblique" or "mowing".  Such bills have long been withdrawn from circulation, and jargon has taken root and has remained.  And this despite the fact that in Soviet times, money of a similar denomination practically did not go.  Only at the end of the 20th century did “mowing" reappear in the youth lexicon. </p><p>  True, in the well-known work of <span>the Weiner brothers</span> “Era of Mercy” between Smoked and Zheglov we can observe a very interesting dialogue.  In it, the thief offers the investigator to play half-slant, and he replies: "... play half a hundred?".  It turns out <span>100 rubles</span> - this is oblique.  And then the question arises: "If a hundred is oblique, then 1 mower is how much then will it be?"  Problem-s.  Perhaps such a confusion arose due to the denomination that was carried out more than once in Soviet times, that is, a 10-fold decrease in the nominal value.  Unfortunately, it is difficult to answer this question more accurately. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Other names of thousand-ruble note </h2><p>  Of course, in different parts of the country for the definition of the same notes appeared their well-aimed words.  So, a thousand rubles has many other names: “piece”, “ton”, “thing” and even just “ruble”.  The last two arose in the 90s, when the value of money was low.  Many received a millionth salary, and the prices of bread, milk and other products were three zeros.  They began to call the “bundle" a bundle of money, that is, initially this word was used for a separate convolution.  It is believed that it appeared in colloquial speech at that far time, when the distance was measured with the elbows.  With a reduction in documents, a thousand, like a ton, is denoted by the letter "t".  Apparently, someone noticed this, jargon has taken root.  So, the answer to the question: "A piece, a ton, a piece or a mower - is that how much money?"  - one: 1 thousand rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Other interesting names for money </h2><p>  At various times, people gave each of their bills their own "prodigies."  Some still use it, while others have long become a part of history.  So, in the second half of the 19th century, a <span>portrait of Catherine II</span> appeared on a hundred-ruble note <span>.</span>  People quickly dubbed the bill "Katka", "Baba Katya" or simply "baba".  It is easy to guess that the name "grandmother" for the designation of money went from here.  On the 500-ruble was depicted Peter I, she was called by analogy "petka" or "grandfather."  However, “5 Katya” or “Five-Katka” was more often used, which later turned into a “Five Katka”, already familiar to modern man.  Just as in the case of the word "mowing", how much rubles it is, now not only young people know, but also people more distant from slang. </p>

    <h2>  And what is abroad? </h2><p>  Just like in our country, their funny names for money appeared abroad, and also, as a rule, among young people.  Although they don’t know, the mower is how many rubles it is, the question of the meaning of the words “bucks”, “cabbage” and “dead presidents” of the Americans will not be confused.  Everyone knows that we are talking about dollars.  But from the British you can even hear that they are paying with a "cartwheel."  So since the 19th century they have been designating a voiced coin in the UK. </p>
