  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Marmaris hotels - European level of service at the level of world standards.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  At the confluence of the Aegean and the Mediterranean Sea, at the foot of the mountains, the slopes of which are covered with picturesque forests, one of the world's largest harbors, full of blue lagoons with warm clear water and a large number of small islands, among which in the past used to hide <span>pirate ships.</span>  The name of this beautiful place is Marmaris Bay, where the city of the same name and resort are located.  According to legend, this Turkish resort city got its name from the exclamation ‚ÄúMimaryys!‚Äù, Which means literally ‚Äúhang the architect!‚Äù  This is exactly the way the ancient conqueror of the <span>island of Rhodes</span> reacted <span>,</span> who went down in history as Suleiman the Magnificent, when he saw how weakly the city walls were strengthened.  In a distorted form, this expression was perceived as the name assigned to it by the settlement - Marmaris. </p><p>  Nowadays, the Turkish resort of Marmaris is a famous holiday destination for tourists from the UK, Holland and Germany, and other countries where yacht racing is practiced.  The fact is that the city of Marmaris is the capital of the annual May sailing regatta, which has the status of International.  This swim has been held on the most elegant and beautiful yachts in the world for more than a dozen years and attracts a huge number of tourists from all over the world who want to admire these beauties with their own eyes.  At their service are luxury Marmaris hotels that can satisfy the most demanding and refined tastes.  Marmaris resort is among the top twenty vacation spots with the highest hotel density in relation to the area.  The diverse hotels of Marmaris, from 3 to 5 star rank, are scattered here at every step.  There are enough customers for everyone, because thanks to the warm tropical and <span>subtropical climate, the</span> holiday season in this place has a year-round duration.  Especially popular among tourists are Marmaris hotels of the HV type (Holidey Villag), consisting of secluded bungalows scattered in separate corners of cool pine forests.  Forest lands in some places go down to the sea itself, separated from the water by only a narrow strip of sandy beaches.  Thanks to this, leaving the bungalow, which giant pines keep in the shade with their crowns, you can already be exposed to the sun in 5 minutes walk and, plunging into the warm waves of the sea, bury in the hot beach sand. So, for example, hotel HV-1 class of <strong>Grand Yazici Marmaris Palace (Grand Yaziki Marmaris Pellas)</strong> , corresponding to the level of 5 stars. <strong>Tourists</strong> who leave reviews on hotels in Marmaris note that from its territory to the sea edge 10 meters. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Lower class hotels, such as 3-star <strong>Intermar</strong> and <strong>Villa Sol of</strong> the same level can be located at a distance from the sea from 200 hundred meters or more, this is the so-called second strip of building blocks. There is also a third, which is further from the sea. The exact distance to the seashore is best to find out in advance from the tour operator. It is also useful to clarify the checkout time, since it is not everywhere the same. In most hotels it is noon, but in some, for example, in the <strong>Elegance Hotel (Elegance Hotel)</strong> 5 stars , it is equal to 14-00. If the arrival happens earlier, you will have to wait for  It happened with tourists from Russia, which were not warned about this fact in advance. </p><p>  Tourists from Russia recently "saw through" all the charms that promise a <span>vacation in Marmaris,</span> and go along the beaten path by the Europeans.  Oriented to the high needs of those who understand the service of travelers from <span>Western Europe,</span> Marmaris hotels and Russian guests provide the same high level of service.  And if earlier most of the vacationers from the Russian Federation had enough of ‚Äúpopular‚Äù Antalya, now our compatriots have become much more sophisticated and prefer places where you can get the maximum of services for relatively little money.  And rest in Marmaris meets these needs as fully as possible.  Our country has already developed long-standing friendly relations with Turkey and entry into its territory is carried out according to a simplified passport and visa scheme.  In the holiday season, from various points of our Motherland, a lot of charter direct flights are usually organized with very ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù prices, which significantly reduces the time to travel to the vacation destination.  And from those lucky ones who have already appreciated all the beauties of this resort vacation spot, reviews about Marmaris hotels are generally positive, which is an additional incentive for those who have not been to this paradise of the Turkish coast yet. </p>
