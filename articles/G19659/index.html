Tens of thousands of Russians come here every year.  Many of them choose to relax Antalya - the largest resort city of this country on the Mediterranean Sea.  Well-developed tourist infrastructure, clean coast, a wide selection of hotels are just a short list of what they can offer here.  At the same time, even in a five-star hotel you can relax at a very reasonable price.  Such a complex is considered Adonis Hotel <span>Antalya 5 * (Antalya,</span> Lara).  But is it worth saving on vacation?  We will tell you more about this hotel in our article and try to answer this question. </p><h2>  Features of rest in Antalya </h2><p>  Antalya is a large port city. In the summer, almost 2 million people live here with tourists.  It has a developed infrastructure, aimed, as a rule, to serve guests from other countries.  Restaurants are open all over the place, offering local cuisine and seafood dishes, noisy bars and nightclubs, but there are also places for families.  Shopping in the city is also quite well developed - there are several large markets and shopping centers where you can buy inexpensively not only souvenirs, but also clothes, jewelry. </p><p>  Choosing a place to stay, first of all, you should focus on the area in which the hotel is located.  For example, the Antalya Adonis Hotel, which will be discussed in this article, is located in Lara.  This is a respectable and expensive area, which is considered a local entertainment center.  It is located on a rocky coast, nearby you can see old towers and mosques.  Therefore, a ticket here will cost a little more, and the quality of the services provided will be higher.  It is better to come here from May to October, since it is during these months that the resort has hot weather.  In winter it is also quite warm here, but the sea is unsuitable for swimming, as the water in it is cold.  By the way, the beach of the Lara district is marked with the Blue Flag, so it‚Äôs safe to swim here even with the youngest children.  However, due to the rocky coast, it will be necessary to choose a sea entry more carefully. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  More about the hotel itself </h2><p>  But, of course, the main thing in buying a ticket is the choice of a hotel, not a resort.  After all, it is there that tourists will have to spend most of their vacation.  As a rule, hotels in Turkey are designed for those guests who prefer to spend almost all the time on their territory, visiting the beach and occasionally choosing excursions.  The Adonis Hotel Antalya 5 * hotel (Turkey) moved slightly away from this concept.  It is built in the city center right on the rocky coast, therefore it is considered a city hotel.  He also has practically no own territory; its total area is only 23,000 square meters.  m. The hotel is a high-rise building (10 floors), which was erected in 1995.  In total, he offers tourists 227 comfortable rooms, while 40% of them have sea views.  Most of them are suitable for double occupancy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Exterior of the hotel building" class="if uuid-2335066" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2335066.jpg"></div><p>  The hotel was last renovated in 2012.  It employs exclusively professional staff who speaks excellent English.  But there are almost no Russian-speaking employees at the hotel, and this should be taken into account when planning to vacation here.  The hotel can stay with children of absolutely any age, including babies.  But the animals will have to be left at home - their placement is strictly prohibited.  Upon check-in, as in other resort complexes, a passport and a credit card will be required from guests.  When choosing a plane ticket, it is also worth considering that the registration of guests is carried out here from 14:00 local time, so it‚Äôs unlikely that it will be possible to check into a room earlier than this.  But they will have to leave their apartments after the end of the vacation much earlier - employees ask to be released strictly before noon.  Although, if desired, tourists can linger for a few more hours and wait for their flight, but not in the rooms, but on the hotel territory. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Where is the hotel situated? </h2><p>  The location of the hotel is also an important component of relaxation.  At the same time, tourists usually want the hotel to be close to the beach and infrastructure facilities, but located in a quiet place so that no one will disturb their sleep at night.  The Antalya Adonis Hotel 5 * complex (Turkey, Lara) fully complies with these requirements.  Although it is located on a rocky coast, the beach can be reached in a few minutes, going down the equipped stairs.  Near the hotel there is also a large park, but the night clubs, on the contrary, are quite far away, so in the evenings it is quite quiet.  Of course, it should be borne in mind that the noise level in the hotel is still higher than that of hotels on the outskirts, since it is located in the city center.  A large shopping center is opened near the complex, where tourists often make purchases. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amoma.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mediterranean Sea View" class="if uuid-2335030" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2335030.jpg"></div><p>  Another significant advantage of the Adonis Hotel Antalya (Grand) is its proximity to the airport.  Antalya is a large transport center, so it is only 12 km from the city.  Tourists get to their hotels in just 1 hour, so they don‚Äôt have to spend a lot of time moving in hot weather.  By the way, you can arrange a transfer to the hotel when buying a ticket.  Then at the airport you will be met by a comfortable bus with air conditioning and comfortable seats, which will quickly bring all tourists to the hotel.  However, if desired, of course, guests can get to it on their own.  In Antalya, public transport is well developed, and tourists can always rent a car. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  What rooms can a hotel offer its guests? </h2><p>  When choosing a hotel, tourists prefer to pay close attention to the condition and arrangement of rooms, because nobody wants to relax in dilapidated rooms with poor repair.  As mentioned above, in the Antalya Adonis Hotel (ex. Grand) complex, the last repair was made in 2012, so you should not worry about these problems.  In total, the hotel offers 227 rooms.  Of these, two standard ones are equipped with the necessary amenities for people with disabilities: wide doorways, a special bathroom and comfortable beds.  Smoking is strictly prohibited in the living rooms.  Connecting rooms interconnected by interior doors, the hotel does not provide. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Interior decoration" class="if uuid-2335055" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2335055.jpg"></div><p>  The standard room is 18-19 square meters.  It is designed for the settlement of two adults, an extra bed is also provided for children under 12 years of age.  The room consists of a bedroom and a bathroom.  The floor is carpeted.  Guests are offered apartments with single or double beds.  All rooms also have open balconies, and the windows overlook the sea, nearby city buildings or a large park.  For families in the complex prepared 20 spacious rooms of 35 square meters.  m. They consist of a bedroom, which can accommodate 3 adult tourists and a child. </p><p>  All rooms are cleaned daily by hotel staff.  During cleaning, they also replenish the minibar.  Sheets and towels are changed once every two days.  But if necessary, they can do this earlier, upon request.  Room service is available for a fee. </p><h2>  What facilities are there in the rooms? </h2><p>  The city complex Adonis Hotel Antalya 5 * (Antalya) is a respectable place to relax, so the rooms here have not only fresh repairs, but also good equipment.  So, all the furniture in them is made of quality wood, and exquisite paintings adorn the walls.  The room has a large mirror, bedside tables, wall lamps.  It is worth noting that some amenities are provided only for a fee. </p><p>  In addition, guests can use the following equipment: </p><ul><li>  central air conditioning - it is worth noting that only hotel employees are engaged in its configuration; </li><li>  a small plasma TV, which is additionally equipped with a range of cable channels; </li><li>  mini-bar - drinking water is provided every day for free, but you will have to pay extra for other drinks; </li><li>  electronic safe - it is also provided for a fee, and you can leave your valuables in it for about $ 2 per day; </li><li>  a hairdryer, shampoo, towels, liquid soap and shower gel in the bathroom - while bath accessories are replenished daily; </li><li>  phone - you can make international calls directly from your room, but for a fee; </li><li>  free internet - you can request a password from the administrator at the reception at check-in. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebookers.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="In-room bathroom" class="if uuid-2335040" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2335040.jpg"></div><h2>  The hotel territory and its infrastructure </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the Antalya Adonis Hotel (Turkey) does not have its own large territory, there are many infrastructure facilities, they are simply located very compactly in the hotel building.  Moreover, they provide most of their services only for a fee.  Such institutions, for example, include a doctor‚Äôs office, a visit to which is not included in travel insurance, as well as a hairdresser and laundry.  The reception desk in the hotel lobby is open around the clock, here you can call a taxi to the hotel, exchange currency and simply solve the problems. </p><p>  Adonis Hotel Antalya (Lara) has its own car park, which can be parked for free.  Of the infrastructure facilities, it is also worth highlighting your own business center, four conference rooms and a meeting room - all of them are equipped only with modern technology, which attracts guests to the hotel who come to the country for seminars or business meetings. </p><h2>  What nutritional concept does this complex offer? </h2><p>  Many tourists choose Turkey to stay in many respects because of the All Inclusive system, which offers a huge variety of dishes and local drinks.  Hotel Antalya Adonis Hotel 5 * (Lara) was no exception.  The concept here works daily from 10:00 to 23:00.  At this time, tourists can not only have breakfast, lunch and dinner in the main restaurant of the hotel, but also have a snack with desserts, fruits and ice cream in bars and cafes, as well as receive an unlimited number of locally made drinks, including alcoholic ones.  Paid at the bar you will make freshly squeezed juice, a cold cocktail.  For a separate amount, imported drinks are also purchased. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Restaurant" class="if uuid-2335041" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2335041.jpg"></div><p>  Antalya Adonis Hotel has a main restaurant, which serves a buffet, a poolside bar, as well as a cafe in the hotel lobby and a disco bar that hosts night discos.  It is worth noting that some of these institutions work only in the high season, that is, in the summer months. </p><h2>  Read more about beach vacations at the hotel </h2><p>  Perhaps the only drawback of the Antalya Adonis Hotel 5 * complex is the lack of its own sandy beach.  The fact is that the hotel is located on a rocky coast, and initially this place for swimming was not adapted.  But for vacationers over the sea, a special platform was built where sunbeds and umbrellas are located.  By the way, they can be used for free.  You can get to the platform by stairs.  The entrance to the sea is also not very convenient, not gentle.  The sunset is steep, so immediately it becomes deep.  Therefore, you can also go downstairs by stairs.  There is also a bar on the platform. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.voyagespirates.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Terrace on the beach" class="if uuid-2335045" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2335045.jpg"></div><p>  If such a swimming is not to your liking, then you can always use the outdoor pool.  It works only in the summer season, daily until 18:00.  The pond is filled with fresh water and is additionally equipped with a slide.  In winter, an indoor pool of 40 square meters is open.  m </p><h2>  What entertainment options does the complex offer? </h2><p>  The Antalya Adonis Hotel 5 * hotel is focused not only on beach holidays.  There are other options for entertainment.  We list the main ones: </p><ul><li>  Turkish bath and sauna - all hotel guests can visit them for free; </li><li>  gym - equipped with weight training equipment and treadmills, working every day; </li><li>  tables for playing table tennis - equipment is provided free of charge; </li><li>  entertainment programs in the afternoon and evening - the hotel has a team of animators consisting of 10 people. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.voyagespirates.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Indoor pool" class="if uuid-2335043" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2335043.jpg"></div><h2>  What can a hotel offer tourists with children? </h2><p>  Despite the inconvenient entry into the sea, the Antalya Adonis Hotel is still very popular among tourists with children.  An extra bed is available for them in the room upon request, but strollers and pots cannot be rented.  The restaurant, as expected, has highchairs. </p><p>  For entertainment, there is a shallow compartment for the kids in the pool.  There is a playground nearby.  Children from 4 to 12 years old can spend time in a mini-club, where animators will entertain them with massive games and competitions. </p><h2>  The advantages of the hotel that tourists give out </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the Adonis Hotel Antalya 5 * complex often receives good reviews from its guests, although they say that the hotel does not reach five-star hotels in Europe.  However, many enjoyed their stay here, and they recommend it to other tourists.  In the reviews, they note the following advantages: </p><ul><li>  Great location.  Nearby are shops and restaurants, as well as public transport.  Tourists walk without problems in the evenings through the streets of the city. </li><li>  Beautiful views from the windows of the hotel, as it is located on a hill.  That is why tourists also recommend taking rooms exclusively with sea views. </li><li>  Delicious meals served in the main restaurant.  Guests also note that the menu here is quite diverse and for 2 weeks of vacation the food does not have time to get bored. </li><li>  The lack of a large number of small children, because instead of the beach there is a platform.  Most often, adults stay here, therefore, in the afternoon and in the evening the hotel is quiet. </li><li>  The rooms do not differ in exquisite decor, but all the equipment in them is working properly.  The rooms are cleaned well every day. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="ranguesperam.gq" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel view from the sea" class="if uuid-2335064" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2335064.jpg"></div><h2>  Negative reviews about Adonis Hotel Antalya 5 * </h2><p>  Of course, it was not without drawbacks.  So, some tourists were unsatisfied with the service provided.  At the same time, in the reviews they indicate not only minor flaws, but also serious shortcomings that greatly spoiled the vacation experience.  Before buying a ticket to the Antalya Adonis Hotel, tourists should pay attention to the following disadvantages of living here: </p><ul><li>  Not the most friendly hotel staff.  Employees do not seek to solve the problems of guests, often ignore their requests. </li><li>  In summer, air conditioners do not cope with their work, so in all areas of the hotel it is very stuffy. </li><li>  The noise in the rooms, coming from the street, greatly interferes with sleep.  This shortcoming was usually told by tourists who got rooms whose windows overlook the city buildings. </li><li>  A small selection of fruits at the buffet.  Even in summer only watermelons, melons and tasteless grapes are served. </li><li>  On the platform replacing the beach, not everyone has enough free sunbeds, and you cannot sunbathe without them.  Therefore, they have to be occupied in the early morning. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lobby interior" class="if uuid-2335035" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2335035.jpg"></div><h2>  Should I choose this hotel for relaxation? </h2><p>  If you are not demanding about having your own full sandy beach, then you can safely choose the Antalya Adonis Hotel 5 * (Lara) hotel.  It has favorable accommodation, located in the very center of Antalya, located close to shopping centers and restaurants.  Despite the shortcomings, the level of service here is quite consistent with low prices, therefore, in general, this hotel can be recommended for leisure to adult tourists, businessmen who arrived in Turkey on business matters, as well as youth companies. </p>
