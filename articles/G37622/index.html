    <h2>  Halkidiki - the legendary trident </h2><p>  Greece, as you know, is divided into mainland and island.  In addition, there are many resorts that are located on the peninsulas.  And there are a great many of those along the coastline of Greece.  And among them, perhaps the most popular is Halkidiki.  There is a huge number of hotels of all categories, ranging from the magnificent "fives", ending with hotels with one star or without them at all (the so-called guest houses).  However, the Russians mainly choose triples.  They are comfortable, decent and offer tourists an upscale vacation, such as the Kassandra Mare Hotel 3 (Halkidiki / Kassandra). </p><p>  This beautiful peninsula is located on the northern shores of the Aegean Sea.  It has the shape of a trident or three fingers.  Each of the teeth is also a peninsula.  They bear very beautiful names: Kassandra, Agio Oros and Sithonia.  All of them are rich in vegetation, which attracts lovers of flora and fauna here.  In addition, Halkidiki is considered an excellent vacation spot for tourists vacationing with families. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kassandra mare hotel 3" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/771909.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there? </h2><p>  The closest Greek airport to Halkidiki is Thessaloniki.  Regular and charter flights fly from Moscow there.  Flight time is about three and a half hours.  From other large Russian cities from time to time, mainly in season, charter planes fly.  Well, from Thessaloniki to the desired resort, you can go either by bus or by car.  The distance is 56 kilometers, which means that you will have to be 40-60 minutes on the road.  If your destination is a deluxe hotel, then the transfer from the airport to the hotel is usually included in the price of the tour, and if your choice is a three-star, for example, the hotel Kassandra Mare Hotel 3 * (Halkidiki / Kassandra / Nea Potidea) , then when you make a tour it is better to pay for the transfer immediately.  Then, after landing at the airport of Thessaloniki, you do not have to solve the problem of moving to the resort on your own. </p><p>  By the way, there is another good option - preliminary car rental.  If you have a driver‚Äôs license of an international standard, you can rent a pretty decent car for only 30 euros per day, and then it will be possible to make long trips every day around the peninsula. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kassandra mare hotel reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/771910.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Climatic conditions </h2><p>  The average annual air temperature in these places is almost the same as in our Black Sea resorts.  This means that the swimming season here lasts from May to early October.  The holiday season is from May to September inclusive.  On average, even in the hot months (July ‚Äì August), the air warms up to 30 degrees, but there are also higher rates - 35 or more.  However, unlike many sea resorts, the humidity in these parts is not high, so even such high temperatures are easily tolerated.  In addition, almost all hotels, even guesthouses, apartments and triples, for example, Kassandra Mare Hotel 3 *, are equipped with air conditioning.  Therefore, tourists always feel comfortable in the room, but on the beach, under the umbrella, no heat is terrible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="greece 3 kassandra mare hotel" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/771906.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beaches on Halkidiki </h2><p>  Of course, the bulk of tourists (more than 95%) come to Greece for a beach holiday.  And sightseeing is a secondary goal, so the condition of the beaches is important for almost everyone.  By the way, almost all land areas adjacent to the sea, regardless of whether the hotel is in the immediate vicinity or not, belong to the municipality.  In terms of cleanliness, everyone can be calm, since the Greeks are very careful about their land, including beaches.  They are all perfectly maintained, you will not find garbage anywhere, everywhere there is beach equipment - changing rooms, showers, deck chairs, umbrellas, etc. True, you need to pay for some amenities.  But the entrance to the beach is free.  The beaches on Halkidiki are covered with snow-white sand mixed with small pebbles.  For lovers of water entertainment there is a wide selection of attractions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kassandra mare hotel 3 reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/771907.jpg" width="600"></div>

Other tourists complain about the audibility in the rooms.  There are also those who don‚Äôt like the hotel‚Äôs cuisine: either the portions are small, or the choice is not satisfactory.  And someone is quite happy with the hotel, but upset because of the lack of any infrastructure.  In the evenings, in order to unwind, tourists go to nearby cities and towns.  But the hotel has no show program, so every day it‚Äôs getting more boring. </p><p>  Nevertheless, a lot of positive reviews can be found in various sources.  If the tourist is not particularly picky, then he will be fine here. </p>
