    <h2>  Security </h2><p>  This is the most important thing that employees devote all their time to.  Moreover, this paragraph applies not only to people, but also to trees.  The rope park is built with reliance on green spaces.  But the mounts are designed in such a way that they do not harm them at all.  There are environmental reports that confirm that the trees continue to grow normally and supply the city with oxygen. </p><p>  But the rope park in Orekhovo is still not a botanical garden, but an entertainment center, so the most important thing here is the safety of athletes.  None of the visitors will be allowed to pass the route until they receive instruction.  Therefore, no matter how you burn with impatience, you will have to carefully listen to the instructor and answer his questions. </p><p>  Be sure to give out special equipment.  The specialist will check each mount, after which it will give permission to go through the route.  And there is no question of how to get through it without safety cables.  Get ready for the fact that, only following all the rules, you can have fun and health benefits. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="norwegian park nut trails" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1423999.jpg" width="600"></div>
