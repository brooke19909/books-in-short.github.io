  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Germany Hotels: Appreciate German Quality and Thoroughness</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In Germany, there are modern skyscrapers and medieval castles, indescribably beautiful nature and resort towns, where you can relax in at least your whole life, choosing the most suitable hotels and hotels for this.  Perhaps that is why millions of tourists come to Germany hotels every year, appreciating the possibility of a quality vacation, punctuality and honesty of local residents, as well as the very atmosphere of this extraordinary country. </p><p>  Tourists who often travel to Europe and the world note that there are no hotels with serious shortcomings - a vacation in Germany guarantees a warm welcome, comfortable accommodation and quality service.  In addition, guests are usually pleasantly pleased with the cost of living - in German hotels it is equal to the average throughout Europe, although it may vary depending on certain factors.  In general, it should be noted that numerous reviews of hotels in Germany are mostly positive, especially in relation to the hotel complex ‚ÄúNassauer Hof‚Äù (Wiesbaden).  Here, in the city with the largest cuckoo clock in the world and a huge number of fans of the famous singer Sting, the rest will be the most memorable and original.  The hotel, as in the city itself, has a very developed cultural and mass sector, so guests can take part in a variety of competitions, festivals, exhibitions and sweepstakes, for example, in the competition of pastry chefs or chefs.  Naturally, no one can stay away from such entertainment. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Nassauer Hof hotel in Wiesbaden is considered quite prestigious and elite, if only because the writer Fedor Dostoevsky and the last Russian Tsar Nicholas II stayed there.  Now ordinary tourists have the opportunity to stay in the imperial rooms, as well as relax in the wonderful thermal resort, take a walk in the picturesque city park, visit the Opera or win a certain amount of money in the casino.  For lovers of less extreme relaxation, the hotel has a large indoor pool, solariums and saunas, a sun terrace and a small beauty center.  Like some other German hotels, the hotel complex in Wiesbaden offers a range of services for future newlyweds - weddings, suites and an extensive entertainment program. </p><p>  Many experts advise tourists to go on vacation to Dresden.  The fact is that this German city is still being rebuilt and reconstructed, therefore it does not experience a large influx of foreign guests, like many other hotels in Germany.  Here you can relax inexpensively and efficiently in the calm atmosphere of traditional German calm and poise.  You can leisurely take excursions to the many Dresden churches and museums, explore the palaces or relax in the comfort provided by small and cozy German hotels.  The Hilton Hotel (Dresden) is a modern and stylish complex located in the heart of the Old Town, close to all significant <span>sights of Dresden.</span>  The hotel offers its guests to relax in the fitness centers and gyms, relax with a glass of delicious local beer in the bar or brasserie, taste several delicious <span>German dishes</span> in upscale restaurants, as well as visit the solarium, sauna and steam bath.  Only families with children can be disappointed with their stay in Dresden, as the sights of this city, as well as most of the attractions that the hotel offers them, will be of little interest to the kids. </p><p>  Germany's hotels are diverse, as is this country itself.  You can go to the German part of the Alps to go skiing, you can visit the famous <span>thermal spas</span> or cities with the greatest monuments of history and culture.  In any of these places you will find German hospitality, detail and upscale comfort. </p>
