But after a while I had a desire to watch my favorite movies and photographs on the big TV screen, and I began to look for ways to connect my laptop to the TV. </p><p>  Typing in a search engine: "How to connect a laptop to a TV?", I received a large number of answers and recommendations.  I will try to systematize the instructions I received. </p><p>  We check both devices for input and output for their connection.  Modern technologies offer us three main types of ports and connectors, these are: </p><p>  1. Four-pin analog video connector - S-video.  Using this connector, you only need one cable to connect the devices. </p><p>  2. The connector used for normal connection to a computer monitor is VGA.  It has fifteen contacts and uses analog technology.  The multimedia data transmitted through this connector does not lose its qualities.  This is the easiest and most common way. </p><p>  3. Digital rectangular port with 24 pins - DVI.  On laptops it comes across quite rarely, but in <span>desktop computers it</span> is used very often and is already beginning to displace the standard VGA connector. </p><p>  In my case, the laptop and the TV turned out to have a VGA connector.  Since I use the Windows 7 operating system, I did not have any connection problems, since this operating system almost determined and configured everything myself. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But if after all, after connecting the VGA cable to both devices, the image did not appear on the big screen, you need to go to the ‚ÄúControl Panel‚Äù, then in the ‚ÄúScreen Settings‚Äù and in this section manually set the expansion parameters and the screen on which you want to display picture. </p><p>  Here we are in a short form how to <span>connect a laptop to a TV,</span> let's move on to the next case - how to connect a TV to wifi. </p><p>  Finally, such a convenient thing as Wi-Fi appeared.  What does this direct connection mean? </p><p>  With it, without the help of wires, it is possible to connect a wide variety of devices, for example, two or more computers (laptops), smartphones, a laptop and a TV.  In general, there are a great many options for building your own small network, and besides, they are all without providing an access point and a router.  Setting up a connection is very simple, and the technology itself is completely safe, as it is based on WPA2 ‚Ñ¢ encryption.  In general, this technology works by analogy to a Bluetooth connection, only with a speed of 12 times faster and with a larger coverage area. </p><p>  Before connecting the TV to wifi, I tried to connect it via a smartphone.  Firstly, you need to purchase an additional adapter for the TV (so that it can receive and consider incoming signals).  In the process of connecting the device, exchanging information about themselves, check the compatibility of their work and request a password for the connection.  In my case, the smartphone serves as a virtual access point, as it is a functional device. </p><p>  Even in this article, one could describe how to connect a TV to a router, but this is such a time-consuming process that most users prefer to contact specialists. </p><p>  An inexperienced user should pay special attention to such factors as the compatibility of devices with each other and the registration of the correct data redirection route.  The main point is the setting of parameters that meet the requirements. </p><p>  You can summarize (my opinion) - it is better to entrust the connection setup to specialists.  Since connecting a TV to a router is a very serious process.  But if you are not too lazy and find detailed instructions on the Internet <span>how to connect the TV to a</span> router, you can safely consider yourself this specialist and set up a connection. </p>
