It is surrounded by magnificent mountains, covered with dense thickets of pine forests and plantations of <span>orange trees.</span>  In itself, it is a calm and cozy town with quiet streets, which are small shops, bars and restaurants.

    <h2>  Relaxation </h2><p>  Here the tourist will find everything he wants.  Fans of club life in the city can visit night discos, although for active pastime it is better to go to nearby Alanya, which can be easily reached by taxi or bus. </p><p>  Konakli has many beaches.  Most of them have a pebble coating, so rubber shoes are required.  For lovers of purely sandy beaches on the outskirts of Konakli there is a so-called "turtle" bathing area.  It got its name due to the presence of a large number of small <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãturtles</span> that crawl here to warm themselves.  This sandy beach is considered a fairly secluded place.  It is surrounded by cliffs and lovers will certainly enjoy the sand in the sun away from noise. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Konaklƒ± Hotels </h2><p>  Along the coast of this small resort town many hotels have been built, which are designed specifically for a relaxing holiday with children.  And although not all of them are luxurious, nevertheless they have the necessary infrastructure for quality living.  These hotels offer tourists not only comfortable rooms, but also plenty of entertainment for every taste. </p><p>  Many establishments are budget, but quite high-quality hotels, for example, Saphir, Anitas, Blue Night, etc. Traditionally on this coast, four-star options are in high demand, such as the Eftalia Resort, the <span>Club</span> Smile Green <span>club</span> equivalent to them, etc. </p><p>  Of the best "fives" can be called Vikingen Quality Resort, Telatiye Resort 5 *.  Reviews about him from the Russians are pretty good.  Many of our compatriots consider this modern hotel the right choice in order to get a complete and unforgettable vacation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Telatiye Resort 5" class="if" height="266" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1086195.jpg" width="600"></div>
