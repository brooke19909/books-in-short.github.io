Below you will find information about what weather conditions await tourists at this time of year, as well as which attractions are worthy of the attention of travelers. </p><h2>  Weather in Nha Trang in winter </h2><p>  The resort is located on the coast of the South China Sea.  The winter period is commonly called the "dry season".  Daytime air temperature ranges from 25 to 30 degrees Celsius.  You can’t name rainy weather - precipitation falls mainly at night.  Keep in mind that this time of day is also cool (the air temperature in Nha Trang in January does not exceed 20 degrees).  Sea water is not particularly warm.  So, for example, its temperature can reach only 22 degrees, which for some tourists is not enough to swim.  However, in general, many travelers like the sea in Nha Trang in January.  Reviews say that this month is quite humid.  But the total number of days when it rains is small.  Rainfall, most likely, will go in the evening, and the rains themselves are rather short-term and will not interfere with your vacation.  Weather in Nha Trang in early January is windy.  <span>Storm warnings</span> sometimes sound <span>,</span> but not often, so don't worry about this either. </p>

    <h2>  General information about the city </h2><p>  Nha Trang is the beach <span>capital of Vietnam,</span> as well as one of the most popular resorts in the country.  The total number of local residents is estimated at 200 thousand people, and most of them are engaged in tourism business.  Nha Trang itself has several beaches that are valued throughout the country.  The bay in the city is largely covered by a series of islands, so there are not often strong waves there. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Great places to relax on a clean beach are the islands of Che and Tam.  However, caution should be exercised in these places, since the depth of the sea is already sufficient not far from the coast (2-2.5 meters).  Nha Trang beaches are in municipal ownership, but this does not mean that you will miss them, as there is an opportunity to try water skiing or take a balloon ride. </p>

    <h2>  The city's attractions </h2><p>  In fact, few tourists like to travel several thousand kilometers just to lie on the beaches on the sea coast.  Most prefer to visit the city (and not only) attractions in order to feel the <span>local flavor.</span>  Of course, in the resort you will have a great rest under the slender palm trees on the paradise coast, in the azure water and on the white sand.  However, Nha Trang is interesting not only for this, but also for its historical sights.  The architectural structures and cultural features of the city are quite distinctive.  If you arrive in Nha Trang in January, you can appreciate the Asian flavor at its true worth by visiting historical and architectural monuments, museum exhibits and religious buildings.  Tourists who come to rest with children will also be able to find appropriate entertainment and educational activities. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Religious shrines of the city </h2><p>  The building of the Catholic Cathedral is considered to be the real pearl of Nha Trang.  This is truly a monumental architectural structure with many original elements.  This temple is a modern building built in the traditions of the Gothic style - using multi-colored stained-glass windows, bells and chimes (which, incidentally, were produced in France). </p>

    <p>  Other places of worship in the city are also impressive.  For example, you will not be indifferent to a trip to the Tyam towers of Po Nagar, where Hindu religious services and ceremonies are held.  To date, only four of the seven turrets are in good condition.  The most interesting from an architectural point of view is the construction of the north tower.  Its main hall is distinguished by the presence of a statue that is dedicated to the ten-armed goddess Uma. </p><p>  Long Sean Pagoda tourists are also called among the main attractions of the city, which must be visited without fail to experience the atmosphere of Nha Trang.  It is known mainly because of the huge <span>statue of Buddha,</span> which is located on a hill. </p><h2>  Islands near Nha Trang </h2><p>  Quite often, tourists vacationing in the city book excursions, including visits to the nearest islands.  If you go to Nha Trang in January, then consider this possibility.  You will definitely like the atmosphere of the island called Hon-Tam, which means “silk” in Vietnamese.  In its western part is a village with a traditional Vietnamese lifestyle, and the people living in it will surprise you with their hospitality. </p>
