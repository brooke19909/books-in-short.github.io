    <p>  Insurance is a special type of financial relationship in order to create and use cash savings, which serve to compensate for damage in the event of various kinds of dangers and are paid to individuals or legal entities. </p><p>  In a narrow sense, this is a relationship between two parties aimed at protecting the insured person or his property at the expense of monetary funds, which were formed from paid insurance premiums. </p><p>  In a broad sense, it includes the types of activities that subsequently formed this material protection. </p><p>  The normative legal acts on the basis of which these relations operate are the Civil Code of the Russian Federation (part two, chapter 48) and the Federal Law "On the organization of insurance business", which describe the detailed aspects of this term.  Based on this Federal Law, one can understand the following: insurance is the relationship of two counterparties in which certain amounts are paid by the contract by one or another party. </p><h2>  Parties and their responsibilities </h2>

However, the foreign insurance system has its own characteristics. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="telephone number of the insurance company MSC" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21473/469571.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  So, it should be borne in mind that the cost of real estate that has been or will be acquired has an almost decisive role.  Naturally, the larger this amount, the more expensive the insurance policy will be.  It is taken into account whether the property serves as the main place of residence, or is it not the only housing.  Thus, if there are any possible risks, the telephone number of the insurance company MSC will help to find out.  Everything is done in advance, as this company respects its customers and their choice. </p><p>  The so-called insurance history of the territory in which the acquired property is located also has an effect on the cost of the policy.  The fact is that if natural disasters have repeatedly collapsed on this site, then the company may well increase the size of insurance payments.  The place itself is simply taken into account. </p><h2>  Differences of organizations located in Russia and other countries </h2><p>  In each country, insurance policies have, in addition to standard, additional items.  For example, in France, the contracts that insure homeowners when renting them out are most popular.  In England, it will turn out to be insured against property damage resulting from the explosion of a steam boiler, gas storage, failure of the sewer or heating, and even the fall of an air-piloted device.  And in Germany, a franchise of civil liability has become widespread, which is designed to compensate for damage caused to another person or another's property.  In the Czech Republic, you can get insurance that will compensate for damage in the event of damage to the landscape by nature.  In the United States, in turn, <span>title insurance is</span> very popular <span>,</span> which provides for compensation for possible damage in case of loss of property rights to real estate. </p><p>  If you take, for example, a Russian company, such as MSC (insurance company), the official website will confirm that it does not have any features. </p><h2>  Minimum MTPL Term </h2><p>  Many car owners understand that it is forbidden to drive on roads without compulsory motor third party liability insurance.  It is because of this that citizens conclude contracts with different companies.  According to the legislation in force on the territory of the Russian Federation, the minimum MTPL period can vary in three categories. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="MSC insurance company CTP" class="if" height="301" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21473/469587.jpg" width="486"></div>

    <p>  The first option is for owners whose vehicle has passed state registration outside of Russia.  For such citizens, the minimum period is from 5 to 15 days. </p><p>  The second option is for people who are going to the place of registration or to a vehicle inspection.  The minimum period is 20 days. </p><p>  The third option is the most common.  The contract is concluded if you have registered with the traffic police.  The minimum period may not be less than 3 months. </p><p>  In the event that you decide to insure your car for one quarter (season), the cost of the policy will be 30% of the annual amount.  Typically, these types of OSAGO policies are issued by car owners who use the car not all year round. </p><h2>  Brief information about CASCO </h2><p>  This type of insurance is considered to be voluntary.  If there is a CASCO policy, a citizen can receive monetary compensation for hijacking a vehicle or causing harm to the health of the driver and passengers.  The final settlement will be provided by the organization you contacted.  For example, if you decide to conclude an agreement and get a policy, select a company, for example, MSC (insurance company).  The addresses of the branches in your city can be found on the Internet. </p><p>  When calculating CASCO, the following parameters are usually taken into account: </p><ul><li>  car model; </li><li>  year of manufacture of the car (usually only new vehicles are insured); </li><li>  driver's age (for older people it usually goes more expensive); </li><li>  experience in driving a vehicle (beginners pay more than experienced drivers); </li><li>  the presence of a franchise (with its use, the policy will cost less); </li><li>  maintenance of the car in a guarded parking lot (in this case, the fee will be less); </li><li>  the presence of an anti-theft alarm system; </li><li>  The region in which the vehicle will be used. </li></ul><h2>  MSC (insurance company), the official website and everything related to it </h2><p>  You can find a lot of different information about a particular company or enterprise.  At the same time, you can find portals that negatively respond to organizations.  Reliable is information that is published on the official website.  So, if you decide to find information about the organization, such as, for example, the insurance company MSC, reviews and other data about it are not a secret. </p><p>  Using the official website of this organization, you can calculate online what the approximate cost of the CASCO and CTP insurance policy will be.  To do this, enter the required data in certain fields (brand, year of manufacture, age and length of service of the driver).  With an online calculation, you can make a choice in the direction of a particular insurance company.  On the Internet resources you can see the positive and negative reviews of citizens who have previously applied to this or that organization for receiving the payments they have made. </p>
