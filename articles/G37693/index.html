Admit it, haven‚Äôt you gotten tired of almost the same photos on the background of the Eiffel Tower, the Egyptian pyramids, the Brandenburg Gate or the <span>Little Mermaid monument</span> in Copenhagen?  Maybe it‚Äôs worth it to diversify your pastime, and do it without leaving your <span>native land?</span>  Mytishchi, Krasnogorsk, Volokolamsk ... The attractions located there definitely deserve attention.  Numerous architectural and natural monuments located in these modest towns can amaze even the most sophisticated traveler. </p><p>  <strong>Volokolamsk.</strong>  <strong>Sights.</strong>  <strong>general information</strong> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Volokolamsk attractions" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10809/157966.jpg" width="600"></div>  Geographically, Volokolamsk is located 124 km from the capital on the banks of the Gorodnya River, which is a full-flowing tributary of the Lama.  The city has a rather long and very interesting history, and the first mention of it is found in the annals of 1135.  Historians of that time told about a certain Volok on Lama.  This record turns the modest administrative center into one of the oldest in the entire Moscow region.

The modest town of Volok very quickly turns into the most important trading point of the region.  It was along it that merchants moving from the Moscow lands to Ryazan and vice versa moved. </p><p>  Today, the sights of Volokolamsk are massively visited by tourists.  The merit in this is not only history, but also an amazing location.  The city located on the hills and its many suburbs has a reputation for ecologically safe territory, so many residents of the capital try to come here during the holidays or summer holidays, and cozy summer villages have long been an integral part of the landscape. </p><p>  <strong>Volokolamsk.</strong>  <strong>Sights.</strong>  <strong>Architectural monuments</strong> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow region attractions" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10809/157967.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The geographical location of the city is special, which is why the buildings there are very specific.  The territory of Volokolamsk is a few hills separated from each other by ravines and streams.  In the center on a hill is the so-called earthen Kremlin with the 15th-century Resurrection Cathedral.  This church is surrounded on all sides by small one- or two-story buildings in the style of classicism of the 19th century. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Once in this place, you can visit the second important local attraction in the style of Moscow Baroque - built at the end of the 17th century Pokrovsky Church.  In the 16th century, in the eastern part of the city there was the famous Vozmitsky monastery far beyond the borders of our country, but to this day only a modest church of the Nativity of the Virgin has been preserved. </p><p>  Moscow region ... Its sights recently actually actually are constantly in the center of increased attention from tourists.  And one of such highlights is the Joseph-Volotsky Monastery, located 18 km from Volokolamsk.  Why is he so interesting?  The thing is that it can rightfully be considered one of the richest church institutions in Russia of the 16th century. </p><p>  <strong>Volokolamsk.</strong>  <strong>Sights.</strong>  <strong>Natural monuments</strong> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Attractions Volokolamsk" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10809/157968.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Travelers tired of the hustle and bustle of the capital will surely like cozy streets and shady squares of the city.  However, staying here for a long time (with the exception of cases when tourists come for purely religious reasons) is not worth it. </p><p>  Having familiarized themselves with the center, tourists are advised to go to the suburbs, namely to the nearby estate called Yaropolts or to the territory of the Assumption Monastery.  Here you can sit on park benches, organize a picnic, admire nature and watch numerous birds and insects. </p>
