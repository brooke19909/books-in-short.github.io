    <h2>  A resort built for local aristocrats </h2><p>  In the eastern part of the South American state, on the coast of the Atlantic Ocean, there is a colorful city, the name of which is translated from Spanish as "silver sea". </p><p>  Five centuries ago, F. Drake explored the territory, wanting to find fur seal colonies.  Then the Jesuit missionaries unsuccessfully tried to settle here, and only in the XIX century the most beautiful resort of Mar del Plata was founded by the owner of the meat processing factory.  The small town in which the railway line from the capital of Argentina appeared has the status of a city.  It develops due to wealthy visitors who have chosen a cozy corner at the beginning of the last century.  Inspired by the most famous works of architecture, architects build the city under the impression of them.  Luxurious villas are being built to house the rich of Argentina, and with the development of tourism, modern buildings appear. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãmar del plata" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1743057.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Soon, Mar del Plata with numerous beaches turns into a popular resort, which becomes a favorite vacation spot with aristocrats. </p><h2>  Beach resort </h2><p>  Now a tourist center with a population of about 600 thousand inhabitants takes in the high season (from December to March) up to six million vacationers, enchanted by a picturesque place. </p><p>  Of course, city beaches are always crowded.  The promenade with night bars and entertainment venues occupies more than twenty kilometers.  Almost all the beaches of the resort are municipal and arranged so that both lovers of noisy parties and lovers of a relaxing holiday will have a great time here. </p><h2>  Monk's tower </h2><p>  The picturesque resort of Mar del Plata, the attractions of which make its appearance unforgettable in the eyes of tourists, is a city where they treat history very carefully.  So, its symbol is recognized as a monk‚Äôs tower reminiscent of a medieval castle, built at the beginning of the 20th century.  Having changed several names, she has a beautiful legend, invented by a wealthy aristocrat who gave the building to the city.  The famous impresario, who often spent vacations at the resort, longed to decorate his favorite vacation spot with an architectural work in the style of an old castle.  He also came up with a story about the tragic love of a Spanish soldier and an Indian girl who committed suicide after she was married off against her will. </p><p>  Now in the tower, to which the bridge was attached, connecting the attraction with the sea, a pastry shop is open, which has become extremely fashionable in the resort. </p><h2>  Water tower </h2><p>  At the top of Stella Maris hill, another tower rises - a water tower, opened 74 years ago.  Built in the style of medieval fortresses, it is the most recognizable monument of the modern city.  The stone tower, which looks very unusual, also acts as an observation deck, where 50 people can be at the same time.  At a height of 88 meters, tourists who visited the city of Mar del Plata, climb either on foot, overcoming the stairs, or on the elevator built into the structure.  Part of the resort‚Äôs water system stores underground a tank with a capacity of about 13 million liters, from where water is supplied to residential buildings. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Monument to Sea Lions </h2><p>  The former name of Mar del Plata is Loberia Grande, which translates as "the great lion."  And this is no coincidence, since a century ago a large number of marine animals frolicked on the ocean shore, a monument to which is erected on a small area of ‚Äã‚ÄãArmada Argentina. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mar del plata" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1743060.jpg" width="600"></div><em> </em>

    <p>  Two sculptural compositions made of stone depict lions with their backs turned towards the ocean.  Near the statues on pedestals, it is never deserted: tourists photograph the symbol of the resort, sightseeing groups gather here, and local residents make appointments. </p><h2>  Nature reserve </h2><p>  Tourists who want to watch amazing animals living in the wild go to the reserve, which received the status of a natural monument.  Not far from the port there is a beach where about 800 sea lions live, freely feeling themselves.  Visitors come to a unique corner to admire the pretty representatives of eared seals at close range. </p><h2>  Bridge-like house </h2><p>  In the small forest park of the resort of Mar del Plata, a local attraction is conveniently located, which is a residential building, which is made in the form of a bridge over a flowing stream.  The authors of the building that appeared in the 40s of the last century wanted to demonstrate all the possibilities of modern architecture, and a unique structure can be seen not only from the side, but also from below.  The unusual "house-bridge", in the design of which the stream perfectly fit in, eventually turned into a popular museum, and not a single tourist leaves without meeting an amazing mansion. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mar del plata argentina" class="if" height="287" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1743100.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Port El Puerto </h2><p>  In 1916, the port of El Puerto was built, turning Mar del Plata (Argentina) into a huge fishing center.  A walk along El Puerto is a fascinating journey, and tourists admire the harbor lifestyle, which has remained unchanged for a hundred years.  You can look into the old port area, see a fishing shipyard, buy antique jewelry from sunken ships in souvenir shops.  And for those who want to spend the night here, unusual hotels on the water open their doors, where instead of rooms, guests are provided with cabins. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mar del Plata Attractions" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1743087.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Argentines themselves call Mar del Plata a "happy city", welcoming millions of travelers every year.  The natural charm, mild climate, high level of service and interesting monuments cause an irresistible desire to visit here again to experience the special atmosphere of a fashionable resort. </p>
