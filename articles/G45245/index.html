People come here to bask on the white beaches and have fun in full.  The picturesque <span>island of Capri</span> in Italy is the very place where vacationers follow their weaknesses.  The luxury resort is famous for its highly developed tourist infrastructure.  This is a miniature island, the population of which does not exceed 13 thousand inhabitants, but at the height of the season the number of guests increases hundreds of times, and the narrow streets are instantly filled with a cheerful audience. </p><h2>  Island Description </h2><p>  Formed on the calcareous rock that gave Capri a mountainous relief, the Italian resort of Capri is located in the Tyrrhenian Sea, in the south of the Gulf of Naples, 36 kilometers from Naples.  The coastline is indented with bays, grottoes and reefs, and the virgin beauty of the island for several centuries has been improved by a man who planted citruses, grapes and olives here.  The earthly paradise, which became a tourist Mecca, was loved by Roman rulers, and it is no coincidence that the emperor Augustus turned it into his private possession, and the valiant commander Tiberius built a villa on which his last years of his life passed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotels on capri italy" class="if" height="281" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1860765.jpg" width="600"></div>

In addition, it has a beneficial effect on the respiratory system, and the absence of rain brings here people suffering from lung diseases.  The resort, bathed in sunshine year-round, keeps a wonderful collection of attractions that you need to talk about. </p><h2>  Two communities in the resort </h2><p>  There are only two cities on the island - Capri, where Maxim Gorky once lived, and Anacapri.  The first is often chosen by young people who love noisy parties and shoppers.  This is a real tourist center with shops, restaurants and hotels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="capri island italy photo reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1860772.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  And the second community, more like a village than a city, is preferred by older people who prefer a relaxing holiday.  Small settlements are connected by a Phoenician staircase carved in a rock in ancient times.  Its length is more than one and a half kilometers, and the rise takes at least an hour.  Tourists who visit Anacapri, always get by cable car to the highest point of the resort - Mount Solaro, from where the fantastically beautiful landscapes of the island of Capri (Italy) open. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What to see at a prestigious resort? </h2><p>  A miniature islet, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich does not exceed 10 km <sup>2</sup> , can be circumvented along and across during your stay on it.  But despite this, it is rich in historical monuments.  The many-faced island of Capri (Italy), whose attractions attract tourists from all over the world, boasts unique buildings from ancient times: these are the ancient baths of Tiberius and the wonderful villa of Jovis, located on Mount Monte Tiberio. </p><h2>  Blue grotto </h2><p>  Of course, the main attraction of the majestic island of Capri in Italy is nature, and the miraculous masterpieces of the resort are of great interest to holidaymakers who celebrate the wonderfully transparent sea, the sandy bottom of which can be seen at a depth of ten meters.  One of the most popular tourist sites is the Blue Grotto, named after the color of sea water.  It is impossible to get into the storm, therefore, all excursions are made exclusively in calm sunny weather.  The unofficial symbol of the Italian pearl is a beautiful cave located on the very <span>shore of the sea.</span>  Ancient legends say that it was this grotto that was chosen by the sirens, which the courageous Odysseus was so afraid of. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="capri italy island" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1860738.jpg" width="600"></div>

The mysterious limestone reefs of Faraglioni protrude from the depths of the sea and are a unique element of the island landscape.  Creative people who contemplate unusual beauty have been drawing inspiration here for several centuries. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="capri island italy photo" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1860749.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Stone colosses more than 100 meters high by gigantic obelisks rise above the sea, and in one of them wind, water and time have carved a stone arch through which tourist boats will surely sail.  There is a belief that at this moment it is necessary to make a wish, and it will certainly come true.  In addition, if the lovers kiss, they will always be together.  And those who do not believe in signs take amazing photos. </p><h2>  Where to stay? </h2><p>  It must be warned that there are no budget hotels on the island of Capri (Italy).  The tourist center of world significance is an elite vacation spot, and legends go about the high level of service at the prestigious resort.  Some hotels are open only in summer, while others are open year-round. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="capri island italy reviews" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1860754.jpg" width="600"></div>

There is no bad weather, eternal fuss, and it is not for nothing that the paradise is a synonym for peace and harmony.  Tourists admit that when they see the stunning scenery, they are breathtaking.  On the world famous island of Capri in Italy (photos and reviews of vacationers confirm this), I want to return again and again, discovering something new each time. </p>
