Collection series "DeAgostini": assembly of a radio-controlled tank</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Collecting large-scale replica models of modern weapons and military equipment is a hobby to which thousands of citizens of our country and the whole world devote their free time with great pleasure. </p><p>  In recent years, there has been a trend when bench models are increasingly preferred full-fledged ones that have the ability to move.  In this series, radio-controlled products rightfully occupy leading positions. </p><h2>  Novelty of the Russian market </h2><p>  The DeAgostini group in Russia implemented a project that aroused quite predictable interest among fans of armored vehicles.  Now they have the opportunity to become the owner of such a product as a radio-controlled model of the T-72 tank.  An employee of the design bureau UVZ, which produces real tanks of the mentioned model, took part in its development. </p>

    <p>  Moreover, the publisher's approach to resolving the issue is unique in its own way.  Anyone who wants to get a high-quality copy on a scale of 1:16 does not acquire at the same time the entire set of parts from which the T-72 tank itself collects (the model is able to move in any direction, obeying the commands of the control panel), as was previously practiced. </p><p>  The parts necessary for assembly, instructions for creating one or another assembly go on sale weekly complete with a magazine.  In addition to materials directly related to technology and installation, the Tank T-72 magazine (model 1:16) contains materials on the history of the development of armored vehicles in the USSR and Russia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where and when can I purchase a magazine? </h2><p>  Magazines are sold at kiosks of Soyuzpechat and AiF in almost every locality in Russia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="guided model of the T-72 tank" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39080/1322571.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The first issue was released on 05/09/2015, and was dedicated to the celebration of the 70th anniversary of Victory in the Great Patriotic War.  In addition to the first set of parts for assembly, a DVD is included with the magazine.  It is planned that a complete set of parts so that the controlled model of the T-72 tank is fully assembled will be available in 65 issues of the magazine. </p><p>  The recommended cost of the first issue is 99 rubles.  The latter two will cost the buyer as much as 799 rubles.  This is due to the fact that, together with the numbers, components for assembling the radio control arrive. </p><p>  The publishers took into account the likelihood that some of the modelers may find themselves in a situation where the magazine issue containing the details from which the radio-controlled model of the T-72 tank is assembled cannot be obtained.  In this case, it can be ordered directly from the manufacturer (detailed information is in the magazine and on the official website of the company). </p><h2>  What does the modeler get? </h2><p>  Each purchase will contain a magazine and a set of parts.  After completion of installation and debugging, you will receive a T-72 tank, the model of which has the following dimensions: 420.0 * 214.5 * 142.5 (mm) and weighs 3,700 g. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tank model T-72 DeAgostini" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39080/1322569.jpg"></div>

The tower is metal-plastic.  It is important that the tracked tracks are made of metal, which allows the model to move on almost any soil.  Support tracks, drive wheel and sloth - metal.  All caps are made of plastic. </p><p>  The prefabricated model of the T-72 tank is equipped with an armed tankman figure made on a similar scale.  A significant advantage of the model, providing a smooth ride and a sufficiently high cross, is a working autonomous suspension of the support tracks. </p><p>  The kit will not include a remote control and a headset that allows you to control the model using a tablet or phone (camera and Wi-Fi). </p>

    <h2>  What can this model do? </h2><p>  The T-72 tank, the model of which can be obtained as a result of the complete completion of assembly work, is capable of: </p><ul><li>  conduct a ‚Äúreal‚Äù battle using infrared sensors; </li><li>  move forward and backward; </li><li>  turn in both directions; </li><li>  unfold in place; </li><li>  raise and lower the gun barrel; </li><li>  emit ‚Äúexhaust fumes‚Äù from a running engine; </li><li>  hatches (both tower and driver) open. </li></ul><p>  The prefabricated model of the T-72 "DeAgostini" tank can be controlled using a special remote control included in the model kit from a computer or smartphone. </p><h2>  Why is it worth choosing the T-72 model? </h2><p>  This tank is rightfully considered a cult machine, which marked a new stage in the development of domestic production of heavy equipment.  The T-72 Ural is a second-generation MBT.  It was adopted by the USSR Armed Forces in 1973 and was mass-produced up to 1992 at two Ural tank factories (in Nizhny Tagil and Chelyabinsk). </p><p>  During this time, about 30 thousand tanks were produced. </p>

    <p>  Licensed production of the tank was established in 4 states: Czechoslovakia, Poland, Iraq and India.  Versions produced outside the USSR had a modification of the T-72M. </p><p>  The prefabricated model of the T-72 tank was made in its original modification, corresponding to the 1973 model.  During the serial production of the tank was made in 19 versions.  The possibility of arming it with four different models of tank guns from 120 to 130 mm was considered.  All issues related to the refinement and modernization of the tank during its operation are discussed in detail in the magazines Tank T-72, a model of which can be assembled if desired by any modeler who bought all the numbers. </p>

    <p>  In addition, each issue has an article devoted to the development of tank building in the USSR, which discusses the creation of the most significant models (T-26, BT, T-34, KV, IS, etc.) </p><h2>  T-72 in the service of the Russian Armed Forces </h2><p>  The Russian army is currently armed with a modification of the T-72B3 tank, the production of which began in 2011, and the first production vehicles entered the army in 2012.  The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation decided to curtail the production of the T-90 Vladimir tank and to abandon the modernization of the existing T-80 tanks in favor of improving the existing T-72 to the T-72B3 level.  This made it possible to obtain tanks of comparable quality at lower costs.  Moreover, the decision was made taking into account the design work already underway at that time to create the T-14 Armata. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tank T-72 model" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39080/1322572.jpg"></div>

    <p>  To participate in the international tank biathlon, the car was upgraded to the T-72BM3 type.  This version received a high-power engine (1130 hp), a panoramic thermal imager at the commander‚Äôs workplace, the automatic transmission system and the SUR with speech output of information on the occurrence of malfunctions. </p><h2>  T-72 tank today: global importance </h2><p>  This tank is in service with many states of the world.  These are the former countries participating in the Warsaw Pact, Iraq, India, Angola, Algeria, Iran and a number of other states. </p><p>  The machine has been repeatedly tested by real hostilities and has earned high praise in the world.  This is due to its ability to effectively withstand the latest weapons and military equipment manufactured in NATO countries (USA, Germany, France). </p><p>  Currently, T-72 tanks are actively used in Syria and take part in painful operations in various hot spots around the world. </p>
