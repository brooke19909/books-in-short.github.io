In addition, if you place in your room a baby under two years old in a crib or a child under eleven years old on existing sleeping places in the room, you will not have to pay anything extra.  For staying in your room, a child over 11 years old or an adult in an extra bed will have to pay 70% of the cost of accommodation per night.  The need to provide such a service must be notified in advance to the White City Resort 5 * administration and wait for confirmation from it.  Also note that in each room only one can be accommodated - either a crib or an extra bed. </p><h2>  Accommodation with pets </h2><p>  This point should be paid close attention to those people who prefer to go on vacation together in the company of their four-legged pets.
