    <p>  Ownership of citizens.  Concept. </p><p>  The right of ownership is a set of rules that govern relations for the exercise of the right to own, use and dispose of property. </p><p>  The right to own ownership is the ability of the owner to actually own the property, consider it his own, legally secured legal possibility of economic dominance over the property. </p><p>  The right to use is a legally secured opportunity to extract useful properties from used property. </p><p>  The right to dispose is the ability of the owner to perform legally significant actions with the property (to give, sell, change, etc.). </p>

    <p>  Ownership of citizens.  Content. </p><p>  The owner of the property has the right, at his will, to perform any actions with him that do not contradict the normative acts and do not violate the rights, legitimate interests of other persons.  The owner may derive any benefits from the property, may not use it, or may even damage or destroy it.  The right of ownership can be expressed in several forms: private, state and municipal. </p><p>  An independent type of private <span>form of ownership</span> is the right of ownership of citizens.  A citizen is the private owner of his property.  A citizen can use the property assigned to them, both for personal consumption and for entrepreneurial activity, which is aimed at extracting property benefits.  Citizens may own any <span>objects (property),</span> with the exception of those withdrawn from circulation and limited in circulation.  However, any restrictions in quantity are usually absent.  The property right of citizens applies to both movable (table, sofa, TV, computer, car, etc.) and real estate (cottage, house, apartment, etc.) property.  In this case, immovable property and some movable property must have a document confirming the right of ownership.  On the basis of this document in the subsequent property, you can dispose of, receive any insurance payments, or, if necessary, confirm the ownership.  Often, a document that confirms the ownership of existing real estate must be <span>notarized.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The main document regulating the ownership of citizens is the Civil Code.  Any disputes arising regarding property rights are resolved in accordance with this regulatory legal act.  If they (disputes) cannot be settled on their own, there is the opportunity to file a lawsuit in civil court.  In case of theft of your property, you can contact the <span>criminal prosecution</span> authority <span>.</span> </p><p>  Forms in which <span>private property of</span> citizens appears: </p><p>  1. property that is formed on the basis of labor as an employee; </p><p>  2. property that is formed as a result of economic activity (own) and not aimed at making a profit; </p><p>  3. property, which is formed as a result of entrepreneurship, on the basis of their own labor; </p><p>  4. property, which is formed as a result of entrepreneurship, on the basis of attracting wage labor. </p><p>  Ownership of citizens.  Methods of education: </p><p>  1) General social: payments and benefits from public funds, payments from charitable foundations, <span>humanitarian aid</span> , etc. </p><p>  2) General civil: gift, inheritance, interest on capital, etc. </p><p>  The ownership right of individuals is one of the most important institutions in our life, since each of us owns movable, and for many, real estate.  Protecting property rights is one of the most important tasks facing the state. </p>
