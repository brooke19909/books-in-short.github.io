Every year there are several thousand residents of the CIS countries and the Russian Federation.  All of them go to Cyprus for a pleasant experience, a beautiful tan, and in general - for a great vacation. </p><p>  The island has a huge number of resort hotels that offer chic living conditions and excellent service.  One of them is Royal Blue Hotel and Spa 4 *, which is located in a village called Paphos. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  As tourists note in their comments, this hotel is a great place to relax together with your loved one or even the whole family - the conditions here are provided for any category of guests. </p><p>  Royal Blue Hotel and Spa 4 * (Paphos) was built relatively recently - in 2010.  From its very foundation, it has a fairly modern look; a beautiful garden has been planted on its territory, in which only tropical plants, outlandish for the Russian tourist, grow.  Throughout the entire period of existence of the resting place on its territory, various kinds of reconstruction were carried out and updates were made.  One of the last was produced in 2013.  At the moment, the total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel is almost 19.5 thousand square meters, which is quite a lot.  This area houses its large two-story building and several types of outdoor entertainment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="royal blue hotel and spa 4" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2060591.jpg"></div>
