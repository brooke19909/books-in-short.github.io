Attractions with a description of this city will simply amaze you.  Let's look at them. </p><h2>  St. Catherine's Cathedral </h2><p>  The history of this landmark of Sudogda begins in the 19th century.  In 1806, many buildings were destroyed here due to a fire, including the St. Nicholas Church.  Private donations began the construction of a new one.  In 1814, the temple was consecrated in honor of the great martyr Catherine. </p><p>  In 1838, a terrible fire again visited these lands, because of which the Catherine Cathedral was badly damaged.  Its restoration was carried out in several stages over ten years.  In 1853 and 1871, work was carried out to expand the aisles of the cathedral.  In 1875, the reconstruction of the main part of the temple began.  The repair was completed in 1891.  This one of the best <span>attractions in</span> Sudogda was one of the largest temples in the entire province.  Two more churches were assigned to it. </p>

    <p>  In 1930, the cathedral was closed, according to the official version, at the request of the workers.  A grain warehouse was made in the building.  In 1959, the main part of the temple was blown up and dismantled, and the rest was given under the House of Culture. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1990, the building was returned to the Vladimir-Suzdal diocese.  Restoration work began only in 1999.  The Catherine Cathedral was restored for more than ten years.  In 2011, a brick fence was built around the temple.  In 2013, the cathedral was consecrated. </p><h2>  Transfiguration Monastery </h2><p>  This attraction Sudogda <span>Vladimir region</span> is located in a place of amazing beauty - Spas-Kupalishche.  Here the Sudogda and Klyazma rivers merge together.  There is a legend that Vladimir Prince Andrei Bogolyubsky loved to hunt in these places.  In memory of Yuri Dolgoruky, his father, who died in 1157, he built a number of churches on the right bank <span>of the Klyazma River</span> . </p><p>  Also, a large number of legends are associated with the settlement.  For example, after <span>taking Kazan</span> on the way to Moscow, Ivan the Terrible allegedly stayed here.  Bathing, he began to sink and miraculously escaped, because of which he built the Church of the Transfiguration of the Lord here. </p>

    <p>  The first written records of this attraction of Sudogda date back to 1628.  The books of 1663 also speak of the creation of a new temple.  The church itself was built in 1763.  It stood for more than a century, but in 1869 it was disassembled. </p><p>  In the same year, construction began on a new church, consecrated in 1881.  In 2001, a monastery monastery was created with him.  For several years, a whole complex was built, including a cell building, a representative house and outbuildings.  In 2012, it became the Transfiguration Convent. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Dyukinsky quarries </h2><p>  This attraction of Sudogda is located on the territory of the Dyukinsky nature reserve, established in 2003.  An indelible impression on tourists makes a rocky relief of these places.  It was formed thanks to many years of mining activity.  It mined dolomite, limestone and other rocks used in construction, metallurgy and other industries. </p>

    <h2>  Khrapovitsky Manor </h2><p>  The palace and park complex is another attraction of Sudogda.  The ensemble consists of an eclectic castle, a large number of various buildings and a garden and park zone, which were created based on the romantic reverence of the European Middle Ages.  The heyday of the estate is associated with the name of Vladimir Semenovich Khrapovitsky.  He decided to remake the estate to his own tastes and the latest fashion.  There is a legend that the castle was built on a dispute.  During a trip to France, Khrapovitsky bet that he would build a castle in Russia that was in no way inferior to Europe. </p>

    <p>  The construction of the main palace began in June 1884.  In the works they used brick from a plant located not far from here, which was also owned by Khrapovitsky.  Even now, you can notice some bricks with the mark "VX".  From 1884 to 1889, horse, carriage and livestock yards, hunting, music and boat pavilions, the church of St. Tsarina Alexandra, a summer theater, a marina, the house of the manager and a water tower were built. </p><p>  The main manor house is an asymmetric architectural composition, which consists of two different buildings.  The first is designed in the Romanesque style, similar to the French Renaissance castles.  This is really worth a look. </p>
