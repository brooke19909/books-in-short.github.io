    <p>  Currently, there are a large number of popular and well-founded psychological theories, each of which offers a special look at human development.  In some, this process is determined by innate instincts, in others, by the social environment, which provides special incentives and their reinforcements.  But there is a concept in which these factors are combined - the heterotype and the <span>social environment.</span>  <span>This is</span> Stern's convergence <span>theory</span> . </p><p>  It is based on a series of proven statements. </p><p>  1. Man is both a biological and a social being.  Therefore, the genotype and environment are equally important in the process of development of the child. </p><p>  2. The theory of convergence proves that only due to the merging of internal data and external conditions is a complete formation of personality.  Each neoplasm is the result of this process. </p><ol></ol><p>  Convergence theory to solve the problem of the relationship of social and biological in development used a special method, which was taken from comparative studies.  This is a twin method. </p><p>  It is a fact that there are monozygotic twins (with identical heredity), as well as dizygotic twins (with different hereditary bases).  Consider the main points of application of this method in more detail. </p><p>  If children with different heredity, in the same social conditions will be formed in different ways, this means that this process is determined by heredity.  If almost the same, then, accordingly, the decisive role in it is assigned to the environment. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Similarly with monozygotic twins.  If they live in different families, but at the same time the development indicators will be the same, then this is evidence that the decisive role was played by heredity, if different, then the environment. </p><p>  The convergence theory, comparing the indicators of differences between the DZ and MZ twins developing under different and identical conditions, was able to draw a number of fundamental conclusions.  They relate to the problem of the relative importance of environmental and hereditary factors, they prove the leading role in their interaction. </p><p>  The convergence theory used the features of the formation of <span>gifted children,</span> paying great attention to the discrepancy between the environment and genetic data. </p><p>  <span>This concept</span> uses examples of convergence as evidence.  For example, for the child in the environment there is a large amount of material for the game.  But then, when and how he will do it, to a greater extent depends on the presence of a hereditary instinct for the game. </p><p>  Stern laid the <span>concept of recapitulation as the</span> basis of periodization <span>.</span>  Consequently, he relied on the fact that human development includes the obligatory repetition of all stages of the formation of ancestors in the process of evolution.  As a result, they were allocated the following steps: </p><ul><li>  From birth to six months, the child is at the "mammals" stage, so his behavior is reflexive and impulsive. </li><li>  From six months to a year, he goes to the "monkey" stage, when there is an active development of imitation and grasping. </li><li>  At the age of six years, the child is at the stage of "primitive peoples."  At this stage, speech and vertical gait appear.  The leading role in the development will be played by games and fairy tales. </li><li>  In elementary school, the child must master high ethical and social concepts, since this is the initial stage of the active formation of personality. </li><li>  At the middle level, the main attention should be paid to education and intellectual development.  This is the age of knowledge of the foundations of all sciences. </li><li>  The last period is the stage of maturity, at which the final spiritual formation of a person takes place. </li></ul>
