Her gadgets are well-deserved.  The success of the Chinese brand is explained by the fact that the company sells its products at almost cost and does not try to make money on the label.  Unlike the same Samsung.  And the brightest representative of mid-range smartphones is Xiaomi Mi 5X.  Its characteristics are such that it can easily leave behind all the other middle peasants from other manufacturers.  Apparently, that's why users like Xiaomi products so much.  In the meantime, a few words about the company itself. </p><h2>  A little bit about the company </h2><p>  This manufacturer began his life journey in 2010.  It was then that the Chinese smartphone industry enthusiasts gathered, founded the company and began developing their own firmware.  They started out of the box.  The first smartphone came out a year later - in 2011. It began to be so popular that it was dismantled in moments. </p><p>  They started talking about the company at home.  After some time, Xiaomi released another device that also won the hearts of Chinese users.  Many of them called this manufacturer the number one company.  Over time, Xiaomi management decided that it was time to enter the European and Russian markets.  Which was done.  And now, the company has pleased its fans with Xiaomi Mi 5X.  Characteristics and reviews about this device allow us to call it the first "camera phone" of the company. </p>

    <p>  The most interesting thing is that among all Chinese manufacturers, only Xiaomi did not stain itself with scandals related to industrial espionage, copying and other unseemly things.  And this cannot but rejoice.  We can say that Xiaomi is a completely original manufacturer with its own unique style. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Their devices, although slightly reminiscent of the products of well-known brands, have a unique zest.  Therefore, this company cannot be blamed for thoughtless copying.  Xiaomi is known as a manufacturer of high-quality, inexpensive and powerful smartphones.  A striking representative is the smartphone Xiaomi Mi 5X.  We will consider its characteristics later, but for now let's turn to the appearance of the new product. </p><h2>  Appearance and design </h2><p>  In front, the device resembles all devices of the middle price segment.  Most of the front panel is occupied by a large screen.  Under it are conveniently located touch navigation buttons.  Above the display there is a mesh of conversational dynamics, a front camera, light and proximity sensors, as well as an infrared port. </p><p>  But the back panel immediately recalls the appearance of the seventh iPhone.  This similarity is inspired by the fact that the dual camera is located in the same way as in the device from the "Yabloko".  But the similarity ends there.  Under the camera (only closer to the middle) is a fingerprint scanner.  There is nothing more on the rear panel.  In addition to the logo. </p><p>  The volume control buttons are located on the side faces of the gadget.  There is also a hybrid SIM card slot.  It is worth noting that the front panel is protected by an additional tempered Corning <span>Gorilla Glass</span> with a 2.5D effect.  This makes the device more respectable.  This is the look of Xiaomi Mi 5X.  Detailed characteristics of the hardware platform we will analyze a little later.  In the meantime, consider the display. </p>

    <h2>  Screen specifications </h2><p>  So, which display is installed in the Xiaomi Mi 5X.  The technical characteristics of the screen suggest that it is very worthy.  Instead of the standard IPS matrix, advanced LTPS technology is used here.  It allows you to get the same colors as in Super AMOLED displays that are used in smartphones from Samsung.  True, there is some departure in cold tones.  But this is not a big deal, since you can even out the thermal tone with the settings. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The screen has a resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels, which means Full HD.  The density is decent.  With the naked eye, it is impossible to see the pixels.  The display is anti <span>-</span> reflective <span>.</span>  <span>An oleophobic coating is</span> also present.  There is a lot of maximum brightness.  Even with bust.  In any case, in direct sunlight, the information will remain readable.  We can say that this is the best screen in the middle price segment.  Xiaomi, as always, did its best.  And now it's time to consider the hardware platform. </p>

    <h2>  Hardware platform specifications </h2><p>  Now let's move on to the performance of the Xiaomi Mi 5X hardware platform.  The hardware features are such that the gadget can launch and pull quite demanding games such as World of Tanks Blitz and Asphalt 8 without any problems. This is facilitated by Qualcomm's eight-core 64-bit processor with a clock frequency of 2 GHz.  A significant role is played by 4 GB of RAM.  For graphics responsible advanced coprocessor from Adreno. </p><p>  The shell works quickly, smoothly and clearly.  High-definition video plays seamlessly.  The built-in drive can be either 32 or 64 GB.  Those who don‚Äôt have enough can expand their memory with a Micro SD memory card up to 256 GB.  The device also has a very fast fingerprint scanner, support for LTE (4G) networks, high-speed Wi-Fi and Bluetooth transmitters, the necessary set of sensors, GPS module and noise reduction microphone.  This range of options is standard for mid-range smartphones. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Cameras (main and front) </h2><p>  And now what is the pride of <span>Xiaomi Mi 5X.</span>  The characteristics and review of the camera indicate that we have a natural ‚Äúcamera phone‚Äù.  The main one is represented by two 13-megapixel modules with a complex optical system.  Both modules are wide-angle and fast.  One of them is used to process an object that is closer, and the second is responsible for processing and blurring the background. </p><p>  I must admit that the images are excellent.  There are many manual settings that will help you feel like a real photographer.  But the most valuable thing is the ability to save photos in RAW format.  This is a sign of quality photomodules. </p><p>  In conditions of insufficient lighting, the camera does not do its job as well as we would like.  But this is enough.  In addition, the main camera can shoot video in 4K format.  What can we say about the banal Full HD?  The front camera is not so advanced.  It is equipped with a 5-megapixel module without a flash, but also wide-angle and fast.  For selfie and communication on Skype, it is quite suitable. </p>

    <h2>  Software platform </h2><p>  What about the Xiaomi Mi 5X operating system?  The characteristics of the software platform indicate that the gadget uses a fresh android with a proprietary MIUI shell.  The sixth android is already very good, but after the corresponding refinement of the Xiaomi engineers, it became even better. </p><p>  The appearance resembles both the Samsung and Apple gadgets at the same time.  But everything works quickly and clearly.  And the elements are arranged in a way that is more convenient for a particular user.  In addition, the European version of the smartphone is devoid of any additional trash, which is usually impossible to remove.  If you are the lucky owner of the Chinese version, then you have only one way out - to change the firmware to European. </p><p>  There is another advantage of this device.  Xiaomi regularly updates the OS even on relatively old gadgets.  Any user, therefore, always has the latest firmware version. </p>

    <h2>  Battery </h2><p>  And how is the new smartphone doing with autonomy?  The phone has a non-removable Li-Ion battery pack with a capacity of 3080 mAh.  It would seem that this is disastrously small for Xiaomi Mi 5X.  Features and NFC quickly ‚Äúeat‚Äù the entire charge. </p><p>  But no.  The smartphone is able to work under normal load for a full 2 ‚Äã‚Äãdays.  It affects the optimization of the operating system and hardware platform of the device.  This is a very good result for a modern smartphone.  Let's hope that Xiaomi will continue in the same vein and will not sacrifice autonomy for the sake of performance. </p>
