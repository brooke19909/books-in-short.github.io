So, of course, you can‚Äôt count on luxurious decoration of rooms, delicacies at dinner and the highest class service.  Nevertheless, our compatriots found this hotel quite worthy and acceptable for spending a vacation on the sea. </p><p>  So, as for the rooms, their tourists found it quite comfortable and well furnished.  Everything is in working condition.  There were no special complaints about cleaning: it was carried out regularly and efficiently.  True, according to vacationers, sometimes the cleaners forgot to put a sufficient number of towels, but the problem was solved very quickly after contacting the reception. </p><p>  In general, the staff left the guests a good impression.  So, everything here, from the receptionist to the reception desk to the bartender, is very sociable and welcoming people who are always happy to have the opportunity to talk and help if necessary in all matters.  However, note that in Russian it will be difficult to explain here.  Therefore, if you plan to stay at Safa Resort Aquapark 3 *, then be prepared to recall at least the school curriculum in English.  It will be ideal if you speak French (after all, this is the official language in Tunisia). </p><p>  As for the food, the opinions of the guests differed a little.  So, some tourists found the choice of dishes quite diverse, and their quality is quite acceptable.  Other vacationers did not really like the work of local chefs, but they recognize that it is impossible to stay hungry here. </p>
