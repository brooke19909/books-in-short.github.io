Only in this way will the user be able to choose for himself the method that will suit him in all respects taking into account the risk.  Let's quickly figure out <span>how to recover deleted SMS</span> on the phone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to restore sms on the phone" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28277/855997.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Application for Android </h2><p>  Let's start with the fastest and most modern approach.  It is perfect for those who have a phone based on the Android OS.  After all, it is with this operating system that you can implement a lot of convenient and useful actions. </p><p>  If you want to understand how to restore SMS on your phone (Samsung or any other), then first of all you have to download and install a special application.  It is called Android Data Recovery.  It is installed on the computer, after which the gadget is connected to your machine.  All that remains now is to click on "Start" in the program and wait a while.  You will have a phone scan and then restore the data.  As you can see, so far nothing is difficult. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The main task here is to find the appropriate application.  Indeed, without it, you will not be able to figure out how to restore SMS on the phone (Samsung or any other brand).  True, for the modern user, searching for applications on the World Wide Web is a trifle.  Thus, we are moving on to other scenarios.  Some of them are still considered quite safe.  And now we will meet them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to recover deleted sms on the phone" class="if" height="392" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28277/855996.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Backup copy </h2><p>  And here is another rather interesting and at the same time simple approach to solving our current issue.  If you are thinking about how to restore SMS on your phone, then it is quite possible to try to implement the idea using the most common <span>data backup</span> .  In truth, a special application would be best.  It will minimize data loss risks. </p><p>  In order to deal with the question posed, install SMS Backup on your phone.  After that, go to the application, and then find Restore there.  After clicking on this button, your data will be restored.  In principle, nothing complicated.  But there is one thing but. </p><p>  To use this application, the user must first make a backup copy of SMS.  Only in this way can you fully hope for a positive result.  Thus, this scenario is not suitable for those users who have just thought about how to restore SMS on the phone.  There are a number of alternative approaches for them.  Which ones?  Let's try to figure this out. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Telecommunications operator </h2><p>  Quite an interesting, though not always an effective option for the development of events is to contact your mobile operator with a request to <span>recover lost data.</span>  It is worth noting immediately the fact that this opportunity is simply fabulous.  A kind of impossible dream.  But instead of thinking how to recover deleted SMS on the phone, you can sometimes get a printout of them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to restore sms on the phone" class="if" height="341" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28277/855995.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  True, not every operator will agree to provide such a service to you.  Quite often, such a move is realized when searching for a missing person.  Yes, and with the help of the police.  So if not very accommodating employees are sitting in the nearest communication office of your telephone operator, you will have to look for workarounds.  Or come up with some believable story, because of which it is now vital for you to receive deleted messages.  If everything works, then you won‚Äôt have to think about how you can restore SMS on your phone.  But, as often happens, our method does not always work.  And then you have to look for a variety of workarounds.  Fortunately, they are still there.  And now we will try to study them. </p><h2>  With sim card </h2><p>  For example, you can use a rather difficult, but very effective scenario.  We are talking about using a special sim-reader, which will help restore data.  Not only messages, but also contacts.  In general, everything that can only be stored on the SIM card. </p><p>  In order to implement this approach, we need a sim reader, as well as a special application for data recovery.  It is put on the computer.  A "reader" with our SIM card is connected to it with a wire.  After the equipment joins and displays, you can start the data recovery program. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to recover sms on a samsung phone" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28277/855994.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As a rule, if you are thinking about how to restore SMS on your phone, then you will be offered utilities in which you will find separate buttons called "Restore".  One click and a few minutes of waiting - and you're done.  Only now you have to worry in advance about the availability of free space on the SIM card.  After all, each message occupies a certain space.  If it is not enough, then the restoration will not be fully implemented.  And this is not a particularly pleasant moment.  However, this is not so important.  We continue to study with you possible scenarios when the user decides to restore SMS from the phone. </p><h2>  Deleted Items Folder </h2><p>  Almost the last method that you can imagine regarding our current issue is to clear the folders on the Deleted phone.  In some models, it is really present.  In this situation, to be honest, you don‚Äôt have to rack your brains on our current issue for a long time. </p><p>  The thing is that we only have to visit this folder, then mark the deleted messages with a tick, and then click on the "Restore" function.  SMS will "fall into place" - some in the Inbox, and some in the Outbox.  You can enjoy the results.  True, such a move is applicable to a very small number of phones. </p><h2>  Online Services </h2><p>  In addition, modern users are increasingly starting to come across online ads that offer us data recovery services on the phone.  These are not only messages, but also contacts, as well as some saved files. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to restore sms on samsung phone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28277/855993.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In truth, this scenario is very risky.  Indeed, for the most part, the most ordinary scammers and thieves are hiding behind such offers.  Some only charge you for an unproven service and hide, while someone steals the phone that was given to them.  So try not to use the offers on the network if you want to figure out how to restore SMS on your phone. </p>
