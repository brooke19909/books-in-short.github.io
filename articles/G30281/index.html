    <h2>  What does the local coast look like? </h2><p>  Many hotels (Turkey, Antalya) have their own beaches.  The use of their equipment is usually included in the price of the permit.  But there are those where umbrellas and sunbeds are paid.  Then you need to either shell out or settle in the shade on a towel. </p><p>  The price of beach amenities is different, from five to 15 lire, depending on the degree of comfort that is provided to you.  The coastal flavor of Antalya is very diverse.  These are pebble beaches in the Liman area, and rocks in the central part of the city, and sand of different colors on the dunes in Lara.  But each of these areas in its own way like tourists.  It depends on which coast they consider suitable for relaxation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey Antalya beaches" class="if" height="255" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1812359.jpg" width="600"></div>

This beach has a free area, with litter bins and changing rooms.  There is nothing else there, but you calmly come with your towel and umbrella and spend time comfortably.  The fact is that few people go to this area of ‚Äã‚ÄãKonyaalti.  Vacationers mainly prefer the paid area of ‚Äã‚Äãthis beach - with showers, toilets and sun loungers.  Money needs to be paid for entry, but you can use all services.  There are also snack bars and bars on this beach.  It looks like the coast of the central part. </p><p>  These typical coastal zones include one of the oldest in Antalya - Mermerli beach.  Entrance here costs two dollars.  Near the port is Liman beach.  All these shores are a continuous strip of pebbles.  But it is rather small, there are no large cobblestones about which you can break your legs, as, for example, in Kemer.  Sandy beaches in Antalya are located mainly within the city.  But they can also be found in areas like Lara, as well as in Belek and Side. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sandy beaches in Antalya" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1812367.jpg" width="460"></div>

    <h2>  Most Popular </h2><p>  Young people prefer Antalya beaches such as Beach Park.  There really are a lot of trees and greenery.  This coast stretches for one and a half kilometers along the sea between the water park and the Sheraton Hotel.  It is a series of paid sites.  There are many water activities for every taste.  This skiing, for riding in spray of foam, and bananas, and cheesecakes, and catamarans, and numerous boat trips on boats in all directions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  And after sunset, the famous foam parties and discos thunder, which arrange a variety of bars on the beach.  It is also believed that the best and most fashionable alcoholic cocktails are poured here.  Admission is free, like dancing, but only if you get a drink.  Near the center there are hotel beaches popular with Europeans.  But since there is a rocky coast, almost all of them are platforms with stairs descending into the water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The best beaches of Antalya" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1812360.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Family </h2><p>  If you come with children, then you are likely to approach the beaches of Antalya, which are located in the Lara region.  It is no different from other coasts, but the entrance to the water is very gentle, and the coating itself is sandy.  Admission is free, and the rental of sun loungers and sun loungers is ten lira per day.  Rocks descend into the sea, and a fine white sand covers the space between them. </p><p>  This area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city is ten kilometers from the center.  By the way, experienced tourists are advised not to rent a sunbed and an umbrella, but to buy a deck chair and other accessories in any store.  The price will surprise you - often it is cheaper than the cost of renting such equipment for one day.  The best beaches of Antalya, from the point of view of Russian tourists, of course, are in Lara.  First of all, they are good because equipped zones are gradually turning into ‚Äúwild‚Äù areas where you can not only relax for free, but also grill something.  Moreover, the number of vacationers decreases significantly, the farther from the city coast.  Good sand, not just white, but golden in color, on the beaches of Kundu.  This is also an option for an inexpensive family vacation in Antalya. </p><h2>  The most environmentally friendly </h2><p>  Pebble beaches continue to the west of Antalya, right up to Kemer itself.  And to the east - sandy, to Alanya.  Among them there are beaches in the vicinity of the city, which are among the cleanest and most environmentally friendly.  This can be called Topcham Beach, located in the Olympos National Park area.  There are a lot of picturesque bays, amazing landscapes.  There are practically no people, the water is clean, and quiet, like in paradise.  Entrance is free, and sunbeds are available for rent. </p><p>  The beach consists of both sand and pebbles.  True, there are no bars, no discos, no water entertainment.  Children on this beach are also safe, because the entrance is smooth, and waves are rare.  The small bays of Phaselis are also good, where, in addition to excellent swimming, you can also see the ruins of the ancient Greek city on the very shore of the sea.  There, by the way, there are also small pebble beaches.  You can swim right in the museum. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Antalya Hotels with Sandy Beach" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1812372.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Antalya Hotels with Sandy Beach </h2><p>  Such hotels in the area are located only in Lara and Kunda.  These are mainly five star hotels.  The most interesting of them is Lycia World Antalya Deluxe.  It stands surrounded by mountains covered with pine forests.  To the beach from its buildings - no more than a hundred meters.  On the territory of this hotel there is a children's water park. </p><p>  The Hotel Club Sera is also good.  He invites all year round, stands in a huge green park and works on the ‚Äúultra all inclusive‚Äù system.  The beaches of Antalya are also good in the hotels of the Dolphin Deluxe and Venice Palace chain.  The first of them is located right on the shore among palm trees.  It seems as if you are not in Turkey, but somewhere in the Tropics.  ‚ÄúVenice‚Äù is a very beautiful hotel, really built in the style of the ‚ÄúAdriatic's pearl‚Äù.  It is located in the new resort of Kundu, near the sandy beach on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. </p>
