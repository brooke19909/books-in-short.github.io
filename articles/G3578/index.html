    <p>  In the client rooms, as the tourists themselves testify, a solid repair was made.  Carpet muffles steps.  The design of the rooms is dominated by pastel-beige colors (walls) and light brown structured to match the color of the wood (carpentry and floor).  The furniture is neat, new.  Bed mattresses - functional, comfortable. </p><p>  The administration does not save on vacationers' service, providing the rooms with high-quality equipment of a new generation.

    <p>  The nearby sea deserves enthusiastic feedback.  And this is not surprising, because the Mediterranean Sea is deservedly considered one of the best for recreation. </p><p>  Due to the pebbles at the entrance to the water, holidaymakers recommend using rubber slippers on the beach.  When swimming, they are useless, but when following to the water they will protect the feet from pebbles.  They are periodically brought by the sea.  In this regard, the entrance to the water from the beach pier is more convenient, however, it is suitable for adults: the depth begins immediately.

    <p>  The spacious, versatile outdoor pool is not only suitable for swimming and swimming, it can also play water polo.  Its fancifully meandering shape imitates a pond with bridges thrown over them.  However, to be precise, one pool consists of three.  The first - with slides, the second - for swimming, the third - purely sports, with tracks.  However, visually all three parts merge into a single harmonious complex. </p><p>  The pool also has a safe sector for children's swimming, the so-called paddling pool.  Well, three water slides of varying degrees of difficulty give reason to consider hotel water management as a small water park. </p><p>  The hotel complex also has an indoor pool.  It is divided into tracks and has a rectangular shape. </p><p>  The Gypsophila Holiday Village 5 * hotel (Alanya) is attractive for tourists with its modern court fitness center.

A variety of power simulators contribute to the photogenicity of the relief of their muscles. </p><p>  Vacationers at the hotel have the opportunity to occupy themselves with outdoor games: tennis, basketball, volleyball.  Fans of mini-golf are often so keen on playing on a specially equipped field that sometimes they do not reach the sea. </p><p>  The hotel complex has a full-fledged spa complex.  His services are paid, but not sky-high.  Reviews of tourists mention the hotel hammam and Finnish bath, as well as professional massage.  Resorts recommend that vacationers immediately upon arrival visit the Turkish bath to open all pores of the body, as well as make easy peeling.  After this, however, the day must be protected from direct sunlight.  However, then tourists who ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù their skin will be able to get a more harmonious and long-lasting tan, as well as improve their health. </p>

    <p>  Gypsophila Holiday Village 5 *, like most hotels, in the list of its services offers to buy sightseeing tours directly at the reception.  However, most tourists prefer to buy them from tour operators than from tour operators because of the one and a half difference in price. </p><h2>  Skin shopping </h2><p>  Tourists from Gypsophila Holiday Village 5 * HV prefer to shop, making a trip to the city of Alanya.  Here you can profitably buy leather and fur products: fur coats, jackets, coats.  The most knowledgeable shopaholics prefer not to shop in small boutiques, but in large warehouses, or in factories where the product range is maximum. </p><p>  However, Baran Club, the most popular leather goods store in Alanya, located in the city center, on Ataturk Street, is ideally suited for the mass buyer. </p><p>  Another large store, Alanya Leather World, is branded from Saddles, and prices are more affordable.  The leather shops Ponto and Havana are also attractive to tourists. </p><p>  When making purchases, a reasonable tourist, of course, should be guided by real market prices, which are: </p><ul><li>  Female sheepskin coat 1000 - 2000 $. </li><li>  Women's light jacket - $ 300. </li><li>  Demi-season men's jacket - $ 400. </li><li>  Like women's short coat - $ 600 - $ 1,000. </li><li>  Men's down jacket made of leather 750 - $ 1200. </li></ul><h2>  Gold shopping </h2><p>  As the guests of the hotel complex recommend, for buying gold it is best for the tourist to get together in a group and book a tour to Antalya shops. </p><p>  At first glance, such recommendations seem strange in the city, where gold jewelry is sold in shops at every step in the Ishiklar region.  And their price is tempting.  That's only about the quality of products the buyer will have to judge only from the words of the seller.  Another thing is if you buy gold in large specialized stores: Hadrian, Antalya Jewelery, Perge.  There, the buyer, except for the goods, receives a certificate and a guarantee for 5 years. </p><h2>  Recommendations </h2><p>  Whenever possible, tourists are advised not to move into the houses by the road and by the central alley leading to the Panorama bar, so as to be away from the traffic of cars and people‚Äôs dreams.  For families with older children, connection rooms are attractive for living (two rooms connected to one through door).  Including them in your reservation is quite simple.  When making a tour at the tour operator‚Äôs office, this type of number should be indicated in the notes of the voucher (blue form). </p><p>  The hotel‚Äôs only free internet is available in its Panorama bar.  It is convenient there, having ordered a beer, at the same time use local Wi-Fi to chat with friends and relatives via Skype and email.  In addition, the bar, especially for tourists, has four PCs connected to the Internet. </p>

    <p>  Tourists do not recommend using the services of local professional photographers.  Firstly, they do not drop the price - $ 5 per shot.  Thus, a photo shoot will cost a tourist $ 150 - $ 200.  Secondly, for photo shoots, tourists are asked to be photographed dressed in water.  Clothing, experience shows, often spoils from such "bathtubs." </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Most tourists really, really enjoy staying at Gypsophila Holiday Village 5 *.  The reviews indicate that most of them plan to come here many more times.  The club way of relaxation is fully embodied here.  A tourist, having paid a tour once, gets into a comfortable, healthy, satisfying, carefree and interesting environment.  Adults are transformed here, as if falling into childhood.  Well, the kids like the hotel complex to such an extent that they do not want to leave here. </p><p>  Some inconvenience is that the hotel staff, except for the girl Mary from the reception, understands minimally in Russian.  However, resourceful tourists who do not know either German or Turkish, and then found a way out.  Technical progress helped, they practiced to communicate perfectly with the staff through an interpreter program on the tablet. </p><p>  Every summer, many of our fellow citizens are attracted to resort Turkey.  Hotel Gypsophila Holiday Village 5 * firmly occupies a worthy position in the hotel business of the Country of Stars and Crescent.  He is deservedly liked by sophisticated Europeans who know a lot about complete and comfortable rest. </p>
