Many visitors call her services truly unique.  According to reviews, the complex is a whole village in the forest.  Rest of the guests here is not disturbed by anything.  All log cabins have a courtyard, closed from prying eyes, surrounded by a strong high fence, where virtually no extraneous sounds penetrate.  Many guests here like spacious pools, lined with beautiful tiles, with clear blue water.  In the interior, visitors note the presence of wooden tables and benches, in the territory - barrels of water (cold), as well as a beautiful barbecue area. </p><p>  In good weather, many people like to organize parties in the open air, and in bad weather they move to a house where, according to the authors of the reviews, everything is also arranged in the best way and thought out to the last detail.  The guest here can comfortably sit on a soft leather sofa and look at the fire, stirring the coals in the fireplace and breathing in the smells of dried herbs and natural wood.  You can take a steam bath in a Russian steam room with a birch or juniper broom.  Either play billiards or drink tea from a samovar - with sweets and jam.  And then the guest can climb to the 2nd floor and relax in silence, spread out on a wide soft bed.  At the same time, many recall with pleasantness and sadness childhood, time spent in the village and regret the traditional life and old ways that were lost in the modern bustle.  Visitors call the bath complex a place in which harmony settles in the soul, the body gains vivacity and health, the mind is completely disconnected from problems, and a person can safely sail in the waves of truly unearthly pleasures. </p>
