And for a quiet life of people, he is not very adapted, especially today.  In a word - a megalopolis!  And I really want to spend my free time in silence among the flowers and trees.  But don't be sad!  There is one such place.  This article will tell about him. </p><h2>  Take a look at the story </h2><p>  There is a museum-reserve in the capital of Russia - Kolomenskoye.  It is in itself a value.  After all, this is a former royal estate.  Many pages of Russian history are connected with it.  It is enough to say that there was a country residence of the great Russian princes and tsars.  Vasily the Third (1479-1533), the father of Ivan IV, and then his son, nicknamed Grozny (1530-1584), lived in Kolomenskoye.  The reformer of Russia came Peter the Great (1672-1725) and Catherine the Great (1729-796).  Also there was Alexander the First (1777-1825). </p>

It was he who built a wooden palace of extraordinary beauty!  It is a pity that it was not preserved.

    <p>  And there is a vast park.  So here we go.  And it is best to visit it in spring when nature wakes up. </p><h2>  Come in may </h2><p>  What attracts the townspeople to this place?  <span>Apple orchards</span> in <span>Kolomensky park</span> can be safely attributed to the pearl of this part of Moscow.  This is a large landing area.  Soft, emerald green grassy carpet.  Quite - thin-bore graceful trees and even with fancifully curved dark trunks.  And snow-white lace of small flowers on them.  Fairy tale! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is worth coming here more often to see this apple orchard in Kolomenskoye.  When does this luxury bloom?  Usually in the first or second decade of May.  And lasts from a week to 17 days.  Unless, of course, the weather does not spoil everything. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that the trees are planted in long rows in large areas.  And this is unusual.  After all, we are used to the fact that apple trees usually grow next to other trees or shrubs.  And there is no this solid array.  But as it turned out, just such an idea is amazing.  You walk in the garden - and he has no end-edge. </p><p>  And what aroma from this mass of blossoming flowers.  Not a single perfume store can compare with so many compositions! </p>

When?  In the last month of spring, it is still not as hot as it usually happens in Moscow in the summer.  You probably won't find quieter, nicer and more beautiful places in this noisy capital than this park.

    <h2>  Take a look at the story </h2><p>  Planting fruit trees and also berry bushes on the territory of the royal estate began around the 17th century.  They were described, by the way, in the "Census of the Palace Gardens of 1701."  It notes that the apple orchards in Kolomenskoye had a perfectly geometric layout.  Plums, cherries, and even pears were also planted.  Over 6 thousand seedlings!  There was a place for the garden. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__0-vn-module__bvu"></div><div class="vn-player" style="box-sizing: border-box; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; z-index: 0; margin: auto;"><div style="position: absolute; top: 0px; right: 0px; bottom: 0px; left: 0px; font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; text-align: center;"><iframe height="100%" width="100%" hspace="0" vspace="0" marginleft="0" marginright="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay" sandbox="allow-forms allow-same-origin allow-pointer-lock allow-scripts allow-popups allow-top-navigation" src="about:blank" style="position: relative; z-index: 1; width: 100%; height: 100%; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border: none; overflow: hidden; max-width: initial; max-height: initial;" class="vn-container-iframe"></iframe></div></div></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Kolomenskoye village supplied its products to the royal table.  Fruits and vegetables were so tasty that the imperial family after moving the capital to St. Petersburg did not want to abandon them.  And the crop was still brought from outside Moscow to the imperial court.  Apple orchards in Kolomenskoye today number 900 trees of different varieties.  Among them there are even outlandish specimens unique to Russia. </p><h2>  Six minus three </h2><p>  Earlier, in the Tsarist era, apple orchards in Kolomenskoye are six plots of land.  Today, only three have survived.  But they stand there, in their rightful historical places. </p><p>  Kazan Garden was located behind the church of the same name.  Apparently, the fruits from here were so good that they were brought to the sovereign's meal. </p>

And then, several centuries ago, and today.  Moreover, here, according to the old schemes (for 1767!), They made a reconstruction - laid neat paths.  Large flower beds appeared at their junctions.  Wonderful flowers - hyacinths, tulips, and also pansies - decorated them.  And on one they put Diana - a statue, of course.  This is the Roman goddess of flora and fauna, also hunting.  It is clear why artists with easels are often here.  Going to the apple orchard in Kolomenskoye, do not forget to take a photo next to the patroness of all living things.

    <h2>  In honor of the church </h2><p>  Ascension Park is so named due to the fact that nearby is the Ascension Cathedral.  Muscovites love to come here and lie on fragrant grass.  They read books, talk, just breathe amazingly gentle air. </p><p>  Someone looks at the site that is next door.  There is an entertaining exposition - ‚ÄúThe beekeeper‚Äôs estate with beehives‚Äù.  Or go to stare at the Pharmacy Garden.  Truly rare medicinal herbs grow here. </p><h2>  Near the village </h2><p>  The apple orchard Dyakovsky is located near another church.  In ancient times, serfs worked in it, caring for all plantings and trees.  They just lived nearby, in a small village. </p><p>  Interestingly, earlier apple orchards in Kolomenskoye were planted ... with vegetable beds!  Maybe that's why the local fruits are so special?  And grown cucumbers with neat forks of cabbage sold. </p><p>  Even in a specially created pond, the villagers began to breed fish.  A pond still exists.  Only vacationers do not know whether he is from the tsarist times, or new. </p><p>  There are usually not as many vacationers in this garden as in Voznesensky or Kazan.  From here comes the path to the very beautiful palace of Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich.  As you walk, you see glades with airy dandelions.  And they are lined with cherries on all sides.  Original. </p>

As fans of these places write, the situation here is far from prim.  For example, on perfectly clean lawns, where bright and juicy grass grows, you can walk barefoot.  And this is a great feeling!  Many take here a blanket, bags with sandwiches and sweet water.  They‚Äôll even grab a bottle of wine if they are traveling in company.  And all day they are in the "unreal" world.  Sunbathe in the sun.  They read books, magazines.  Play different games.  And they rest not only with their bodies, but also with their souls.

    <h2>  Waking fairy tale </h2><p>  Want to get into the pink sea?  So, you must certainly come to this place.  Near the palace were planted extremely beautiful apple trees.  Their flowers have petals not white, but deep pink.  There are many burgundy.  Charming beauty! </p><p>  Moreover, these fragrant flowers sit so densely on the branches that they cannot be seen because of them.  A solid picturesque wall.  Or a carpet - as you like best. </p><h2>  Metro - further on foot </h2><p>  We hope that you were inspired to travel here and you understand where the apple orchard is in Kolomenskoye.  It is definitely worth a visit. </p>
