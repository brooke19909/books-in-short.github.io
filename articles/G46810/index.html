    <h2>  pros </h2><ul><li>  From the international airport in Rhodes to the hotel, the journey is only 15 minutes.  Most vacationers positively noted the friendliness and diligence of the staff of Summer Dream Hotel 3 *.  Greece, about.  Rhodes in particular is notable for its sunny hospitality and special sympathy for Russian tourists.  This is felt by the lack of a language barrier in the hotel.  Upon arrival, guests are quickly checked in and luggage delivered to their rooms. </li><li>  Tourists about the cuisine in the restaurant of the hotel complex respond with special warmth.  Tasty dishes made with fresh products, large portions and a wide variety - such a service simply cannot leave you indifferent.  The drinks menu in the bar is also marked with a plus sign. </li><li>  It should be remembered that the hotel has the status of three stars.  Therefore, you should not count on luxury apartments and plenty of entertainment.  However, the hotel seems to be striving for more.  Yes, according to vacationers, the interior in the rooms and lobby is very modest.  But the rooms offer beautiful views of the island and the sea.  And the surrounding area gives the impression of a fabulous idyll.  And yet, guests at the hotel do not have to get bored.  This is especially true for children.  They have a playground and a special games room.  If necessary, the child can be left with the nanny. </li></ul>

    <ul><li>  The highlight of the hotel is the sunbathing terrace.  This is true for those tourists who do not want to spend energy on the road to the beach, but prefer to enjoy the Greek sun in plenty.  All the necessary accessories (glasses, cream, panama) can be purchased at local stores. </li><li>  The most remarkable thing is that on the territory of the hotel additional services cost the guests practically for nothing.  And the vouchers themselves, taking into account the diversity and level of service, are quite acceptable.  So, for example, tours for two for seven days and nights cost no more than $ 2,000 (with transfer).  Of course, the cost of tickets depends on the chosen travel agency. </li><li>  The surroundings of the hotel are also positively marked.  Amazingly picturesque nature, sights (for example, Butterfly Valley) have turned this place into an attractive resort where you want to return again and again. </li></ul><h2>  Minuses </h2><ul><li>  Summer Dream 3 * (Rhodes) is located in a secluded place, away from roads, country streets and stone houses.  Therefore, it is always quiet and serene.  According to the observations of hotel staff, tours for two are more popular for those who want to retire and enjoy each other's company, relaxing as much as possible in the lap of nature.  Young and active people, however, do not always positively evaluate such a vacation.  And the lack of clubs, discos and other noisy attractions here disappoints them.  The nearest entertainment centers are in Rhodes and Filicara.  And this is additional time for the road and transportation costs. </li><li>  Room cleaning was also negatively noted.  Its staff performs without fanaticism, satisfactorily.  But for an additional payment you can achieve absolute cleanliness. </li></ul>

    <ul><li>  Some tourists claim that air conditioning in rooms is paid.  However, prices diverge a little - 3 or 5 euros per day. </li><li>  As for nutrition, then here everyone can not please.  However, couples immediately noticed that there is no children's menu. </li><li>  More discontent caused the beach.  More precisely, its remoteness from the hotel and a pebble-sand embankment.  For a comfortable walk along the beach you need slippers.  The entrance to the sea is quite rocky, which is also not welcomed by vacationers. </li><li>  Despite the gentleness of the sun, in this part of the island it is very windy and restless at sea.  Perhaps that is why couples with small children do not seek here.  But for lovers of active marine recreation, the conditions are quite suitable. </li></ul>
