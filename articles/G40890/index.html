For lovers of cultural holidays there are a huge number of attractions.  The refined medieval architecture of the Old City, magnificent churches built in the Venetian style, the proximity of Catholic churches and Ottoman mosques, incredibly beautiful fountains - all this can be seen in Rethymno alone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gortyna hotel 3 o crete retimno" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1441427.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Once outside the city, tourists seem to fall into a completely different world - in the atmosphere of pacifying landscapes and winding paths, in fragrant vegetation.  Thirteen kilometers from Rethymnon is a small seaside village, located on the northern coast of Crete.  This is the village of Skaleta, considered an ideal place for families with children.  It was chosen by those who prefer to spend their holidays in a calm atmosphere on the beach, away from the hustle and bustle, surrounded only by the azure sea, the gentle sun and the amazing atmosphere that the wonderful island of Crete gives everyone. </p><p>  There is practically no nightlife in Skeleton.  Moreover, those who want to go shopping or just sit in a noisy bar mostly go to neighboring villages, where you can get by bus, taxi, or rented car.  In many ways, this place has gained fame thanks to its sandy beach, which stretches for almost a kilometer, as well as to numerous hotels located along the coastline.  One of them is Gortyna Hotel 3 * (Greece, Skaleta).  <span>Crete, Rethymno</span> in particular, near which this small village is located, has become quite a popular tourist destination in recent years.  Russians who prefer to spend their holidays here are choosing hotels located on the first coastline.  And one of them is Gortyna Hotel 3 *. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  general information </h2><p>  The hotel was opened in 2002.  Since then, every two years it is undergoing cosmetic repairs.  The last major renovation at Gortyna Hotel 3 * was carried out in 2015.  It has a relatively small, but well-thought-out area, whose cleanliness is taken care of by special staff from morning to evening.  Moreover, every morning all marble paths, judging by the reviews, are disinfected with a solution of chlorine. </p>

    <p>  In general, cleanliness is not the only advantage of the Gortyna Hotel 3 * (Crete).  Rethymno is a large port city where you can walk along the old streets, visit restaurants and night clubs, buy gifts.  The village is located ten minutes drive.  The city bus stop is located directly at the entrance to the territory.  Tickets can be bought either from the driver or at the hotel at the registration desk or at the nearest grocery stores.  The fare is 1.8 euros to the bus station in Rethymnon. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Hotel Gortyna Hotel 3 * (Greece), the reviews on the location of which are mostly positive, are seventy kilometers from the international airport located in Heraklion.  Transfer time is about two and a half hours, depending on the number of tourists leaving at previous stops.  This is not very convenient for those who come to the hotel with young children who have poor road tolerance.  Although many couples ignore this fact, preferring a convenient location and affordable price, at which they sell tickets to Gortyna Hotel 3 *.  O. Crete (Rethymno, Heraklion, Chania and other big and small cities of this resort) is famous for its many attractions.  You can see them by buying excursions both in the hotel itself, at the registration desk, and in one of the many offices located nearby. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  I must say that the list of services offered at this hotel is not numerous.  This is due to the fact that Gortyna Hotel 3 * (Crete) has a low category.  Nevertheless, its infrastructure is fully consistent with the three-star hotel. </p><p>  A small free parking lot, a 24-hour reception, laundry service, an internet corner, an amphitheater, a car rental desk, a tour desk, a left-luggage office and a depository safe, good animation are not all the services that are offered at Gortyna Hotel 3 * (Greece, Crete) .  Rethymnon, located a short drive away, is an excellent solution for those who prefer an active holiday.  The city is full of clubs and restaurants, there is also a water park and other entertainment venues. </p>

Those who are not satisfied with the food at the hotel can eat in one of the nearby taverns. </p><h2>  Beach Gortyna Hotel 3 * (Greece) </h2><p>  Crete (Rethymnon), reviews of which most tourists have a good stay in, is especially beautiful in early summer, when the weather is not so hot, but sunbathing and swimming is already quite comfortable.  There are not many visitors here at this time, and therefore the prices are not so high. </p><p>  Many hotels on the island are built on the first line.  Gortyna Hotel 3 * (Crete, Rethymnon) is no exception.  It is from the beach across the road.  You can reach the coast in a few minutes along the underpass, going a little to the side, or carefully through the highway.  The beach has a sand cover.  This is a good entrance to the water.  If you go a little to the left of the hotel, you can get to the wild beach, where there are much fewer people, although not very comfortable.  At the entrance to the water you need to walk about a meter on small stones, which without special shoes will be difficult to do. </p><p>  Residents of this hotel can use the beach of the five-star Creta Royal, located within walking distance.  However, for sunbeds and umbrellas here, unlike the Gortyna Hotel‚Äôs own bathing area, you will need to pay. </p><h2>  For children </h2><p>  Since this hotel is offered by tour operators as an excellent option for a family vacation, you can always hear children's laughter on its territory.  For their young clients, the Gortyna Hotel 3 * (Crete, Rethymnon), reviews about accommodation in which parents leave just enthusiastic, has a shallow pool, a playground and a small club for games in its infrastructure. </p>

Food was served in large quantities, so tourists did not go hungry, even when they arrived late.  Young children especially liked the two-color ice cream. </p>

    <p>  Most complaints about the work of staff.  In general, many have good and warm memories of Crete: its mild Mediterranean climate, beautiful unspoiled nature, rich history, hospitality of the inhabitants - all this contributes to falling in love with this island. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, the Russians who choose this hotel because of its ‚Äúhumane‚Äù price simply did not pay attention to many small flaws, compensating for all these disadvantages with a wonderful sea and beach.  During the tour you can sunbathe perfectly, swim enough in the warm Cretan Sea and generally have a good rest.  Gortyna Hotel 3 * Russians recommend to those who are not interested in the "stardom" of the hotel, although most had no problems with everyday life, except mosquitoes at night.  But this problem is solvable: you can buy or take the Raptor with you. </p><p>  In a word, there are very few of our compatriots who have remained dissatisfied with their vacation, but there are quite a lot of their opponents who intend to come here more than once.  Moreover, most tourists recommend this hotel as a good enough ‚Äútroika‚Äù at a great price. </p>
