Of course, it‚Äôs stupid to change the phone just for the reason that the system interface became boring and boring.  There is another way that allows you to give the graphic shell a "second wind" - launchers. </p><p>  There are a huge number of such programs, but today, in the framework of the review, we will tell only about the best launchers on Android, which everyone will definitely like, and also tell you how to install and change them in the system itself.  It will be interesting! </p><h2>  What is a launcher? </h2><p>  So, before telling about the best launchers, it is worth saying a few words about what it is.  After all, not everyone can know about it.  Launcher is a third-party application that replaces the standard desktop, application menu and, in some cases, individual programs, for example, a stock ‚Äúdialer‚Äù or a contact book. </p><p>  A huge plus of launchers lies in the fact that many of them have support for a huge number of additional themes, with the help of which icons, fonts, wallpapers, sometimes even sounds are changed. </p><h2>  Installation </h2><p>  Now, in just a few sentences, we will talk about how to install the launcher on Android.  In fact, everything is very, very simple here.  If your phone has a Google Play application store, you can download the launcher directly through it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="launcher installation" class="if uuid-2606249" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2606249.jpg"></div><p>  If for some reason there is no store, you will have to search the installation file on the Internet, download it to your phone, and then install it manually, simply by clicking on it and following the next steps. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to change? </h2><p>  Well, in the end, a little about how to change the launcher on the "Android".  After the application is installed, its shortcut will appear in the menu or on the desktop.  You must click on it to start the launcher.  At the first start, it will immediately be offered to replace the standard launcher with a third-party one, for this it is enough to follow the instructions of the application. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="launcher replacement" class="if uuid-2606246" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2606246.jpg"></div><p>  If suddenly a proposal for a replacement did not appear automatically, then you can change the launcher yourself, through the settings of the application itself.  That's all.  Now you can proceed to the overview. </p><h2>  GO Launcher EX </h2><p>  The first launcher to be discussed is the famous Go Launcher.  A similar application has been located on the Google Play for a long time and has over 100 million installations at its disposal.  The application will delight users with the huge availability of themes, speed, beautiful design and other amenities. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  After launching the launcher, the first thing that catches your eye is a nice interface and high speed.  Also very pleasantly surprised is the effect of turning the screens, which is made in 3D style.  The effect of turning over, by the way, can be changed.  To do this, a separate icon is displayed on the desktop.  It is noteworthy that when choosing an effect, you can immediately see the flipping animation - this is very convenient. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="best go launcher ex" class="if uuid-2606250" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2606250.jpg"></div><p>  The second thing worth noting is the bottom panel with shortcuts.  In addition to the standard icons for dialers, SMS, cameras and browsers, there are a number of application icons that appear when swiping left and right.  You can configure applications in the settings of GO Launcher EX, which is also very convenient. </p><p>  The application menu also deserves a few kind words.  It has a quick search by application, you can set a password, sort by several items, combine a number of applications into folders to save space, etc. In general, there is a complete order with the menu functionality. </p><p>  Among other interesting points, it is worth noting a huge number of topics, among which there are even paid options, as well as a collection of wallpapers, widgets, including branded ones from the launcher itself and a wide range of settings.  You can change and edit literally everything: the desktop grid, the bottom application bar, notification indicators on shortcuts, icons, fonts, a screen lock and much more. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="go launcher ex launcher review" class="if uuid-2606243" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2606243.jpg"></div><p>  According to its capabilities, GO Launcher, of course, is one of the best Android launchers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Minuses </h2><p>  Alas, there were some flaws as well.  The launcher is distributed for free, but advertising, as well as banners with offers to purchase a premium version, often appear, and this is annoying.  Also, as part of the free version, a number of functions in the settings are limited.  And this is also bad.  Also upsets that when connected to the Internet, the launcher‚Äôs speed drops slightly, because the volume of incoming advertising is noticeably increasing. </p><h2>  NOVA Launcher </h2><p>  The next launcher on Android is NOVA Launcher.  This application is resorted to by all those who, for one reason or another, were not satisfied with the previous launcher, which, in general, is logical.  NOVA has a simple and nice interface, there is support for third-party themes, high speed and most importantly - there is no annoying advertising. </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  The first thing that every user sees when starting NOVA Launcher is an almost empty desktop.  It has only a search bar and a Google daddy with related applications. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="best launcher nova launcher" class="if uuid-2606247" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2606247.jpg"></div><p>  The lower dock bar includes 4 application icons that can be configured, and a menu entry button.  The application menu itself is much simpler.  Upon opening, one huge list of all installed applications is immediately visible, which is not very convenient.  There is also a search bar that helps you quickly find the right program.  The disadvantages immediately include the impossibility of creating folders for more convenient grouping. </p><p>  Launcher settings are very extensive.  Here you can change many parameters, for example, you can change the grid of the desktop, enable endless scrolling, select the animation of turning over, adjust the size of the icons, etc. The application menu also has its own settings, but for the most part they are similar to the previous parameters. </p><p>  The bottom panel on the desktop can also be modified.  In particular, it is proposed to increase or decrease the number of icons in the dock bar, select icon sizes, set the background color, and much more. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="launcher launcher review" class="if uuid-2606245" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2606245.jpg"></div><p>  Among other interesting points, it is worth noting the ability to change the appearance of the launcher using third-party themes, support for quick gestures, backing up settings, and more.  In general, due to its capabilities, speed, lack of advertising, low RAM consumption and other parameters, NOVA Launcher is considered one of the best Android launchers to date. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  As for the drawbacks of applications, here include the inaccessibility of some functions in the free version, the inability to create folders in the menu, a small number of themes and transition effects. </p><h2>  Evie launcher </h2><p>  Another very popular Android launcher application is Evie Launcher.  Although this is a relatively new application in this category, it has already managed to collect a lot of flattering reviews and get into several ratings of the ‚ÄúBest Launcher of 2017‚Äù according to some authoritative sources. </p><h2>  Application description </h2><p>  Evie is striking in its simplicity and minimalism.  The default launcher desktop is one, but you can add additional screens if necessary.  On the main "table" at the very top is a line that pleasantly surprises with its functionality.  You can not only search for words on the Internet, but also search for installed applications - this is convenient. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="best launcher evie launcher" class="if uuid-2606242" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2606242.jpg"></div><p>  The application menu is conveniently hidden and you can enter it using the swipe from the bottom of the screen up.  The menu itself is simple and looks more like a list of contacts on the phone.  Navigation can be done using both conventional paging and alphabetical navigation.  The display mode in the form of a list can be changed to the usual ‚Äútiles‚Äù. </p><p>  The launcher settings are in no way inferior to the previous options.  Here you can customize the desktop, change the grid, the size of the icons, you can turn on the dock bar and also configure it.  Separately, there is an item for changing icons, gesture support, folder management, etc. </p><p>  What can be summed up by Evie?  This is really one of the best Android launchers.  It has everything you need for comfortable use, and you don‚Äôt even want to add any additional functions.  In addition, Evie is completely free - it has no ads and absolutely all functions are unlocked. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="review launcher evie launcher" class="if uuid-2606248" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2606248.jpg"></div><h2>  Cons launcher </h2><p>  Surprisingly, to find fault with Evie is very difficult even with a great desire.  There are no pronounced shortcomings, so perhaps it can be called perfect. </p><h2>  Microsoft launcher </h2><p>  Well, in conclusion, the last one for today and one of the most beautiful launchers for Android is Microsoft Launcher.  Such an application will obviously appeal to those who appreciate a beautiful and elegant interface.  But do not think that, in addition to beauty, there is nothing more, on the contrary, the launcher has very good functionality.  However, about everything below. </p><h2>  Application features </h2><p>  Microsoft Launcher in its capabilities is something very similar to the Windows operating system.  Here you can also select ‚ÄúImage of the day‚Äù according to Bing as wallpaper.  You can customize the appearance of the current theme, like the same personalization in Windows, etc. This is great and many will surely like it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="best beautiful launcher" class="if uuid-2606251" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2606251.jpg"></div><p>  By default, the launcher creates 2 desktops.  On one there is a daddy with applications from Microsoft, on the other there is a very convenient feed, with news, a calendar, frequently used applications, etc. The ribbon can also be completely customized for you. </p><p>  As for the application menu, you can enter it through a separate button on the dock panel.  Sort and display options are changed through the settings.  There is a search bar and an index for faster access to the desired application.  <span>Folder creation is</span> supported, and this is a big plus. </p><p>  Application settings are very interesting and extensive.  In addition to changing wallpapers and themes, here you can configure folders, the desktop grid, the lower dock bar, application menu, activate notification icons, configure gestures and much more.  It is also worth noting one very useful feature that is useful for weak devices - "High Performance Mode".  With it, you can turn off visual effects, thereby increasing the speed of the launcher. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="microsoft launcher launcher review" class="if uuid-2606244" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2606244.jpg"></div><p>  The unique advantages of the program include high speed, a beautiful and user-friendly interface, wide settings, a complete lack of advertising, no paid features, company widgets and much more. </p><h2>  Disadvantages of the launcher </h2><p>  As in the previous case, this launcher has no serious minuses.  The performance is good, the interface is convenient and pleasant, there are no advertising and paid features.  The only thing for someone, perhaps, will be the lack of the ability to install third-party themes and change icons, but this is not such a big minus to refuse the wonderful and one of the best launchers on Android. </p>
