    <p>  Of course, for starters, it is important to understand the location of the Ladiko Hotel 3 * (Rhodes).  Ladiko is a small resort village on the shores of the bay of the same name, and it is here that you can spend your vacation.  Most tourists find this location very advantageous, because the beach is just a few steps away. </p><p>  In addition, the more lively tourist city of Faliraki is 3 km away - there are already large shopping centers and entertainment venues.  By the way, you can get there not only by taxi, but also by bus (if you do not like long walks).  The capital of the island, <span>Rhodes,</span> is 17 km away, which is also convenient.  And the distance to the airport is no more than 20 km, so hotel guests are spared from a long journey. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotel Ladiko Hotel 3 * (Rhodes, Ladiko, Faliraki): infrastructure description </h2>

    <p>  This is not a very large, but very comfortable hotel complex, located on a hillside, almost at the very bay.  It consists of the main two-story building, where the reception is located, as well as five small cottages where guests relax, enjoying the silence.  The courtyard of the hotel is spacious - there is a swimming pool, terraces, and even a small garden.  On the territory you can everywhere enjoy the bright colors of nature, the shade of trees and flowering shrubs. </p><p>  It is worth saying right away that the Ladiko Hotel 3 * hotel works only in season - its door is open from April to October.  It was built in 1987, but the territory has undergone various modernization several times.  The hotel meets all the requirements of a modern traveler. </p><h2>  Photo and information about the rooms on the territory of the hotel </h2>

Its room fund is represented by 42 rooms (this standard single and double rooms).  Some of them are located in the main building, while others are in more secluded cottages.  In their reviews, tourists say that the rooms are very clean and tidy.  The situation here is simple and straightforward, but the necessary furniture and appliances are at the disposal of the guests.  By the way, the rooms have balconies or private terraces where you can relax while enjoying the fresh air. </p><p>  In the summer months, all rooms have air conditioning, but in colder periods, central heating is turned on.  You can use the phone and radio, and in the evenings relax while watching an interesting movie or TV show. </p><p>  The bathroom is modest and small, but the plumbing recently completely changed to a new one.  There is a shower, a toilet, a mirror, a washbasin, a hairdryer and, of course, clean towels - they are brought every day.  Tourists respond positively to the work of the maids, since the room is really always clean and fresh. </p><h2>  Meals: can I eat at the hotel </h2>

    <p>  What in terms of a beach holiday does the Ladiko Hotel 3 * offer?  Rhodes is famous for its beautiful, rocky coast and small, cozy beaches.  To get to the bay, you just need to go down the hill - convenient steps lead to it.  The beach here is beautiful, covered with soft sand.  Practical waters are always calm, because the bay is protected from the wind - not only adult travelers have fun here, but also their kids. </p><p>  This is a public beach, but there are not always a lot of people here.  After giving a few euros, you can use the sunbed and umbrella.  Near the shore there is a cafe where you can relax from the heat and order a cool cocktail.  And tourists like to ride boats and boats, snorkel and engage in other water sports. </p><h2>  Additional services for guests </h2>

    <p>  Despite its modest size, the hotel complex may offer some additional services.  Room service, as well as staff at the reception, work around the clock, which is very convenient, because at any time you can count on help.  You can rent a small safe deposit box from the administrator, as they are not in the rooms.  Here, at the hotel, you can exchange money. </p><p>  There is a small car park on site.  By the way, in the city you can easily rent a transport with the necessary documents.  The nearest supermarkets are three kilometers away, but the hotel has its own shop where you can buy some little things, souvenirs, even some food, so you do not need to go to the center every day. </p><h2>  Hotel Ladiko Hotel 3 * (Greece, Rhodes, Ladiko): can you count on entertainment? </h2><p>  According to reviews, guests spend most of their time on the beach or in the central part of Falikari, but they return to the hotel only to eat and relax.  You should not count on special entertainments in the hotel, as it is intended primarily for a beach holiday.  However, there are terraces with sun loungers where you can sunbathe.  There is also a gym, where a professional instructor works every day.  And for young tourists a playground with swings and slides is equipped. </p>

    <p>  Entertainment can and should even be sought outside the Ladiko Hotel 3 *.  Rhodes is an island with an incredible history and a large number of attractions, so it is worth at least a little study.  At the hotel or near it you can, for example, purchase a guided tour of ancient temples and museums, visit local markets, learn more about the culture and traditions of the islanders. </p><h2>  What do travelers say? </h2><p>  What feelings do tourists have after visiting Ladiko Hotel 3 *?  Reviews about this place are for the most part positive.  The hotel really had a renovation not so long ago, so all rooms are pleased with modern amenities, freshness and cleanliness.  The rooms are simple, but inside there is everything you need for a comfortable stay, and thanks to soundproofing you can sleep in silence.  The area here is very clean and well maintained, so spending time in the shade of palm trees and cypresses is always a pleasure. </p><p>  The food is also at a high level, because the dishes are always fresh.  Despite the somewhat monotonous menu that travelers note, nobody leaves the restaurant hungry.  And in the city itself you can always find a cozy place and have lunch.  The location is very convenient, since it is easy to get from here to almost anywhere in the island.  3 km away are large supermarkets and shopping centers where you can buy the necessary food.  Advantages include the proximity of the sea, because the descent from the hill takes no more than a few minutes. </p><p>  The staff here are polite and welcoming - you can appreciate the legendary Greek hospitality yourself.  Former guests recommend the Ladiko Hotel 3 * for a relaxing, comfortable and, most importantly, budget holiday on the shores of one of the most beautiful Greek islands. </p>
