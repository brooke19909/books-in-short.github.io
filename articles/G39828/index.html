    <p>  Within the system, clients can exchange documents and information with their partners, as well as representatives of a financial organization.  Moreover, you can do all this remotely.  And the exchange process itself is carried out through a computer or mobile phone connected to the network. </p><h2>  A small historical background </h2><p>  The Client-Bank system is far from a new service.  According to preliminary data, it is precisely its financial institutions that have been providing for 6-7 years.  According to representatives of banks, the system was created to facilitate and simplify the work of customers with their accounts.  Moreover, with its help, bankers get not only the location of their current customers, but also completely new users. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where do banks get this program? </h2><p>  Most financial organizations wishing to add the services of “Client-Bank” to their existing services, try to place an order directly with the developer.  In this case, they do not need to reinvent the wheel.  It is only necessary to connect “Client-Bank” (this is not at all difficult to do) and adapt it to a specific lending institution. </p>

    <p>  Other banks are trying to make an exclusive product on their own.  In this case, they themselves create the system at their discretion.  However, as such, there are no general rules for the manufacture of such software.  The general approach of the bank’s representatives when connecting the service is not provided.  For example, in some financial institutions they do not charge for access to the service.  For others, such services are paid.  Still others offer customers monthly paid services, etc. In short, each organization has its own “Bank-Client”.  Logging in and connecting to a system most often involves the use of one-time and permanent passwords. </p><h2>  What kind of service are there? </h2><p>  “Client-Bank” can be conditionally divided into two types: </p><ul><li>  "Fat customer." </li><li>  Thin Client. </li></ul><p>  In the first case, we mean the classic version of the program, which involves the installation of a separate service on the user's workstation.  What does it mean?  In other words, the program is installed on a computer or mobile device.  All necessary data, including a variety of account statements and documents, are also stored on a PC and in the Client-Bank service.  entrance <em> </em>  the system is executed through a portable device connected to the network. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bank opening customer bank" class="if" height="404" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/1564880.jpg" width="600"></div>

The simplest among them is the option using telephone lines, a modem, or an Internet connection.  This type of system does not require constant access to <span>remote banking</span> technology (abbreviated RBS).  The thing is that initially such a program can be installed on its own database management system.  This approach helps to back up the corresponding databases and provides users with a network version of the service.  Moreover, this all happens at a high speed of processing documents, which is very convenient for accountants and large entrepreneurs. </p><p>  In the case of the “thin client,” logging in is done through an Internet browser.  At the same time, the program itself is installed on the virtual service of a credit institution, and all user data is stored on the bank’s website (in the “Personal Account” section).  In fact, this is the same Internet banking for PC or mobile banking for phones and smartphones.  However, everything in the complex is called “Bank-Client”.  Credit, sending transfers, paying bills and other financial functions become available after connecting this program. </p>

    <h2>  Otkritie Bank: Client-Bank </h2><p>  We give an example of connecting the system.  As a sample, we will choose the bank "Discovery".  To work with a financial institution program, you need to complete four simple steps: </p><ul><li>  Install and run the special Rootoken driver. </li><li>  Set up Internet Explorer browser. </li><li>  Install and connect special ActaveX components. </li><li>  To invent or implement a ready-made electronic signature. </li></ul><p>  All settings can be found on the official website of the bank ic.openbank.ru.  After completing all the above steps, you can register and log in. </p><h2>  What is the purpose of Client-Bank? </h2><p>  The main function of <em>the</em> Client-Bank system (this is a real find for legal entities) is the provision of the ability to make payments to an enterprise without a personal visit to a financial institution.  Moreover, this service makes it possible to track movements in the <span>current accounts of the</span> company.  As a rule, such responsibilities are assigned to accountants.  Using this service, they, for example, can learn about the transfer of funds from customers of the enterprise.  After the payment is completed, the organization has the right to ship the goods. </p>

    <p>  In addition, within the system, company executives or people authorized by them can receive prepared statements of accounts, find out the current exchange rate, and keep records of existing counterparties.  And also with the help of “Client-Bank” you can always keep abreast of the latest news of a financial institution, including the appearance of new products, lower interest on loans, an increase in deposit rates and various stocks. </p><h2>  What are the benefits of the program? </h2><p>  Among the main advantages of bank software are the following: </p><ul><li>  Easy to connect. </li><li>  Easy management (no additional training and work skills required). </li><li>  Ease of use (without having to visit a bank branch). </li><li>  Monitoring all account movements remotely. </li><li>  Ability to create ready-made templates for making payments. </li><li>  Getting the latest news on banking products. </li><li>  Providing information on current exchange rates (indispensable when performing exchange transactions). </li><li>  Ease of use of electronic document management. </li></ul><p>  And of course, the system is famous for its efficiency.  When using it, bank customers, including legal entities, admire the high speed of payments.  Moreover, all data is stored in a single electronic registry and does not require documentary evidence.  Since most documents have an electronic signature of the head of the organization, this equates them to real forms and eliminates the need for printing or scanning. </p>

    <p>  And finally, the system works around the clock.  This allows customers to control their accounts throughout the business day.  Moreover, the system is reliably protected.  It controls actions with one-time passwords, as well as additional electronic keys. </p><h2>  Negative moments of working with the program </h2><p>  Sometimes unpleasant situations may arise in the operation of the system.  In particular, most of them are related to the uncoordinated actions of the leaders of the enterprise and the bank.  The problem is especially acute when the system is acquired and installed independently.  Moreover, a completely different program part may operate in the bank itself.  As a result, they are not compatible, and the workflow is interrupted. </p>
