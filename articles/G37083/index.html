One bedroom apartment in Moscow: price</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Despite the fall of the national currency and the economic crisis, people continue to sell and buy real estate in the state.  For many years they have been saving money for the long-awaited apartment.  The most expensive property is considered to be in Moscow.  But here, the final price is affected by many factors. </p><h2>  The price is determined by location </h2><p>  Real estate has such a name because it cannot be moved.  As in other cities of the Russian Federation, prices for apartments in Moscow depend on the area in which they are located.  Housing with the same layout, number of storeys in different areas of the city can have completely different costs.  It is possible to purchase a luxury apartment several floors outside the capital at an affordable price.  For the same money, one-room apartments in the center will be offered. </p>

At the same time, you will have to get to the metro for at least 20 minutes by public transport.  The least prestigious area is the Moscow Ring Road.  And even cheaper, you can get your own housing if you go to the suburbs.  Many save significantly by purchasing apartments here.  It should be borne in mind that you will have to get to work for at least two hours.  Those who have their own car win.  But the daily costs of gasoline and staying in traffic jams can discourage any desire to purchase housing outside the capital.

Apartments have significantly decreased in price in areas such as Lyublino, Tekstilshchiki, Hammer and Sickle, Lianozovo, etc. These areas scare buyers not only from their remoteness from the center.  Neighbors in many cases are a decisive factor.  Many are not interested in how much an apartment in Moscow is in a remote area.  But the environment and traffic intersection are very important.  Is it worth it to buy housing in the area in which it is scary to be on the street in the dark? </p>

    <h2>  Southwest Administrative District </h2><p>  Previously, this district was divided only into sleeping areas.  A huge number of educational institutions led to the fact that people needed to build appropriate housing.  Numerous panel houses were erected.  The main peak of buildings in this district falls on the 70s of the last century.  Many homes still exist.  Therefore, the secondary real estate market is more developed here.  The cost per square meter does not exceed 180 thousand rubles.  This is affordable housing, which can afford a person with an average income. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

Today, a huge number of business-class facilities are being created here.  New sleeping areas are not built up.  Combined houses appear, in which there are both apartments and office premises.  The cost of an apartment in a new business class building on average is 19 million rubles.

The average price of an apartment in Moscow will be 5 million rubles. </p><h2>  Northwest Administrative District </h2><p>  This district, according to experts, is the most environmentally friendly.  Therefore, families with small children try to acquire housing here first of all.  It is here that the Khimki reservoir is located, next to which Muscovites prefer to relax in the warm season.

    <p>  The situation in the secondary market here is similar to other regions.  The average price of a square is 195 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Northeast District </h2><p>  This area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe capital is also quite prestigious.  How much does an apartment in Moscow cost if there is a popular shopping center "Babylon" nearby, as well as a botanical garden?  Pretty expensive.  Prices for economy class apartments do not fall below 9 million rubles.  But the cost of business-class housing starts at 14 million rubles.  For 15-16 million, you can buy a good one-bedroom apartment in an area with excellent transport interchange.  Nearby are schools and kindergartens.  A weekend can be spent as a family in one of the many entertainment centers. </p><p>  In the secondary market, prices are slightly lower.  The average cost of one square meter is 170 thousand rubles.  And the cheapest apartment, which is now for sale, has a price of 4 million rubles.  This is a one-room premise with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã22.5 square meters.  m </p><h2>  Eastern Administrative District </h2><p>  This district is the most populated in Moscow.  Here are prestigious areas such as Izmailovo and Golyanovo.  There are really old buildings, as well as new houses.  Most new buildings are in the business class.  Hence the high prices. </p><p>  The Eastern Administrative District provides an opportunity to understand how Moscow has changed over the years.  Apartments from the developer, prices for which start at 200 thousand per square meter, are located next to the original old buildings.  At the same time, prices in the secondary market do not differ significantly from new buildings.  After all, old houses have a large area and high ceilings.  The cost per square meter does not fall below 170 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Southern Administrative District </h2><p>  This area is the least prestigious in the capital.  A huge number of factories that are located in the district, significantly affected the environment.  Only a few choose housing for permanent residence in this place.  How much does an apartment in Moscow cost if the area is not popular?  Relatively inexpensive.  Even in a new building, you can purchase housing only 4.5 million rubles.  The minimum price per square meter is 110 thousand rubles.  In 2014, the Tsaritsyno-2 residential complex was erected. </p><p>  In the secondary market, things are also not in the best way.  After all, this is not a new Moscow at all.  Apartments prices have the most diverse.  But even the most expensive housing does not cost more than 5 million rubles.  And the average cost per square meter here is 160 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Southeast Administrative District </h2><p>  This area has historical value.  There are really old buildings, apartments in which are expensive.  Along with this, in the South-Eastern district there is an oil refinery, which significantly affects the environmental situation of the capital.  It‚Äôs definitely not worth buying an apartment for living with small children. </p><p>  Apartments in new buildings are much cheaper than in the secondary market.  The average price is 130 thousand rubles per square meter.  At the same time, in the secondary market, you can buy an apartment at a price of 165 thousand rubles per square. </p>
