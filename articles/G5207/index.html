The Xeno Club Mare 4 * complex is considered a country hotel and is located near the sea. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Xeno Club Mare 4 * is located in the village of Mahmutlar, 140 kilometers from Antalya Airport and 12 kilometers from Alanya itself.  The hotel was built in 2002, and in 2012 underwent a major renovation.  Therefore, we can say that the complex is quite young.  Its territory is 9000 square meters.  The hotel is a six-story building.  Until 2015, the hotel had a different name, and now it is called Xeno Club Mare (ex. Porto Azzurro) 4 *. </p>

In addition, vacationers can visit the sauna and hammam, spa, disco and evening animation programs. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel beach </h2><p>  Xeno Hotels Club Mare 4 * is located on the coast and has its own beach, which is only a few minutes walk.  The road to the shore lies through the underpass, which eliminates the need for guests to cross the track.  The beach of the complex is sand and pebble.  There are umbrellas and sunbeds on it. </p><h2>  A bit about the resort </h2><p>  As we already mentioned, Xeno Club Mare 4 * (Turkey) is located in the village of Mahmutlar.  Currently, this village is actively developing as a resort. </p><p>  In the east, Mahmutlar is adjacent to Kargicak, and in the west - with the village of Kestel.  And from the north it is covered with Taurus. </p><p>  The village is now popular as a place of economic relaxation.  On the one hand, this is the resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãAlanya, and on the other, the prices here are much lower.  Mahmutlar is experiencing a real building boom.  Every year, new housing is being built here at affordable prices.  At the same time, new hotels are opening and infrastructure is being formed.  A large number of restaurants and bars, discos and spa salons are already operating in the village. </p>

    <p>  Several times a week there is a bazaar where you can buy souvenirs, fruits, vegetables, shoes and clothes.  Large shopping centers are located near the city: Kipa, Metro, Alanyum.  Shopping lovers can visit them.  I would like to note that Mahmutlar is more likely suitable for those tourists who want to relax inexpensively and are not too picky in terms of entertainment and the beach.  The sea on the coast is clean, but entry into the water is not always good, stones and large plates are often found. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Alanya Attractions </h2><p>  Guests of Xeno Club Mare 4 * (Alanya) can see the sights of Alanya itself, which can be reached by bus.  The village of Mahmutlar itself is not rich in interesting places, so vacationers seek to visit the resort center. </p><p>  Alanya is one of the most interesting and pleasant cities in Turkey.  It does not have the fuss and noise that is inherent in large cities (such as Istanbul).  It‚Äôs just nice to walk around and sit in local cafes. </p><p>  Therefore, everyone who rests in the immediate vicinity, seek to allocate time to see the sights of the city.  In addition, there are many souvenir shops that sell a variety of pleasant things.  For lovers of shopping and designer clothes, local shops are just a real find. </p><p>  Alanya is full of historical places.  The central attraction of the city is the fortress.  It is well preserved to this day and welcomes guests in all its glory.  Inside it once worked a mint, a monastery, a church and a mosque, and there was also a winter residence of the sultan himself. </p><p>  The archaeological museum of the city is no less interesting for guests.  Turkey is an amazing country.  Excavations are never stopped on its territory and ever new historical monuments are found.  Thanks to this, the museum is annually replenished with unique exhibits.  Currently, the collection is so large that it does not fit in the building itself, and therefore part of the exhibition is in the courtyard. </p>

    <p>  In the port of Alanya you can see one of the main attractions of the city - the Kyzyl-Kule tower.  For many centuries, she defended the locals, so she became a real symbol of Alanya.  Now her image is even on the flag of the city. </p><p>  Dim Tea is a sight that not everyone knows about.  This is a very interesting place, which is often visited by the locals themselves. </p><p>  The valley of the Dim Chai river is located just between the village of Mahmutlaru and Alanya itself.  Not so long ago a dam was built here.  The reservoir is of great importance for the resort.  Swimming is prohibited, as local farms breed fish.  But from the observation deck offers a beautiful view.  In the valley itself, many cafes, restaurants and leisure complexes have been built. </p><p>  Tourists who come with children should visit the Sealanya Park.  The complex is very large, to watch it, it is better to use the "fast river" attraction.  The park has a dolphinarium that will delight children and adults with colorful and positive views. </p><p>  In Alanya, along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, there are many caves and grottoes.  Excursions to the largest of them are very interesting.  This is one of the favorite tourist attractions. </p><h2>  Xeno Hotels Club Mare 4 *: reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, I want to pay attention to the reviews of vacationers.  Can I actually book apartments in this complex and what should I expect? </p><p>  I would like to note that the hotel is quite suitable for an economical vacation.  Therefore, the list of possible places for spending your holidays can safely include Xeno Club Mare 4 *.  Hotel reviews are quite good.  Let's discuss in more detail all the nuances. </p>

    <p>  Those who are going to visit Mahmutlar for the first time would like to remind once again that the village as a resort is still developing.  It is chosen as a place of rest by those tourists who do not count on expensive holidays in fashionable hotels, and therefore you should not expect from the hotels of the town any transcendental delights and super services. </p><p>  The resort is relatively cheap due to the fact that the coast in this place is not as good as in the same Alanya.  In the sea, quite large pebbles and concrete slabs are found in some places, which not everyone likes.  With all this, an excellent promenade has already been built along the coast, along which vacationers walk in the evenings. </p><p>  According to tourists' reviews, the Xeno Hotels Club Mare 4 * hotel (Alanya) is small in itself.  It occupies only one building of the complex that once worked here.  Currently, the old hotel is closed, and a new one with a very small territory has appeared in its place. </p><p>  The indisputable advantage of the hotel complex is its location.  It is located right on the beach, and only the road and the boardwalk separate it from the beach. </p><p>  Among the reviews of vacationers there are very different opinions regarding the quality of food.  However, most of the guests still praise the menu and the variety of the buffet.  When buying a tour of the economy option, you should not expect the presence of king prawns and lobsters every day on the table.  The hotel's restaurant always serves fresh and quality food.  According to tourists, there are quite a lot of various salads, baked and pickled vegetables.  There are cream soups, there are cutlets and deliciously cooked wings.  Of meat, chicken dominates.  Fruits (2-3 types) and famous Turkish sweets are offered daily.  It‚Äôs simply not possible to stay hungry here. </p>

    <p>  Another advantage of the hotel is its staff.  These are very polite and calm people.  Of course, one cannot say that they all speak Russian, but it is quite possible to speak with the same maid.  Reception workers understand and speak Russian, so there are no problems.  There are no problems with the settlement.  Even if the room is not ready yet, you will be offered to hand over things to the left luggage office and go for breakfast. </p><p>  The hotel rooms are simple and simple.  All are in good condition.  Cleaning takes place daily, but the replacement of towels and bed linen - once every three days.  In addition, the hotel does not practice issuing beach towels.  There is no such service.  Therefore, you must bring your own from home or purchase on the spot. </p><p>  The rooms of the complex are small, but they have everything you need, including a balcony. </p><h2>  Recreation and entertainment </h2><p>  The hotel has animation, but entertainment programs are far from every day.  Therefore, tourists are advised not to pay attention to such a nuance and devote evening time to a promenade along the sea or walks through the streets of the village, which, after sunset, dress in elegant lights. </p><p>  Special attention should be paid to the beach of the hotel, which is located very close.  Sand-pebbled coast.  There are umbrellas and sunbeds on the beach, but not everyone needs them during the season.  The sea is quite clean and very warm, but sometimes there is a wave.  Tourists advise to go into the sea between the plates, however, and sometimes there are large stones at the bottom.  In general, the beach is quite normal, the same as on the entire coast. </p>

    <p>  Guests of the complex can visit the many beautiful places and attractions of Alanya, since there are no historical buildings in Mahmutlar.

Jeep safari and boat trips cause a special delight among vacationers. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  In general, the hotel makes a pretty good impression.
