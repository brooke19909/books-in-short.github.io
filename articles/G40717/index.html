The coast, or rather its parts, apply to all the above countries.  Because of this location, it is called the "enclosed" sea of ​​the Atlantic Ocean.  Its waters are slightly salted and very warm.  This factor is crucial for tourists.  It is here that many vacationers come, especially with children, since the sea is quite calm and shallow near the coastline.  An interesting fact is that there are such beaches on the coast where you need to walk a few meters until you reach a depth of 0.5 m. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sea of ​​Azov coast" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1134921.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Short description </h2><p>  The smallest body of water compared to all the others located in the Russian Federation is the Sea of ​​Azov.  The coast has a length of only 1472 kilometers.  As for the depth, the average indicator is 8 m, however there are such areas, the bottom level drops to the level of 14 m. </p><p>  The Sea of ​​Azov belongs to the basin of the Atlantic Ocean.  However, his path is quite interesting.  First, its waters pass through the <span>Black Sea, the</span> Bosphorus and the Mediterranean.  And only after that they get into the Atlantic Ocean. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Features of the Sea of ​​Azov </h2><p>  Unsalted, shallow, warm - these words ideally characterize the Sea of ​​Azov.  The coast is covered with shell rock and fine sand.  <span>Sea water</span> contains a huge amount of chemical elements, so it can be used for medicinal purposes.  Since the waves of the sea wash the sand of the coast, it also has unique properties.  Probably, many noticed that it’s enough just to lie down near the water for several hours, and the unpleasant sensations in the back and muscles pass by themselves.  The conclusion suggests itself: here everything acts on the human body as a medicine and a particularly useful remedy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="map of the coast of the Sea of ​​Azov" class="if" height="352" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1134923.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Territorial division </h2><p>  Ukraine and Russia are territorially divided into several parts of the Sea of ​​Azov.  The coast of each state and the area surrounding it are a closed zone, where ships of other countries cannot enter. </p><p>  Over the entire existence of the independent states of Russia and Ukraine, they were on friendly terms.  That is why clear boundaries of ownership of the water expanses of the sea were not established.  However, since 2014, everything has changed radically.  Now these states are at enmity with each other, therefore they are trying to maximize their positions. </p><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Flora and fauna </h2><p>  Steep limestone landslides, stone slopes - this is how the Sea of ​​Azov looks at first glance.  The coast of Ukraine, however, as well as from the Russian Federation, does not differ in dense thickets of plants.  Here you can find single bushes of elderberry, blackthorn, fern, aronnik.  Closer to water, vegetation is represented only by species resistant to salt.  This is explained quite simply: the waves, hitting the stones, pour salt water over them.  These are herbaceous plants such as mucilage and kermeka.  And already in the water you can see algae of red and green colors, water flowers. </p><p>  The animal world is also not very rich: geese, ducks, steppe waders, lapwings, red geese, mute swans, curlew, black-headed gulls and laughter.  On the beach, you can occasionally notice turtles, frogs and even crayfish. </p><p>  The underwater world of the Sea of ​​Azov holds about 80 species of fish.  The most common ones are stellate sturgeon, garfish, beluga, herring, large flounder, fisherman, mullet, tyulka, hamsa and sea mole. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  The average annual rainfall in millimeters is from 250 to 500. Since <span>the climate is</span> dry in southern Ukraine and the <span>Crimea</span> , it negatively affects the coast of the Sea of ​​Azov.  The average temperature in July is from +23 <sup></sup>  up to +30 <sup>0</sup> ;  temperature in the winter period (in January) from -2 <sup></sup>  up to +7 <sup>0</sup> C. </p><p>  The coast of Azov is characterized by cold, but short winter and warm summers.  The air temperature is evenly distributed.  The weather is pleasant for spring and autumn, in these months the thermometers show from +9 <sup></sup>  up to +13 <sup>0</sup> , and high humidity is felt in the air.  The transition from summer to winter is unsharp. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  One of the most popular holiday destinations is the Sea of ​​Azov.  The coast of Russia and Ukraine is occupied by numerous boarding houses.  Their list is truly vast.  These are towns for tourists, recreation centers, hotels, cottage houses, etc. There are also cafes and restaurants so that vacationers can eat or just have fun.  If we are talking about holidays with children, the most important thing is open modern pools with slides of various sizes, dolphinariums, amusement parks, circuses. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Azov Sea coast of Russia" class="if" height="283" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1134925.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  The main problem of the Azov coast is that almost the entire territory is polluted with waste from various enterprises.  A large number of steamboats, boats and other equipment led to pollution of the sea itself.  The presence on the coastline of numerous recreation centers leads to the fact that it is gradually turning into a landfill, especially in areas of public beaches.  Closed areas look much better.  However, for rest they will have to pay a considerable amount of money. </p><h2>  Rest on the Sea of ​​Azov </h2><p>  For those who have never been to these places, below is a map of the coast of the Sea of ​​Azov, where you can see all the cities and towns that offer cultural recreation.  And he, it is worth noting, is quite well developed here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Azov Sea coast of Ukraine" class="if" height="407" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1134910.jpg" width="600"></div>
