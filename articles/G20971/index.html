Many <span>descendants of the heirs of the</span> Russian throne still live and live in prosperous European countries.  One of these descendants is Prince George Aleksandrovich Yurievsky - an heir who did not become the emperor of Russia. </p><h2>  Emperor‚Äôs marriage </h2><p>  In the noble families there is not rarely a tradition of repeating the names of the heirs from generation to generation.  Prince George Aleksandrovich Yurievsky is a clear confirmation of such a tradition.  The first person with this name was born in 1872 in St. Petersburg.  His father was the acting emperor Alexander II, and his mother was the morganatic wife of the tsar, Princess E. M. Dolgorukaya.  Georgy Aleksandrovich Yurievsky was born out of wedlock and until 1874 had no rights and titles.  But in the middle of 1874, the tsar sent a secret decree to the Senate on conferring on children of Princess Dolgoruky Georgy and Olga the legal rights and the title of "brightest".  Later, in 1880, the marriage act of Emperor Alexander and Princess Catherine was drawn up.  This document endowed the newlywed with the title of His Grace Princess Yuryevskaya, who could later be passed on to children from this marriage.  So the daughters of <span>Princess Olga</span> and Catherine, son George received their own title and their own surname. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="georgy alexandrovich yurevsky" class="if" height="282" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1222963.jpg" width="200"></div>

After the assassination of Alexander II by the Volunteers, the Yurievsky family emigrated from Russia and settled in France.  His Grace Prince George Aleksandrovich Yuryevsky graduated with honors from Condorcet College, and received his higher education at the Sorbonne.  In 1891 he received a bachelor's degree, returned to Russia and became a naval officer.  For several years, Georgy Aleksandrovich Yurievsky served in the Baltic Fleet, and in 1908 retired due to illness. </p><p>  At the beginning of <span>1900, His</span> Serene Highness was married to Countess Zarnekau.  From this union was born the heir, the namesake of the Russian emperor, Alexander Georgievich.  Unfortunately, the century given to George turned out to be short-lived.  At the age of 41, he died in Marburg from acute jade. </p><h2>  150 years later </h2><p>  The son of George lived a long life.  The constant revolutions and the change of governments in European countries, the two world wars lost the remnants of the great fortunes of the Yurievskys - Alexander had to earn his own living.  In the end, a descendant of Emperor Alexander II chose Switzerland as his permanent residence.  In 1925, in the cathedral, he married Ursula Annemaria Beer, who, after marriage, began to bear the title of His Grace Princess Yuryevskaya.  From this marriage was born George Alexandrovich Yurievsky - great-grandson of Emperor Alexander II. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Prince George Aleksandrovich Yuryevsky" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1222965.jpg" width="399"></div>

Yurievsky was born in 1961 in Switzerland.  A descendant of royal and princely blood leads an ordinary life, has its own profession.  George Aleksandrovich Yurievsky received an excellent education, became a graduate of the Faculty of Law of the University of Zurich.  He leads several software development companies.  In addition, the great-grandson of the emperor has excellent sports training - he is a professional tennis player, has a diploma of a plunger-rescuer. </p><p>  Prince George knows the Russian language, but does not speak it perfectly.  Poor knowledge of native speech is explained by the decision of his father Alexander, who was afraid of persecution by the Soviet regime.  A strict ban on talking about modern Russia reigned in the family, but the history of the great country until 1917 was studied with all the details.  About life in Russia, about the ancestors of the Yuryevsky, little George was enthusiastically told by the mother of Ursula, His Grace Princess Yuryevskaya. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="His Serene Highness Prince George Aleksandrovich Yuryevsky" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1222758.jpg" width="341"></div>

    <p>  In 2013, His Serene Highness Prince George Aleksandrovich Yurievsky started a family.  Sylvia Trump, a resident of Germany, became his chosen one.  Before the wedding, the bride was baptized according to the Orthodox rite - she was given the Christian name Elikonida, in honor of the martyr from Thessaloniki, whose memory the Christians of the Orthodox rite celebrate on May 28. </p><p>  The marriage of this couple for many noble families was the highlight of the season.  The offspring of the most famous ruling dynasties of central and eastern Europe attended the wedding. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="His Serene Highness Prince George Aleksandrovich Yuryevsky Sylvia Trump" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1222915.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Yurievsky in Russia </h2><p>  Unlike his father, George Yurievsky was able to visit Russia.  His visit came in 1991.  He became one of the first to cross the borders of the Soviet state and witness the collapse of the USSR.  Currently, the Most Serene Prince is a regular guest on the territory of Russia.  Here he is engaged in business in the field of arts and real estate, has an apartment in St. Petersburg. </p>
