On expensive premium devices, a decrease in performance is almost not felt, because they have a powerful processor and more than enough RAM.  But not everyone can afford such gadgets, so for many this problem is more relevant than ever. </p><p>  There can be many reasons for reducing performance, but the most likely and common, as a rule, is only one - the work of third-party programs in the background.  That is, such applications are launched automatically at system startup and load the processor with RAM, thereby directly affecting the speed of the device. </p><p>  The only effective option in this case is to disable the autorun application on the "Android" and work without lags and brakes.  But not everything is so simple in this matter, as it seems at first glance, and the platform together with program developers often throw up problems. </p><h2>  Should I turn off autostart applications? </h2><p>  If you install dozens of programs on the platform daily, then there should be no problems here, in principle.  Because the platform itself must, so to speak, fight for RAM.  That is, if the gadget's performance starts to fall, the system automatically closes unused applications to stabilize the OS. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gadgetgyani.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="autostart applications on android" class="if uuid-2632151" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2632151.jpg"></div><p>  You can disable auto-start programs in Android in manual mode, but this will already be counterproductive measures, and in some cases they are simply not needed.  But it also happens that some program doesn‚Äôt want to shut itself down even by the efforts of the platform itself.  As a result, the processor is loaded, the RAM is cluttered, and the performance, together with the battery charge, tends to zero. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Features of the procedure </h2><p>  But do not turn off the autorun application on the "Android" for everyone in a row.  There are necessary exceptions, such as official applications from Google and some working anti-virus programs.  Of course, the Android platform has good protection "against a fool," and if you unknowingly try to stop system or really important processes, the system will warn you, and very persistently. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidcentral.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable unnecessary applications" class="if uuid-2632155" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2632155.jpg"></div><p>  But the sad truth suggests that a good half of the programs downloaded from the Network (usually gaming and illegal) settle in the startup and prevents the operating system from working normally.  And, as mentioned above, the only option is to simply disable the automatic launch of applications on Android.  This is exactly what we are trying to do, the benefit of tools to solve this problem is enough. </p><p>  So, we‚Äôll figure out how to turn off the autorun application on Android and make it as painless as possible for the platform itself and for the user.  Consider the main options for solving the problem and features of different versions of the OS. </p><h2>  Disabling autorun on Android 4.x.x </h2><p>  Before you turn off auto-start programs in Android, you need to find out which applications consume (and whether consume at all) the resources of the operating system.  To do this, go to the gadget settings and open the "Applications" or "Application Manager" section. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to view running applications" class="if uuid-2632153" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2632153.jpg"></div><p>  It‚Äôs worth mentioning right away that disabling the autorun of unnecessary processes in Android 4.2.2 by local means is only a temporary solution, and third-party software is required to make fundamental changes. </p><h2>  Process features </h2><p>  Next, you need to find the ‚ÄúRunning‚Äù tab and familiarize yourself with it.  ‚ÄúPlay Market‚Äù from ‚ÄúGoogle‚Äù email clients and programs with a specific Android icon should not be touched, but you need to carefully look at the rest.  Opposite each application, the amount of RAM used is displayed.  According to this indicator, it is just possible to determine the gluttony of software.  To disconnect, you must select an objectionable application and tap on ‚ÄúForce Stop‚Äù, and then answer ‚ÄúYes‚Äù or ‚ÄúOK‚Äù. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to stop applications" class="if uuid-2632157" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2632157.jpg"></div><p>  If some suspicious utility is running in the <span>background</span> , then it is also better to disable it.  Autostart of applications on Android will start after each reboot of the gadget, so the procedure will have to be repeated again and again.  But often there is no need to restart the operating room, therefore, a similar temporary solution is quite suitable for many.  As mentioned above, it will be possible to remove the startup programs in Android only with the help of third-party task managers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Disabling autorun on Android 6.x.x </h2><p>  With Marshmallow firmware, everything is not so simple.  It‚Äôs not clear why, but the developers stuck the ability to disable autorun applications on ‚ÄúAndroid 6.0.1‚Äù and in versions above, as they say, to hell with horns.  In principle, the new ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù is very good in terms of optimization, flexibility of user settings and visual component.  But the system functionality is hidden very well. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to stop applications at 6 0" class="if uuid-2632154" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2632154.jpg"></div><p>  Before disabling autorun applications on ‚ÄúAndroid 6.x.x‚Äù, you must enable developer mode.  In the menu, go to "Settings", then "Information about the device", and after that you need to click on the item "Build number" several times.  After that, the developer mode is activated and special functionality is available. </p><h2>  Features of the procedure </h2><p>  After that, you must again go to "Settings", and there will already appear the item "Developer Options".  We click on it and select the section ‚ÄúLaunched Services‚Äù.  Here, by analogy with previous generations of the Android OS, there is a list of active applications.  You can see the total operating time of the programs, their disk space and the amount of RAM. </p><p>  To turn off the process, you need to tap on the active application and select the "Turn off" item.  After which the program should close.  But this procedure, again, is a temporary solution to the problems, and after the reboot everything will be the same.  You can completely get rid of the application at startup by just deleting it or adopting specialized third-party utilities.  The most sensible representatives of the latter will be considered below. </p><h2>  Greenify </h2><p>  This is one of the most popular utilities for managing the startup of your mobile gadget.  Software can be used both with administrator rights (root), and without them.  In the first case, the application will disappear from startup once and for all, and in the second, you will have to make a couple of clicks after the gadget restarts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dailymobile.ir" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="application program" class="if uuid-2632152" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2632152.jpg"></div><p>  After installation, the utility will leave its widget on the desktop.  By clicking on it, you will be taken to the working area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe program.  To exclude unnecessary applications from the startup list, just click on the plus at the bottom of the screen and add the problem program to the list of prohibited ones.  Once with root rights, once is enough, and without them you will have to open Greenify and confirm previously performed actions. </p><p>  The program interface is simple, understandable, and even a beginner in this business will cope with it, not to mention the scorched users.  The product is distributed under a free license, but there is also a paid option with advanced functionality.  The latter is useful for advanced users, and ordinary users will have enough of the usual modifications. </p><h2>  Autostarts </h2><p>  This application allows you to get full control over startup.  Using the utility without received administrator rights is pointless, because the program will be back in place every time you reboot. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="program for working with startup" class="if uuid-2632156" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2632156.jpg"></div><p>  Software neatly and with due meticulousness puts everything on the shelves.  In the menu you can configure what will be launched before, during and after loading the operating system.  All processes are decrypted as detailed as possible, which makes it possible to determine their interference with the platform with an accuracy of byte. </p><p>  The interface is simple, and the tools are intuitive.  In addition, the application is fully Russified, so no problems should arise.  Here, in the menu, you can free up memory on internal and external drives, as well as play with the battery consumption settings.  The last moment allows you to turn off a good half of the system processes at low charge and return them at high.  Thresholds are easily adjustable in percentage terms. </p><p>  The product has both paid and free modifications, but, as in the case of Greenify, the first is for ordinary users completely unnecessarily. </p>
