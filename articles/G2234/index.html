    <h2>  Knitting pattern </h2><p>  So, we collect 80 loops on the knitting needles (this is about 1.5 years old) and we knit with a 2x2 elastic band in a circle of about 4 cm. Next, go to the <span>front surface.</span>  Do not forget in the last row of the elastic band to either change the needles to a larger size, or make an increase from 5 to 10 loops. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  We continue to knit the front surface for another 12-15 cm. After this, it is necessary to start making reductions.  In eight places, through an equal number of loops we knit two together the front.  We make such reductions in each row.  When 8 loops remain on the knitting needles, thread the thread through them and tighten.  The ends are seasoned on the wrong side. </p><p>  That's basically it.  Spring hat for a boy knitting with needles.  Having spent a minimum of time and yarn, you have updated your baby‚Äôs wardrobe.  As a decor for hats for a boy, you can use a large button, as in the photo. </p><h2>  Simple hats decor option </h2><p>  If you want to connect something unusual for your crumbs, but you are a beginner needlewoman, and you cannot afford complex models, do not despair.  There is a way out.  <span>Knitted hat</span> for knitting with needles for a boy, the description of which is described above, is very simple in execution, but if you use unusual decor, it will easily turn into an original and stylish spring model. </p>

And from the black thread we make pompons - two of the same size and one smaller.  Of those that are larger, we make the ears of the cap, and of the small - the nose.  Eyes can be made from the remnants of dense fabric or crochet these details.  We fix all the elements on the header and get the panda's face.  The photo above shows how to arrange all the details.  Surely such a hat your baby will wear with great pleasure.

Reductions begin similarly to the previous method, but are performed in four places and every two rows.  After two loops remain on the knitting needles, they are threaded one into the other and tightened.  To finish the design of the cap, you need to make a large pompom and fix it on the end of the cap.  Knitting such a model is better from multi-colored yarn to get a strip.  The photo shows an example of such a hat, made in pastel colors.  But you can make it more visible and vibrant.

    <p>  We start knitting, as in the first embodiment, with gum.  But, unlike the previous options, instead of the front surface, after the gum, you need to complete 4-5 rows of a shawl pattern.  If you knit on two knitting needles, then just do all the loops face, and if on circular, then purl. </p><p>  After you have made several rows of garter stitches, we add (10-15 loops) and knit the elastic again, but only now it will be a 1x1 option. </p><p>  In this model, there is no need to perform downsizing.  Having knitted the cap to the required height, we simply thread the thread through the loops and tighten them.  The ends are seasoned on the wrong side. </p><p>  Now you need to make two pompons and fix them on the sides of the cap, as in the photo.  You must admit that all this is not difficult at all.  An original and comfortable hat knitting for a boy knitted. </p><h2>  Winter hat option </h2><p>  And now we‚Äôll look at how a more complex hat for knitting a boy knits.  The scheme of such a model will be slightly different from previous options.  It can be worn both in winter and spring.  Everything will depend on what yarn you will use for knitting hats.  You will need threads of two colors, knitting needles and two buttons. </p>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hat with earflaps for a boy with knitting needles" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17517/380066.jpg?1398497172995" width="340"></div>  Knitting begins with a set of 80-100 stitches.  Focus on your child‚Äôs head circumference, yarn and knitting needles.  Further knitting continues with facial loops.  After fifteen centimeters, we begin to make reductions so that the cap fits tightly around the head.  They are performed in the same way as in the first described embodiment.  Now we proceed to the formation of the ears and the visor of the cap. 
      <br>

      <p></p>
    <p>  To do this, on the lower edge of the product, you need to mark the place where the ears of the hats will be located, and raise the loops.  Knitting is performed with a garter stitch for 10-12 cm, after which we knit two loops together in each row three times from each edge and close the rest.  We knit the second eye in the same way. </p><p>  The visor fits in the same way.  Just do not need to make reductions at the end to round its shape.  Please note that the visor is knitted from a yarn of a different color.  So that he holds well and does not fall into his eyes, on the surface of the cap he is fixed with buttons. </p><p>  If there is such a need, you can attach ties to the ears.  It can be laces crocheted or bought in a store. </p><p>  This is how knitting hat with earflaps for a boy fits.  Good luck and inspiration! </p>
