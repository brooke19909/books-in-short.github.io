    <h2>  Phuong Nhung Hotel 2 *: tourist reviews </h2><p>  As you know, a hotel becomes a second home for travelers on a vacation abroad.  And even if you consider yourself an unassuming person, you probably want to be able to return every day to a cleanly cleaned and comfortable room that has everything you need.  That is why it is important not to make a mistake in choosing a hotel.  Invaluable help in this, according to many tourists, is provided by studying the reviews of those people who have already stayed in the place you are interested in.  After all, they share their impressions based on their own experience.  We invite you today to find out what opinion has developed among our compatriots who lived in Phuong Nhung Hotel 2 * during their vacation in Vietnam.  Just note that almost all reviews are positive.  This can be confirmed by the hotel rating based on guest ratings.  So, out of the five maximum possible points, tourists awarded him 4.6, which can be called a very good result. </p><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  In general, tourists were satisfied with the apartments of this hotel.  However, many guests warn that in some of the rooms there are no windows facing the street, but only windows overlooking the corridor.  If this is critical for you, then when booking the apartments, check if they have a full window.  However, for many tourists this was not a problem, since they spent a minimum of time in the room.  The rest of the guests claim that the apartments have everything you need for your vacation - a spacious wardrobe, a TV with one Russian-language channel, comfortable beds, a minibar, a bathroom, a hairdryer and air conditioning.  The guests liked that the cost of drinks from the minibar is almost the same as in stores.  Despite the fact that this is just a two-star hotel, guests are offered a full range of personal hygiene products: toilet paper, liquid soap, shower gel, shampoo, toothpaste, toothbrushes, cotton buds, etc. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>
