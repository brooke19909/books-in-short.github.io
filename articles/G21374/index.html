It is these issues that I immediately begin to attack, as soon as the decision is made to make this accessory on my own.  It should be noted that this process is not at all complicated, but very exciting, interesting and positive. </p><p>  So, first of all, you need to determine the type of strap.  It will be thin or wide, matte or glossy, with stones, chains or a brooch.  Based on your own wishes, you should choose a material.  It can be leather or suede, denim, satin or <span>lace fabric,</span> as well as all kinds of laces, ribbons and even elastic bands. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Ribbon Belts </h2><p>  Tape belts look very original.

    <p>  To begin with, you should measure the waist and add another 10 cm to this measure - this will be the length of the belt.  Next, one edge of the ribbon is turned inside out and a neat seam is laid, on the other hand, two half rings are sewn for fastening the belt.  So that such a strap does not seem boring, it can be embroidered with stones, beads or just take a sequin ribbon.  Ribbon straps with neatly laid bows also look perfect.  A good option would be a belt of ribbons or cords of contrasting colors, braided with a tie from a wide ribbon, tied in a bow with long tails. </p><h2>  Cloth Belts </h2><p>  Different fabric belts look original.  How to make a belt from fabric?  Yes, it‚Äôs very simple, and it‚Äôs not at all necessary to run to the store behind a piece of matter.  You can revise your old things and give them a new life.  For such a belt, you also need to measure the waist and cut a strip of fabric two times wider than the future belt plus an allowance for the seam.  Next, you will need non-woven or doubler to stabilize the material, it is glued with a hot iron, so even a beginner can cope with this task.  After a strip of fabric is folded face inward and a stitch is laid, leaving a small hole for eversion.  For such a belt, you can make a fastener on a large decorative button or on several buttons and decorate it with a brooch, beads, rhinestones or lace.  Drawstrings made of laces with beautiful tassels made of thread or beads are a good option.  If the accessory is needed very simple, without unnecessary decors, then the simplest option is how to make a belt for a skirt: a strip of fabric is sewn in such a way that its ends extend downward or have a serrated edge.  Usually, such a belt is threaded into harnesses and tied with a beautiful knot or bow. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a skirt belt" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/421434.jpg" width="527"></div>

    <h2>  Basic rules for accessories </h2><p>  Knowing how to make a belt with your own hands, you can transform any thing - be it a skirt, shorts or classic jeans.  The main thing here is not to overdo it and remember that a belt for multi-colored clothes needs to be chosen monophonic, and vice versa.  A belt with sparkles, rhinestones and stones will look perfect and harmonious on simple and even modest clothes.  But combined with colorful and shiny materials, it will look superfluous and even defiant. </p>
