Of course, it studies the reviews of the owners about a particular model.  It is real people who will tell the whole truth.  This is not to say that manufacturers are deceiving when specifying characteristics, but they focus more on the strengths of the gadget, trying to just keep silent about the weak.  Almost every user also faced with hidden problems that appear only after several months of operation.  And how to find out about them before buying?  Of course, refer to the reviews of real people. </p><p>  Well, it‚Äôs already clear where you can find more accurate information.  Therefore, the basis of the review of our "hero" will be used characteristics and reviews.  <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> J2 Prime (it will be discussed in the article) is another ‚Äústate employee‚Äù from the South Korean manufacturer.  The products of this brand are quite popular in Russia.  The company is different in that it produces devices of different price categories.  In its lineup there are gadgets of premium class, middle and budget segments.  As for the latter, it combines quite simple smartphones, but this does not mean at all that they completely do not meet modern requirements.  For example, Galaxy J2 Prime has LTE support.  What else is interesting in this device?  Let's get it right. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy j2 prime reviews" class="if" height="395" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2011318.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Laconicism and minimalism are the rules that designers used when choosing the design of the packaging box.  It looks pretty simple, but this is where the discreet attractiveness lies.  The background was white, which is positioned with purity.  Thanks to its neutrality, it turned out to focus on the name of the phone.  In principle, that‚Äôs all.  The image of the phone is not shown on the package, so it remains a mystery, pushing the buyer to quickly look inside it. </p><p>  Negative reviews about the <span>Samsung Galaxy J2</span> Prime (G532 F) regarding the configuration are practically not found, although the manufacturer did not become very generous with accessories.  The fact is that buyers are already accustomed to the fact that the "state employees" are equipped with only the most necessary.  The box has the device itself.  Attached to him and the documentation.  In it, for example, there is information about the original accessories, which can be very useful to the user.  Of course, it could not do without a USB cable.  Currently, it is used to charge the battery by connecting directly to devices with the appropriate port or using the power adapter directly to the mains (via a 220V power outlet).  And this is all that the manufacturer offers in the kit. </p><h2>  Reviews on design and build quality </h2><p>  They are greeted by clothes, and escorted by the mind.  This proverb is the best suited to describe the design of the gadget.  What do the user reviews say about the appearance of the <span>Samsung Galaxy J2</span> Prime G532F?  The first thing that users noticed was plastic.  The case is completely made of this material.  Of course, at present, most buyers prefer metal.  And it is worth noting that in the budget segment such models of other manufacturers are represented by a wide range.  But in the Galaxy J2 Prime, developers only designed the end face for metal, covering the plastic with special paint.  According to many users, this design was relevant in 2014.  Advantages include the corrugated surface of the back cover.  Thanks to this choice, the mark is practically minimized. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In order to protect the screen from damage, the manufacturer used glass.  But many users were outraged by the lack of oleophobic coating.  Because of this, the front surface is constantly covered with fingerprints. </p>

    <p>  The Samsung Galaxy J2 Prime Gold control panel received good reviews.  The central button "Home" works fine, does not play.  In addition to it, there are also touch keys: access to applications and Back.  They are located on the sides.  The inconvenience is caused by the lack of backlighting, however, users did not attribute this to critical minuses.  The designation of the touch keys is chrome-plated, so it stands out well with sufficient lighting. </p><p>  Now consider what is on the front panel.  In principle, here all the elements are standard, except for one.  The front camera is equipped with a flash.  However, because of this, the developers had to abandon the light sensor.  This model has another interesting point.  We are talking about two proximity sensors.  Why so much?  This remains a mystery to users.  The disadvantages include the thick frame that frames the screen.  Because of this, the display occupies only 66% of the area. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Some reviews of the Samsung Galaxy J2 Prime (G532 F) are devoted to the "rocker" volume.  It is located on the left side, which is not very convenient for many people, and there is a backlash when working with it.  The lock key is displayed on the right end.  Users have no comments on it.  The bottom end is occupied by a microUSB port and a microphone hole.  At the top there is a headphone jack.  Almost everyone considers its location as successful as possible. </p><p>  What is the back side?  Here is a removable cover with a surface imitating a woven fabric.  A camera lens framed by a metal frame is displayed on top.  On each side of it are a flash and a speaker hole in the shape of two stripes. </p><p>  How did users rate the assembly of the Samsung Galaxy J2 Prime Gold smartphone?  Reviews on this topic can be safely compared with laudatory odes.  The device does not creak, does not bend.  By and large, it was rated 4 on a 5-point system.  Why not five?  Due to the backlash of the ‚Äúrocker‚Äù volume. </p><p>  I would like to end the description of the design of the case by indicating the dimensions of the smartphone.  Its weight of 160 g can be quite considered within the average.  Physical dimensions: 145 √ó 72 √ó 9 mm.  Ideal for those who do not really like big "shovels". </p><h2>  CPU Reviews </h2><p>  Let's move on to the performance description of the Samsung Galaxy J2 Prime Black.  User reviews on this issue are 90% positive.  Shortly before the release of this model, the Korean company began cooperation with the Chinese chipset manufacturer MediaTek.  Therefore, the choice of developers was quite expected.  The smartphone is based on the MT6737T processor.  It is based on four computing modules.  Type - Cortex-A53.  Under heavy load, they are able to accelerate to 1400 MHz.  Compared to previous models, productivity has increased by approximately 15%.  This, of course, pleased brand connoisseurs.  The manufacturing process is 28 nm.  This is not a good indicator, but the platform can be safely called energy efficient.  It was possible to achieve such results thanks to correctly selected software algorithms.  Also, the improved SoC design played a significant role. </p><p>  The manufacturer was still able to surprise buyers by releasing the Samsung Galaxy J2 Prime SM-G532F.  Reviews indicate that this model in some cases is quite superior to its competitors. </p><p>  The Mali T720 GPU also performed well.  In order to evaluate its work, you can run the popular game World of Tanks Blitz.  It is quite demanding, so you will need to immediately set the phone settings to maximum.  The game starts at up to 50 frames per second.  Surprisingly, on the phone you can even see the grass in sight.  Definitely, only mid-budget devices give such results. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung g532 galaxy j2 prime reviews" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2011320.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Memory </h2><p>  <span>Samsung Galaxy J2</span> Prime reviews often mention the amount of RAM.  The fact is that the manufacturer is gradually abandoning high performance due to the improvement of software.  The company directly stated at a press conference that it would not chase a powerful hardware platform.  Users decided to test this in practice.  For this, the WoT game was used and at the same time ten tabs of the Internet browser were launched.  Surprisingly, the phone switched between them quite quickly.  There were no freezes.  This result pleased and users decided to complicate the task by launching a video on YouTube as well.  After 5 minutes of viewing, returning to the game took a matter of seconds.  But still, one point deserves attention.  Open tabs after such manipulations began to reboot spontaneously. </p><p>  What conclusion can be made?  For such a model, 1.5 GB of "RAM" is enough.  However, when installing resource-intensive applications, one fact will have to be taken into account: only about 800 MB are available to the user, since the rest is already occupied by system files.  The manufacturer forgets to indicate this point in the specifications.  But thanks to the reviews of advanced users who thoroughly test the phones, for detailed information. </p><p>  Now let's talk about how much native memory the smartphone Samsung Galaxy J2 Prime Black has?  Owner reviews will help determine the real size of the integrated storage.  In the characteristics declared by the manufacturer, it says about 8 GB.  It is clear that at present such a storage is critically small.  Users simply shout that there isn‚Äôt enough of him.  For example, before installing WoT Blitz, you have to uninstall other applications.  Advanced users have determined how much native memory is enough.  In practice, you can install only one resource-intensive game and no more than two applications such as social networks. </p><p>  Although the phone supports working with external drives, it is impossible to unpack program files onto them.  They are intended only for storing videos, photos and music. </p><h2>  Battery Life </h2><p>  What autonomy can owners of Samsung Galaxy J2 Prime G532F / DS count on?  User reviews and in this matter will help to understand.  The device is equipped with a battery capacity of 2600 milliamps per hour.  Real terms of work on one charge: </p><ul><li>  6.5 h - video mode; </li><li>  4.5 hours - games. </li></ul><p>  Testing was also conducted in order to understand how the battery is discharged in standby mode.  In 13 hours only 5% was spent.  Pretty good, as for the "state employee". </p><p>  You can use the USB port to charge the battery.  From the network with a branded accessory, it will take about 3 hours.  According to users, this is a lot.  But nothing can be done, so it is recommended to connect the charger at night. </p><p>  To summarize the battery characteristics of the Samsung Galaxy J2 Prime.  The reviews say that with an average load, you can fully expect 20-24 hours. If an emergency occurs and the phone is soon discharged, you can activate the power saving mode.  It is provided in the firmware.  In this state, the smartphone will last up to 3 days.  Only, the device will be limited in capabilities, in simple words it will become an ordinary ‚Äúdialer‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung g532f galaxy j2 prime lte reviews" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2011322.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Camera Features &amp; Reviews </h2><p>  There is a category of buyers for which camera resolution is one of the most important criteria when choosing a phone.  What does this say about the Samsung Galaxy J2 Prime SM-G532F?  The main module is based on an 8-megapixel matrix.  There is a focus that works in automatic mode.  But here you need to pay attention to one point: best of all, autofocus performs its functions at a distance of 12 cm. If you bring the camera closer to the object, you will not succeed in achieving a clear picture. </p><p>  You can focus on the subject manually.  To do this, just click on the display in the right place.  Users left a few comments about the face recognition option.  It works only with the full-face image.  If the face is shifted at least a couple of millimeters, then the shooting will have to be done manually. </p><p>  In order to start the viewfinder, you will need to press the Home button twice.  Be sure to remove the lock before doing this.  For settings, you can use the light filters, exposure, change the mode by choosing, for example, burst or panoramic shooting. </p><p>  What do users say about the front module of the Samsung Galaxy J2 Prime?  Reviews, it is worth noting, are positive.  The first thing that caught the eye was the flash.  It is impossible to say that this is a common thing.  The front camera is based on a 5 megapixel matrix.  The quality of the pictures is acceptable, but not impressive.  Ideal for video calls. </p><h2>  Feedback from users about the display </h2><p>  The Samsung G532F Galaxy J2 Prime LTE reviews, of course, also talk about the screen.  This smartphone is equipped with a display that is manufactured in compliance with PLS technology.  It is because of her that not very good comments on the network slip through.  Screen size - 5 ∫.  This is pretty good, however, the low resolution, 960 √ó 540 px, spoils the interaction with the device somewhat.  The pixel density is also low - only 220 ppi.  But in defense we say that the "squares" are not visible to the naked eye. </p><p>  Not pleased users and the air gap between the matrix and the top layer (glass).  With a strong press, you can notice the formation of stains, you can also feel the deflection, albeit slightly. </p><p>  When testing viewing angles, it was possible to find out that the color distortion is practically not noticeable, but the brightness level drops.  The most significant drawback, according to users, is the thick frame.  It is she who spoils the positive impression of the screen most of all. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone samsung galaxy j2 prime black reviews" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2011323.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Communication opportunities </h2><p>  Finally, the turn came to communication capabilities.  Smartphone Samsung Galaxy J2 Prime LTE reviews on this criterion received praise.  Most users appreciated the fact that the "state employee" works with fourth-generation networks.  The device supports two SIM cards.  Their format is micro.  To transfer data, you can use wired (USB) and wireless (bluetooth) methods.  The developers did not forget about the Wi-Fi module.  The gadget works as an access point, supports the standard 802.11 b / g / n. </p><p>  GPS functionality has earned only praise.  The search for 11 satellites took no more than 10 seconds.  There is support for OTG. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  Good reviews of the Samsung Galaxy J2 Prime sound at the platform.  Management of the gadget is carried out using the sixth "Android".  Although the seventh version has already been released, this one is still not outdated.  The operating system is not implemented in a ‚Äúpure‚Äù form; the manufacturer installed a proprietary shell on top of it.  It offers the user a lot of different "chips", which are accepted by the owners with a bang.  This software was borrowed from the flagship smartphone Note 7. </p><p>  Consider the advantages of "OSes": </p><ul><li>  Change of design. </li><li>  Implemented Samsung Notes application. </li><li>  Now you can password protect data stored in a special folder. </li><li>  Provided technical support for Smart Tutor. </li></ul><p>  According to all owners, without exception, it is software that is the indisputable advantage of J2 Prime. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone samsung galaxy j2 prime gold reviews" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2011324.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  To conclude the review of J2 Prime, we will summarize.  To find out the strengths and weaknesses, it was necessary to study a large number of reviews.  Samsung Galaxy J2 Prime, of course, faulty.  It has quite significant shortcomings.  The main ones will be presented below: </p><ul><li>  The presence of an air gap between the protective glass and the display matrix. </li><li>  The screen with a diagonal of 5 inches has a low resolution. </li><li>  Body material. </li><li>  There is not enough internal memory to install applications. </li><li>  Poor quality movie recording. </li><li>  Due to the loud ‚Äúname‚Äù, the price is slightly higher than that of Chinese models with similar characteristics. </li><li>  There is no light sensor. </li></ul><p>  Well, in principle, these shortcomings for users are the most critical.  But this does not mean at all that this gadget has no advantages at all.  These include: </p><ul><li>  Excellent navigation module (GPS). </li><li>  Good performance. </li><li>  Thoroughly thought out optimization of the offline mode. </li><li>  Corporate preinstalled software. </li><li>  During the game shows good results. </li><li>  There is support for external media. </li><li>  Resolution of the main camera. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Who is it for? </h2><p> Even with the fact that the J2 Prime model is considered a fairly simple smartphone, it has a wide audience of customers.  The fact is that the gadget pulls the game well, so it is bought for children as a gift.  Young people also pay attention to this phone, as they are interested in "digging" in the updated software.  People of a respectable age may also like such a device only if there is no categorical attitude to the plastic case. </p>
