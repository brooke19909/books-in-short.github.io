Goynuk - what makes him attractive?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The translation into Russian of the name of this resort village (“an abundant valley under a blue sky”) can make the heart of a lover of travel and relaxation beat faster.  And in fact, it is preferred by such "pearls" of the coast, as Antalya and Kemer.  This is not the most famous resort, but Turkey can be proud of it.  Goynuk is close to other places of rest on the sea, and from the Antalya bus station it can be reached quite quickly by a very beautiful serpentine among the greenery of the mountains by the dolmush minibus.  Stop there "on demand", but transport runs regularly, not even in season.  The village is really located in a beautiful river valley. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey Goynuk" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/268792.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Turkey, Goynuk.</strong>  <strong>How to relax here</strong> <strong> </strong></p><p>  The season in these places begins in April, and ends in late October - early November.  However, under more favorable circumstances, you can sometimes swim here and at Christmas.  The fact is that on all sides this village is closed by surprisingly beautiful, rocky and covered with evergreen forests of the Taurus Mountains.  Large, beautiful beaches, oranges and pomegranates, blooming in spring, and in late autumn strewn streets, coffee houses, beckoning with a breathtaking aroma ... Yes, this is real Turkey.  Goynuk was not created specifically for tourist joy.  This is a historical village founded by nomadic Turkmen tribes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Goynuk village turkey" class="if" height="344" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/268793.jpg" width="600"></div>  Yes, there is an area exclusively for vacationers.  It is closer to the sea - between the coastline and the main highway.  Here are the best hotel-palaces with the All-Inclusive system, marvelous parks and various entertainments.  In addition, beaches and streets are very shady, planted with trees, so there is where to hide from the heat. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Goynuk turkey reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/268794.jpg" width="331"></div>  Beyond the road, under the mountains - in fact Goynuk, a village for residents.  And although it seems sleepy, compared with the boiling vibrant life of the coastal quarter, in fact, real life is here.  And they advise buying souvenirs and things just in the city, because the prices here are practically “for local”.

    <p>  <strong>Goynuk Village (Turkey).</strong>  <strong>What to see</strong> </p><p>  The main highlight of this resort is its indescribably beautiful nature.  There are beaches for every taste.  The hotels have huge, wide, with all the necessary accessories and water activities.  And you can find secret, secluded coves, hidden from the eyes of the lagoon and underwater grottoes.  But the canyon of the same name with the river village is considered the most beautiful place here.  Coastal Turkey (Goynuk in particular) is famous for its limestone mountains.  The Bedaglara rocks, where the canyon is located, also consist of this breed.  The river washed fancy baths and caves in them.  Tours are led here (including horseback riding).  But experienced tourists are advised to take this walk on their own.  It requires some skill, shoes in which you can walk on the water, and a swimsuit.  But in general, the passage through the canyon is very impressive, and for a “snack” those who dare to take this trip will see a beautiful waterfall, lake and cave.  No wonder Goynuk <span>(Turkey) reviews of</span> tourists are called one of the best places to stay between Kemer and Antalya.  And about the canyon, the responses are extremely admired.  People write that the beauty of these mountains cannot be described, you only need to see it.  So - Goynuk is waiting for you! </p>
