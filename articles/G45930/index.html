This European game has become widespread and popular.  Its original name sounds like "Mau-Mau", but with us it was originally called exclusively as "Czech fool." </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-2157380" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44196/2157380.jpg?1541757997"></div><p>  Today, there are many different variations of this game, each of which has its own name.  These are "Pharaoh", "Moor", "English fool" and "Pentagon".  The details of these games are slightly different from each other, but not significantly.  How to play ‚Äú101‚Äù cards and what are the nuances should be examined in more detail if only the first game is to be played. </p><h2>  Beginning of the game </h2><p>  In order to play the card game "101", you will need a standard deck consisting of 36 cards.  A minimum of 2 people and a maximum of 4 can play. There is no difference in how to play ‚Äú101‚Äù cards - together, four or four.  The sequence of actions is identical.  The player making the first move is determined by the draw, then each goes in turn.  The person who deals the cards, respectively, begins the game. </p><p>  5 cards are dealt to each, only the dealer gets 4 cards, and the last one flips over and becomes at stake.  The deck is laid aside without turning it over. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-2157379" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44196/2157379.jpg?1541757997"></div><h2>  Game progress </h2><p>  The rules for playing cards in "101" are quite simple.  This game is not associated with a high level of difficulty, but it develops attentiveness and memory very well.  So, the person sitting to the left of the first player must make his move.  On a card lying on the line, you need to put on top of the card with the same value or the exact same suit.  If there is no suitable card in the five cards issued to him, then he draws one card from the deck.  In case of failure, an additional card remains with him, the move is skipped and transferred to another player.  The rules on how to play "101" cards have their own peculiarities and nuances.  This is described below. </p><p>  So the game process continues until one of the players completely discards his cards, after that all the cards that the players have are opened and scored, points are recorded, and a new deal follows.  The game lasts until the score reaches 101 points.  If a player scored exactly 101 points, then his score is reset, but the one who "went through" automatically becomes a loser. </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  Before playing "101" cards, you should study in detail all the features and nuances of this game.  Namely, the cards of a certain suit and value allow you to somewhat diversify the course of the game. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  So, for example, an ace, put in a suit or on another ace, prohibits the move to the next player.  This is very beneficial when two people play, that is, the right of the next move remains with the player and allows him to discard another card. </p><p>  Ladies are profitable cards in the distribution, so they can be put on a card with any value and for all stripes, while the person who put the lady still has the right to order a suit that suits him.  If the last card in the deal is a queen, then the player who placed it takes 20 points from the account.  And if this lady is also of the peak suit, then 40. </p><p>  The king of spades is also of particular importance.  If it is put on the line, the next player must take 4 cards from the deck and skip his turn. </p><p>  If the player puts a nine on the line, then he must once again walk, covering the card with either another nine or the same suit.  Moreover, if there is no such card in his hands, he must draw cards from the deck until he covers his nine. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-2157377" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44196/2157377.jpg?1541757997"></div><p>  Seven at stake will also force the next player to skip his turn and get two cards from the deck to the load. </p><p>  With the six, the situation is the same, only one new card is taken from the deck. </p><p>  Having learned and well remembering the rules of how to play cards in "101", you can predict the course of the game and always remain the winner! </p><h2>  Scoring </h2><p>  Each time before a new deal, cards are counted, more precisely, the points that were left in the hands of the players.  The value of each card is such that the ace gains the maximum number of points - 11, ten, respectively, with its number 10 points.  The same thing with eights, sevens and sixes - the number of points directly depends on their number.  For the king 4 points are awarded, the queen brings 3, and the jack 2 points.  Nine is not taken into account in the calculation, its value is zero. </p><p>  If the last card is at stake, then the player who discards it will be taken away 20 points; if this is the queen of spades, then taken away 2 times more. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-2157378" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44196/2157378.jpg?1541757997"></div><p>  With the modern development of computer technology, it is absolutely not necessary to look for a company in order to pass the time behind the cards.  Now you can easily download the installation file and play "101" cards with your computer, tablet or smartphone.  The game can be played both with real people on the network, and with virtual players. </p>
