  <section class="page js-page"><h1>LCD "Green Alleys": reviews, developer, layout, infrastructure</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Moscow is the capital of our vast country, the city that beckons the inhabitants of remote corners.  But indeed, many come here in the hope of a better life, its high level, self-realization.  It's no secret that the cost of renting even the most modest housing in the capital is quite high, which is why sooner or later everyone begins to think about buying their own apartment.  If you had the opportunity to evaluate the Moscow real estate market, you probably were impressed by the cost of square meters. </p><p>  But now there is a more affordable alternative - new buildings outside the Moscow Ring Road.  Moreover, it is absolutely not necessary to move hundreds of kilometers from the capital, to endure the mass of inconvenience.  It is quite possible to buy an apartment within 10 km of the MKAD at an attractive price and with fairly comfortable living conditions.  Take, for example, LCD "Green Alleys".  Reviews about the complex help to evaluate the project, revealing all its advantages and even the most hidden drawbacks of the developer.  It was this project that fell into our field of vision. </p><h2>  about the project </h2><p>  Before you start considering reviews of the LCD "Green Alleys" (Vidnoe), you should get acquainted with what the developer offers.  So, comfortable housing just 3.5 km from MKAD is the main concept of the project, which attracts the attention of all Muscovites interested in purchasing an apartment.  A full-fledged urban environment, all the necessary infrastructure, surrounded by a forested area - the best combination, which some time ago it was impossible to dream of.  The project provides for the construction of 14 monolithic buildings that meet all the requirements of reliability, durability and safety. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.metrprice.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd green alleys customer reviews" class="if uuid-2955892" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/2955892.jpg"></div><h2>  Developer </h2><p>  In many respects, the prestige of the company leading the facility affects the quality of construction and the level of comfort offered.  So, the developer of the Green Alleys residential complex in this case is the MIC.  For more than 20 years, the company has been constructing residential buildings and entire complexes with its own infrastructure and has managed to acquire an army of fans.  Moreover, it is among the industry leaders.  The construction of the LCD "Green Alleys" is far from the first in the history of the company.  I must admit that she managed to realize many <span>residential complexes</span> in Moscow and the region. </p><p>  Attention to detail, high professionalism, the use of high-quality materials and innovative technologies are what apartment buyers managed to note.  Moreover, the developer attaches great importance to planning, trying to take into account all the existing needs: spacious and bright apartments with isolated rooms, an additional bathroom and a wardrobe. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Residents of the capital, rather vain, gassed, like no one else needs clean and fresh air, the opportunity to be alone with themselves and their thoughts.  And this can only be done in nature.  So what can Green Alley LCD offer? Customer reviews focus on the excellent location chosen for the facility. New buildings are being erected in the town of Vidnoe near Moscow, which is located just 3.5 km from the Moscow Ring Road. On the one hand, all residents receive comfort and benefits urban life, and on the other - suburban delights. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.tass-sib.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="reviews of lcd green alleys prominent" class="if uuid-2955893" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/2955893.jpg"></div><p>  On all sides, the complex is surrounded by a forested area, which is a barrier to metropolitan noise, dust, and dirt.  You can rest assured: here you can fully enjoy the peace, tranquility, relax in nature with your family and friends.  In addition, the project provides for the creation of a pedestrian zone with boulevards and gazebos. </p><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  You can get to any point of the capital not only by personal transport, but also by public transport.  There are several bus stops on the territory of the complex, the routes are quite enough in order not to feel discomfort. </p><p>  And this is not all the advantages of the LCD "Green Alleys".  The responses of the first buyers regarding transport accessibility are quite encouraging: already in 2020 a metro station should appear here, which will make the complex even more attractive for living. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  When purchasing an apartment outside the city, it is extremely important to assess in advance the level of comfort, the degree of infrastructure development, especially if your family has small children.  You must admit that it‚Äôs extremely inconvenient to take children to kindergarten and school for several tens of kilometers every morning, then go to work all weekend to devote a trip to supermarkets.  It is much better when everything you need is right at your fingertips. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="lan.estate" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd green alley tenant reviews" class="if uuid-2955895" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/2955895.jpg"></div><p>  LCD "green alleys" (Prominent) - the same option.  Three private kindergartens and a comprehensive school will be built on its territory, which will fully satisfy the entire need of the complex for education.  In walking distance are a clinic and a multidisciplinary medical center. </p><p>  The developer paid great attention to the comfort of families with small children: toddlers will be able to play on comfortable and safe playgrounds, and older children will be able to develop endurance and play sports in a specially equipped area.  In walking distance from new buildings there is an ice palace, which is a place for organizing leisure activities for children and adults.  And, of course, residents do not lack stores, which are enough in the area. </p><h2>  Floor plans </h2><p>  Our parents could not pay attention to the layout of the apartments, because in most cases they received square meters from the state.  Nowadays, when we invest our own funds, it is necessary to more demanding approach to the choice. </p><div class="photo" data-original="novostroi-ki.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="apartment in a prominent lcd green alleys" class="if uuid-2955898" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/2955898.jpg"></div><p>  So, buyers are offered 1,2 and 3-room apartments of improved layout.  They are distinguished by spaciousness and thoughtfulness: each square meter of area carries its own functional load.  Apartments in Vidnoye (Green Alleys residential complex) are really represented by a variety of layouts, so everyone will find the option that will satisfy his requirements and financial capabilities.  By the way, the height of the ceilings is 2.84 m, which will not only allow you to correctly organize the space, but also afford a multi-level lighting system. </p><h2>  Finish </h2><p>  Most of the apartments in the LCD are for rent without finishing, but the developer decided to take into account the wishes of modern buyers, offering their own repair options.  This is a real salvation for those families who do not have the time and finances, who want to call in their family nest right after receiving the keys </p><p>  In the standard version, the apartments are rented without finishing, the interior floors are made "in one block".  The first buyers note that they inherited from the developer two-chamber double-glazed windows of European manufacture, extremely high-quality and reliable entrance doors, heating radiators, and also electrical wiring.  Moreover, all the loggias are glazed. </p><h2>  Construction progress </h2><p>  Serious delays in the delivery of facilities - perhaps the main and most obvious drawback of the LCD "Green Hotels. Investors' feedback suggests that in some cases they reach up to a year. If you expect to call in a new apartment as soon as possible, this is definitely not your option. But if you focus on the quality of work and materials used, this complex will meet your expectations.The developer does not really save on materials, but attracts real professionals to work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mskguru.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lc green alley developer" class="if uuid-2955905" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/2955905.jpg"></div><h2>  Beautification </h2><p>  The developer promises to conduct large-scale landscaping of the territory adjacent to the complex.  Already on the official website you can see photos of the pond and walking alleys that so attract the attention of potential buyers.  As the first tenants note, at the moment the pond does not look so rosy and attractive as on the complex‚Äôs website, there is not even a hint of a boulevard at all, nevertheless, work is underway: the space between the buildings has already been cleared, leveled and prepared for the future beautification. </p><h2>  Issue price </h2><p>  The cost of apartments in the LCD "Green Alleys" from the MIC varies depending on the selected section, floor and, of course, area.  One-room apartment in 35 sq. M.  without finishing can be purchased for 3.2 million rubles, a more spacious three-ruble note in 65 sq. m.  for a large family - for 5.5 million rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="avaho.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd green alleys prominent" class="if uuid-2955896" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/2955896.jpg"></div><h2>  Battle check </h2><p>  We decided to check how objective the reviews of residents of the LCD "Green Alleys" are.  So, you can get to the complex from the Kantemirovskaya metro station in just 20 minutes, and this is by public transport.  Minibuses shuttle every 10-15 minutes, so the wait will not be long.  If you wish, you can get by train from the Paveletsky railway station, having previously read the schedule.  If your family has a personal car, the way home will be even faster and easier - traffic jams for this direction are rare. </p><div class="photo" data-original="afy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="construction lcd green alleys" class="if uuid-2955899" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/2955899.jpg"></div><p>  Several buildings have already been commissioned and settled, but the first tenants will have to use the infrastructure of Vidnoye and nearby residential complexes.  This will bring some inconvenience, but only temporary.  With the development of the district and its improvement, the cost of square meters only increases, so if you want to save money, it is better to invest in real estate right now.  The quality of work is what all the residents note.  Many of them are willing to put up with a delay in terms of reliability and durability.  By the way, those who bought an apartment with decoration also did not regret it - they only had to bring furniture and settle down. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  LCD "Green Alleys", the reviews of which we presented as part of this material, are an excellent option for those who have long dreamed of buying their own apartment.  Excellent location, developed transport network, landscaped area, all the necessary infrastructure, diverse layouts and affordable prices are the advantages that the owners managed to notice.  True, most likely, you will have to endure a delay in the delivery of buildings, which, along with the impeccable quality of work, becomes not such a significant drawback.  At the same time, there is no reason to doubt the completion of construction and the implementation of all agreements, because in this case you are dealing with a reliable developer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="avaho.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd green alleys mitz" class="if uuid-2955901" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/2955901.jpg"></div><p>  In order to get to know the object better, look after an apartment for yourself, it is enough to contact the sales office.  We are convinced that after the first visit to the complex, a personal acquaintance with its advantages, you will want to complete the transaction as soon as possible.  Moreover, the developer offers many programs, including soft loans for young families and other categories of citizens.  Do not miss your chance to become the owner of comfortable housing in a modern complex. </p>
