    <h2>  Inexpensive hostel </h2><p>  Moscow is far from the cheapest city, respectively, a stop at any hotel is an additional cost.  However, we are starting to adopt Western traditions.  So, the first sky-hostel appeared in the capital.  Not all Sheremetyevo hotels can boast of such prices.  A bed in a dormitory room can be rented for only 400 rubles, which may be an acceptable option in order to spend some time waiting for a flight.  This is a cozy, modern hostel where, in addition to shared rooms, there are private rooms.  Their cost is about 2000 rubles per day.  The airport is located just 2 km from the hostel, so the road does not present any problems.  The hostel staff is fluent in Russian and English, guests are free to use the Wi-Fi network, and bulky personal items can be stored in individual lockers.  If we consider the most visited Sheremetyevo hotels, then this hostel is in the lead. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
