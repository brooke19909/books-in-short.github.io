The Turkish coast of the Mediterranean Sea attracts tourists not only for its fashionable resorts, equipped beaches and excellent climate, but also for a large selection of excursion programs.  For several thousand years, representatives of different peoples with a highly developed culture (Byzantines, Hittites, Phrygians, Greeks, Armenians, Assyrians, etc.) lived on this territory, and each of them contributed to the history of the architecture of these places. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nilbahir resort spa" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/490145.jpg" width="600"></div>  Therefore, the main feature of holidays on the Turkish coast is the possibility of combined - beach and sightseeing - tours.  From this point of view, the Side resort is especially popular.  It is rightly called the architectural and archaeological museum under the starry sky of Turkey.  Staying at one of the chic hotels in the city or its environs, for example, in the brand new Nilbahir Resort Hotel SPA 5 *, tourists can combine beach activities with numerous excursions to the unique architectural monuments that these places are full of.

    <h2>  How to get </h2><p>  There is no airport in Side.  The nearby one is Antalya Airport Terminal.  It takes flights from all over the world.  Airplanes from Moscow and St. Petersburg fly here daily, and in the high season from other major cities of the Russian Federation.  The flight time from the capital is about three and a half hours.  If you have chosen the Nilbahir Resort SPA (Side) hotel for your vacation, then upon arrival in Antalya you will have to make another 65 kilometers by road to Side resort, and from there another 20 kilometers to the hotel complex.  However, do not worry, the roads in Turkey are in excellent condition, and these 40-50 minutes will fly by for you unnoticed.  A taxi from Antalya to Side will cost 110-115 dollars, and a bus - 10 <span>Turkish liras</span> (4.5 dollars). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nilbahir resort hotel spa" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/490144.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Side or Manavgat </h2><p>  The closest large settlement near the hotel is the city of Manavgat, nevertheless, in the Turgids this hotel is marked as Nilbahir Resort Hotel SPA (Side).  This is because Manavgat is not a coastal city, while Side is a beach resort with well-developed infrastructure.  On this coast there are wonderful sandy and pebble beaches, always clean and well-groomed, and along the coastline there are fashionable hotels.  Nilbahir <span>Resort Hotel SPA 5</span> is located between Side and Alanya.  There are not so many hotels in this part of the coast, although on the beaches you can see towers of <span>cranes</span> building new hotel complexes.  The beach is separated from the hotel line by a six-lane expressway.  Between the hotels there are private cottages. </p><h2>  Location and address of the hotel "Nilbahir Resort SPA" 5 * </h2><p>  As noted above, this hotel is 85 km from Antalya.  Upon arrival at the airport, tourists who paid for the transfer ($ 45-55) should go to the window of the tour operator from whom they ordered the tour, they will be helped to get their luggage and taken to the minibus, which will take them to the hotel.  By the way, the address of the hotel Nilbahir Resort Hotel SPA <span>5 *: Antalya</span> 07600, √ñren≈üehir village, Manavgat.  You can also get to the complex on your own by bus, first to Manavgat, and from there by dolmush to the hotel.  The fare on a regular bus is about $ 5.  A taxi will be much more expensive (about <span>$ 100).</span> </p><h2>  Hotel description Nilbahir Resort SPA </h2><p>  The aforementioned hotel is one of the youngest on the coast.  He opened his doors to guests at the beginning of the summer of 2014, but already managed to receive thousands of tourists from different countries.  By the way, the majority of vacationers are guests from Russia.  Apparently, the Russian tour operators did a good job, offering tourists tours to the newly opened Nilbahir Resort SPA 5 * hotel.  The complex covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã33 thousand square meters and is located across the road from the sea.  An underground passage leads to the beach.  The hotel consists of one six-story building.  In front of the building there is a large outdoor pool with a bar and a sunbathing area, and next to it is a children's pool.  In addition, there are tennis courts and a basketball court.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Room Service </h2><p>  Rooms are cleaned daily and linen is changed three times a week.  This already does not speak in favor of the Nilbahir Resort SPA 5. The reviews of former guests indicate that the rooms are not cleaned in the best way, and linen and towels are not changed as often as indicated on the hotel‚Äôs websites.  And in general, in upscale five-star hotels, linen is usually changed daily. </p><h2>  Infrastructure and service </h2><p>  According to information posted on travel sites, the recently opened Nilbahir Resort SPA has a well-developed infrastructure.  It has the following services: </p><ul><li>  laundry; </li><li>  dry cleaning; </li><li>  lobby; </li><li>  5 bars (including by the pool and on the beach); </li><li>  3 restaurants; </li><li>  SPA-center (Jacuzzi, hammam, massage ($ 50), peeling, solarium, body wraps, etc.); </li><li>  parking; </li><li>  rent a car (from 60-100 dollars per day), a bicycle (10-15 lira per day) and a moped (20 dollars); </li><li>  transfer "airport-hotel" ($ 45-55); </li><li>  currency exchange point; </li><li>  first-aid post (the cost of the service depends on the specific problem); </li><li>  gift shop; </li><li>  boutique; </li><li>  elevator; </li><li>  outdoor pool (children and adults); </li><li>  diving lessons (200-300 dollars, plus 35 dollars for a certificate) </li><li>  indoor pool; </li><li>  tour desk (60-100 dollars) </li><li>  hairdresser, etc. </li></ul><p>  All of the above services, except for the elevator, pool and parking are provided for a fee.  Paid also include the following business services: </p><ul><li>  a conference room with audio and video equipment (the cost depends on the number of participants in the conference or presentation); </li><li>  copier; </li><li>  a printer; </li><li>  scanner; </li><li>  fax and others </li></ul><p>  The only free service in this category is the wireless Internet in the lobby.  Now it‚Äôs becoming clear why the former guests are so disappointed with the level of service at the Nilbahir Resort SPA.  Their reviews contain mostly negative statements.  Indeed, in the understanding of many tourists, the cost of living in a five-star hotel, and operating under the Ultra All Inclusive system, should include the cost of many services, while in this hotel almost everything has to be paid separately, and a lot of money.  The minimum tour price in this hotel during the season is 38,000 rubles, and the maximum is over 50,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  There are three restaurants at the hotel: one main, where a buffet is served three times a day, and two √† la carte menus, serving √† la carte and on preliminary reservation.  On Thursdays, ‚ÄúTurkish evenings‚Äù are arranged for guests, during which vacationers are served numerous dishes and drinks of traditional <span>Turkish cuisine.</span>  The highlight of this dinner is a rich show program in an oriental style, for example, a small theatrical performance of one of the tales of ‚Äú1000 and 1 Nights,‚Äù with dancers performing a belly dance, etc. If you study the comments left on tourist blogs about the Nilbahir Resort SPA hotel, reviews tourists about these thematic evenings are the only bright moment in the stream of negative information and complaints.  Guests unanimously praise a wide variety of delicious Turkish dishes, which, in comparison with the daily menu, seem like just a royal treat.  About the diet and vegetarian menu, which is indicated on advertising sites, and there is nothing to say.  Tourists who have already had time to relax in the Nilbahir Resort SPA, in their comments, note that nothing similar was offered to them at the hotel.  There are several bars on site and on the private beach where guests can enjoy local drinks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel nilbahir resort spa 5" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/490142.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Leisure activities </h2><p>  Since this hotel is located in an area with underdeveloped infrastructure, guests either have to be content with the entertainment provided by the hotel or go to the nearby cities - Side and Manavgat, where you can have a wonderful time in numerous night clubs, restaurants, discos, etc.  But on the territory of the hotel complex you can play billiards (for a fee), table tennis and tennis (for a fee), darts, basketball, boccia, water polo, as well as do water aerobics or work out on fitness machines (for a fee).  As for the SPA center, which is mentioned in the name of the hotel, it is not yet fully operational, and guests have to go to nearby hotels for SPA services.  After all, being in Turkey and not experiencing the effect of a hammam (Turkish bath) will be a big omission.  During the day and in the evening, animation is organized in the amphitheater of the hotel.  Here on this issue, the reviews of tourists are contradictory: some praise an interesting and varied program, while others, on the contrary, complain about the same type.  Animation is free, but a disco for adults costs $ 10 per person.  Of course, tourists going to the 5 * hotel assumed that entertainment would be included in the price of the tour, and therefore were disappointed, but they need to be a little more lenient to this hotel, because the Nilbahir Resort SPA is still very young, and so that everything fits here in its place, it takes a little time. </p><h2>  Children's entertainment </h2><p>  In the lobby of the hotel you can immediately notice a sign on which "MINI-CLUB" is written in large bright letters.  This area is intended for children's activities.  Here, children will find several slot machines and board games, they also have a children's playground with swings, as well as a paddling pool with slides next to the pool.  For a fee, the smallest babysitter can look after.  In the daytime, entertainers organize a fun show program for children, as well as contests and quizzes. </p><h2>  Sea and beach </h2><p>  The Mediterranean coast is what Turkey is always proud of.  Nilbahir Resort SPA 5 (hotel) has its own beach, which is located only 50 meters from it.  However, in order to reach the beach line, tourists need to walk 3-4 minutes through the private sector, then dive into the underground passage, which runs under a six-lane highway, then continue the path between private cottages.  In addition, the beach can be called a stretch.  Absolutely bare beach with dozens of sun loungers and umbrellas (free).  The entrance to the sea is not very convenient, so for the safety of tourists on the water, a plastic pontoon is arranged.  For this, tourists express gratitude to the hotel administration.  On the beach you can find several water attractions, such as a banana, water skiing, parachute (parasailing).  You can also go diving under the supervision of an experienced instructor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nilbahir resort spa turkey" class="if" height="477" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/490140.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  If you have chosen to stay at a hotel in Nilbahir Resort Spa (Turkey), which is located 10 km from the city of Manavgat, then you will definitely need to visit the waterfall of the same name with the city.  This is truly a bewitching sight.  A giant 20-meter (wide) stream falls from a 2-3-meter height directly into the sea.  Next to it there are many fish restaurants where you can sit, taste local fish and relax to the sound of a waterfall.  By the way, psychologists believe that the noise of falling water is a wonderful antidepressant, so a visit to Manavgat can be regarded as stress therapy.  As for excursions to historical sights, the hotel will definitely offer you to visit the city of Side, which is known throughout Turkey as an open-air museum.  Here you can see the well-preserved ruins of the ancient Greek city with a real amphitheater, agora, baths, etc.  Thousands of vivid impressions will be guaranteed. </p><h2>  <strong>Nilbahir Resort SPA 5 *: tourist reviews</strong> </h2><p>  The reviews of vacationers in this hotel, left by former guests, indicate that this hotel does not yet correspond to its 5 stars, and that there is much to be improved.  Tourists are especially unhappy with the service staff, in particular in connection with housekeeping, as well as the neglect of the beach.  Many tourists believe that the price they paid for the tour does not match the quality of service.  Moreover, many services are provided to tourists for a fee.  The minimum cost of a weekly tour to this hotel (for two people), as already noted, is 38,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Hotel Nilbahir Resort SPA 5 (Turkey / Side), of course, has a wonderful modern dizian and well-developed infrastructure.  However, in order for it to correspond to its five-star status, the hotel administration needs to change a lot in the structure of the hotel and the organization of service and leisure, as well as to assemble a conscientious and highly qualified team of employees, which has not yet been done.  We hope that by the next beach season all the shortcomings will be eliminated, and in this they will certainly be helped by the reviews of tourists left on various tourist resources.  After all, they can point out to the management all the mistakes. </p>
