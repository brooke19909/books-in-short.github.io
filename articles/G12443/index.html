A suitable climate, excellent service, clean beaches, comfortable hotel rooms and bungalows, delicious food - all this attracts up to 10 million tourists annually. </p><p>  One of the most visited by travelers is the island of Phuket, which has several beaches with developed infrastructure.  Karon Beach (Phuket) is the largest in length. </p><h2>  Location of Karon Beach </h2><p>  Located just 6 km from Patong, Karon Beach (Phuket) has a completely different infrastructure.  According to the reviews of tourists vacationing here, this beach is for those who come to enjoy the peace, the ocean, the sun and delicious food.  An unusually deserted coast creates the necessary atmosphere for all this. </p><p>  Those who prefer a rich <span>nightlife</span> and many-voiced noise on the beach, choose beaches near Patong with its huge selection of entertainment and events. </p>

    <p>  The length of the beach is an area of ‚Äã‚Äã3.5 km, covered with amazing white sand.  The sand has a coral origin, so when walking on it you hear a small creak, more like a ‚Äúcrunch‚Äù of snow under your feet. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In total, at a distance of 1 km from this place there are other recreation areas - the beaches of Kata Yai and Kata Noi.  So, while walking, you can visit several beaches at once and compare them. </p><h2>  Description of Karon Beach </h2><p>  Karon Beach, Phuket, has no bays and bays that are familiar to other parts of the island, so it has an open view of the ocean, which is beautiful in the summer season, but is the cause of large waves during the rainy season. </p><p>  Pure water of saturated blue color beckons to itself, but it should be remembered that a fairly strong current is felt at the depth, which sometimes becomes the cause of accidents occurring with careless or intoxicated tourists. </p>

    <p>  Although this part of the island is quite built up and here you can choose from hundreds of housing options that are more suitable for price and quality, the beach is quite deserted.  Most often this is due to fairly high waves, which, however, attract surfers. </p><p>  Prudent Thais, knowing the insidiousness of local waves and currents, in bad weather hang red flags on the beach, signifying the prohibition of swimming.  This warning is best not to be ignored. </p><p>  Unlike other famous resorts, where the coastline is developing very densely, the Karon Beach (Phuket) hotels are located mainly 200-300 m from the coast.  Several hotels on the beach do not violate the ecosystem of the beach, which speaks of the careful attitude of Thais to their nature.  This is due to the fact that the coastline is not private property, as in many other countries, but the property of the state. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  North Beach Hotels </h2><p>  Conditionally, Karon Beach (Phuket) can be divided into 3 zones.  The north side of the beach has a milder atmosphere, but sun loungers are few in number here, as are tourists.  Suitable for those who prefer to stay away from other tourists, choosing silence and the surrounding world. </p><p>  Hotels located in the northern part of the beach can be divided into: for families and romantic couples. </p><p>  For example, the Centara Villas Phuket **** hotel is located in a real tropical garden, spread on a cliff.  The hotel has 72 bungalows that attract couples from all over the world. </p>

    <p>  Hotel Talay Karon Beach Resort **** has everything you need for a unique childhood holiday, which is why couples with children prefer it.  The rooms in this hotel are decorated in the theme of children's fairy tales, where there is an underwater kingdom, the cosmic world and beds for real "princesses". </p><p>  The infrastructure of the northern part of Karon Beach is equipped so that vacationers can have a great rest without denying themselves either the silence on the beach or the entertainment on site. </p><h2>  The central part of the beach </h2><p>  Karon Beach (Phuket) hotels in its central part are denser, as this is the widest and most beautiful place on the beach.  Nevertheless, sunbeds on the beach are only in 2 rows, which compares favorably with Patong beaches, where they are arranged in 5 rows. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The dunes located right behind the beach create silence and complete isolation from the outside world, which attracts those who like to hear the sound of the surf, and not the sounds of cars and the crowd's noise. </p><p>  For those who want to combine the peace of the day with the vibrant nightlife, the <span>Karon Sea Sands Resort ****</span> is located in the immediate vicinity of the nightlife.  Inexpensive 87 rooms, some of which have their own access to the pool, are located just off the road from the beach. </p>
