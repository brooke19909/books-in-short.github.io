Apartments from the developer in the near Moscow region</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The nearest suburbs in itself is quite heterogeneous.  The far edges of the region, which are located at a distance of more than 100 km, actually have no differences from the neighboring regions, while the cities and towns located at a distance of no more than 15 kilometers from the Moscow Ring Road are completely different real estate.  Projects of new buildings, provision of infrastructure and transport of residential areas, quality of construction - all this often not only is not inferior to many areas of the capital, but can even surpass them. </p><p>  It is for this reason that the near Moscow region is popular with people who are looking for a new place to live.  But at the same time, many do not understand the accessible areas and their main features. </p><h2>  Balashikha </h2><p>  It is located east of Moscow and is a fairly large city with a population of more than 220,000 people.  From the west, it is located very close to Moscow, while the eastern outskirts are more than 15 km from the Moscow Ring Road. </p>

    <p>  In the overwhelming majority of cases, people who have chosen the closest suburbs as their housing get to the capital via the Gorky or Shchelkovo highways, while it is worth noting that the roads themselves are problematic.  It is for this reason that many people were encouraged by the fact that the city government was going to launch a new <span>light rail line</span> connecting Balashikha directly with the Enthusiasts Highway metro station. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  One of the most interesting projects among the new products in this city is Sacramento, the construction of which is carried out 13 kilometers from the capital along the Gorky Highway.  All two- and three-story houses here are built exclusively from precast concrete of the EURO series.  The vast majority of buildings have already been erected, while the rest are 75% ready. </p><h2>  What to choose? </h2><p>  At the moment, for those who are going to relocate to the near Moscow region, Sacramento offers a mass of one-room apartments at a price of 2.2 million rubles, as well as two-bedroom dwellings, the price of which starts at 2.7 million, while the seller offers the initial 1.5% discount.  Particular attention should be paid to the fact that pensioners, holders of <span>a Muscovite social card,</span> large families, as well as those people who have the opportunity to immediately pay off the full price, can get a discount.  The only limitation is that within the framework of one transaction, the buyer has the opportunity to choose only one specific of the possible discounts, that is, it will not work to combine several of them at once. </p><p>  Also, many experts pay attention to several more interesting objects for those people who are interested in apartments in the near Moscow region.  This Shchitnikovo, the residential complex "Forest Town", as well as a house on Sovetskaya Street. </p><h2>  Butovo </h2><p>  This name often misleads many people.  Almost everyone knows that they are the Moscow districts of South and North Butovo, but at the same time, villages Drozhzhino and Butovo are located next to them (albeit already in the region), which are under active development to this day. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  First of all, the attention of those who are interested in apartments in the near Moscow region can be attracted by the microdistrict of complex development called ‚ÄúButovo Park 2‚Äù, which is located only five kilometers from the Moscow Ring Road, since it is being built in the first place today.  The project, which currently occupies a 22-hectare site, will include 15 residential buildings with variable number of storeys, and the housing area in them will be approximately 200,000 m <sup>2</sup> .  Also, many people who are looking for apartments from a developer in the near Moscow region may be interested in the fact that within the framework of this project, the construction of the modernized P-3M and KOPE-Tower series will be built.  These series of houses are well known among consumers. </p><p>  In addition to houses, this microdistrict will include a school and a kindergarten, a multifunctional center, as well as a full range of necessary commercial infrastructure, conveniently located on the first floors of residential buildings.  It is also planned to build parking lots, walking areas, landscaping and landscaping will be organized. </p><h2>  Prominent </h2><p>  A relatively small city, which is located just 4 kilometers south of the capital.  It was recognized as comfortable for life during the 2006 competition, where it won first place, becoming the most comfortable city in Russia with a population of less than 100 thousand people. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Like other cities that offer apartments from the builder in the near Moscow suburbs, Vidnoe is quite actively being built up.  Among all new buildings, many experts pay special attention to the Green Alleys residential complex, which includes 17 monolithic-brick houses with a variable number of storeys.  It is also planned to build three kindergartens, a clinic and three comprehensive schools.  In the courtyards of residential buildings over time, game, children and sports fields will have to appear, and the entire territory of the residential quarter will be completely fenced in the future. </p><p>  The ‚ÄúColors of Life‚Äù quarter, which is a separate part of the Rainbow mini-policy, should become one of the most attractive projects in terms of investment.  Houses in the immediate suburbs here are being built in full accordance with the social and architectural concept of City-XXI Century to create the most comfortable living environment.  Eight residential buildings, as well as the Smile kindergarten, are already operating in this microdistrict.  In general, the new quarter includes three complexes of variable number of storeys, each of which was built entirely according to an individual project. </p><p>  Some experts note new buildings in the immediate vicinity of Moscow from the developer, which are located in the Eco Vidnoe complex, which includes many prefabricated houses of the P-44K series that are popular today. </p><h2>  Dzerzhinsky </h2><p>  This city is located in the southeast side of Moscow and has a population of approximately 50 thousand people. </p><p>  At the moment, new buildings with decoration in the near Moscow region can be purchased in the new residential complex called "Nikolsky Quarter."  In this region there are three monolithic houses, the total area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich is 53 thousand m <sup>2</sup> .  It is also worth noting that at the moment, landscaping is planned, as well as the construction of an underground parking for up to 228 cars. </p>

    <h2>  Railway </h2><p>  It is located in the eastern side of Moscow and is distinguished by rather convenient transport links with the capital: right in the center of this city there is a station from which you can get to the Kursk station not only by electric trains, but also by rather comfortable "Sputniks". </p><p>  <span>The residential complexes of the</span> nearest Moscow region are represented by the New Pavlino <span>residential complex</span> , which is located in the southern part of this city and is located not so far from the Kuchino station.  This complex includes five monolithic brick buildings, and also has an extensive infrastructure, which includes a large number of retail and office premises, two ground garages with a capacity of 580 beds, various clinics and a kindergarten serving up to 130 children. </p><p>  Another interesting object of this city is the Center-2 microdistrict, which, accordingly, is located in the central part and is built up with panel houses of the P-44K series. </p><h2>  Krasnogorsk </h2><p>  The city is located west of the capital and has a population of about 117 thousand people.  Its main feature for those people who are interested in new buildings in the near Moscow region, can be called the fact that here is the whole complex of buildings of the Moscow Regional Court, as well as the institutions of the regional administration.  In addition, Krasnogorsk is the first and so far the only settlement in this region that has its own metro station called Myakinino. </p>

    <p>  Here, experts recommend turning their attention to the neighborhood called "Pavshinskaya floodplain."  On the territory, the total area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich is one hundred and fifty hectares, the construction of a whole complex of comfortable modern houses is being carried out.  Also, this residential complex in the near Moscow region will acquire its own infrastructure with kindergartens, schools, underground parking, a full-fledged restaurant complex, located on the well-equipped embankment of the Moscow River. </p><p>  If we talk about specific houses, then we can pay attention to the buildings of Levitan and Benoit, which differ in a rather convenient and spacious layout of residential premises.  The one-room apartment here has an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 43 m2. </p><p>  Among other things, the construction of the Palette complex, which will also be interesting to many who are tired of Moscow, is already ending in Nakhabino.  The nearest Moscow region offers a lot of interesting options, but for people who work in the capital, settling in Krasnogorsk will be one of the most optimal solutions so as not to waste a lot of time on the road. </p><h2>  Lytkarino </h2><p>  The city, whose population is 55,000 people, is located eight kilometers southeast of the capital.  For a long time, even those people who were interested in new buildings in the near Moscow economy class did not pay much attention to this city, since it is located in the shadow of Lyubertsy, located in the neighborhood, but over the past few years it began to rage construction life. </p>

    <p>  In this city, the focus of experts is on two new residential complexes - ‚ÄúCoastal‚Äù and ‚ÄúPresidential‚Äù.  The latter is one of the few projects involving the reconstruction of the territory, and here it is planned to erect ten new buildings, reconstruct four residential buildings, a school, and two kindergartens.  In addition, it is planned to erect a new parking lot and additional improvement of this territory. </p><p>  Also, many are beginning to talk about a new LCD called ‚ÄúCentral‚Äù, whose total area is approximately 70,000 m <sup>2</sup> . </p><h2>  Lyubertsy </h2><p>  One of the largest cities of the Moscow Region, with a population of 172,000 people and adjacent to the capital on the east side.  Zhulebino separates this city from MKAD.  It is worth noting that relatively recently in the area they opened their own metro station, which significantly improved transport accessibility not only for Lyubertsy, but also for Zhulebino. </p>

    <p>  In this case, experts most often talk about the area called "Krasnaya Gorka", which is one of the largest integrated development projects in the entire Moscow Region, and at the same time is located only two kilometers from the Moscow Ring Road.  Initially, it was planned to build more than forty different residential buildings in the area, while 34 of them have already been built and put into operation.  The infrastructure of the district will include all the elements that are required to ensure a comfortable human life - kindergartens and comprehensive schools, sports and shopping centers, banks, pharmacies, multi-level parking lots and many other facilities.  It is also worth noting that to ensure the maximum convenience of future residents, each apartment, which is offered in the local new buildings, has a full finish. </p><p>  Another interesting object can be called the residential complex "Gems". </p><h2>  Mytishchi </h2><p>  The city has a fairly large number of features that make it similar to Lyubertsy.  First of all, this concerns the number of population, which is 173,000 people.  Also, the city has its own metro station - Chelobitevo. </p><p>  Among the objects of new construction, experts often mention the Akademik residential complex.  In the already built LCD, you can easily purchase a one-room apartment, the cost of which starts at 4.1 million rubles, while the new LCD, which will be built after a while, will already offer a cost of 3.5 million. </p>

    <p>  Many talk about the residential complex "Orion", which is almost completely built and put into operation.  Among the distinguishing features of this project, non-standard windows that are distinguished by their large width can be distinguished, in some apartments they are not inferior in size to the width of the room.  It is worth noting that in a large number of three-room apartments there are windows in the bathrooms, which is not so often found even in elite buildings. </p><p>  Not far from this complex is located LCD "Barberry", in which housing can now be purchased.
