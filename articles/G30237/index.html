A hook for creating such products will do much better than knitting needles.  Creating an accessory on your own, you can give it any shape, make a product of any size, arrange at your own discretion.  The main thing is to decide on the model of the bag for cosmetics and to do the job correctly. </p><h2>  What material is best for making cosmetics </h2><p>  A fashionable crocheted cosmetic bag will become functional only when the yarn and design are chosen correctly.  The functionality of the product will also depend on the quality of the thread.  If the yarn is too light, then the makeup bag will not last long. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thestoryofamulberry.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="threads for knitting cosmetic bags" class="if uuid-2873392" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2873392.jpg"></div><p>  The material must meet several conditions: </p><ol><li>  Yarn should be easy to wash.  To do this, it is advisable to use synthetic threads. </li><li>  It is advisable to use yarn in dark colors, as the product will often get dirty from cosmetics. </li><li>  So that the product does not appear spools and loops do not get stuck, it is worth choosing yarn, which is a retinue of two threads. </li></ol><p>  Other preferences are determined by the features of the type of future product and the desires of the needlewoman herself.  Some craftsmen make threads themselves from old dimensionless tights or garbage bags. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Arrangement of a homemade cosmetic bag </h2><p>  To make the product meet all the needs of the user, it is better to make a cosmetic bag yourself.  The easiest way is to tie the product.  Usually, a crocheted cosmetic bag is trimmed and decorated with your own hands.  The main finish implies the presence of such elements: </p><ul><li>  User-friendly clasp.  Most often used lightning, button or button. </li><li>  On the "case" can be placed pockets for storing small hairpins, rubber bands, cotton buds. </li><li>  If the model implies the presence of a cover, then it is necessary to consider the mechanism of its fastening and fixing. </li><li>  In addition to the functional arrangement, it is worth paying attention to decoration.  You can decorate a cosmetic bag with any elements and in any quantity. </li></ul><p>  If the bag for cosmetics will be used only at home, then you can attach legs to it or make a stand.  When the accessory is used to carry cosmetics in a bag, then too complicated arrangement is not required. </p><h2>  Crochet Round Cosmetic Bag </h2><p>  Crocheting a round cosmetic bag is quite simple.  In this case, a product of this form will become a real decoration of the toilet stoic.  An interesting shape and spaciousness make the product for storing cosmetics a favorite in comparison with other options.  The only drawback is that it is inconvenient to transport this accessory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="round cosmetic bag without cover" class="if uuid-2873394" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2873394.jpg"></div><p>  The principle of manufacturing a round cosmetic bag: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Link a chain of 5 air loops (VP).  Close the chain into the ring. </li><li>  Knit the first row with single crochet columns (RLS). </li><li>  The second row also knit sc.  In each column of the previous row, knit 2 sc. </li><li>  In each subsequent row, add 8 RLS evenly. </li><li>  When the circle will satisfy its size, you can begin to manufacture the walls of the cosmetic bag. </li><li>  Without cutting the thread, you need to turn the work and start knitting through a row from the edge. </li><li>  In the process of manufacturing the walls of the cosmetic bag, no additions or decreases are necessary. </li><li>  Upon completion of knitting the boards, we proceed to the manufacture of the cover. </li><li>  The lid is knitted in the same way as the bottom of the product.  Then the element is fixed with a zipper or buttons. </li></ol><p>  Next, decorating cosmetic bags. </p><h2>  DIY oval cosmetic bag </h2><p>  The principle of making an oval cosmetic bag is the same as a round one.  But there is a difference in knitting patterns, which sets such a shape for the product. </p><div class="photo" data-original="madeheart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="a variety of forms for cosmetic bags" class="if uuid-2873396" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2873396.jpg"></div><p>  The instruction of the oval-shaped crochet cosmetic bag is quite simple if you first learn the principle of creating a round analogue: </p><ol><li>  Link a chain of 5 VIs. </li><li>  We turn the work and knit RLS in each VP.  It turns out a strip. </li><li>  Next, circular knitting is done - the strip is tied. </li><li>  In each subsequent round, it is worth adding 2 sc.  So, in each subsequent round 4 additional RLS appear. </li></ol><p>  Then the walls fit and, if necessary, the lid.  The principle of decoration is determined by the needlewoman herself. </p><h2>  How to make a flat mini cosmetic bag with your own hands: for beginners </h2><p>  The simplest option for self-production is a flat crochet cosmetic bag (instructions for beginners are presented below).  In this case, the product has a rectangular or square shape, which simplifies the knitting pattern. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mk.jiraygroup.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="flat cosmetic bag" class="if uuid-2873390" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2873390.jpg"></div><p>  The sequence of actions will be as follows: </p><ol><li>  Link a chain of 15 VPs.  The number of loops determines the size of the product - this is the length of the finished purse for cosmetics. </li><li>  Next, you need to knit the fabric using any pattern.  For beginners, the ideal option would be double crochet (CCH), which are knitted in each column of the previous row without additions or decreases. </li><li>  To determine the desired height of the cosmetic bag, you need to periodically fold the canvas in half.  When the size will be completely satisfied, you just need to sew two halves of the fabric on the sides. </li><li>  In order for the cosmetic bag to close, you can sew in a zipper. </li></ol><h2>  Crochet cosmetic bag </h2><p>  A cosmetic bag that has the shape of a bag and has the same functionality will look very impressive and original.  A detailed and understandable description of a cosmetic bag crocheted in the shape of a bag will help simplify the work and create a real masterpiece.  To do this, you can use this option: </p><ol><li>  First dial 5 VP.  Close the chain in a ring, since the base of the bag will be knitted according to the principle of a circle. </li><li>  The first row to knit sc.  Then, in each subsequent row, do 8 uniform additions. </li><li>  When the circle reaches the required size, you need to finish the work by fastening the thread. </li><li>  Next, a strip of the desired width is knitted.  It should be of such a length that allows you to connect the two parts of the finished circle. </li><li>  Fold a circle in half.  Now, between the halves, on the one side, a previously connected strip is sewn. </li><li>  On the other hand, zipper is sewn. </li></ol><p>  To make the product visually look like a bag, you can sew on pens from any type of material. </p><h2>  Openwork cosmetic bag for real fashionistas </h2><p>  Crocheted cosmetic bag can be not only functional, but also beautiful.  If the needlewoman has some experience in crocheting, then it is worth trying to create an openwork product.  In this case, you can make a fashionable shape of a cosmetic bag.  Recently, cosmetics bags in the form of bags have been trending, which often replace clutches, being used as a mini handbag. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mydoubles.top" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bag-shaped cosmetic bag" class="if uuid-2873381" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2873381.jpg"></div><p>  Features of creating a cosmetic bag in several ways: </p><ol><li>  You can connect a regular circle, initially choosing an openwork pattern.  Then a satin ribbon, tourniquet or rope is stretched along the edge.  By pulling the tape, you can close the cosmetic bag and give it the shape of a bag. </li><li>  You can knit a product on the principle of a round cosmetic bag.  Just for work it is advisable to use soft and pliable threads.  In the process of forming the walls, it is not necessary to retreat a row from the bottom edge.  A ribbon is stretched from above, which will serve as a ‚Äúfastener‚Äù. </li><li>  You can make a flat bag using schemes for flat cosmetic bags.  In this situation, the canvas will have a high height and a lacing clasp. </li></ol><p>  When delicate patterns are chosen for a cosmetic bag, it is imperative to sew a lining.  The lining will prevent small objects from falling out through the pattern holes. </p><h2>  Finishing methods for the finished product </h2><p>  A crocheted cosmetic bag will become truly beautiful if you elegantly decorate an already finished product.  For decoration, you can use beads, sequins, fabric, leather, fur, buttons, metal rivets and other elements. </p><div class="photo" data-original="datds.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="finished product finish option" class="if uuid-2873391" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2873391.jpg"></div><p>  A beautiful applique is made of fabric.  With the help of the same hook, flowers and other elements are tied.  If you sew in random order beads, sequins or beads, you get a beautiful abstraction. </p><p>  The principle of decoration depends on the features of use and imagination of the needlewoman. </p>
