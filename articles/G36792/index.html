And if you gather with your family or yourself and go on a trip to this beautiful city, two or three days stay here will change your life, make a note of diversity in it. </p><p>  Suppose you are a tourist and want to choose a hotel in St. Petersburg.  The main thing to know is that the hotels of North Palmyra are designed for different people, regardless of their social status and religion.  If you have specific goals, then choose a hotel near the historical and cultural center of the city.  If you are a businessman - choose accommodation in the business district, so that the hotel must have a conference room equipped with the necessary office equipment. </p><p>  For foreigners, a wide range of additional services is ideal.  Among them, the most important: booking and booking air and train tickets, transfer from the nearest airport.  Also for foreign tourists it is preferable that the hotel provide additional services, such as: registration of guests in the city, free parking on site. </p><p>  Cheap hotels of St. Petersburg for business people - three stars.  Here you will get comfortable rooms at a reasonable price.  Most of these hotels are located far from the city center, the interior is not very beautiful.  Such housing is also ideal for tourists who are looking for the best price ratio, which is 130-240y.e./day, and the quality of services provided. </p><p>  More chic five-star hotels in the city provide maximum comfort during the holidays, but these same hotels and the most expensive.  Here you will find magnificent and comfortable rooms (standard, junior suites, suites, presidential apartments and studios), service at such hotels is carried out 24 hours a day, sports complexes for maintaining health and well-being are assumed, spa salons and restaurants are offered that offer exquisite dishes and so on.  Such a hotel "with all amenities" will be quite interesting for VIP guests and foreign visitors to the city.  The average room price in such a hotel is approximately 400-1200y.e.  per day. </p><p>  So, one of the most important criteria is the price of a hotel room and the level of service.
