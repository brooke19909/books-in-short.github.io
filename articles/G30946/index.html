    <h2>  Amari Havodda Maldives: reviews </h2><p>  According to the vast majority of Russians, the Maldives, including the atoll on which this hotel is built, is a paradise.  Many of our compatriots liked it here, so some are even surprised by the presence of negative reviews.  Nevertheless, they are.  And first of all, they relate to the second flight, which is carried out by plane, so often with a delay.  This is a big minus for those who travel with transfers and may not be in time for the flight. </p><p>  However, despite this drawback, the vast majority of Russians liked the hotel.  The food is very good.  Shrimp dim sums and borsch from the chef were especially remembered by many.  The hotel is mainly inhabited by Italians and British, while there are few Russians.  Therefore, among the staff, no one understands our language.  And this is another minus of the hotel. </p><p>  As for the rooms, there are complaints as well: some did not like the constant noise of the waves, which interferes with sleep.  Therefore, they recommend that this circumstance be taken into account when choosing a villa.  But the Russians left a lot of enthusiastic reviews about rooms with a private pool. </p><p>  As a result, we can conclude that Amari Havodda Maldives corresponds to the five-star category in almost all respects. </p>
