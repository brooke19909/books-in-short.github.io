  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Wireless home theaters. History and Benefits</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Wall-mounted home cinemas are designed to bring the viewer as close as possible to the atmosphere of the film or to divide the sound of each instrument in reproduced composition with crystal clearness.  Since the creation of the first <span>speaker system,</span> there has been a debate on the topic of wires.  The question of how to connect speakers to the receiver is the key.  Quality directly depends on this.  And recently a new topic for discussion has ripened.  And why not produce wireless home theaters, and more specifically, home theaters with wireless speakers. </p><p>  Wireless ... Advertising and replete with these terms.  It seems that without this word, any new product in the High-tech world simply loses the meaning of its existence.  But the truth is very close.  Wireless technology is not just a tribute to fashion, but the result of another technological progress.  Humanity is looking for a way out of the unbearable confusion of a wide variety of wires.  It's time, many will say.  Another device that actively seeks to completely get rid of the ‚Äúshackles‚Äù is wall mounted home theaters.  Remember only the rear speaker cable.  The longest wires in the system that need to be routed through the entire (!) Room.  They are twisted, confused, but you also need to figure out how to better hide them.  In a word - a nightmare! </p><p>  To solve the inconvenience associated with a large number of cables and their installation has been considered for a long time.  A separate wire for each column is not enough for anyone.  Often it seems that <span>the control unit</span> (amplifier) ‚Äã‚Äãlike an octopus spread its tentacles throughout the room where the speaker system is installed.  Of course, there are few options.  There was an attempt to make very thin wires, but the thickness of the <span>wire section is</span> very important.  The result is a decrease in sound quality.  It‚Äôs more convenient to lay one cable at times, but you can‚Äôt argue with physics and because of the big pickup in the bundle, this idea was abandoned.  The idea to create flat wires turned out to be successful.  It is convenient to lay, no twisting, no wringing, excellent cross-section, high quality of reproduction, but ... The price of such an innovation was several times higher than the cost of standard wiring and the idea did not take root.  It seemed that home theaters with wireless speakers would never go on sale.  Never say never! </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The future has come true, albeit partially.  But even this "partially" is a serious step forward.  Famous brands such as Sony, Panasonic, Phillips, LG, Samsung and Pioneer actively sell speakers with wireless rear speakers, and it is they, or rather their wires, as we recall, that cause the greatest headache.  The price of such freedom starts at about $ 600. There are also models with a <span>wireless subwoofer.</span>  Though not so tangible, but still convenience.  The fewer the wires, the less likely one day to get lost in them. </p><p>  So why can't wireless home theaters be realized to the end.  Indeed, if you judge, then with the transmission of sound through the air, people solved the problem back in 1980.  Then the first, so-called, radio microphone was invented.  This was a real revolution in the world of technology.  But this invention did not complete the year of startling novelties.  In the same year, the American company Koss launches the first wireless headphones with a lifetime warranty (!).  Americans are ready to invest big money in true quality.  This means that wireless sound transmission has been practiced for more than 30 years.  For technology, this is a long time.  Just for comparison.  The first home personal computer, in a more or less familiar view for us, was created only in the mid-80s.  The result of development is simply impossible to describe.  Creating serial wireless home theater systems was unrealisticly difficult. </p><p>  Undoubtedly, technically, they can, of course, be made.  But the cost of a high-class miracle without wires, as a result, will become simply sky-high.  Indeed, in the acoustic systems of this family it is precisely the quality of reproduced sounds that is valued.  This is the main advantage.  Even the slightest attempt to save on radio transmitters leads to a significant deterioration in the "transparency" of playback.  A good transmitter costs a lot of money.  We'll have to wait a little while the world of technology again takes a step forward.  In the meantime, completely wireless home theaters remain the subject of study and active discussion. </p>
