  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Register ownership of residential real estate</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The procedure for registration of ownership is quite complex, time-consuming and time-consuming.  Most people sooner or later resort to this procedure, since state registration of real estate rights is the only evidence of the existence of this right.  And then a lot of questions arise: where are the property rights registered, what documents are needed, when can the main document for the property right be obtained, and many others.  Let's look at the process of registration of ownership in more detail. </p><p>  The ownership right must be registered if you buy, change, give, inherit, privatize / deprivatize, rent for a long time, build a property, or if any property is not registered in the unified state register of rights.  The registration procedure is regulated by the Civil Code and the law "On state registration of rights to real estate and transactions with it."  The ownership right is registered at the location of the property within the registration district, if the property is not located in several districts.  The names of the registration authority itself may differ in different cities and republics of the Russian Federation: the state commission on real estate and land relations, the city registration office for real estate rights, the regional registration chamber, etc. </p><p>  For registration you will need a package of <span>title documents</span> and more.  You need to submit an application to the registration authority, <span>pay the state fee,</span> confirm with documents the right of ownership of a particular property.  All documents will need to be photocopied because you will need both the original and a copy to submit to the registration authority.  It will be necessary to provide a cadastral plan for a land plot or property with a cadastral number.  The cadastral plan for land is certified by the Committee on <span>Land Resources,</span> and for other property - Bureau of Technical Inventory or another organization that keeps records of real estate. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If the property has only recently been built, you will need documents confirming its creation (contract, investment contract, <span>acceptance certificate,</span> state commission <span>act</span> , design and estimate documentation, subcontract) and a lease / title to the land. </p><p>  Ownership of construction in progress is confirmed by the following documents: a document on the right to use the land plot, a description document of construction in progress, design estimates. </p><p>  All documents submitted for real estate must contain all the necessary information for registering ownership of real estate and the reflection of this information <span>in the Unified State Register of Rights.</span>  The documents must necessarily contain a detailed description of the type of property.  The text of the document itself should be easy to read and legible, all names, surnames, patronymics, addresses and names should be written in full, without reduction, if there are references to legal entities, then the actual and legal address of this person must be indicated. </p><p>  If the documents are provided by an individual, a passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation will be required from him, an additional document will be required for the representative of the organization, confirming his authority to act on behalf of the organization. </p><p>  If the documents contain corrections, postscripts, erasures, strikethroughs and other corrections or serious damage to the document, your documents will not be accepted and reviewed. </p><p>  If all the documents are in order, your documents will be accepted for consideration and they will hand you a receipt with the date of acceptance and the list of documents received from you.  Within a month, a document of ownership must be ready. </p>
