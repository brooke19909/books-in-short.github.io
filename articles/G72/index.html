  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Crochet gloves and knitting</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many housewives try to decorate their kitchen, give it originality and their own style.  There are great opportunities for this even in the smallest kitchen area.  And in the big one you can give full play to your imagination.  <span>Unusual lamps,</span> beautiful curtains or blinds on the window, paintings, <span>compositions of dried flowers</span> - this is just a small list of what will help make the kitchen unique.  And it is especially valuable if something is done by oneself. </p><p>  For example, kitchen potholders for hot dishes.  <span>Crocheting tacks is</span> not such a great wisdom.  It is better to knit them from thick yarn (acrylic or cotton), crocheting at least No. 3,5.  You can alternate the rows of yarn of different colors.  In general, crocheting tacks is an interesting and creative activity. </p><p>  As a rule, potholders fit in a square shape.  To do this, you need to tie a ring of air loops, which in the next row is tied with double crochets in an amount multiple of 4 (for example, 12).  Then, in each subsequent row, knit with double crochets, four times through an equal number of loops, knitting two from one loop with an air loop between them.  In this way, tack angles are formed.  The finished tack is tied around the contour with a thread of contrasting color with the 1st row of single crochet stitches or with the "crustacean step".  At the same time, you can make a loop (a chain of air loops) over one of the corners, for which it will then be convenient to hang the tack on a hook. </p><p>  Similarly, you can make a double tack.  In this case, you need to connect two identical squares, fold them together and tie them with one decorative one next to the loop, connecting both parts during knitting. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can tie a double tack in another way: make a rectangle in the ratio of 1: 2 and fold it in half.  Thus, a double thickness tack is obtained.  It is easier to knit a rectangular shape not from the middle, like a square, but in straight rows.  That is, first you need to connect a chain of air loops, the length of which is equal to the length of the side of the future square tack.  All subsequent rows are knitted with double crochet (or, if needed more densely, with single crochet).  In order to master the simplest crocheting of tacks, it is enough to know the basics. </p><p>  Craftswomen with good skills can tie a tack in the form of a circle, rhombus, leaf, berry, house, etc. </p><p>  In general, knitting tacks - crochet or knitting - has many options.  The most suitable of them for knitting is a rectangle folded in half. </p><p>  But there is a way to knit a double fabric immediately.  Take the simplest option - the <span>front surface.</span>  Having collected the number of loops corresponding to the length of one of the sides of the tack, in the first row after each knitted loop, a yarn is made.  In the next (wrong) row, these crochets are knitted with the front, and all the loops of the previous row are simply removed on the knitting needle.  In this case, the working thread should remain behind, behind the canvas.  Now we knit all the rows in the same way: we knit the front loops, purl the back loops.  It turns out a sort of bag.  In the last row, the loops are closed in pairs to return to their original number. </p><p>  With a good selection of yarn, any knitted potholders - with knitting needles or crochet - look very elegant in the kitchen.  They can be either monophonic or multicolor: striped, checked or with a knitted pattern.  On one-color tacks, you can make embroidery or applique. </p><p>  As another option for decorating your home, you can make grips for <span>curtains with your own hands.</span>  They can be sewn from the same fabric as the curtains themselves, or, conversely, in a contrasting color, knitted or crocheted, weaved or embroidered on a fabric ribbon.  If these are curtains hanging in the children's room, you can decorate the hooks with small soft toys, images of animals, flowers or cartoon characters. </p>
