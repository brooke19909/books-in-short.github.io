This is especially true of the summer period, when on hot days it is quite difficult to be in a stuffy room.  For this, various means and methods are used.  To maintain the optimum temperature in the room, many install in their apartments air conditioners and split systems from various manufacturers.  But during the operation of these technical devices, sometimes problems arise.  It may completely or partially fail.  The most common problem is that the air conditioner has stopped chilling.  According to most experts, such malfunctions arise as a result of improper handling of equipment, as well as disruptions in the operation of the device. </p>

    <p>  Depending on the breakdown, it <span>is</span> possible to repair the <span>air conditioning system</span> both independently and using the services of qualified employees of companies that are involved in the installation and maintenance of such devices.  For owners, at least once a year, it is necessary to completely clean the air conditioner, this will help to avoid most breakdowns. </p><h2>  Fault diagnosis </h2><p>  But how to correctly establish the presence of such a problem, if it seems that the air conditioner is not cooling well?  Appropriate measurements must be taken.  To solve this problem, the temperature difference at the inlet / outlet of the cooling system is estimated.  To do this, you can use a conventional thermometer.  The main thing in the process of taking measurements is to ensure that it does not get into the fan drum. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The temperature of the incoming air is measured by placing a thermometer above the indoor unit, and blown, where the flow is near the open curtain.  If the set temperature difference reaches 8-12 degrees and above, then the operation of the device is optimal.  If such a difference is less, then you can diagnose that the air conditioner does not cool, the reasons must be sought in the device itself. </p><p>  First of all, it is worth noting that the installation and installation of split systems should be carried out by qualified specialists.  If a malfunction occurs during the warranty period, it is better to immediately call the installers.  If the warranty period has passed, you can try to repair it yourself. </p><p>  As a rule, the poor performance of the air conditioner to cool the room is accompanied by various factors, which include the following points. </p><h2>  Dustiness of a shaggy drum and a fur coat </h2><p>  This suggests that the air conditioner does not chill as a result of contamination of the equipment.  Such problems are caused by clogging of the air mesh filters with dirt.  They are located under the front panel of the indoor unit.  Over a huge 30-day period, these elements are very polluted.  Therefore, it is necessary to clean the device in a timely manner. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  If you ignore these measures, dirt will fall between the plates of the heat exchanger, which will affect the movement of the air mass.  The fan will also suffer from pollution.  It should only be cleaned by specialists.  Over time, when a large layer of dust and dirt settles on the fan, it ceases to drive air.  To check its performance, it is necessary to check the air pressure.  If it is weak, then it's time to call the masters, at the same time they will check other external sources of air intake.  A fairly common reason why air conditioning does not cool in early summer is poplar fluff, which splits elements of the split system. </p><h2>  Lack of freon </h2><p>  Any air conditioning system basically contains a special substance - freon.  Therefore, the refrigerant is a kind of working fluid.  During operation, it boils and condenses and thus provides cooling of the interior.  For split systems that are installed in apartments, up to 700 grams of freon is used.  If there is no coolant in the device or it is not enough, the air conditioner will not cool in the required mode.  The whole split system consists of an external and internal block.  Between themselves, these parts are connected by copper tubes, which are called the Freon route.  Installation wizards use nuts and rolling joints during installation. </p>

    <p>  If the density of these elements is insufficient, freon during the operation of the air conditioner will begin to evaporate.  Also, cracks that may appear may cause leakage.  They arise due to vibration of the fan and compressor.  But most often, such a leak can be detected at the places where copper pipes are connected to the system unit in the case of poor-quality soldering.  If about 150 grams of the substance evaporates in this way, this will significantly affect the performance of the device.  The following symptoms indicate a lack of refrigerant: </p><ul><li>  oil appears on the tubes; </li><li>  the air conditioner does not chill or does not work at full capacity; </li><li>  frost appears on the heat exchanger of the indoor unit; </li><li>  the screws on the outdoor unit freeze. </li></ul><p>  Therefore, when lifting the front panel and removing the air filters, the heat exchanger will not be cold.  Its upper part can be covered with hoarfrost.  Therefore, to improve the performance of the cooling system, it is necessary to add freon and eliminate the existing leakage.  Indeed, when the system overheats, the compressor may burn out. </p><h2>  Too much freon </h2><p>  It must be said that the consumer may encounter such a problem when employees of the company who refuel the split system with coolant may incorrectly consult it and receive additional funds from constantly filling the device with freon.  In the future, an excess of refrigerant can also become the reason why the air conditioner does not cool the air.  In order to eliminate various leaks of freon, competent employees of specialized firms use special gas analyzers. </p>

But if the compressor itself fails, the repair will not be cheap, it may be necessary to change the entire external unit. </li></ul><h2>  Sensor malfunction </h2><p>  The reason why the air conditioner is not cooling can be temperature and pressure sensors, which are completely or partially out of order.  As a rule, for safety reasons, manufacturers provide for automatic shutdown of the system as a result of the failure of these elements.  To resume operation, non-working components must be replaced. </p><h2>  Hose clogged with debris </h2><p>  Sometimes the air conditioner cools slightly, because it is necessary to carry out cleaning using a special hose with a vacuum pump.  In any case, to resolve this problem, you must use the services of a wizard. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  For the normal functioning of cooling systems it is necessary to carry out timely maintenance.  In the future, this will avoid various problems.  Call a master to clean the entire split system at least once a year. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="does not cool the air conditioning in the apartment" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/1435152.jpg"></div></h2><p>  If the air conditioner does not chill, the first thing is to check the filters, as a rule, this is the most common reason for the malfunction of such devices.  If the service warranty has not yet expired, it is best to immediately invite a qualified professional.  In the future, this will avoid additional costs.  And timely maintenance of cooling systems will prevent a complete failure of the air conditioner.  And it will create the prerequisites for a normal and comfortable stay in the room in order to solve personal and business problems. </p>
