    <h2>  Kamala Beach </h2><p>  The coast is also called one of the most beautiful areas of the island.  It is located in its northwestern part.  Hotels on Kamal are mainly ‚Äútriples‚Äù and ‚Äúfours‚Äù.  Although the infrastructure can not be compared with Patong, the local hotels have everything that is needed for a good holiday.  The same is said about the hotel Swissotel Resort Phuket <span>4 * (Thailand,</span> Phuket, Kamala).  You can live here long and carelessly - the prices in Kamal are not very high, the service is excellent, and people have not yet been spoiled by the attention of tourists.  Once it was a fishing village, where mainly Muslims lived.  Yes, and now there are many people who practice Islam.  The north of Kamala is best for tourists, and the south is more crowded.  At the highest point of this area - Mount Khao Phon Thurat - there is an observation deck with a breathtaking view.  Attractions in this part of Phuket are not very many.  First of all, this is a Buddhist temple in the south and the Fantasy park.  But he is famous throughout the country.  This theme park has a lot of entertainment, a theater, shows, a zoo and a lot of different programs for children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Swissotel resort phuket 4 reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1084781.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach, sea, pools </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the hotel is separated from the sea by a road, it is located not far from the coast.  It‚Äôs literally five minutes to go through the underpass, so it‚Äôs very safe for children.  A mile-long beach with good sand, but there are no sun loungers and umbrellas.  However, for Thailand it is now not uncommon.  They were removed from all coasts of the country in the spring of 2015.  On the beach, guests of the Swissotel Resort Phuket 4 * hotel (Phuket, Kamala) provide a lot of water entertainment and sports activities.  You can play volleyball.  Especially worth noting are windsurfing and kayaking.  In addition, coral reefs overlook the coast, which is why a diving center is open here.  Kamala beach is very clean, comfortable, there are no crowds of people, as in Patong.  Clear water.  Sometimes there are waves, but less than on Karon.  Great sunsets.  There are many palm trees that give shade, as well as cafes - budget and not very.  The bottom is sandy, so you can splash around at sea and at high tide.  The hotel has a cool pool with sunbeds.  It is open until eight in the evening, but tourists claim that you can swim at night.  In the morning they clean it, there is no smell of bleach.  He is very fond of children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Swissotel resort phuket 4 thailand phuket kamala" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1084785.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Excursions, shopping </h2><p>  At the exit markets that open near the Swissotel Resort 4 * (Thailand, Phuket, Kamala), things can be bought cheaper than in stores in Patong.  But if you want to visit supermarkets or shopping centers, then order a free bus at the hotel.  For shopaholics here is a real paradise!  So many things - and clothes of famous brands, and products of local factories or handicraftsmen, and souvenirs, and applied art, and jewelry ... Tourists often regret that when they gathered here, they did not bring another large suitcase with them.  Only empty, so that was where to put purchases.  Excursions, both in the hotel and on the street, offer different.  This is a sightseeing trip to Phuket (but keep in mind that this is a mountainous area, and people who are sick of it may not feel comfortable), and visits to various establishments with exotic animals.  You will see an aquarium, a zoo, shows with crocodiles, elephants, monkeys ... There are excursions with visits to reserves that are located outside of Phuket, for example, Khao Sok National Park.  Boat trips, as a rule, include trips to the most beautiful islands of the neighboring province of Krabi.  And the most mysterious places in Thailand - Similans - are available for those who are ready to devote travel not two hours, but two or three days. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Swissotel resort phuket 4 thailand phuket o" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1084788.jpg" width="600"></div>
