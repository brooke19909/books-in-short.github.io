Company History</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Have you ever wanted to know who owns MTS?  Phone numbers with this mobile operator code are used by many people.  After all, MTS is included in the "Big Three" of Russian operators, along with Beeline and Megafon.  The customer base of the company has millions of people and has long gone beyond the boundaries of classical cellular communications.  Under the auspices of MTS, technology is being created, and the scientific and technical database of data transmission is being developed.  The company expands the range of services to meet the needs of customers. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  MTS Closed Joint-Stock Company (Mobile TeleSystems) was officially registered in 1993.  Due to the rapid growth and active attempts to monopolize the market of mobile operators, MTS is currently one of the largest telecommunications companies not only in Russia but also in the CIS.  Now it has in its assets many subsidiaries.  Even on a global scale, the company is among the ten most famous. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rspectr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Who owns the MTS phone number" class="if uuid-3209350" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97054/3209350.jpg"></div><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  In recent years, MTS has significantly diversified its own business.  For example, she began to produce phones under her own brand name (the only minus of most of them is support only for MTS SIM cards).  The company has become one of the most expensive brands in Russia.  Its value at the end of 2010 amounted to more than two hundred million rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The headquarters of the company is located in Moscow, however, MTS branches are found in many cities.  Already in 2013, their number exceeded several thousand.  About a quarter of them are flagship stores.  This is where you can find branded models of mobile devices.  A striking example is the touch MTS 970, released several years ago, as well as the MTS 945 GLONASS, supporting a satellite tracking system. </p><p>  Despite the current greatness, the path that the company took was not an easy one.  Those who own MTS now understand that the stories of their mobile communications corporation as a whole are closely intertwined. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trinova.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to find out who owns the MTS number" class="if uuid-3209351" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97054/3209351.jpg"></div><h2>  Way of development </h2><p>  Until the nineties of the last century, no one could have imagined that the frequency range of 900 MHz, designed for communication between pilots and the military, would not only be used for peaceful purposes, but would serve to create a mobile communications market. </p><p>  In 1992, the prototype of the modern GSM system was introduced, and later a competition for the ownership of the GSM-900 license was announced.  At that moment, a key event for the company occurred.  The victory in this competition was won by the monopolistic association Mobile Moscow, which was later renamed MTS. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The rights to the company at that time were divided between MGTS OJSC (Moscow City Telephone Network), German company DeTeMobil, Siemens and a number of small shareholders.  Later, the shares were redistributed several times, but most of them remained in the hands of domestic entrepreneurs, to whom MTS is still owned. </p><p>  The foundation of the company was laid.  A new mobile operator was introduced to the world, and the network coverage, in the 94th, with only one BSS station, began to expand rapidly.  The customer base, initially numbering only a few thousand subscribers, has exceeded one million over several years. </p><p>  This happened for two main reasons.  Firstly, the company moved from large centers to regions, actively expanding its services in places where there was practically no mobile communication.  A recognizable number was spreading throughout the country.  MTS quickly captured the market.  The success was affected by the effect of novelty, the lack of decent competition, the expansion of the technical base and the construction of new networks.  Those who owned the MTS number found themselves in a winning position. </p><p>  The second reason for economic victories was the active takeover of small companies that also provide communications services.  This facilitated the legal side of the issue regarding the provision of a license for the provision of telecommunication services.  So, a significant amount of shares of the Ukrainian operator UMC was purchased.  The corporation grew like a snowball, sweeping away competitors in its path. </p><h2>  Guide </h2><p>  In many ways, the development of MTS depended on its leader.  It was he who determined the vector along which the company was supposed to move.  This is a person for whom the success of the enterprise would be in the first place among all other values. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="twitter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Who owns MTS" class="if uuid-3205376" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97054/3205376.jpg"></div><h2>  Leonid Melamed and Mikhail Shamolin </h2><p>  After the global rebranding of the company, as a result of which it acquired its current form, Mikhail Shamolin stood at the helm, replacing Leonid Melamed.  The latter did not renounce business and became president of Sistema.  But it is interesting not only for this.  It is Melamed - the person to whom MTS previously belonged.  He proposed to make the familiar red-and-white egg symbolizing the company, symbolizing simplicity of form and promising content. </p><p>  Shamolin already had behind him not only an automobile and road institute, but also the knowledge acquired at the Russian Academy of Public Administration. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.forbes.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mikhail Shamolin" class="if uuid-3205377" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97054/3205377.jpg"></div><p>  The School of Business (WBS) in finance and management also influenced him.  It was she who prepared the bridgehead for his career growth: from a position at McKinsey &amp; Co to a managing director of the Ukrainian Interpipe Corporation.  Further, his path lay in MTS, in which he first served as vice president of sales, and three years later became president of the company. </p><h2>  Andrey Dubovsky </h2><p>  In the spring of 2011, he was replaced by Andrei Dubovsky.  By that time, the businessman was 45 years old, he graduated from VGIK and worked in the field of telecommunications.  Punchy character also led him to leadership positions.  After working for some time as the director of one of the branches of the corporation, he headed the company. </p><div class="photo" data-original="energysmi.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to find out who owns the MTS phone" class="if uuid-3209361" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97054/3209361.jpg"></div><h2>  World brand </h2><p>  MTS, as mentioned earlier, is more than a mobile operator.  It was in his stores that sales of BlackBerry and Apple devices began.  It was he who greatly influenced the spread of mobile Internet in Russia and the CIS. </p><p>  In 2008, the corporation was included in the list of hundreds of the best global brands, and in 2009 it became one of the world giants in the field of mobile communications.  By this time, more than 100 million people have become MTS subscribers.  The company passed international certification, according to the results of which it was standardized within the framework of ISO. </p><p>  Despite the status of the most expensive brand in Russia, those who owned MTS actively interacted with the roaming system, reducing prices for their services.  At the same time, the company did not reduce the quality of service, remaining one of the most reliable mobile operators. </p><p>  She began to actively collaborate with banking systems.  So, the MTS-Bank service was introduced, which allows using the phone as a payment device. </p><h2>  Company scandals </h2><p>  So big a corporation could not avoid black spots in its history.  Those who own MTS phone numbers are probably familiar with scandals and rumors that occasionally arise in the media. </p><p>  The peak of hype occurred in 2010.  At that time, some of the old subscribers suffered.  Without explaining any reasons, their tariffs were changed by the company itself to less favorable ones.  They quickly ‚Äúate‚Äù the bill and drove subscribers into a state of chronic debt.  Those whose SIM cards were inactive at that moment were most affected.  These people with considerable surprise found receipts of debt to the company. </p><p>  I got subscribers in roaming.  They could be debited from their account just for the reason that caused more than one trial. </p><p>  Criminal proceedings were instituted against the company for introducing paid services without the knowledge of subscribers.  It also adversely affected the <span>company's</span> popularity <span>.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="protarify.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to find out who the MTS phone number belongs to" class="if uuid-3209352" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97054/3209352.jpg"></div><h2>  How to find out who owns the MTS phone number </h2><p>  It often happens that people who they don‚Äôt know call people.  If a person simply made a mistake with the number, this is completely acceptable.  If the unknown person is too annoying, nobody likes it.  Of course, such situations arise not only with MTS subscribers.  How to find out who owns the phone?  This is not as easy as it may seem. </p><p>  The fact is that MTS operators do not have the right to disclose confidential information to individuals.  Only representatives of certain services, such as the police, can recognize her.  If you get a call by MTS number and are threatened at the same time, write a statement to the authorities. </p><p>  For a fee you can find out information using the company directory.  To do this, you need to fill out a special form on the site "number.  RU".  Another option is to buy a database on the radio market. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  MTS Company strives to diversify the services provided, responds constructively to criticism, and tries to correct all deficiencies in the work that users note.  In order to not only stay afloat, but also to develop successfully in the world of business related to mobile communications, it is necessary to modernize the service, use modern technologies, expand the range of capabilities of phone owners, increase the coverage area, introduce programs that are interesting for customers.  All this is carried out by the management of the company and its employees. </p>
