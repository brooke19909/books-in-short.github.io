Progress does not stand still.  Not so long ago, a new class of mobile devices - smart watches.  The very first versions of this <span>interesting gadget</span> were just appendages of a smartphone and did not know much how to do, but they cost a lot of money.  Now these devices have received new features, have fallen in price and have become affordable for most consumers. </p><h2>  Essence of the question </h2><p>  Since time immemorial, parents want to be able to find out where their child is currently located.  Each of us is worried about his child when he leaves for a walk on the street, goes alone to the sports section, and returns late from school.  With the advent of mobile phones, the situation improved somewhat, but still there were nuances: the child could lose the phone, not pick up the phone, not hear the call. </p><p>  A few years ago, a new class of devices appeared - children's smart watches, allowing parents to quickly find out the coordinates of their child‚Äôs location. </p>

    <p>  In this article, we will take a closer look at the smart baby watch Q80.  Reviews about this device are mostly positive.  The peculiarity of this watch is that it has a built-in GPS tracker and can be used as a mobile phone.  Let's see what helped them become so popular with consumers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Smart watches: a bit of theory </h2><p>  What are smart watches designed for?  At the dawn of its appearance, this device was conceived as a kind of "appendage" to the smartphone.  The watch was connected to the phone via the Bluetooth protocol.  The more expensive models had a touch screen and even a camera, while the cheaper ones represented a regular watch with additional functions for working with a smartphone.  What functions were originally performed by a classic smart watch: </p><ol><li>  Event Notification.  The clock informs you of an incoming call or SMS. </li><li>  Answer the call.  With an incoming call, it is not necessary to get the smartphone out of your bag or pocket, just answer the call by pressing the touch screen of the watch and talk. </li><li>  View SMS.  Ability to view incoming messages on the watch display. </li><li>  View the contacts in the phone book and the call log of your smartphone. </li><li>  The ability to control the clock playing the music player of the smartphone using a special application. </li><li>  The ability to take pictures using the camera built into the watch. </li><li>  The presence of built-in "sports" applications: pedometer, calorie counter, heart rate monitor. </li></ol><p>  The functionality of modern smart watches has expanded significantly.  Now the gadget can work separately from the smartphone and allows you to autonomously make calls and answer SMS.  Many devices even have a built-in GPS module. </p><p>  Children‚Äôs wristwatch Smart Baby Watch Q80 (analogue is the GW100 watch from Wonlex) has both a communication module and GPS.  We will study them more closely and analyze their capabilities in more detail. </p><h2>  Appearance and first impression </h2><p>  Watches at first sight attract attention.  This design, this color ... But first things first.  Let's start with the packaging.  A bright, fun little box immediately indicates the target audience of device users - children.  Customer reviews on the Smart Baby Watch Q80 model also indicate a successful delivery of goods.  Inside the box, everything is prosaic - the gadget itself is in a soft bag, a USB cable for charging, Russian sellers are adding instructions for setting the clock in Russian. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  So watch!  Color options for the case of a children's <span>watch with a</span> Smart Baby Watch <span>GPS tracker</span> can be as follows: pink, bright yellow, blue, blue and black.  There are plenty to choose from for both boys and girls.  The overall design is attractive.  The case may be a little too big, but this drawback is more than compensated by the advantages: rounded edges, low weight of the device, a successful strap fastening design (not directly to the case, but through movable metal loops) and a large margin of size adjustment when put on the hand. </p>

    <p>  There is a large display and a universal control button on the front of the watch.  On the left side is the SOS button for <span>emergency calls</span> and a miniUSB socket.  On the right side is a slot for a SIM card.  Below the watch is a hand-held sensor.  What is it for, consider later. </p><p>  <span>Smart children's watches Smart Baby Watch</span> Q80, according to reviews, left buyers only positive emotions.  Now we should dwell on the technical characteristics of the device. </p><h2>  Watch Specifications </h2><ol><li>  Sizes and weight.  Width - 31 mm, length - 48 mm, thickness - 11.8 mm, weight - 39 g. The watch is designed for a child's age from 3 to 12 years.

The built-in GSM radio module supports networks from 850 to 1900 MHz.  It uses a reduced size SIM card (micro-SIM). </li><li>  Wireless Modules  The watch has a GPS module on board to determine the coordinates.  It is noteworthy that there is also a Wi-Fi module, which by connecting to wireless networks significantly improves positioning accuracy. </li><li>  Display.

In addition, unlike previous models Q50 and Q60, it is touch-sensitive, which greatly facilitates the work with the device. </li><li>  CPU.  There is nothing particularly remarkable.  The gadget has an onboard processor MTK2503D with a frequency of 260 MHz.  For normal operation of the clock, the processor power is enough. </li><li>  Protection against dust and moisture.  The gadget has entry-level splash protection, that is, with the clock you can completely wash your hands and take a walk in the rain, but taking a shower with them or swimming in the pool is not recommended. </li><li>  Additional functions.

    <h2>  Watch user reviews </h2><p>  You can read the many parental reviews about the Smart Baby Watch Q80.  In general, users have positive impressions about watches, but there are also nuances. </p><p>  We will consider them in more detail: </p><ol><li>  Some users complain about the very fast discharge of the watch‚Äôs battery (lasts less than a day), although according to the specification the device must withstand up to 3 days in standby mode. </li><li>  The clock is registered on one smartphone and attached to it.  Many people have a question about what to do when you need to tie the clock to another device. </li><li>  There are problems with the microphone quality in some instances of the Smart Baby Watch Q80.  Parents hear the child very poorly. </li></ol><p>  Despite the above disadvantages, it should be noted that negative reviews relate to the operation of only certain instances of Smart Baby Watch Q80.  Perhaps these users came across fake watches, which, unfortunately, are enough on the sites of Chinese auctions. </p>
