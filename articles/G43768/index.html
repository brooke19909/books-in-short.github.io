How to see "My taxes" in the taxpayer dashboard</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  From time to time there comes a time when you need to see "My taxes" on the Internet on a special site.  This service is used when a citizen forgets about debt or does not receive a payment at all, but knows for sure that he must pay some kind of payment to the state treasury.  Every year, this issue becomes relevant closer to April - towards the end of the tax reporting period.  It is no secret to anyone that it is at this point that you need to pay off your debts and fees.  Otherwise, you can run into many problems.  Not sure how you can watch ‚ÄúMy taxes‚Äù on the Internet?  For action, the modern user is given a very good selection of alternative approaches.  And today we have to get to know them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="see my taxes" class="if" height="210" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1203173.jpg" width="460"></div>

    <h2>  Preliminary preparation </h2><p>  You need to start with preliminary preparation for the process.  Yes, you can do without it.  Only often it is she who helps to get rid of the question posed before us without problems and in the shortest possible time.  Why?  Just all the necessary documents and data will be at hand.  And this will greatly facilitate the process.  What might come in handy?  Firstly, your passport.  It will only need personal data, namely: last name, first name, middle name, date of birth.  Most often, even just a surname is enough.  In principle, this information is known to you.  And a passport by itself is not so necessary. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Secondly, TIN.  This is an important point that requires special attention.  Some citizens do not even know their individual number.  And it is difficult to find out My Taxes by TIN without it.  More precisely, it is impossible due to its absence.  So try to find out your individual number.  Or prepare an appropriate certificate with it.  Thirdly, sometimes you need information about the vehicle.  No matter how hard it is to guess, this applies when it comes to transport tax.  Prepare your driver's license and TCP.  This is not so difficult as it might seem at first glance.  In principle, that's all.  Now you can study the possible methods of checking taxes and debts that only take place.  Most of them, of course, use the Internet.  Do not be scared - all the proposed options are actually official and completely safe. </p><h2>  Personal Area </h2><p>  The first method that can only be offered is the use of the so-called personal account of the taxpayer.  The thing is that this resource is located on the official portal of the tax authorities of the Russian Federation.  And that means you can trust him.  Only not every user knows how exactly you can see ‚ÄúMy taxes‚Äù using ‚ÄúMy Account‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="my taxes personal account" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1203174.jpg" width="600"></div>

This is the address of the service we need.  You can log in to ‚ÄúTax.ru‚Äù yourself and look for it there.  But this is an extra waste of time and effort.  Not all users know exactly where to click to call the desired window.  Now what?  How can I see My Taxes? </p><p>  "My Account" on this service will help you.  Registration is optional.  Just after clicking on the link, accept the offer.  Then enter the necessary data.  This is passport information and TIN.  Please note: you can not print the middle name, but here the taxpayer number and his last name with the name must be indicated without fail.  All that remains now is to click on the "Find" button.  Wait a while.  In the window that appears, you will see all your debts and taxes.  You can download a payment card from the site for payment in pdf format.  To do this, there is a separate button on the right side of the screen (next to each payment). </p><h2>  Personally </h2><p>  Where can I see ‚ÄúMy taxes‚Äù on the Internet?  Frankly speaking, such an option as personal appeal to the tax authorities to obtain the necessary information has not lost its relevance.  It's no secret that this is an outdated, but accurate way.  For him, usually a certain amount of time is enough, as well as a passport. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="see my taxes by last name" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1203175.jpg" width="534"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  What do you need from you?  Just contact the <span>tax office in</span> your area with all the documents available and let us know that you would like to know everything on the topic ‚ÄúMy taxes‚Äù.  By TIN or in any other way.  Just hand over your documents to an employee.  He will search the database and give you all the information you need.  As you can see, nothing is difficult.  The main advantage of this method is that you can receive all payment documents on the spot and pay off debts.  Cons also exist - a waste of time, for example. </p><h2>  Call </h2><p>  Want to see My Taxes online?  Then it is better to use a stationary computer to carry out the task.  If you just want to know about debts, you can call the tax authorities.  This will not require a personal visit.  You will have to give your <span>passport details</span> (including series and number) and TIN.  That is, you must prove that you are indeed a taxpayer who seeks help. </p><p>  Not a good approach to solving the problem.  Why?  He has a lot of shortcomings.  Firstly, there will be no information before our eyes, everything will have to be remembered or written down.  Secondly, it‚Äôs usually difficult to reach the tax authorities in Russia, regardless of your location.  Thirdly, sometimes this process will be time-consuming.  In the end, you still need to receive payments to pay tax.  That is, immediately paying off with the state will not work. </p><h2>  Government services </h2><p>  Recently, all citizens of the Russian Federation have the opportunity to verify their debts using the State Services portal.  It is here that you can not only find the information you need, but also make payments by bank transfer, as well as apply for certain documents.  The main disadvantage of the system is that it needs to be registered in advance.  On the network, you can see ‚ÄúMy taxes‚Äù only after that.  Fortunately, there is nothing special in the process of establishing a profile.  Just click on the ‚ÄúRegister‚Äù button, and then enter your passport data. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="my taxes see tax" class="if" height="205" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1203172.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Important: no need to lie and write false information.  After all, your account will be created only once.  Information about the citizen can be changed, but this will cause some difficulties.  Once you complete the authorization, you can search for taxes.  How it's done?  You can use the context menu of the portal.  But this is not recommended.  Finding the only item in the middle of all the available options is not easy.  Instead, simply enter the phrase ‚Äútax arrears‚Äù into the search box on ‚ÄúGovernment Services‚Äù.  Or something like that.  You will be given the opportunity to select the function responsible for displaying information. </p><p>  What's next?  Select a method for finding a debtor.  For example, you can look at the surname in the My Taxes network.  Or using the TIN.  The second option is more popular.  Select it, in the field that appears, type the necessary information - and you're done.  You will see all the tax debts that you currently have.  If some payments were paid less than 10 days ago, they may not disappear from the system. </p><h2>  Online wallet </h2><p>  Another interesting way is to use electronic wallets.  More precisely, this option is more suitable for those citizens who do not care what they pay for.  They are sure that they owe some kind of debt, and it is repaid by bank transfer using an electronic wallet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to see my taxes" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1203171.jpg" width="600"></div>

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  In the My Taxes network, looking at the TIN in this case is as easy as shelling pears.  Log in to your online wallet, and then go to the "Services" section.  In the search, you can type the word ‚Äútaxes‚Äù or select the item ‚ÄúTaxes and penalties of the STSI‚Äù.  It remains to choose the option of searching for the debtor.  It is preferable to click on the "Search by TIN" function. </p><p>  Ready?  Then in the window that appears, type in the desired combination and complete the request.  Next, you will see a page that displays your taxes and debts with fines.  By the way, the penalty here will be displayed as a separate payment.  Moreover, for each tax or fine, if you have a delay, it will be separate.  In principle, that‚Äôs all.  Now you can either save the payment, or enter the details of the recipient and the debtor to the very end, repay the debt, and then print the receipt of payment.  This option is very welcome. </p><h2>  Federal Tax Service </h2><p>  In some cases, you can use the FTS website.  Every citizen has the right to see ‚ÄúMy taxes‚Äù in his personal account.  True, this method is not very popular.  All due to mandatory registration.  The profile is activated approximately 3 days after clicking on the link received in the email.  In addition, you will be given a special password that works for only a month.  You must change it during this period.  Otherwise, you will have to contact the Federal Tax Service of your area for a new one. </p><p>  After you get to the ‚ÄúMy Account‚Äù on the resource, you can search for the recipient.  Locate this line in the context menu, and then select the "By TIN" option.  Without this information, the idea cannot be realized.  Enter the required data and wait for the results.  Done!  Now it‚Äôs clear where you can see ‚ÄúMy taxes‚Äù in the virtual office.  From the site you can, as in the previous case, print out payments for payment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="find out my tax on tax" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1203170.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Payment of public services </h2><p>  There is another portal that will help to cope with the task.  It is called "Payment of public services."  On it you can not only see debts, but also pay them.  The main type of search is by INN.  By the way, transport tax is easy to find here.  But on the website of the Federal Tax Service you will not find it.  These data are not published there. </p><p>  What is required of you?  Go to the "Payment of public services" website, and then select "Taxes, fines."  We introduce, as in most cases, the TIN, and then we wait for the results.  It is advisable to supplement the information with passport data.  You can try to find "My taxes" ("My Account" will help with this) in the context menu.  But it can be quite difficult.  If we are talking about transport tax, you can dial your car number or data from the TCP.  The owner of the vehicle will be searched, after which the result with tax and debt will be displayed on the screen. </p><h2>  How to pay? </h2><p>  As you can see, there are a lot of options for obtaining the necessary information.  The Internet is now full of services and portals that help both pay bills and find them.  Find out on the My Taxes network by TIN (or without it)?  Easy.  What to do with payment? </p><p>  It has already been said - most Internet services allow you to quickly pay online.  Most often, the details of a bank card or electronic wallet are required.  Among all the available methods of paying taxes, there are: </p><ul><li>  contacting the bank (if you have any payments and passports with you); </li><li>  a visit to the tax authorities and the traffic police (for transport tax, for example); </li><li>  use of ATMs and payment terminals; </li><li>  Internet portal "Gosulugi"; </li><li>  website "Payment of public services"; </li><li>  Internet banking (like Sberbank Online) </li><li>  electronic wallets. </li></ul>

    <p>  Which way to choose?  This is a purely individual solution.  Every citizen has the right to freedom of choice in the current issue.  The main thing is that you pay taxes in time and can confirm the payments made.  Most often, people choose ATMs, Internet banking, and the payment of public services.  Checking My Taxes online is, as you can see, easier than it might seem. </p>
