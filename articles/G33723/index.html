Opening code</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Dozens of years ago, there were no additional common house protections from unwanted visitors in the houses, or <span>combination locks</span> were installed <span>.</span>  Far from the most reliable method, it could not help to completely secure the apartments.  But progress does not stand still.  <span>Coded locks were</span> replaced by so-called intercoms.  These are electronic devices that open with a special magnetic key.  You can pay for the ‚ÄúFactorial‚Äù doorphone, like any other, through your subscriber‚Äôs personal account, if you have one.  Otherwise, the postman brings a receipt every month, which can be paid at any bank. </p><p>  If a <span>factorial intercom is</span> installed in the house <span>, how to open it</span> without a key?  This is quite difficult to do.  The best tips and tricks presented to attention will certainly help to bring the idea to life.  With the right approach, you can easily open any intercom, not just Factorial. </p><h2>  Production matters </h2><p>  Nevertheless, you will have to try.  Each intercom has its own distinctive features.  Pay attention to the manufacturer.  Some companies were not too worried about hacking issues. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="intercom factorial how to open without a key" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1407951.jpg"></div>

    <p>  This statement is not relevant for the considered device model.  How to hack the "Factorial" intercom?  This is not so easy.  After all, the production of this system is domestic, therefore the intercom is adapted not only to various climatic conditions, the manufacturer responsibly approached the issue of hacking.  This means that the creators are worried about the security system of the intercom to the maximum. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Key </h2><p>  Nevertheless, there are several tricks that will help solve all the issues associated with opening the device.  The most reliable way, which allows you to open any intercom without any problems, is to obtain a key programmed for a specific house. </p><p>  If a citizen does not have it, you need to get it, or do it yourself (more on this later).  Further it will be possible to use the key when opening the door.  Quite often, this option is not considered as real.  After all, getting a key is not an easy task.  Are there any other opening secrets that the Factorial doorphone hides?  How to open this device without a key? </p><h2>  House call </h2><p>  Yes, there are options.  Only it should be remembered that no method can be considered completely successful.  There is always a chance of failure.  If you need to get into the house with an intercom, it does not matter which one, you can try to call the apartments and ask them to open the door.  Introduce yourself, for example, as a neighbor who forgot his key, a postman, a courier. </p><p>  Most often, after the doorphone on the other side of the line is removed, many are lost and do not know what to say.  It is recommended to introduce oneself, as has already been said, by couriers, postmen, or any other employees who should be allowed into the houses without hindrance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="code from the intercom factorial" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1407950.jpg"></div>

Sooner or later, residents will stop letting uninvited guests into the house, especially since now usually all postmen are provided with separate copies of the keys to the intercom, or special combinations that help open the access door without much difficulty. </p><h2>  We select the code </h2><p>  Now you can consider more successful ways out of the situation.  The house has an intercom "Factorial".  How to open it without a key?  To do this, you need to pick up a specific code that will unlock the door for a while.  This combination works as much as when using a magnetic key. </p><p>  For most doorphone models, you should select the codes yourself.  Many manage to do this.  True, with "Factorial" everything is somewhat different.  What is it about?  Most residents indicate that it is impossible to find the password for the ‚ÄúFactorial‚Äù doorphone on their own.  Only if you use several common combinations.  And that is not the fact that they will work.  Therefore, independent key selection is not relevant for this device.  You should not even try. </p><h2>  Call to service </h2><p>  The following approach is used extremely rarely.  It is most often doomed to failure, because we are talking about calling a support service.  It is here that they will help to answer why the code from the ‚ÄúFactorial‚Äù doorphone does not work.  Or rather, why it is not possible to open the door. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="intercom handset" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1407949.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Not a single technique is safe from system failures, so even intercoms have a so-called support service.  Communication phones are usually written next to the device at the entrance to the entrance, so at any time you can call and clarify all the information of interest.  For example, we can say that the doorphone is working in the apartment, but the key has stopped.  Have to play the role of a resident of the house who wants to open the door.  If it is possible to prove that the caller is the real owner of the key, then it is likely that a citizen will be helped to program the magnetic key by telephone so that you can use it again. </p><h2>  Six characters to help </h2><p>  Nevertheless, as already mentioned, the previous option is rather just an alternative solution, which is extremely rare in practice.  Want to hack the Factorial intercom?  How to open it without a key?  To do this, you need to enter a special code that gives the go-ahead to unlock the front door. </p><p>  It has already been said that it is almost impossible to pick up a key.  However, residents often give each other advice on how to open the door.  The code from the ‚ÄúFactorial‚Äù doorphone should consist of 6 characters, so this is the combination that should be used. </p><p>  Which options do they most often offer?  To open the intercom, you need to dial "000000" on it, then press the call button.  If there was no reprogramming of the device, then it unlocks the front door. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="intercom key" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1407948.jpg"></div>

    <p>  That's not all.  Is there a ‚ÄúFactorial‚Äù intercom on the door?  The opening (unlocking) code may be as follows: "123456".  After dialing, you need to ring the combination.  If done correctly, the door will open. </p><p>  However, these options do not work as often.  As practice shows, more and more often citizens are asking to reprogram this device.  During the operation, the access code changes radically.  So, standard offers will not work. </p><h2>  Combination </h2><p>  What other hacking tips can you find?  For example, many users indicate that the previously listed combinations should be used together.  What does it mean?  The key to the ‚ÄúFactorial‚Äù doorphone is ‚Äú123456‚Äù.  But it is only entered after access to the programming of the device is obtained by dialing "000000". </p><p>  In other words, to open the intercom, first you need to press "0" 6 times, then wait a few seconds and dial the combination from 1 to 6 inclusive.  After that, the incoming presses on the "Call" button and waits.  This technique helps in some cases. </p><h2>  Alternative </h2><p>  But even on the previously proposed options, the struggle with the intercom does not end.  There is another small alternative.  She has a great chance of success.  To do this, you must strictly follow a certain algorithm of actions. </p><p>  What is required from someone who wants to enter the house by breaking into the "Factorial" intercom?  How to open it without a key?  To do this, click on "5", then wait a while.  It will be enough 3-5 seconds.  Then dial the combination "180180", after which you need to click on the "Call" button.  As soon as this step is completed, you need to click on the number "4" and again dial the password you typed. </p><p>  If everything is done correctly, the door will open.  Neither a special magnetic key, nor any separate 6-digit access code is needed.  Like all the previously proposed tricks, this one is not successful.  It is noted that it acts quite rarely.  It is impossible to predict when and where this alternative password will work. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="intercom factorial opening code" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1407953.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  No programming </h2><p>  The manual of the ‚ÄúFactorial‚Äù intercom, which is attached to this device, has a note that this device can be reprogrammed if desired.  Then access to the entrance to the house will be almost impossible.  Only employees who service this or that device will be able to cope with the task. </p><p>  Nevertheless, there is always the possibility that no one has reprogrammed the intercom.  So, you can use the generally accepted methods that help to break the electronic lock.  What other solutions do residents offer each other? </p><p>  For example, a method that requires some skill.  Not the fact that you can use it the first time.  There is also no guarantee that he will be able to open the porch door, but it‚Äôs worth a try.  Has a citizen decided to hack the Factorial intercom?  How to open without a key and its specialists? </p><p>  To do this, you need to simultaneously press and hold for several seconds the buttons with numbers: "2", "0", "1".  After a while, horizontal bars appear on the display near the keyboard.  As soon as this happens, click on the ‚Äú4‚Äù button, then click on ‚ÄúCall‚Äù. </p><p>  The door should open without any bells.  Some recommend simply clamping all the buttons on the doorphone panel until several horizontal stripes appear on the display, and then press "4". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="password from doorphone factorial" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1407952.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Cracker </h2><p>  Perhaps all the existing methods are clear.  There is one more trick.  But it is considered illegal.  The citizen will act at his own risk.  Now you can find offers that promise the manufacture of universal magnetic keys for intercoms.  It is proposed to seek the help of such companies.  For a moderate fee, a person will be given a key to a particular brand of intercom.  In this case, it is advisable to indicate at which address the appeal is planned. </p><p>  Thus, you can get a personal intercom key, and unauthorized.  Often, fraudsters are hidden under proposals for the manufacture of magnetic keys for intercoms (any).  The maximum that they provide is a false door opener.  The key will not work in practice.  At the same time, manufacturers do not give any guarantees.  A waste of time and money.  This approach can only be considered as theoretically existing. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  The doorphone key is the easiest and most realistic way to open a locked door.  Only with its presence will a citizen be able to freely enter this or that house. </p><p>  Each intercom has a number of its own characteristics.  You can choose an access password for the majority yourself, but not for Factorial.  This device almost always undergoes a reprogramming procedure.  Therefore, all standard access codes are not suitable in most cases.  You have to find out by all means what combination you need to dial so that you do not need a key to open the door of the house. </p><p>  Some prefer to use the services of companies that make universal "openers."  Intercom "Factorial" is unlikely to be opened using such a key, but some believe in it.  It is recommended not to resort to this method in order to save money and time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to hack intercom factorial" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1407954.jpg"></div>

    <p>  If no passwords help, it is recommended that you simply call someone on the doorphone and ask them to open the door.  It is desirable that these were residents from the upper floors.  It has already been said that this method is quite effective.  There are no other alternatives. </p>
