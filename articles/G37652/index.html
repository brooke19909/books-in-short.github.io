    <h2>  Internal rules </h2><p>  In accordance with the rules adopted at the Tsanotel 3 * hotel (Limassol, Cyprus), check-in of newly arrived guests is done after two in the afternoon.  If you arrived earlier than this date and your room is ready, you can enter it immediately.  As a rule, such an opportunity is absent in the midst of the tourist season, when the hotel is filled, as they say, ‚Äúto the eyeballs‚Äù.  In this case, you will be prompted to leave things in the luggage storage room and go for lunch, to the pool, for a walk or immediately straight to the beach. </p><p>  On the day of departure, in accordance with the <span>internal rules</span> , it is necessary to free your room, hand over the keys and pay for the period of stay before noon.  Payment can be made both in cash and with plastic cards of such systems as "Visa", "Mastercard", "American Express" and "Diners Club".  If you have already pre-paid with a travel agency for accommodation, in the hotel you will only have to pay for additional services, if you have used them. </p><h2>  Accommodation with children </h2><p>  Since the Tsanotel 3 * hotel is positioning itself, among other things, as a place for family holidays, guests who come to rest with children of all ages are only welcome here.  In this case, if you place a baby up to two years old in a crib or a child up to twelve years old in an extra bed, then you do not have to pay extra for this.  Placing adults and older children on an extra bed will cost 20 euros per night per person.  Each room can accommodate no more than one extra child or adult bed.  The need to provide such a service should be notified in advance to the administration and wait for confirmation from it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Reviews about Tsanotel Hotel (Limassol, Cyprus) </h2><p>  Since today more and more travelers in the process of selecting a hotel in a particular country pay much attention to the opinion of compatriots who have already been there, we summarized several comments by Russians who spent their summer vacation at Tsanotel.  It should be noted that, like the whole island of Cyprus, Tsanotel 3 * for the most part left a pleasant impression on tourists.  But we offer to understand everything in more detail. </p><p>  So, with regard to the rooms and the entire decoration of the hotel, thanks to the reconstruction carried out last year, everything here looks very decent and modern.  The decor in the rooms is quite simple, without frills, but comfortable and cozy.  Bathrooms have good and trouble-free plumbing.  Everything is very clean, cleaning is done six days a week with the exception of Sunday.  The only thing that slightly disturbed some vacationers was the continuous operation of the <span>central air conditioner,</span> regardless of the air temperature in the room.  Therefore, sometimes tourists were a little cool in the room.  Otherwise, there are no complaints about the numbers. </p><p>  The real "bone of contention" in the comments of travelers is often the issue of nutrition.  I must say that the Tsanotel hotel is an exception to the rule here.  So, most tourists note a good level of food quality.  Of course, there wasn‚Äôt much variety of dishes here, but this is a normal situation for a three-star hotel.  Nobody remained hungry. </p><p>  As for the pool at the hotel, some of our compatriots found it quite good.  However, for some tourists, the water in it seemed too chlorinated. </p><p>  Since the vast majority of travelers come to Cyprus to relax on the sea coast, the issue of the beach is one of the most important.  So, the nearest municipal beach is really just a couple of hundred meters from the Tsanotel hotel.  You can reach it in a leisurely step in just a few minutes.  It is quite clean, with pleasant fine volcanic sand and a gentle entry into the water. </p>
