The ancient city-state of Kition, where Larnaca is located - a large port city in Cyprus, founded in the 13th century BC.  e.  No matter what the difficult times, this city remained true to itself and its traditions. </p><h2>  Larnaca History </h2><p>  It is mentioned in the Bible as the settlement of Kitim, which was built by the grandson of Noah.  By the 9th century, this city had become such an important and large port at the intersection of trade routes between Europe and Asia, that even if it was raided and ruined, it was quickly restored. </p><p>  The Mycenaean Greeks were the first to settle Larnaca, but as it was settled down and its strategic importance increased, the Phoenicians, Persians, Egyptians, Assyrians and others fought for the right to own the city. For example, under the Phoenicians, he achieved unprecedented power and prosperity, but whoever he belongs to always remained autonomy. </p><p>  Sailors and merchants of antiquity knew well where Larnaca was located, although the city received this name only in the 12th century.  This is due to the fact that an ancient burial place was discovered on its territory, and the word ‚Äúlarnaca‚Äù means ‚Äúsarcophagus‚Äù. </p>

    <p>  Today it is a world famous resort, all of whose beaches have a sign of environmental cleanliness - the blue flag.  <span>The archaeological site</span> and the UNESCO-protected ancient city are located in the center of the place where Larnaca is located.  In which country, besides Cyprus, you can not only relax on a beautiful beach, but also feel like a scientist, having been among the workers of the expedition! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  Unlike other resorts of the island, tourism is only developing in Larnaca, and the infrastructure of beaches continues to be equipped.  Perhaps that is why here is the cheapest vacation in Cyprus.  In addition, where the city of Larnaca is located, there are no white beaches.  The sand has a yellowish tint, and it has to be cleaned daily from algae. </p><p>  On <span>Mackenzie beach,</span> for example, sand is a gray-yellow hue, but it is wide enough, and its gentle slope into the sea makes it very attractive for couples with children and elderly people to relax.  Its attraction is the promenade, immediately following the pedestrian road that separates the beach area from the city limits.  There are numerous cafes and bars where you can eat tasty and inexpensively without returning to the hotel for this. </p><p>  Finikoudes is another beach, famous for its date alley, which not only city visitors, but also locals like to walk. </p>

    <p>  The resort area where Larnaca is located is equipped with three-star hotels, which also makes the resort accessible to poor tourists.  Perhaps that is why in the season all rooms are occupied, and the beaches are crowded. </p><h2>  Church of St. Lazarus </h2><p>  This temple is the most revered Christian shrine on the island.  Resurrected by Jesus on the fourth day after his death, Lazarus arrived in Cyprus in the year 45, when he was still known to the whole world as Kition.  In 47, he was visited by the apostles Paul and Barnabas, who made Lazarus the first Bishop of Citation.  The temple was built in the 9th century at the burial place of the saint, but by then his relics had been forgotten.  Only the fire and further rebuilding of the church helped to find the steps going underground, where the ancient crypt turned out to be.  Today, a sarcophagus with relics can be seen by visiting the temple, which is one of the oldest functioning Christian churches on the island. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Visit it for free.  Women in the service do not have to cover their heads with a scarf, but if the visitor is wearing trousers, the servant will strongly recommend wearing a special apron. </p><h2>  Crusader Fortress </h2><p>  Larnaca Castle was built as a fortress in the 14th century.  Its main purpose was to protect the harbor from pirate attacks.  At this time, the Lusignans ruled Cyprus.  Until the 17th century, it was repeatedly subjected to destruction and fires, so that every time it was rebuilt and restored.  When the island came under British control, a prison was made in the castle, where criminals were executed until 1948. </p><p>  After that, the <span>Museum of the Middle Ages</span> was opened in it <span>,</span> where there are many interesting exhibits telling about various eras of the development of Cyprus - from early Christianity from the time of Lazarus to the 20th century.  Today, fairs and festivals are held on the castle‚Äôs territory, which you should definitely visit, as Cypriots love to relax and have fun, which means there will be music, dancing and delicious local food. </p><h2>  Salt lake </h2><p>  For thousands of years, the city of Larnaca, where this lake is located, has been a place where people came for salt.  Today it is also mined here.  It is interesting that in the hot season, when the water evaporates, the lake is covered with a layer of salt up to 10 cm thick. All the city guests come to see how it shimmers with all the colors of the rainbow in the sun. </p><p>  In the winter rainy season, the lake is filled with water, and then people come to it to admire the migratory birds that fly here for the winter.  Here you can see ducks, swans and pink flamingos at the same time. </p>

    <p>  Especially for exploring this unique natural monument, benches are set around it that are never empty, the lake is so beautiful at any time of the year. </p><h2>  Diving other activities </h2><p>  Thanks to the Zenobia ferryboat that sank in 1980, all diving enthusiasts know where Larnaca is in Cyprus.  The ferry wreck itself became an unforgettable event - the snow-white giant slowly fell to one side, near the island in broad daylight. </p><p>  Today, both beginners and experienced divers dive to it, although it is located at a shallow depth.  Traveling along its corridors and cabins is an interesting sight, although the ferry itself can also be seen from a pleasure boat, the water is so clear here. </p>
