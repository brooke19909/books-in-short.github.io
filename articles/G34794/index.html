One is located on the mainland, near the city of Sorrento, in the resort of Sant'Agnello.  But the hotel, which will be discussed here, is located on the island of Sicily.  The nearest cities are Messina and Catania.  And the resort town where the hotel is located is called Taormina.  What can be said about her?  What are the beaches at this resort and when is it best to relax?  We will touch on this issue in our article.  But the main attention we will devote to the hotel "Corallo" 4 * in Taormina.  Tourists often describe it and for the most part praise it.  What did they like so much in the Sicilian Quartet?  What are the disadvantages of the hotel?  This we learn from the reviews of tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Corallo 4 Sicily" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2000895.jpg" width="576"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  If the star status of a hotel was determined by its location, then the Corallo 4 * hotel (Sicily) would have long been the "five".  It rises on the first line of the sea, and not somewhere, but in the beautiful bay of Villagonia.  By the way, it is not only a wonderful place for a beach holiday, but also of historical interest.  This harbor, sheltered from storms, was used as a natural port by the ancient Greeks, then the Romans, then the Goths, the Spaniards and so on.  The town is conditionally divided into two parts: ancient Taormina and the spa Taormino Mare.  The last area has been mastered by the tourism business for a long time.  Hotel "Corallo 4 *", which is located there, was built in the 60s of the last century.  Of course, she underwent renovations and repairs many times.  The complex stands in a wonderful location with panoramic views of Cape Taormina and the bay of Naxos.  The hotel is 40 kilometers from Messina, and 60 from Catania. The popular tourist destination Giardini Naxos is just a kilometer from the hotel.  In walking distance (less than 200 meters) stretches the wonderful beach of Baia di Villagonia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Corallo 4 Taormina" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2000892.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is built in typical Sicilian style.  The small territory of the hotel consists of several terraces connected by stairs.  At the very bottom is a swimming pool.  Green arches, like tunnels of boxwood and flowering wisteria, lead you upstairs to the building.  On the ground floor there is a restaurant.  Its windows and the veranda offer panoramic views of the Giardini Naxos bay.  Guests are accommodated on the second and third floors.  From there, even more spectacular views open up.  In the evening, the hotel turns on the lights, and it becomes like a fabulous gingerbread house.  The furniture in the restaurant and the lobby is beautiful, antique.  Reviews say that this hotel will appeal to those who love the good old Europe with its leisurely and good quality. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel corallo" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2000893.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where guests are accommodated </h2><p>  Many love big hotels.  But the very spirit of hospitable Italy can be felt only in such small cozy hotels as Corallo 4 * in Sicily.  Its number of rooms is only 36 rooms.  It is enough to know each guest in person and treat him as a dear guest.  Yes, and the rooms themselves, although they are divided into categories with sea or mountain views, are individually decorated and do not look like one another.  There are rooms for one guest, for two and three guests.  Each room is equipped with a sauna, which, in addition to a bath or shower, has a bidet.  All rooms have personal balconies with wicker furniture - a small table and chairs.  The rooms are equipped with technology: air conditioning with individual temperature control, TV, telephone, safe, hairdryer and minibar.  They clean the premises every day, and bed linen is changed every three days. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Corallo 4 reviews" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2000894.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beaches in Taormina </h2><p>  The coast of Giardini Naxos is considered one of the best in Sicily.  Therefore, the resort itself is crammed with wealthy tourists, and hotel prices there "bite".  Taormina is located at the foot of Mount Tauro, and to Giardini Naxos go about a kilometer from it - 10-15 minutes.  Sicily has few sandy beaches.  Therefore, the coast of Giardini Naxos is so popular.  The best beach is Lido di Naxos, with a soft sand.  It is located near the Sporting Baia Hotel.  Pebble beaches in Taormina.  Hotel "Corallo" 4 * owns its own piece of the coast.  To get to it, you need to cross the road through an underground tunnel.  The beach is covered with pebbles.  Sunbeds and umbrellas are free for hotel guests.  Alternative to the sea can serve as pools.  There are two of them - for adults and for children.  Reviews say it‚Äôs good there in the morning.  In the afternoon, a shadow from the Tauro Mountain creeps onto the terrace near the pools, so that you will not be able to sunbathe. </p><h2>  Hotel Infrastructure </h2><p>  Corallo 4 * in Sicily is a quiet family hotel.  If you like animation and parties, you are clearly not here.  But in the hotel there are almost no Russians.  So you can relax in it not only from noise, but also from compatriots.  The main contingent of vacationers are Germans, French, and in August - Italians from the mainland (they have their vacation time at the end of summer).  Therefore, the hotel service is designed for Europeans.  There is free and fast enough Wi-Fi, room service, high chairs for babies in a restaurant, a children's pool.  The reception desk is open around the clock and its staff speaks excellent English.  Many in their reviews pay tribute to the friendliness and courtesy of the hotel staff.  The hotel accepts pets.  Parking is available twenty meters from the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sicily in September" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2000906.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  When to go to Taormina: Sicily in September </h2><p>  The tourist season on the Italian island lasts from early May to late October.  But reviews report that the deep Mediterranean Sea at the end of spring still does not have time to warm up.  And even in July and August, the difference in air and water temperatures is very noticeable: +30 and +22 degrees, respectively.  In addition, in the summer, Taormina is crowded with people.  Art lovers who flock to this resort for the annual festival flock to beach vacationers as well.  Many people come from mainland Italy.  But in September, Sicily can pleasantly surprise a traveler.  The sea remains still warm (+20 ... +21 <sup></sup> ), and the heat decreases slightly.  In the shade during the day in Taormina it is +27 <sup>o</sup> C. It is quite a comfortable temperature to tear your back off the sunbed on the beach and go on excursions. </p><h2>  What to see in Taormina </h2><p>  Speaking about the location of Corallo 4 *, in the reviews, guests repeatedly mention that the hotel is very close to the train station.  And this makes the hotel a convenient starting point for traveling around the island.  But first you need to examine Taormina herself.  This ancient town in the Middle Ages (in the 9th century) was the capital of the island under the rule of Byzantium.  Taormina, like a swallow's nest, perched on the side of a mountain.  To get there, you need to take the funicular (a few minutes walk from the Corallo 4 * hotel), take a serpentine ride or climb a steep path for about a quarter of an hour.  In Taormina, the 2nd century amphitheater and numerous medieval buildings have been preserved.  You also need to go or go to Giardini Naxos.  If not for the sake of sandy beaches, then for the sake of its glorious history.  Indeed, during the time of Ancient Rome, the first botanical garden in Europe was laid out here. </p>
