When issuing loans today, almost all banks offer insurance coverage.  Despite the fact that this procedure is not mandatory at all, many credit organizations impose it on borrowers. </p><h2>  Conditions </h2><p>  Home Credit offers a choice of several programs: Asset Plus, Combot, insurance of property, purchased goods, bank cards, as well as family members of the borrower and him from certain accidents. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.plusworld.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="home loan insurance statement" class="if uuid-3156934" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/3156934.jpg"></div><p>  Home Credit loan insurance is not obligatory, and ignoring it cannot lead to a refusal to issue a loan.  For borrowers who wish to insure, it will be enough just to inform the manager about the decision.  The amount of the service depends on the choice of type of insurance.  Today, the following companies cooperate with Home Credit Bank: Renaissance Life, PPF Insurance and the Regional Insurance Institution. </p><p>  Before signing the contract, you need to get acquainted with the list of insurance events included in the selected program.  Upon their occurrence, borrowers have the right to demand the immediate payment of amounts due.  These funds will be used to repay the loan debt.  What documents are needed for Home Credit loan insurance? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Documentation </h2><p>  To obtain insurance, the client will need to present their passport, and information from credit documentation is also used.  To receive the promised amount, it is necessary to draw up a statement of the established form.  Documents confirming the occurrence of the insured event, and the amount of damage when it really took place, shall be attached to it. </p><h2>  Home Credit Life Insurance </h2><p>  Such a service is a guarantee of repayment of a loan in case of death of the borrower and the Central Bank may include a clause on life insurance in the contract.  By signing it, customers must familiarize themselves with all the available items and subsequently do not present claims of the credit organization. </p><div class="photo" data-original="irecommend.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="home loan waiver of insurance" class="if uuid-3160418" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67477/3160418.jpg"></div><p>  This type of insurance in Home Credit Bank can reach up to thirty to forty percent of the loan amount, which is extremely unprofitable for the borrower.  In the event that such a clause is absent in the loan agreement, then customers have the right to refuse to take out insurance without giving a reason. </p><p>  Often, managers insist on life insurance, citing the transfer of debts to close relatives of a citizen after his death.  But the automatic transfer of a loan obligation to the spouse of a deceased borrower is allowed only if the inheritance is notarized.  When the borrower has no property, then there can be no question of any inheritance of debt. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Home Credit life insurance, as well as health insurance, is an independent transaction that is not related to the issuance of a loan.  When applying for insurance, borrowers sign a separate insurance agreement.  According to the law, the transaction can be terminated at the request of one of the parties.  In the event that the imposed service was nevertheless documented, it is best to terminate the Home Credit loan insurance agreement as soon as possible.  Moreover, almost the entire amount can be used to repay the basic debt of the loan. </p><h2>  Can a customer refuse this service? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="mari-a.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="home loan bank insurance" class="if uuid-3160412" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67477/3160412.jpg"></div><p>  The banking product insurance procedure is not required at all.  True, in practice, the rejection of Home Credit insurance is practically impossible.  Credit managers use different methods of selling insurance to borrowers.  Often, bank customers are not sufficiently informed about their ability to refuse the imposed service. </p><p>  If the client does not want to enter into an insurance agreement, the manager can secretly influence the institution's decision to grant a loan.  It is enough for this to write in a certain field that the client is very nervous, which means that he is not trustworthy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In the event that a potential borrower has decided that he does not need additional services, then simply inform the manager about it.  No one can force them, so you can apply for a waiver of insurance.  With insurance at Home Credit, this can be done very simply, let's take a closer look at the features. </p><h2>  How can I refuse if the loan is not issued </h2><p>  In the event of a dispute with the issuance of credit insurance, clients can send complaints to the manager at the territorial or the head office of the financial institution.  At the same time, it is required to register it with a bank branch by marking receipt. </p><p>  When a complaint is sent by mail, the receipt of the letter must be retained until the end of the proceedings.  You can also send a letter of delivery with notification.  The bank must provide a written response to the complaint. </p><h2>  Refund of loan insurance </h2><p>  The faster borrowers decide to get rid of imposed insurance, the more chances they have not to overpay on their loan.  The first thing you need to do is call the company on the phone number indicated on the policy.  During the conversation, you must inform about your desire to terminate the insurance contract in Home Credit on the fact of its uselessness.  Representatives of insurers must indicate which documents, and, in addition, where, must be submitted to terminate the relevant contract. </p><div class="photo" data-original="irecommend.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="home loan life insurance" class="if uuid-3160417" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67477/3160417.jpg"></div><p>  A package of papers can be sent to the email address of the company.  Each copy must be certified with the phrase ‚Äúcopy is correct‚Äù, putting a date with the signature of the borrower.  Then, in a free form, a statement is written with a request to terminate the insurance contract due to the lack of need for such. </p><p>  In the application for insurance in "Home Credit" indicate the details of the account for the subsequent transfer of the amount.  Mostly a credit score is reported.  Within ten days, the paper will be considered, and the money is transferred for its intended purpose.  You can duplicate all the information if you send a copy of the documentation on paper using a registered letter. </p><p>  How fast you get your money back depends on how much money you get back.  If this decision was made immediately after signing the contract, there is a high probability that everyone will be returned to you.  If the agreement has already entered into force, they will deduct the cost of the service for this period from the total insurance amount. </p><p>  After the early repayment of the mortgage remains the most funds.  A certain amount can be returned even after repayment of the loan.  But it is important to understand that money can only be returned through an insurance company.  The lending institution does not have the authority to return the funds paid. </p><p>  In case of refusal to return the insurance amount, you can go to court to the company or the bank.  If the loan agreement contains a clause on non-return of the premium in case of early termination, then to return the money, unfortunately, will be very problematic.  What other insurance is provided in Home Credit LLC? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.callcentersforhire.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="home loan insurance waiver of insurance" class="if uuid-3156928" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/3156928.jpg"></div><h2>  By bank credit card </h2><p>  To protect financial resources on card accounts, a program called "Card Insurance" is provided.  It allows you to save customers' savings on plastic in a number of the following cases: </p><ul><li>  With illegal deduction of money as a result of fraud. </li><li>  Theft or other loss of funds that were withdrawn from the card in the terminal. </li></ul><p>  When making an agreement, customers are offered to conclude an insurance contract.  At the same time, they issue a policy under the name "card protection".  In the event that after receiving the plastic the client did not use the money, then the insurance will not work.  If the finances were withdrawn or debited from the account by bank transfer, then it will be active until the debt is paid off. </p><p>  In the event of an insured event, the plastic holder will be able to call the manager at any time on the phone number indicated on the policy.  Documents that confirm the illegal debit of funds from the card, and the application are sent by letter to the main office of the company. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.meltonmcfadden.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="home loan insurance contract" class="if uuid-3156927" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/3156927.jpg"></div><h2>  Advice to borrowers </h2><p>  When registering a service at Home Credit, lawyers recommend that clients carefully read all of the loan documentation immediately before signing.  Refusal from an imposed product on a bank's decision to issue a loan does not affect what must always be taken into account.  But in case of refusal of insurance, a financial institution may increase interest on a loan. </p><h2>  How can I get insurance at Home Credit? </h2><p>  This service gives the client the confidence that in the event of unforeseen life circumstances, the credit burden will not fall on the shoulders of the borrower and his relatives.  In the bank in question, the size of such a product is one hundred and ten percent of the amount of credit debt. </p><p>  To receive payments, within a month from the moment of the insured event, you must contact the company in person or send all the necessary documentation by mail.  Copies of papers must be notarized. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rv-mo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ooh home loan insurance" class="if uuid-3160430" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67477/3160430.jpg"></div><p>  After receiving all the documents, the insurer checks their accuracy and legality within ten days.  If everything is in order, then the client will receive insurance by transferring funds to the account.  Any contentious issues are resolved in court. </p>
