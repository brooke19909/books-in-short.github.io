All transactions are made on it.  In trading on financial markets, there are various terminals that have their own characteristics and characteristics.  This article will detail the Quick trading floor.  The reader will receive information about the correct Quik settings for various trading assets and its installation. </p><h2>  Features of stock trading </h2><p>  Trading in financial markets takes place in various directions: stock and commodity exchanges, Forex, cryptocurrency, binary options and much more.  It is very important for a speculator or even less an investor to have complete information in order to timely monitor any changes occurring in the market. </p><p>  Quite often, many assets correlate with each other.  This property allows us to assume the growth or fall of one instrument in relation to another.  Since all assets are very different in their characteristics, it is almost always difficult to track their dynamics in one place. </p><h2>  Tool types </h2><p>  All trading assets can be divided into several groups, which depend on the direction of trade and the type of market. </p><p>  Types of trading assets: </p><ol><li>  Shares of companies, government and commercial bonds, shares, deposits, debt receipts and other securities. </li><li>  Futures, options contracts. </li><li>  Market indices. </li><li>  Currency pairs. </li><li>  Metals (gold, silver) and other tools. </li></ol><p>  All trading assets have their own specifics, volatility, features that a trader needs to know and be able to systematize, as well as analyze the data received. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Advantages of Quik Terminal </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="setting up a quik terminal" class="if uuid-3267621" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41139/3267621.jpg"></div><p>  Above in the article, it was not in vain that information was provided on the diversity of assets and the characteristics of exchange trading.  Modern trading is a very high volatility in almost all assets, which can not always be quickly and efficiently analyzed.  Unfortunately, not every platform provides such opportunities for the trader, where you can fully engage in the analysis and forecasting of changes in quotations in one place.  The MetaTrader platform is perfect for the forex market, but its use is simply impossible for the stock market, since there are no corresponding functions for futures and securities. </p><p>  Therefore, for these purposes, the developers created the Quick platform.  It allows you to visually see any changes in a variety of assets that can be tracked simultaneously.  Setting up Quik for trading is not at all complicated, even a beginner can handle it.  It is important to study the instructions and repeat the necessary steps. </p><p>  Using Quik settings correctly, you can trade more efficiently.  In addition, simultaneously monitor the movement of quotes of various assets, conduct market analysis, systematize the data obtained, create a portfolio for investment and much more. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Terminal settings </h2><p>  “Quick” is regulated differently depending on the type of market.  The following Quik settings are distinguished: </p><ul><li>  for stocks; </li><li>  for bonds; </li><li>  for currency; </li><li>  for the derivatives market. </li></ul><p>  Before you configure the terminal, you must install it.  To do this, you need to register with a brokerage company, pass verification and submit the necessary documents. </p><p>  To trade in financial markets, you will need to select an account and replenish it.  After registration, the client will be provided with a link to download the terminal.  It can be obtained both on the broker's website and by e-mail. </p><p>  After completing all the necessary formalities and installing the platform according to the instructions, you can proceed to configure Quik.  The platform is installed in just 2 clicks, the process does not cause difficulties. </p><h2>  Settings for stock trading </h2><p>  When trading stocks for clarity, it is advisable to always have two tabs open - for trading and market analysis.  Determining the price range will allow more efficient and profitable opening and closing of transactions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="setting up quik for trading" class="if uuid-3267606" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41139/3267606.jpg"></div><p>  To create a new tab, you must select a function in the terminal menu "Add". </p><p>  The figure clearly shows how this can be done.  Now we need to come up with a name for this tab, let's say "Shares" or "Stock Charts", and then save all the actions by clicking on the appropriate field. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  To be always aware of the release of important news, it is recommended to create a special window and call it "News".  This is very convenient, since you do not need to periodically go to the broker's website or other specialized resources and view the “Events and News Calendar”.  In addition, it is simply impossible to miss any important news, as they will immediately be reflected in this window and attract the attention of the trader.  To do this you need: </p><ul><li>  go to the "Menu"; </li><li>  select "Create window"; </li><li>  then "News." </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="setting up a quik terminal" class="if uuid-3267618" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41139/3267618.jpg"></div><p>  Everything is very simple, it is clearly shown in the figure. </p><p>  The next instrument for trading stocks is Current Trading.  This is a table in which all the necessary information is displayed.  For example, the name of a trading asset, percentage changes, market supply and demand, the number of transactions and much more.  From the presented list, you can select the necessary Quik settings for stock trading. </p><p>  Procedure: </p><ul><li>  open the "Menu"; </li><li>  "Current bidding"; </li><li>  "Creating a table of current trading"; </li><li>  go to the next window "Available tools", here you need to select the names of shares; </li><li>  then "Available options." </li></ul><p>  In conclusion, you need to confirm all your actions by clicking the "Yes" button. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="quik stock customization" class="if uuid-3267622" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41139/3267622.jpg"></div><p>  As soon as all points of the instruction are completed, the table will be reflected in the workspace of the terminal.  One of the most popular tools for traders is the "Glass of prices" or "Glass of quotes." </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="tuning quik tools" class="if uuid-3267632" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41139/3267632.jpg"></div><p>  To add it to the platform, in the settings of Quik stocks, in the "Current Bidding" window you need to select the name of the instrument and right-click on it. </p><h2>  Price Chart Settings </h2><p>  After these steps, you can go to the schedule settings.  This is done according to the principle described above, that is, the name of the stock is selected and a mouse click is made in the "Menu"&gt; "Price and Volume Chart" section.  Once it appears, position it to the right of the Quotes Glass tool. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="setting up quik for stock trading" class="if uuid-3267624" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41139/3267624.jpg"></div><p>  To connect these three tools, so that all information appears automatically, you need to connect using the anchor in the "Current Bid", "Quotation Glass" and "Chart" windows.  To do this, click on the icon in the upper corner of the "Current Bidding" sign. </p><p>  In addition, in the settings of the Quik terminal, you can sort stocks by turnover, that is, the maximum number of transactions.  To do this, select "Turnover", "Sort".  In the same tab, you can create tables for deals, orders and stop orders. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="quik futures setting" class="if uuid-3267626" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41139/3267626.jpg"></div><p>  The figure shows how to properly configure them. </p><p>  Many traders here also display information on the trading account: limits, restrictions, deposit status, current profitability, losses on open positions and other parameters. </p><p>  At this stage, the setup of the platform for stock trading can be considered completed.  Get to work! </p><h2>  Setting Up Quik for Futures Trading </h2><p>  Let us consider this question in more detail.  Futures are used in the derivatives market.  To make settings for these assets, you need to create a new tab and somehow designate it, for example, “Derivatives Market”.  Then, by analogy, you need to create the tables: </p><ul><li>  "Current bidding"; </li><li>  "FORTS Futures" - here you need to select all the instruments that have the closest date to the time of expiration; </li><li>  then it needs to be tied with an anchor to the chart and the Glass; </li><li>  Further, it is necessary to edit the tables of transactions, orders and stop orders. </li></ul><p>  Additionally, you need to create two more tables: </p><ol><li>  "Account Limitations." </li><li>  "Positions on customer accounts." </li></ol><p>  In the first plate, information on the status of the account will be visible, and in the second, more detailed values ​​for an individual instrument.  At the final stage, you need to save everything using the "OK" button. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="setting up quik for futures trading" class="if uuid-3267629" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41139/3267629.jpg"></div><p>  For clarity, the article presents a drawing. </p><p>  At this point, the configuration for Quik futures is considered complete. </p><h2>  Foreign exchange market and bonds </h2><p>  There are no strong differences in the settings for trading these assets.  The foreign exchange market is speculative trading in currency pairs, which are the main tools. </p><p>  It is recommended, by analogy, to create a special window and name it somehow, say, "Forex market".  There are no difficulties in the terminal settings.  You just need to make tables and specify the necessary parameters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="quik setup" class="if uuid-3267627" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41139/3267627.jpg"></div><p>  There are no special recommendations for setting up bonds assets either.  The main thing is not to forget to anchor them. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Quik trading platform is a very convenient platform.  It allows you to maximize the use of the workspace of the terminal and track several types of markets at the same time.  Its settings are very simple and accessible even for beginners.  Quik has a clear and convenient interface and is very popular among traders. </p>
