  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Review of the Nokia 1616 Mobile Phone</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The old phones of the Finnish company Nokia were produced so high-quality that they still work smoothly at present.  They can be called a kind of legend.  In 2009, the Nokia 1616 model appeared on sale.  It differed from its predecessors in updated software.  In addition, the manufacturer has made changes in its appearance.  At the time of release, this unit was considered the cheapest device equipped with a color screen.  Let's look at its characteristics. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  Nokia 1616 is a typical monoblock.  For its body, the manufacturer used plastic.  In the lineup there are several color options.  A choice of black, graphite, dark red and dark blue.  During the interaction, you can feel that the manufacturer did not use expensive materials in his budget. </p><p>  The dimensions of this phone are small.  Case thickness is 15 mm.  In height, it reaches 107.1 mm.  Width, respectively, is 45 mm.  With such dimensions, the phone weighs only 78 g. And this is an indisputable plus, as it easily fits even in the small breast pocket of a summer shirt. </p><p>  There are no functional elements on the left side end.  But on the opposite is the connector for connecting the charger.  In the upper part, the manufacturer placed a flashlight and a headphone jack.  At the bottom there is a special mount for the strap.  The microphone hole in this model is displayed directly below the keyboard. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What about the build quality?  She, as always, is on top.  During operation, nothing creaks, does not play.  If necessary, the front panel can be easily replaced in this phone.  It is not offered as an additional accessory, however, this will greatly facilitate the repair, for example, after a fall. </p><div class="photo" data-original="technave.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nokia 1616 phone" class="if uuid-2530461" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2530461.jpg"></div><h2>  Nokia 1616: screen specifications </h2><p>  This phone model was produced in 2009, and at that time the screen with a diagonal of 1.8 inches was considered quite large.  It has a physical size of 28 √ó 35 mm.  In the budget segment, such characteristics can be considered a significant advantage. </p><p>  The display is made using CSTN technology.  Able to display up to 65 thousand different shades.  The picture is displayed with a resolution of 160 √ó 128 pixels.  The image looks bright, all information is displayed clearly.  On the street, in direct sunlight, using the phone will be quite problematic, since the screen is almost completely blind.  Some problems may arise when starting a game on Nokia 1616.  The image is not as high quality as we would like.  There is a certain pixelation, because of which, with prolonged interaction, the eyes get very tired. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  5 lines of text and 2 service lines are placed on the screen.  In a locked state, the owner can see the date and time. </p><div class="photo" data-source="http://wowshopi.com/index.php?route=product/product&amp;product_id=545" data-original="wowshopi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nokia 1616 review" class="if uuid-2530477" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2530477.jpg"></div><h2>  Keyboard </h2><p>  Nokia 1616 has a mechanical keyboard.  The keys are rubber.  The manufacturer claims that they do not leak moisture.  During work with them there is no discomfort, since they are quite large.  Soft keys are located directly below the screen.  In the center is a joystick for 5 positions.  Unlike the digital block, it is made of plastic.  During prolonged use, slight abrasions may appear on the chrome rim. </p><p>  The buttons are equipped with white backlight.  Thanks to it, all the signs are clearly visible under any operating conditions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cnet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 1616 battery" class="if uuid-2530471" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2530471.jpg"></div><h2>  Nokia 1616: battery </h2><p>  Old models of the Finnish manufacturer have always been distinguished by a long battery life.  This device was no exception.  It is equipped with a battery with a capacity of 800 mAh.  The chemical element is lithium-ion.  According to the manufacturer, in standby mode, the device is able to function up to 540 hours.  During operation, you can expect about 4 days of work.  Moreover, it is allowed to make calls up to 15 minutes each day, listen to the radio for one hour and use other functions for approximately 10 minutes.  In order to restore the battery life, it will take about two hours. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia games" class="if uuid-2530463" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2530463.jpg"></div><h2>  Menu </h2><p>  Nokia 1616 runs on Series 30. The system interface is slightly different from that used in previous models.  The difference is in the design of the icons.  They are displayed on the main screen in the form of a 3 √ó 3 grid. The menu consists of a standard set: </p><ul><li>  Phone book.  The owner can save up to 500 contacts in it. </li><li>  Message.  The described device is able to work only with regular text messages. </li><li>  Calls  This item stores information about 30 missed, incoming and outgoing numbers. </li><li>  Games.  There are three standard games preinstalled on Nokia 1616.  These are Forbidden Treasures (wandering), Snake Xenzia (snake), Bounce (arcade). </li><li>  Settings  Here you can change the following parameters: ringer volume, signal and ringtone, activate / deactivate the "vibro" option, turn on / off the light indication, and more. </li><li>  Clock.
