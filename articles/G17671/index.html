But you can control the deposit only from the age of 18.  Partial capital management rights arise from the age of 14.  After receiving a passport, a citizen can replenish the deposit and withdraw interest. </p><p>  Deposits for children under 18 are opened in the department.  And you can replenish the account: </p><ol><li>  In the bank. </li><li>  Using the Sberbank-Online system. </li><li>  Through the mobile app. </li></ol><p>  To deposit funds you need to know the details.  Information is needed to make the transfer.  Whether to open a contribution to a child depends on his parents and relatives.  But if they care about the future, then a deposit should be made.  In the future, you can get a good income. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Bets </h2><p>  The income of the target contribution for children depends on the size of the rate.
