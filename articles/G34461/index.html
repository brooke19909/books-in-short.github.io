  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to change an account on iPhone: procedure</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Working with the iPhone becomes easy when the user has set up the device.  After that, you can not worry about the work of accounts and related programs.  But questions may arise at the time of buying or selling a smartphone.  The user must know how to change the account on the iPhone. </p><h2>  Why change the profile? </h2><p>  Before you figure out how to change your account on iPhone, you should turn to another question.  It is necessary to understand what the owner does before selling or transferring the device. </p><p>  Before transferring the phone, you should erase all personal data from it.  But manually doing this is inconvenient.  In addition, you can inadvertently forget about some hidden files.  Therefore it is recommended: </p><ul><li>  break the pair with the Watch, if it is configured; </li><li>  save device backup data; </li><li>  Sign out of iCloud, the iTunes Store, and the App Store </li><li>  reset to factory settings; </li><li>  unregister iMessage if necessary. </li></ul><p>  This is what the complete cleansing of the apparatus looks like.  But sometimes the user only needs to change the account on the iPhone.  How to do it? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wired.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="IPhone Account" class="if uuid-3043350" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3043350.jpg"></div><h2>  Change using id </h2><p>  This is the username that you need to register for further work with iTunes or the Apple Store, as well as for using iCloud.  This account allows you to manage personal files.  When selling a smartphone, you need to remove it or replace it with a third-party one.  After purchasing the device, you will need to get an Apple ID account. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Change account needed: </p><ul><li>  when selling the device; </li><li>  when buying a used smartphone; </li><li>  if someone found out your personal data; </li><li>  in order to use the phone from scratch. </li></ul><p>  This option is definitely not suitable for those who have forgotten the password, because you need to remember it to change the record. </p><h2>  Work with iCloud </h2><p>  This is an important resource that stores personal user data.  Therefore, first of all, you need to know how to change your ‚ÄúIklaud‚Äù account to ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù.  To do this, go to the smartphone settings (gray gear on the main screen). </p><p>  One of the first items there is an Apple ID account.  You need to go to it in order to continue changing iCloud.  In some older versions, this item was in the section of the same name. </p><p>  After switching to iCloud you need to scroll down the screen and find the ‚ÄúExit‚Äù button.  The system will request a cipher from Apple ID.  You need to select the "Turn off".  This will help to disconnect the option ‚ÄúFind iPhone‚Äù from the corresponding account. </p><p>  Below is a list of data that can be saved.  For example, so that all contacts remain on the smartphone, you need to enable the option by moving the slider to the right.  You can also leave your browser settings, calendar entries and notes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lynda.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Change Apple ID" class="if uuid-3043355" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3043355.jpg"></div><p>  If you don‚Äôt need any iCloud data or you made a backup in advance, you can turn off all sliders.  Thus, it will be possible to delete all data from the smartphone. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the upper right corner of the screen you can find the ‚ÄúExit‚Äù button, which you need to click on.  The system will ask you to confirm this process. </p><h2>  New iCloud Launch </h2><p>  How to change iCloud account on iPhone?  After exiting the account, we return to the smartphone settings.  At the top of the screen there is a button for a new login to the account.  If there is no saved Apple ID record, it will be possible to enter new parameters.  Next, go to iCloud.  In earlier versions, the settings have the same name menu. </p><p>  After entering the credentials, click on the "Login" button.  A notification will pop up on the display.  Enter the phone unlock code.  It had to be recorded after the first setup of the device. </p><p>  Next, you will need to combine user data.  If you have left calendars or contacts, you can combine them with your iCloud account.  You can refuse this. </p><p>  To save, go to the program menu.  Below are listed all the resources that save files in the cloud.  It is necessary to include those parameters that you want to combine with the new account.  Just turn on the slider. </p><div class="photo" data-original="9to5mac.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Change Apple ID" class="if uuid-3043356" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3043356.jpg"></div><h2>  Work with a used device </h2><p>  Many users do not know what to do if they bought a used iPhone.  How to change iCloud account? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It is important that no reset to the initial configuration will help in this matter.  The owner must immediately speak with a former smartphone user at the time of purchase.  If he suddenly forgot or did not know, you need to ask him to delete ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù from his account. </p><p>  To do this, he must log into iCloud account on the official resource.  It is from there that you can unlink the smartphone to your account.  On the page you need to select the menu with the parameters. </p><p>  A new window will show all the devices that are associated with the account.  You need to select the smartphone that the user sold, and come to the data.  A cross will be displayed to the right of the device, which should be clicked.  Thus, it will turn out to untie the account from the sold device in order to enter your data. </p><h2>  Disabling Apple ID Account </h2><p>  Also no less important may be the question of how to change your account on iPhone 6 or any other model through Apple ID. </p><p>  You should immediately know that the process will be successful if the account name is mail from Google, Yandex or any other service.

After that, you can change it. </p><p>  The next entry will need to be done with the new password.  The smartphone will also ask you to enter the changed data. </p><h2>  Change password on smartphone </h2><p>  You can use a smartphone for this task.  If it works on iOS 10.3 and later, go to the device‚Äôs settings and select a name.  Next, go to the "Password and Security" section.  In it, you can just change the data.  During the shift, you need to enter not only the old, but also the new password, and also specify the unlock code for the device. </p><h2>  Lost password </h2><p>  But how to change the account password if you forget it?  To do this, reset the encryption.  It can be performed in different ways.  It all depends on the type of protection. </p><p>  With two-factor authentication, you must go to the smartphone settings.  Next, you need to log in to the account and the "Password and Security" section.  After the device indicates recovery instructions. </p><p>  If you aren‚Äôt signed in to iCloud, it can be difficult.  In the account you will need to indicate that you forgot the password, and then follow the instructions again. </p><p>  If email is selected for protection, then you need to use the official site to recover your password.  You need to go to the page with the account.  Next, enter the identifier and click Continue.  The system will understand that you have forgotten the password and will offer to answer the security question, use an e-mail message or request a recovery key. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="test questions" class="if uuid-3043374" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3043374.jpg"></div><p>  Two-step verification is also slightly different.  The initial stages of the procedure are similar.  It is necessary to indicate in the account that you have forgotten the password.  Next, enter the key for the two-step verification.  To do this, the user indicates a trusted device.  The system sends a message with a code to it.  You must enter it to continue changing the password. </p><h2>  Change Apple Music profile </h2><p>  An Apple Music account may also require a data change.  But getting to her is even more difficult.  To do this, go to the application.  Next, select its settings and the ‚ÄúMusic‚Äù section.  It contains the item "Home collection".  Thanks to him, you can try changing your account. </p><p>  By going to this menu, you need to go under the corresponding Apple ID entry in the store profile.  In the tab "Selection" you need to scroll to the very bottom.  The active account will be indicated there.  It can be changed right away.  In this case, Apple Music will automatically switch to another account. </p><h2>  Account Change Issues </h2><p>  In general, replacing your Apple ID is a straightforward process.  If everything was set up correctly before this, then no problems should arise.  But there are some malfunctions in this action. </p><p>  What should I do if I cannot change the identifier?  It can be changed to any email that is not yet used in the database.  Remember that if the existing address ends with @ icloud.com, @ mac.com or @ me.com, changing it to a third-party will fail.  Also in this case, the edit button will not be in the account menu.  In new versions of the operating system, there is also no way to delete the email address. </p><p>  Perhaps you need not to change the e-mail, but log in to another account.  In this case, just log out of the old account and enter the new data. </p><p>  If you encounter other failures or errors, you will have to turn to specialists for help.  The problems may be related to hardware or more serious system problems.  In this case, only a specialist in an official service center can help you. </p>
