Even in warm time, rest in Krasnaya Polyana was not very popular, since there were no special entertainments, except for beaches. </p><p>  However, everything has changed, the rest in this beautiful place has ceased to be monotonous: now there are so many entertainments in Krasnaya Polyana and its environs that in one vacation you won‚Äôt be able to visit and feel everything.  Let's try to find out where the best entertainment centers for children and adults are located, and when it is better to visit them. </p><h2>  Fashionable ski resorts </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ridertrip.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Alpine skiing in Krasnaya Polyana" class="if uuid-3140814" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/3140814.jpg"></div><p>  Despite its proximity to the sea, this village is considered a paradise for skiers, so most of the entertainment in Krasnaya Polyana in winter is associated with skiing on snowy slopes. </p><p>  There are several comfortable tourist complexes in the village: Rosa Khutor, Gorki Gorod, Laura, part of the center of Gazprom. </p><p>  Each of them has modern hotels, restaurants and shops.  The equipment rental service and training for beginners are well developed, so you can start skiing from scratch here in a couple of days. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Only on the slopes of the Rosa Khutor complex there are more than 100 tracks with different levels of difficulty, and for lovers of free-ride there are always some untouched slopes. </p><p>  The highest slopes in Krasnaya Polyana can be found in the Gorki Gorod complex.  For example, the peak of the Black Pyramid, from the top of which one of the highways begins, is located at an altitude of 2375 meters above sea level.  In total there are more than 30 kilometers of slopes of varying complexity, between which the threads of the lifts stretch.  The highlight of the ski holiday is the lighted trails for night skiing and the fact that the snow season on the slopes of Gorki Goroda lasts quite a long time. </p><h2>  The remedy for boredom </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.visitvaldaran.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="heliski in Krasnaya Polyana" class="if uuid-3140817" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/3140817.jpg"></div><p>  Among the attractions in Krasnaya Polyana it is worth noting the possibility of Heliski, descent from inaccessible slopes, to which the helicopter delivers skiers.  For lovers of thrills, this will be an unforgettable experience: in good weather and snow, you can make 3-4 descents in a day with a total elevation of 3000-4000 meters. </p><p>  In the mountains of Krasnaya Polyana, an amazing combination of interesting terrain and centuries-old forest - any real skier wants to go down such a track.  The ski area is approximately 500 kilometers long and runs through three mountain valleys.  The best time to try Heliski is the period from January to March, although in spring you can also go down the northern slopes, where there is never a problem with snow. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Waterfalls, caves and rivers </h2><div class="photo" data-original="yandex.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mountains in the vicinity of Krasnaya Polyana" class="if uuid-3140821" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/3140821.jpg"></div><p>  The unique beauty of the Caucasus Mountains attracts guests not only in winter.  There is a lot of entertainment in Krasnaya Polyana in the summer: a wider selection of hiking tours, mountain biking trails (for example, Gorki Bike Park), jeep tours and mountain river rafting. </p><p>  Very close to Krasnaya Polyana is one of the highest waterfalls in Europe - Palikarya Falls, whose jets fall from 72 meters.  Many other picturesque waterfalls can be seen on the mountain excursion route "Waterfall Park", with a length of more than two kilometers. </p><p>  One of the popular sightseeing and entertainment in Krasnaya Polyana is the descent into one of the caves.  Under the guidance of experienced guides, you can go down deep underground, see the halls, to the arches of which the light of the lantern, underground lakes and waterfalls do not reach.  Many of the caves are not equipped, so a visit will require good physical fitness and despair. </p><p>  On the surface, you can organize rafting along a fast mountain river on an inflatable raft, walk along the bottom of one of the many picturesque canyons, or simply lie down on one of the equipped beaches of Krasnaya Polyana, enjoying relaxation and service. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Skypark Adventure Park </h2><div class="photo" data-original="turizm.sputnik.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Jumping in the amusement park" class="if uuid-3133369" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/3133369.jpg"></div><p>  Opened in June 2014 near Krasnaya Polyana, an amusement park at an altitude has already become popular among regulars.  So far, this is the only complex of high-rise attractions in Russia that allows you to feel the most powerful adrenaline rush. </p><p>  By the way, this is where one of the longest on Earth is located - 439 meters!  - A suspension bridge stretching over the beautiful Akhshtyrsky gorge.  Below, at a depth of 200 meters, a mountain river rages, which is clearly visible through the rope base of the bridge. </p><p>  Of course, things are not limited to a walk on the bridge.  There are a lot of entertainments for Skypark visitors near Krasnaya Polyana: the largest swings in the world, raising to a height of 170 meters, a climbing path, a quick descent along a steel rope, returning to the park entrance. </p><p>  For thrill-seekers, bungy jumps from 69 and 207 meters are offered here.  The sensations even from flying down to "small" 69 meters will be remembered for a very long time. </p><p>  For those who are relaxing with children, an interesting rope park with tracks of different levels is suitable.  In summer, in fine weather, guests are offered a sightseeing tour by helicopter. </p><h2>  Water park on a background of mountains </h2><div class="photo" data-original="tonkosti.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Waterpark &quot;Mountain Beach&quot;" class="if uuid-3140832" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/3140832.jpg"></div><p>  For lovers of fun in Krasnaya Polyana, entertainment is offered by the large Mountain Beach water park.  If you listen to the reviews of tourists, it is comfortable to relax here all year round, and the kids will be delighted with the slides and attractions. </p><p>  The Mountain Beach complex, successfully built on the roof of a shopping center, impresses with amazing views of the peaks of snow-capped mountains.  Here is the only sandy beach on the coast of Sochi, carefully furnished under the roof of the complex. </p><p>  For the smallest there is a separate platform with small slopes and a pool.  Adults after skiing will enjoy the Finnish sauna, wave pool and many interesting slides. </p><h2>  Complex "Galaxy" </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Outdoor pool in the complex &quot;Galaxy&quot;" class="if uuid-3140839" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/3140839.jpg"></div><p>  Among the attractions of Krasnaya Polyana, the large entertainment center "Galaxy", located at an altitude of 450 meters, stands out.  Its total area exceeds 50,000 square meters, here all guests will find classes to their liking. </p><p>  The most popular entertainment is the water park "Galaxy", which has both indoor and outdoor areas.  The water temperature in the open area is constantly maintained at comfortable +28 ... + 32 ¬∞ .  Lovers of outdoor recreation like to bask in the warm water of the pool, admiring the peaks of the Caucasus Mountains. </p><p>  For those guests who appreciate comfort, there are several interesting slides on the territory with labyrinths and steep bends.  There is a children's water town, waterfalls and water guns for the kids. </p><p>  Also on site are a bowling alley, several cinemas, restaurants with local cuisine, a popular ice arena and a night club. </p><h2>  Theme Park "Bath-Land" </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.arrivo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Complex &quot;Bath-Land&quot;" class="if uuid-3140886" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/3140886.jpg"></div><p>  It is so pleasant to relax in a hot steam room after a day spent on a snowy slope, and then undergo a deep healing massage.  Of course, bathing procedures can hardly be called entertainment of Krasnaya Polyana, but great pleasure from visiting the Banya-Land center is guaranteed. </p><p>  The center consists of five SPA complexes, in each of which guests will be offered unique bath procedures based on ancient Russian traditions and the philosophy of yogis.  All complexes are made of natural materials (processed stone and wood), after a steam room with fragrant herbs, guests will be offered to plunge into a huge oak barrel with ice water.  Then you need to warm up in the "Humpbacked Horse": a huge tub of water suspended from chains over an open fire.  Moreover, the vat is located under the starry sky - it is difficult to imagine a greater unity with nature. </p><p>  In the Banya-Land park, guests can enjoy a variety of body treatments (body wraps, masks, cleansing), and in the spacious tents you can get a relaxing or classic massage. </p><h2>  Aviary complex </h2><div class="photo" data-original="sochilives.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Inhabitants of the Aviary complex" class="if uuid-3140896" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/3140896.jpg"></div><p>  There are a lot of entertainments for children in Krasnaya Polyana and Sochi, but it's still worth a visit to a small aviary complex.  In conditions as close to natural as possible, there are "aborigines" of the Caucasus Mountains: wolves, mountain bisons, chamois and lynx.  Behind fences invisible to visitors, animals feel quite comfortable and willingly pose for guests.  And if you are lucky to visit the complex during the distribution of food, you can feed the inhabitants. </p><p>  Recently, a rope park has been equipped on the territory of the aviary complex.  Here everyone can try to pass a not very difficult, but interesting obstacle course. </p><h2>  Amazing Husky Park </h2><div class="photo" data-original="funsochi.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sledding in husky park" class="if uuid-3140898" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/3140898.jpg"></div><p>  At an altitude of 1,500 meters above sea level, where even in the summer it is quite cool, a husky nursery is located.  If you have seen everything and can‚Äôt decide what kind of entertainment to visit in Krasnaya Polyana, you should definitely look here.  The easiest way is to climb a snowmobile from the Psekhako shelter. </p><p>  Here guests can chat with funny puppies and forget about their problems for a while.  If you wish, you can order a dog sledding or just chat with friendly fluffy dogs. </p><p>  An outdoor pool overlooking the surrounding mountains, a summer cinema and a separate relaxation area under centenary fir trees are located on site.  By the way, there is an unusual ‚ÄúDeer Farm‚Äù nearby, where you can take pictures with real reindeers and treat them with reindeer moss. </p>
