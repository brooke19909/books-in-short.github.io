The restored ancient monuments will delight tourists interested in history, and the central part of this city will pleasantly surprise connoisseurs of the beautiful. </p><p>  Burned out almost to ashes by Rennes in France, nobody will be overwhelmed by its scale, but it will allow you to experience the special flavor of a country famous for lavender fields, fashion and fine cuisine. </p><h2>  The capital of the Brittany region </h2><p>  For tourists who want to relax from the hustle and bustle of megacities, a trip to the ancient city is a unique opportunity to immerse yourself in a peaceful atmosphere.  Cozy Rennes is not the place everyone wants to be.  However, the green corner falls in love at first sight, and travelers who have received incredible pleasure from meeting with him often come here again. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="48.117266" data-lng="-1.6777925999999752" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="11"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/0/7/3/0/10730.png"></div><p>  The administrative center of the Brittany region is located in the west of France, at the place where the two rivers merge - Ile and Vilen, which gave the name to the prefecture of the department (Ille-et-Vilaine).  The population of the city, the appearance of which has changed greatly, is 210 thousand people. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Short story </h2><p>  The ancient Rennes (France) was founded before our century.  The annals mention its first inhabitants - representatives of the Celtic tribe of Redons.  They were the founders of a small village, which later received a modern name.  The settlement, located at the crossroads of important trade routes, was economically developed and built up. </p><p>  During the Middle Ages, the settlement acquired the status of a center of secular power: it was here that the coronations of the Breton dukes took place.  In the 30s of the XVI century, Brittany joins France, losing its independence, and Rennes is declared the capital of the region. </p><p>  In 1720, the city perishes in a fire, the flame destroys most of the wooden structures.  And only after two centuries, he is reborn from the ashes thanks to the efforts of local residents. </p><p>  During the Second World War, another terrible tragedy took place - numerous bombing raids the remaining historical monuments, which inflicts irreparable damage to world culture.  The French again rebuilt their favorite city from scratch. </p><p>  Today, the administrative center of Brittany employs automobile plants Citroen and Renault, the arms factory Giat.  16 years ago, a nine-kilometer metro line consisting of 15 stations appeared in a small town.  Manage an automatic system in which there are no drivers, only 4 people. </p><h2>  Parliament Building in Rennes (France) </h2><p>  Sights reflecting its rich past are worth the attention of curious tourists.  One of the main architectural monuments is the parliament building, the first stone of which was laid in 1618.  The construction lasted almost 40 years, and the architect Solomon de Bross made a great contribution, famous for the fact that he erected the famous Luxembourg Palace. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": Avaalonn, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Parliament building" class="if uuid-2924170" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2924170.jpg"></div><p>  Surprisingly, the magnificent building, recognized as a national treasure, is the only building that spared the fire.  It has seriously suffered already today, in 1994, from a flare of a flare during a rally. </p><p>  Fire instantly swept the building, the roof collapsed, and the restoration of the building lasted more than 5 years.  Now all the consequences of the fire have been eliminated, but visitors can observe the traces of the terrible tragedy intentionally left by restorers.  This misfortune is an integral part of history, and you should not forget it. </p><h2>  Religious monument </h2><p>  The most ancient building of Rennes in France is considered the city Catholic cathedral, made in the Gothic style.  Despite the fact that its foundation was laid in the XII century, the doors to parishioners a religious monument opened only after 4 centuries.  It was here that magnificent coronation ceremonies were held.  One of the most beautiful buildings of the city stands out with a strict facade. </p><p>  Of particular interest to tourists is the luxurious interior decoration, which is decorated with gilding and marble.  But the main relic of St. Peter's Basilica is a carved altar with carved figures of saints.  Everyone can get into a local attraction, which has the status of a historical monument. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The newly rebuilt temple </h2><p>  Another religious monument, striking in its grandeur, bears the imprint of past centuries.  The architecture of the cathedral of Notre-Dame-en-Saint-Melanie is a mixture of different styles.  The temple dedicated to St. Melen died in fire, and was later completely rebuilt.  Only fragments of frescoes on biblical themes located in the southern wing have survived. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gpsmycity.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Notre-Dame-en-Saint-Melanie Cathedral" class="if uuid-2924187" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2924187.jpg"></div><p>  An amazing masterpiece that admires a high Gothic spire, is a whole complex.  It includes belfries, galleries, monastery buildings and even a wonderful garden where you can be alone with yourself. </p><h2>  Ancient gate </h2><p>  As you know, there are not so many monuments erected during the Middle Ages in a city like Rennes (France): most of them were damaged by fires and bombings.  Now the descendants admire fragments of the walls, including the gates of Port Mordles, through which they entered the city. </p><p>  Two ancient towers and an arch connecting the structures have survived.  A stone with the embossed emblem of the representatives of the Montfort dynasty is installed above it.  At the beginning of the last century, the gate was given the status of a national monument of the country. </p><h2>  Market Square </h2><p>  The Grove Square, which has now become a regular market, surprises with a special touch.  Valorous knights fought in tournaments in the Middle Ages, and now merchants from all over Brittany come here to offer fresh vegetables and fruits, wine and cheese.  Tourists may not even buy anything, but just take a walk through a busy corner surrounded by half-timbered houses that seem like toys. </p><div class="photo" data-original="erasmusu.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Half-timbered houses" class="if uuid-2924142" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2924142.jpg"></div><p>  Lined with wood, decorated with various details, painted in bright colors, they create a fabulous atmosphere. </p><h2>  Art Museum </h2><p>  The end of the 18th century in France is a time of great historical events that led to the establishment of the republic.  The Great French Revolution also touched on art: priceless works were removed from private collections, which became exhibits of the museum.  Drawings by da Vinci, canvases by Rubens and Picasso, engravings by D√ºrer cause awe among visitors. </p><p>  Replenishment of work in the exhibition halls is ongoing.  Here you can admire collections of objects of both the ancient Greek and Roman periods. </p><h2>  Modern attractions </h2><p>  Among the modern attractions of Rennes (France), the Magellan residential complex, located on the banks of the river, stands apart.  Four snow-white houses in the form of ships were designed by Alan Sarfati, a Parisian architect, whose track record includes many unique works. </p><p>  In addition, the city metro, working without the help of people, deserves a separate discussion.  There are no familiar rails, and all trains consist of two railcar wagons.  Many stations are interesting in architectural terms. </p><h2>  Harbour Air </h2><p>  One of the country's main air ports is located in the city of Rennes, France.  Saint-Jacques Airport is considered an important airline harbor hosting public and private charters.  Located a few kilometers from the city center, it serves both local and international flights. </p><p>  Airplanes from our capital also fly here, the average cost of a flight is about 20 thousand rubles.  Airborne accepts low-cost carriers - Aerlingus and Flybe. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rennes Airport" class="if uuid-2924204" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2924204.jpg"></div><p>  From the airport, which has everything you need to wait for a flight, you can get to the city by bus at number 57 in just 20 minutes. </p><h2>  Paradise for ecotourism lovers </h2><p>  One of the most unusual sights of the city of Rennes in France is the Bintine eco-farm.

Cozy and well-groomed, it is famous for its green parks spread over a vast area. </p><p>  Tabor is a former garden planted by monks.  Every year its territory expanded, and in the XIX century it was taken up by famous landscape designers who decorated the park with luxurious flower gardens, a rose garden and copies of sculptures installed in Versailles.  It has a relaxed atmosphere and visitors to the park have a great time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tourisme-rennes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Park Tabor" class="if uuid-2924210" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2924210.jpg"></div><p>  Oberture was once privately owned, but 41 years ago it became municipal property and opened its doors to all residents of the city.
