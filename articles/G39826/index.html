Some go to resorts, while others, taking children by the arm, go to relatives and friends in another city.  Both this and that <span>kind of rest</span> are good in their own way.  The first is the absence of problems associated with children and their care, the presence of a large amount of money that can be spent on shopping and delicious <span>exotic fruits.</span>  The second type of vacation is more suitable for family people who do not like to part with each other even during summer vacations.  Today we will focus on visiting cities, as well as on what you can see and where it is better to walk while not in your hometown. </p>

Naturally, in the first days you don‚Äôt even think about where in Moscow to walk with your child.  At this time, there is always adaptation to a new rhythm of life, getting used to a different climate.  In addition, it is necessary to buy products for several days, and unpack things.  In general, there are enough problems, so the question of where in Moscow to take a walk with a child is postponed until the ‚Äúbetter times‚Äù.  But things are unpacked, the refrigerator is full of food, and relatives are already waiting for a walk with you and your child.  They can be understood.  They want to pamper you with something tasty, take you to the most beautiful places, in general, make your vacation great.  It is then that the question arises of where to take a walk with the <span>child.</span>  <span>Moscow,</span> as you know, is far from a small city, so walking along the streets just won't work (uninteresting, sometimes even dangerous).  We will help you decide where your child will like most. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to walk with the child Moscow" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/228560.jpg" width="600"></div>

Of course, in the Alexander Park.  Perhaps this is one of the best places in the capital of Russia.

That is why it is very interesting and informative to come here with a guide who can tell you some interesting facts or mystical situations related to the park.  Aleksandrovsky is located in the northwestern side of the Kremlin, so finding it is very easy. </li><li>  <span>Park Tsaritsyno.</span>  Of course, you will not find colorful attractions and cotton candy here, but you can fully enjoy the fresh air and excellent nature (which is also very useful for a child).  The park is rightfully considered one of the best places in the capital of Russia, combining centuries-old historical values ‚Äã‚Äãand modern design. </li><li>  The Hermitage Garden.

It can not be called a historical place, since it was built quite recently, but it is full of entertainment.  <span>A romantic place</span> for walks both alone and with a small child.  In the center of the park is a huge arch in the shape of a heart.  According to legend, every person who passes through this heart, making a wish, will receive it in reality.  We are sure that your baby will be interested in this place! <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to walk in Moscow on the weekend" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/228558.jpg" width="430"></div></li></ul><p>  In addition to historical places, there are a number of amusement parks that your child will definitely fall in love with.
