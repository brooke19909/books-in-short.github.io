    <h2>  According to law </h2><p>  Loans for housing construction in Belarus can get completely different categories of the population, including young families.  Moreover, many citizens have significant benefits and concessions when applying for a loan.  The <span>President‚Äôs Decree</span> No. 13 of January 6, 2012, is considered to be the main document regulating the receipt of preferential cash loans. His full name is: ‚ÄúOn the issues of providing state support to citizens during the construction (reconstruction) and / or acquisition of residential premises.‚Äù </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Those who decide to get acquainted with it should know that there is a later version, or rather, Presidential Decree No. 469 of 11/16/15, which entered into force on 03/01/16.  This decree corrects several points of the previous one, so it is better to study it in detail. </p><h2>  Who is generally entitled to a soft loan? </h2><p>  In the general case, there are several categories of citizens who are entitled to a special loan for housing construction.  Those in need of privilege must first register with the relevant authorities.  This will make it possible to get into a special queue consisting of citizens in need of an indispensable <span>improvement in housing conditions.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="soft loan for housing" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/1213780.jpg" width="573"></div>  Priority categories include:

In any case, they are obliged to put you on the line, but the waiting process may be delayed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Whom to consider a young family </h2><p>  Under the new law, a family can be considered young in which at least one of the spouses is not older than 31 years old at the time of applying for a soft loan.

    <p>  To get a soft loan for the construction of housing for young people, the average income for each individual member should not exceed three times the average monthly minimum SPB (per capita consumer budget) calculated for a family of 4 people. </p><p>  In order to be eligible for benefits, it is necessary that in the existing housing for each member of one family there should be no more than 10 m <sup>2</sup> (for Minsk) or 15 m <sup>2</sup> for other cities.  At the same time, none of the spouses can own any housing on the territory of Belarus, and also not act as a tenant when living in non-privatized housing.  Simply put, a family must either rent an apartment or live with their parents or other relatives in their territory. </p><p>  There is another interesting point: being married does not mean that you should stand in line together.  If one of the spouses stood in line for preferential housing before marriage, then he can continue to wait until his time approaches. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  What kind of loan can you count on </h2><p>  Loans for housing construction provided by the state program are designed to facilitate the acquisition of their own home (apartment) for a young family.  For such ‚Äúcells of society‚Äù two types of lending are provided: </p><ul><li>  For the construction of new housing.  The approximate amount can be calculated as follows: the norm of the total area (20 sq. M / person) is multiplied by the cost of 1 m <sup>2</sup> .  Since the model housing is taken as the basis, the total amount will differ sharply from the market value.  The size of the loan should not exceed 90% of the cost of all housing. </li><li>  To buy a finished apartment.  This path is chosen when it is not possible to resolve the issue through construction.  In this case, the loan amount is calculated as if for construction, and then 70% of this number is taken.  This will be the maximum amount for which you can claim. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="soft loan for housing for young" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/1213783.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><p>  You also need to know that families who have obtained loans for the construction of a house or its purchase will not be able to fully dispose of their new property until the moment when they are fully paid for debt obligations.  This means that housing can not be sold, donated or exchanged for another.  In addition, no such actions with housing can be performed even within three years after the final calculation of the loan. </p><h2>  Financial support for young people </h2><p>  Of course, buying an apartment for a young family, even taking into account the benefits, is not so simple.  To do this, you need not only to have money for monthly payments for many years, but also immediately make 10, or even 30% of the cost of housing.  And what about those who have already taken a loan, and not a preferential one, but an ordinary one? </p><p>  For some families who have taken such a loan, a state subsidy is provided.  To do this, one of three conditions must be met: </p><ul><li>  have one minor child (or give birth after the acquisition of housing) - assistance will amount to 20 minimum subsistence budgets; </li><li>  for two children under the age of majority they give 40 budgets; </li><li>  if there are three or more children, you are assigned 50 <span>living wage budgets.</span> </li></ul><p>  The subsidy will be paid only after the state registration of ownership of the apartment (house) has passed.  So use the money as a down payment will not work.  Yes, and you will not see money live.  The amount will be evenly transferred to repay the loan body or% on it, if the main debt has already been paid. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Belarusbank housing loans" class="if" height="275" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/1213785.jpg" width="470"></div>

    <h2>  We collect documents </h2><p>  If you nevertheless decided to apply for a soft loan, you should seek the advice of Belarusbank.  Loans for the construction of housing there usually give out with great pleasure.  Initially, you will need the following documents: </p><ul><li>  passport; </li><li>  income statement; </li><li>  a document (reference) on the composition of the family; </li><li>  for men under 27 years of age - military ID. </li></ul><p>  About documents that will need to be provided additionally, they will tell you in detail at the bank. </p><h2>  Loan sizes and area norms </h2><p>  As already mentioned, loans for housing construction still do not cover its full cost and those who wish to have their own housing will have to stock up on an initial payment.  Only <span>large families</span> can apply for one hundred percent lending <span>.</span> </p><p>  The norms of the total area are set as follows: </p><ul><li>  20 m <sup>2</sup> / person  - during the construction of a one-room apartment; </li><li>  30 m <sup>2</sup> / person  - for the construction of a 1-apartment residential building; </li><li>  30 m <sup>2</sup> / person  - during the construction of a one-room apartment, 1-apartment building in a rural area, for citizens who constantly live and work there; </li><li>  44 m <sup>2</sup> / person  - for the construction of a 1-apartment apartment building, 1-room apartment in the countryside for 1 person who constantly lives and works there; </li></ul>
