This model is convenient for its versatility; in combination with it, a wide variety of shoes looks advantageous: from open sandals with high heels to slates with flat soles.  Although the most effective choice will be fashionable sandals with many interlocking straps.  Flare skirts can be accompanied by jewelry in the form of long beads and thin bracelets, which can decorate not only the wrists, but also the ankles. </p><p>  The fair sex with any figure can afford to sew a sun skirt and look excellent in it.  Only you need to consider some nuances: if your forms have an enviable volume, just lower the flare level, then the hips will seem narrower than it is.  For chic ladies, a fabric pattern that expands downward or simply has many small details is suitable - there should not be large spots in the upper part of the product.  Owners of slim figures can choose a fabric with any pattern, the main thing is that it be symmetrical about the center.  Good on delicate silhouettes and flared lace. </p><p>  Before you sew a sun skirt, think about what you will wear it with.  Perhaps the selection of the top will make adjustments to the choice of matter.  It is best to pick up short topics or shirts from shiny fabric in a pair of this part.  Braided belts with tassels and bronze bracelets will add an oriental touch. </p><p>  <strong><span>How to sew a</span> flared sun <span>skirt</span> ?</strong> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For work you will need: </p><ol><li>  The cloth.  Light cotton, silk and even thin wool are suitable.  If the width of the canvas is 140-150 cm, then take the length of the product + 20 cm for processing. </li><li>  Elastic tape (elastic band) 2-3 cm wide. </li><li>  Threads. </li><li>  Whatman paper or roll of unnecessary wallpaper for the pattern. </li><li>  Compass </li><li>  Long ruler. </li><li>  Tailor's chalk or bar of soap. </li></ol><p>  Before stitching a sun skirt, take measurements from the model.  You will need a girth of the waist and hips, as well as the length of the product.  The pattern will be a wide ring.  Calculate the radii using the formulas.  The inner radius is equal to half <span>the circumference</span> times 3.14, and the outer one is longer by the length of the skirt.  Now build a pattern with a compass (small circle) and thread with a pencil attached to it (large circle).  Hold the end of the thread opposite the pencil in the center of the figure, and at this time circle the bottom of the pattern with an even semicircle.  You should get a half ring.  The blank for the belt is a simple rectangle with a length equal to the waist circumference + 5 cm, width = 6 cm. </p><p>  Fold in half a piece of fabric along the lobar and attach the pattern so that the slices lie directly on the fold.  Add centimeter allowances to the seams and circle the paper with chalk or a piece of soap.  The belt is cut along an oblique line, at an angle of 45 degrees to the lobar, so as not to stretch. </p><p>  Now about how to sew a sun skirt.  Start with a belt, folding it in half and grinding the short sides.  Iron inward allowances.  Now align the top of the main part with the hole in the belt so that the edge of the skirt is inside it.  Make a seam.  Remember to leave room for the elastic. </p><p>  Stitch the details, insert the elastic band into the belt, sew the insertion point with a hidden seam.  Fold the bottom edge and fix the hem in the same way.  Now it remains only to iron the finished thing and you can wear it! </p><p>  Some subtleties: </p><ul><li>  if the circumference of the hips exceeds the width of the fabric, you will have to take two lengths; </li><li>  if the length of the skirt is planned to be maximum, to the floor, then even 4 lengths may be needed.  In this case, 4 seams will have to be ground; </li><li>  when calculating the internal radius, no increase is taken into account; </li><li>  Before cutting natural fabric, it must be washed and ironed so that the finished skirt does not warp after the first wash.  Synthetics do not need such preparation. </li></ul>
