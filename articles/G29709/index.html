    <h2>  How does it work </h2><p>  It is worthwhile to find out how the Auto Payment service from Sberbank generally works.  What it is?  Why is it necessary?  All this will be discussed now. </p><p>  After the client receives a plastic card, they immediately offer him to bind a mobile number to it, and then connect the "Auto payment".  This is a service that will automatically replenish the balance of a mobile number on a certain date and for a certain amount.  This will save the client from the minus in the account.  Funds will be debited from the linked card. </p><p>  Many people agree to connect, and then think about how to disable Auto-Payment.  Sberbank (Tele2, MTS, Megafon and other mobile operators) offers this service to everyone.  But disconnecting is much more difficult than starting to use the service.  Let’s find out what solutions exist. </p><h2>  Hotline Phone </h2><p>  The first method that you can advise everyone and everyone is calls to the Sberbank hotline.  You just need to take any phone and dial the number 8-800-555-55-50, and then wait for an answer.  After contacting the operator, inform him of your intentions to disable Sberbank's Auto Payment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="car payment service from Sberbank" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/849522.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Further, you will be required to enter the card details and some of your data, such as last name, first name, middle name, telephone balance recharge number, card number from which funds were debited.  In addition, <span>passport data</span> with registration may be requested from you.  If you do everything right, then after a while (usually a couple of hours after the call), "Auto Payment" will no longer work. </p><p>  The whole difficulty of this option is to dial the operator.  Sometimes the waiting time for a response can reach 15-20 minutes.  Not very pleasant, especially if you are calling from a mobile phone.  So you have to look for other approaches.  Let's understand further how to disable Sberbank's Auto Payment (MTS, Megafon, Tele2 and other mobile operators). </p><h2>  Mobile Bank </h2><p>  The next scenario, too, will not require you to go extra to the nearest branch of Sberbank.  For him, you just need to have a mobile phone at hand.  Only with its help you can cope with the task. </p><p>  The thing is that if you are thinking about the question “Auto payment” of Sberbank - how to disconnect (“Megaphone” and other mobile operators)? ”, Then, of course, you can resort to the help of“ Mobile Bank. ”This is a very convenient service of Sberbank, which allows us to work with the card and some services of the institution using only one mobile phone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable auto payment sberbank tele2" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/849523.jpg"></div>

In SMS, write "Auto Payment -" and, after a space, starting from nine, a telephone number.  Then again make a space and write the last 4 digits of your card, from which funds are debited.  Are you done?  Then send a message to 900 and wait for a response message.  You will be told that the service is disabled.  As you can see, disabling Sberbank’s “Auto Payment” is quite simple if you know what and in what sequence to do.  But there are other reasons.  They suit most customers.  And now we will try to study them. </p><h2>  the Internet </h2><p>  The most advanced users can resort to the help of the Internet, more precisely, to another Sberbank service called Sberbank Online.  It is here that you can control expenses from the card, as well as pay for many payments in a convenient form.  And all this is doable; it’s enough to have a computer and the Internet at hand. </p><p>  In order to disable Sberbank's “Auto payment”, you will have to visit Sberbank Online and log in to it.  Username and password should have been given to you upon receipt of the card.  Next, you enter the security code to access the site (it will come to your mobile).  After that, you will be taken to the main menu. </p><p>  There you have to look for "Auto Payment".  It is located in the "Personal" menu.  Now click once on the required payment.  You will see a list of possible actions.  There you need to find the item "Disconnect".  This action will completely remove the request.  In addition, if you do not want to re-create "Auto Payment" later (you never know, decide to return this service), then it is better to use the "Pause" command.  Next, confirm your actions.  That's all, now you can enjoy the result. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank auto payment how to disconnect a megaphone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/849524.jpg"></div>

    <p>  This option is getting used to using more and more.  It can be implemented without assistance and very quickly.  In addition, when changing the phone number, you can also change the "Auto payment".  But there are other options.  Which ones?  Let's get to know them, because not everyone is used to using Sberbank Online or Mobile Bank.  Some prefer more traditional methods. </p><h2>  Appeal to employees </h2><p>  One of the methods is a personal appeal to the employees of the nearest Sberbank branch with a statement about disabling Auto Payment.  This is the oldest and most proven way.  But it takes time. </p><p>  It is enough to come to the nearest branch of Sberbank, and then contact the employees with a statement about the refusal of "Auto Payment".  The form will be issued to you at the bank.  Fill it out and give it back.  Now you can wait a while (usually 10 minutes), after which you will receive an SMS notification about the disconnection of the service.  Nothing difficult, the main thing is the presence of patience and time.  After all, the line at the banks is always long. </p><h2>  ATM </h2><p>  You can do without the help of employees.  If you’re thinking how to disable Sberbank’s “Auto payment”, then try to use the most ordinary ATM or payment terminal, which is located in a bank branch.  These two machines will help you cope with the task. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable auto payment sberbank pay" class="if" height="448" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/849525.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Insert the card into the receiver, dial the PIN code and proceed to the "Mobile Bank" in the main menu.  Now you need to click on the "Auto Payment" menu.  Next, select "Disabling services."  Confirm your actions and enter the number from which you want to untie the service.  Click "Next" and wait for a suspension notification.  As a rule, you have to wait no more than 5 minutes. </p>
