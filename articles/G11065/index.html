They are compact, powerful and multi-functional.  However, all of the above applies only to good multicookers.  And there are not so many of them.  From Chinese crafts to choose a good product is almost impossible.  Therefore, when choosing to pay attention to all sorts of "Redmond" and "Borki" is not worth it.  Only money thrown to the wind will turn out.  But the multicooker with the pressure cooker function of the Moulinex CE 501132 is simply an excellent device.  Do not believe?  Then let's look at the key features of this product. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="multicooker with pressure cooker function moulinex ce 501132" class="if uuid-3239609" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3239609.jpg"></div><h2>  Design and appearance </h2><p>  Let's start with the look of the Mulinex pressure cooker.  In shape it is a small cylinder made of metal.  On the front is a control panel with a bunch of necessary buttons and an informative LCD display.  The upper part of the multicooker is covered with a lid, which is removed completely.  On the lid itself is a thermally insulated handle and a valve for releasing steam.  The steam release button itself is far from the valve, which positively affects ergonomics and safety.  The color scheme of the device is pleasant.  There are no aluminum or black tones.  The case itself is white.  But the individual elements are brown.  The Mulinex pressure cooker looks good.  She easily fits into any interior. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="slow cooker pressure cooker mulineks" class="if uuid-3239610" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3239610.jpg"></div><h2>  Multicooker Design </h2><p>  Inside this device is a bowl.

User reviews in this regard are not unambiguous.  There are both positive and negative comments.  But we will start with the positive.  So it will be easier in the future to highlight the pros and cons of the device.  So, many owners of this device note that this product from Mulinex can significantly save time.  What a cooker would cook on a stove for two hours cooks in 10 minutes.  This is how much free time appears!  Also, users note that the multicooker bowl is easy to clean, and nothing sticks to it.  This is pretty good.  For cheaper models, things are much worse with this.  Also, the owners of the device note a very thoughtful arrangement of the valve and buttons for releasing steam.  And in general, in other multicookers, the valve must be unscrewed.  And this is fraught with burns. </p><p>  Also, users praise the quality of dishes that are obtained in the multicooker.  They are really very tasty.  And if steaming, then it is also useful.  The owners of this product from Mulinex say that the warm-up function generally works great.

In general, those who purchased a Moulinex CE 501132 multicooker with a pressure cooker function are happy with the purchase.  According to them, this is a very profitable investment.  Yes, and the price of the device is very affordable.  Devices with the same functionality from other manufacturers are much more expensive.  So, Mulinex is just what you need for a person who wants to get a high-quality and reliable device for the right price. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="multicooker with pressure cooker function moulinex ce 501132 reviews" class="if uuid-3239614" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3239614.jpg"></div><h2>  Negative user reviews </h2><p>  However, there were those whom this multicooker did not suit for some reason.  Most often, in the comments, there were complaints about the device spending a lot of energy.  This is understandable.  After all, the heating element has a power of 1000 watts.  Of course, the power consumption is large.  Also, some did not like the fact that the multicooker does not have a timer with which to delay the start of cooking.  But for the money, the lack of a timer is a very small minus.  Another feature is the relatively large weight of the device.  And indeed it is.  The multicooker weighs a lot.  And carry it uncomfortable.  It is intended for stationary use only.  But even this is very difficult to write down as flaws.  You don‚Äôt drag the stove back and forth?  And the last thing that caused user dissatisfaction.  For a very long time this machine cooks yogurt.  And indeed it is.  The process takes as much as 8 hours.  This is a lot.  But it happened because of the specifics of the dish itself.  The slow cooker itself is quite powerful. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we thoroughly examined the Moulinex CE 501132 multicooker with a pressure cooker function.  This is a modern and very high-quality machine, which will help reduce the time devoted to cooking.  The device has a lot of features that may be required in the kitchen.  at the same time, the multicooker is not so expensive.  Everyone can afford it.  Moreover, at the moment this is the most suitable product on the market, for the ratio of "price-quality" is almost perfect. </p>
