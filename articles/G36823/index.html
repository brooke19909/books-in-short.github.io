Gadget users from the American company Apple were no exception. </p><h2>  Alternative Chargers </h2><p>  It is honest to say that gadgets from Cupertino have a weakness - they are their battery and chargers.  Even modern versions of phones hold battery power rather weakly, to say nothing of the older generation of phones.  Fast-discharging batteries led to an increase in sales of portable batteries, therefore it is not surprising that many users are interested in portable charging for the ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù 5th generation, an old man who has become obsolete and can hardly withstand even a day of stress.  The battery manufacturers realized that it would be nice to always have a charge on hand so as not to run in confusion in search of an outlet when the time comes to recharge the device. </p>

    <p>  Many people prefer to recharge their gadgets in the car.  On the way to work, for example.  Car charger for iPhone 5 generation is in great demand, allowing you to directly connect to the cigarette lighter and power the device on the go. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Well, in the end, every owner of the iPhone knows that the cables that come with the phone are not of the best quality (stability is lame).  Therefore, they know firsthand that you always need to have in mind a spare cord for charging the ‚ÄúiPhone 5‚Äù. </p><h2>  I carry everything with me </h2><p>  Being all the time on the road, using the phone on the go, far from sockets, and maybe from civilization at all, of course, you need to worry about carrying portable charging.  For the ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù 5th generation, this is a real panacea that can save the device from turning off, and you from losing communication in the most difficult situations.  Fortunately, the market is saturated with similar gadgets, from the most inexpensive and low-cost to full-fledged charging stations for several phones or tablets. </p><p>  I would like to highlight a number of interesting solutions.  For example, LithiumCard: The Hyper Charger is a stylish and compact battery that fits in your wallet and will be a great solution for those who are light.  The problem with this solution is its small capacity, only 1,200 milliamps of hours, which means that it will be enough only for a small charge of the phone and nothing more. </p>

    <p>  Another compact battery is the Mojo Hi5 Powerbank, which is worn directly on the phone and has not only the ability to fully charge the phone, but also performs protection functions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There are quite stylish and voluminous options.  Yes, <span>portable charging</span> for ‚ÄúiPhone 5‚Äù can be beautiful.  For example, Lepow Virtue, which, in addition to its elegant design, also has a powerful battery for 9,000 milliamps of hours, which will provide several recharges to your phone. </p><p>  But the most popular and popular product now is portable charging for ‚ÄúiPhone 5‚Äù from the Chinese company Meizu.  The Chinese like to delight users with low prices.  Their huge PowerBank M10 with a volume of 10,000 milliamps of hours will cost only 2,500 rubles. </p>

    <h2>  In touch in the car </h2><p>  A popular place to recharge devices is your personal car.  We often have to spend a lot of time in the car, while using the phone, listening to music, answering calls or using the navigator.  The ability to charge the phone in the car is not just a convenience, but a necessity. </p><p>  In most cars, problems should not arise at all, modern radio tape recorders are equipped with a USB port, you can simply connect a phone to it, and it will gradually charge.  If there is no USB port, then you will need a special charger that can be connected to the car‚Äôs cigarette lighter (do you have a cigarette lighter?).  The range of such chargers is offered by Belkin, the price varies from 1,500 rubles. </p><h2>  Lightning cables - the scourge of all iPhone users </h2><p>  Yes, alas, Apple‚Äôs modern and fast Lightning cables, despite the many advantages in the form of high data transfer speed, reversibility and other things, have very low endurance.  In less than a year, the cord bundled with a fashionable smartphone will most likely begin to fall apart, and this is the main, necessary component, which includes charging for iPhone 5.  The price for them, by the way, varies from unfortunate 80 rubles to several thousand, it all depends on how long the cord lasts. </p><h2>  Original or alternative? </h2><p>  This is a rather difficult question, or rather, it becomes as soon as it comes to price, the 5th generation iPhone cord for charging Apple itself will cost you 1,500 rubles, which is a lot for a cord that will last no more than a year.  Therefore, many users prefer other solutions. </p><p>  Alternatives are also different.  They can be divided into two main categories: MFi (those that were developed taking into account all the requirements of Apple, certified goods) and ‚ÄúChinese toys‚Äù (assembled in the basement of some modest Chinese town). </p>

    <p>  MFi is not always cheaper, often the choice falls on these cables due to their uniqueness.  Often they have an interesting, and most importantly, functional design.  For example, cables with a rag or titanium braid, which, according to manufacturers, are ready to serve their customers forever. </p><p>  Chinese cables are exceptionally cheap, but carry a lot of surprises.  The most harmless is slow charging, very slow.  Charging only in the off state, inadequate display behavior, turning off the phone - all this and much more awaits everyone who decided to order a cord for 100 rubles.  Unfortunately, there are also dangerous specimens that can overheat and even explode the device.  Be careful if you need charging for the ‚ÄúiPhone 5 S‚Äù, the original, despite its price, is the best solution, the same applies to other models. </p>

    <h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  Modern phones, of course, carry a lot of benefit, but all good things are always seasoned with a fly in the ointment, and difficulties with the battery are one of them.  Charging on the ‚ÄúiPhone 5‚Äù, the price of which is often frightening and outraging, can significantly spoil the impression of using the gadget.  Unfortunately, you have to put up with this, the main thing is to make a choice in favor of high-quality and proven batteries that do not pose a threat to your life. </p>
