This resort is known for its unique black volcanic sand beach.  People come here from all over Bali to watch dolphins frolic in the open sea.  Is it possible to live on Lovin?  This resort is very Europeanized.  Even its name consists of the English word love (love) and the Indonesian ina (mother).  Previously, there were several fishing villages on this site. </p><p>  Panji Tisna, the regent of Buleleng County, where Lovina is located, united them into one resort and gave him such an original name, which symbolically should mean ‚ÄúLoving Mother (of the Earth)‚Äù.  The center of the tourist zone falls on the former village of Kalibukbuk.  In general, the resort, like its beach, stretches for eight kilometers.  When is it worth coming to the north of Bali to catch the high season?  Can I live on Lovin?  What to do there, except for a beach holiday?  We will talk about all this in our article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sites.google.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Black Sand Beach in Bali" class="if uuid-3238892" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3238892.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get to Lovina </h2><p>  The resort is located between the cities of Babunan and Singaraja.  To the last from Lovina 11 kilometers.  International regular and charter flights on the island are mainly accepted by Denpasar Airport.  From there, as well as from the southern resorts will have to book a transfer.  But if you arrive to the north of the island, then to get to the resort of Lovina (Bali), you can use the services of the bus company "Perama".  Its routes are laid to the most famous beach of Padang Bay, Candidas, Ubud, Sanur and Kuta. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But if you travel in a company of 3-4 people, then at the same price as the bus, you will get a taxi.  From Denpasar such a transfer will cost three and a half thousand rubles, from Kuta - four.  Another low-cost alternative to the bus is the minibus, which is called "Bemo" here.  The road from Denpasar Airport to Lovina Resort takes three hours. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="-8.161140999999999" data-lng="115.02435660000003" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/9/5/9/17959.png"></div><h2>  Resort infrastructure </h2><p>  The center and focus of tourist life in Lovin (Bali) is Kalibukbuk.  Now a little reminds that once it was a poor fishing village.  Kalibukbuk has a bus station where tourists arrive, as well as an equipped pier.  After all, Lovina is famous not only for the beach, but also for the fact that flocks of dolphins live here in the natural environment not far from the coast.  In season, this resort was chosen by divers and snorkelers, because the water in these places is transparent, and the world of coral reefs is diverse and colorful. </p><p>  Most luxury hotels in Lovin are concentrated in Kalibukbuk.  On the outskirts of the resort (that is, in other former fishing villages) there are simpler hotels.  Getting around Lovina is best done by bicycle.  The embankment along the entire eight-kilometer length is covered with beautiful pink tiles.  But away from the sea, the terrain is hilly.  To explore the surroundings of the resort, in particular, visit the hot springs or temples, you need to rent a scooter.  In this resort area there are many shops, cafes, restaurants, and not only in its center. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.bali-indonesia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lovina Infrastructure" class="if uuid-3238905" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3238905.jpg"></div><h2>  Lovina Beach: Description </h2><p>  The northern coast of Bali is also washed by the ocean.  But, unlike the south, there are practically no big waves.  This is due to the fact that on the contrary there are small islands - Amed, Tulamben, Menjangan and a bunch of nameless ones - which take on the blow of the elements.  As a result, surfers do not come here.  But "Lovina" is heard by snorkelers and divers.  The former explore coral reefs along the coast.  Divers board boats and go to sites on the nearest islands. </p><p>  In the morning, buses with excursions eager to watch dolphins in their natural habitat arrive at the resort.  But most of all, like a beach with black sand in Bali, lovers of a relaxing and relaxed vacation.  The sea is calm and calm, there are no special winds either.  Low tides are noticeable, but they are not critical, and you can swim all day long.  Due to the orientation of the beach, you can enjoy both sunrises and sunsets.  <span>Volcanic sand is</span> very soft, but sometimes, tourists warn, the sea ashore sharp fragments of coral or shells.  Entry into the water is smooth, but you won‚Äôt have to wander to a depth of 200 meters.  Black sand is not everywhere.  Sometimes it is dark or light gray.  In some places there are inclusions of gold, quartz, sand. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lovina Beach in Bali" class="if uuid-3238889" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3238889.jpg"></div><h2>  Beach infrastructure </h2><p>  Admission to the eight-kilometer Lovina Beach is free.  Front-line hotels have fenced areas on the coast.  On them sunbeds and umbrellas are reserved for guests.  Cafes on the shore have their own beach equipment, which can be rented.  And no one will forbid you to sit on the black volcanic sand on your towel. </p><p>  It should be noted that many boats moor right to the shore.  Their owners hope to earn extra money by taking tourists to diving sites or to dolphin habitats.  But areas free of watercraft are available to the right and left of the main pier.  There the water is very clean. </p><h2>  Where to live in Lovin </h2><p>  In the high season for recreation, Bali is crowded with people, so it is better to book hotels in advance.  Of the fives, tourists praise Sea View Villa Blum, Jeria Amerta Sari and Villa on Tulip.  Among four-star hotels, travelers recommend Lata Lama, The Lovina Villas and Villa Teman. </p><p>  Surprisingly, there is a very big price difference between 4 * and 3 * hotels.  If the number in the Quartet costs from 9 thousand rubles, then in the Troika it is already two and a half.  Tourists recommend 3 * hotels: Frangipani Beach, Padmasari Resort and Pandava Village.  Budget tourists can also relax at Lovina resort.  Among the cheap hotels, a lot of meritorious reviews were collected by GM Lovina, Odica House &amp; Villa and Pondok Visata Sartaya. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.agoda.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to stay on the beach &quot;Lovina&quot;" class="if uuid-3238902" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3238902.jpg"></div><h2>  The best season for a holiday in Bali </h2><p>  Since the island is located in tropical latitudes, the annual climate cycle in it is divided in half.  The first season, lasting from May to October, is considered dry, and the second, from November to April, respectively, wet.  In the summer months, sultry weather reigns in Bali, with a clear sky and calm sea.  This is the peak of the tourist season.  Moreover, in the south of the island it is much hotter than in the north, in Lovin. </p><p>  Bali in May, at the very beginning of the season, can still meet guests with rains.  But they are short-lived.  But the sea has completely calmed down, there is no turbidity, which is why you can freely inspect coral reefs.  The last month of spring is still not very hot.  Such weather is suitable for excursions.  If you are traveling to Bali with a child, it is better to choose September for your vacation.  Toward the close of the high season, a refreshing breeze begins to blow.  Both May and September are also good because the prices in the resorts of Bali still or do not reach a peak. </p><h2>  Resort Activities </h2><p>  Lovina is a quiet place.  Couples in love, families with children come here to meet the sunrises and spend sunsets, soak up the black volcanic sand.  But Lovina (Bali) is also very much appreciated among professional divers.  Therefore, the resort has many schools teaching this sport, as well as rental equipment for it. </p><p>  But all these target groups of vacationers (lovers, families with children and divers) go to bed early.  In the evenings, there is no music in Lovinj and nightclubs are not lit.  In some cafes you can see local dancers in national clothes, listen to traditional singers.  One of the bars has billiards.  In restaurants, as a rule, live music sounds. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.muterjagad.com" data-author=": Bali Traveller, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beach &quot;Lovina&quot; - reviews" class="if uuid-3238899" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3238899.jpg"></div><h2>  Spa treatments </h2><p>  About 11 kilometers west of Lovina Beach (Bali), Banjar thermal springs hit from under the ground.  The natural temperature of these sources is not too high, so swimming in them is not only useful, but also pleasant.  This allows you to forget about the strong smell of sulfur, which is in the air even on the way to the baths.  Water fills three pools connected to each other by cascades. </p><p>  Sources allow you to get rid of arthritis and problems with joints and bones.  Also, bathing in them will benefit those who suffer from skin diseases.  Sources beats in a very beautiful area, more like a garden of paradise.  It is simply necessary to visit the balneological resort Banjar, although the entrance to the baths is paid. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": Quinn E, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Thermal springs near Lovina" class="if uuid-3238908" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3238908.jpg"></div><h2>  Dolphins and cocks </h2><p>  Gambling is prohibited in Indonesia.  But the law does not seem to be written to the locals.  After all, excitement cannot be destroyed with one circular.  Therefore, you can often see how local men train ... cocks.  The battles themselves take place underground, in the courtyard of one of the residents.  You cannot take pictures of the process.  But if you want to see a cockfight or even make a bet, you can carefully find out at the reception of your hotel where this competition will be held in the near future. </p><p>  If you arrived in Bali in May-September, you have the opportunity to observe dolphins.  These mammals drive schools of fish in shallow water and have breakfast.  Tourists say that you need to go to the beach early in the morning, from 5:30 to 6:00.  The sea near the beach simply ‚Äúboils‚Äù from a beating small fish, and from the waves smooth backs emerge from time to time.  In addition to bottlenose dolphins, which are the majority here, there are also a very rare gray dolphin and long-nosed stenella.  Early in the morning about 50 boats with excursionists eager to look at marine mammals in their natural habitat go out to sea.  After all, besides dolphins, small grind whales swim here.  Close to shore, they do not fit.  Dolphins became the real ‚Äúbreadwinners‚Äù of Lovina.  Indeed, thanks to them, vacationers began to come here.  Therefore, on the beach of Kalibukbuk there is a monument to the dolphin in the royal crown. </p><div class="photo" data-original="balioneparadise.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dolphins in Bali" class="if uuid-3238887" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3238887.jpg"></div><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  From April to October, numerous travel agencies offer vacationers to go on a short trip.  The Banjar dolphins and thermal springs were mentioned above.  But they do not exhaust the program of possible excursions.  Tourists in reviews of Lovina Beach (Bali) mention that the resort has the largest Buddhist monastery on the island, Brahmavihara Aram.  It is located near thermal springs. </p><p>  In the former village of Kaliasem, which has now become part of the resort, there is a culinary school.  There you can get acquainted with the basic products of Balinese cuisine and learn how to cook 5-6 national dishes.  A trip to the Hindu temple of Pura Oolong Danu will give many positive emotions.  Fans of natural attractions will enjoy an excursion to Sekumpul waterfalls - seven powerful jets.  They are considered the highest on the island of Bali. </p>
