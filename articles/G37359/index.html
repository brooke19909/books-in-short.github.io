    <p>  Credit cards are also offered at other banks.  Thus, there are many options where you can get a credit card with a passport.  You just need to choose the most attractive offer and visit a financial institution.  Feedback from borrowers suggests that you should draw up a card in extreme cases, since taking a consumer loan is much more profitable. </p><h2>  What does the interest rate consist of? </h2><p>  The loan rate is set based on such factors: </p><ul><li>  Inflation: the higher it is, the higher the rate. </li><li>  Interest on interbank loans: if a bank does not have its own funds for obtaining loans, then it asks for help from large financial institutions. </li><li>  Costs: the rate includes interest on the salary of employees, rental of premises, office maintenance. </li><li>  Profit: loan disbursement costs are taken into account. </li><li>  Seasonal costs: the provision of loans depends on the season.  During the holidays and before the New Year, the demand for loans increases and deposits decreases, so during these periods the rate may increase by 5-6%. </li></ul>

    <p>  The rate in each bank sets the same.  In addition, you need to pay attention to whether there are paid services.  Interest in large banks is less compared to small commercial organizations.  But if the rate is small, then the borrower is carefully checked. </p><h2>  Are cards issued to disabled citizens? </h2><p>  There are many banks in Russia competing with each other.  For profit, they treat customers loyally.  If the bank does not need to provide a statement of income, as well as provide information about the place of work, then unemployed citizens can also get a loan.  Only financial institutions cover risks with a high rate.  An important role is played by the borrower's credit history.  If it is positive, then usually <span>money loans are</span> approved.  Some lenders require you to provide SNILS or a driver‚Äôs license. </p><h2>  Pros and cons </h2><p>  According to customer reviews, card loans have the following advantages: </p><ul><li>  Quick review of application and provision of funds. </li><li>  Minimum documents. </li><li>  Available programs for all citizens. </li><li>  Cash is withdrawn at any ATM. </li><li>  Payment in terminals without commissions. </li><li>  Making payments over the Internet. </li><li>  In the grace period, interest is not charged. </li><li>  Renewable limit. </li><li>  The opportunity to participate in bonus programs. </li></ul>

    <p>  The disadvantages, judging by the reviews, are as follows: </p><ul><li>  High rates. </li><li>  Hide the commission. </li><li>  A small line of credit. </li><li>  Many cards do not have chips and a name, so they are less secure. </li></ul><p>  Before issuing a card, you should consider the pros and cons.  Typically, banks offer individual conditions for customers, so rates and amounts may vary. </p><h2>  Recommendations for borrowers </h2><p>  Before deciding which bank you can apply for a credit card, you should familiarize yourself with tips for borrowers.  Please note that an additional fee is charged for the service.  In case of delay, a fine and penalty are provided.  At first, a lower rate is offered, but with a loan, it will be high. </p>
