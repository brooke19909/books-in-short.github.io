    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  LED panel features </h2><p>  The design of the panels is designed so that during installation they are located on the same level with the rest of the ceiling surface.  This allows you to create a solid canvas without sudden changes.  Also, with the help of special suspensions, LED panels can be mounted directly to the concrete surface.  Thanks to these devices, the height of the structure is regulated. </p><p>  This method of lighting for rooms can significantly save energy.  At the same time, the ceiling structure itself is as safe as possible, quite strong and durable.  LEDs are designed for a long life, more than 50 thousand hours.  And, importantly, they are not afraid of power surges, they can work with a constantly changing current from 100 V to 250 V. </p><p>  When installing panels, special attention should be paid to fasteners.  If they are not included, then you can purchase these items in any specialized store, be sure to check the quality of the product.  As a rule, branded products have a <span>warranty period of</span> at least 5 years. </p><h2>  LED Ceiling Panels: Advantages and Disadvantages </h2><p>  The main advantages of this <span>type of lighting</span> : </p><ul><li>  <em>A wide selection of design solutions.</em>  Due to the variety of colors and shapes of panels, it becomes possible to easily integrate them organically into any stylistic direction: both in a cozy home design and in a strict office space. </li><li>  <em>Easy installation.</em>  Installation of panels does not take much time and does not require additional work. </li><li>  <em>Saving.</em>  With sufficiently bright lighting, it becomes possible to reduce energy consumption by 50%. </li><li>  <em>Backlight method.</em>  LED <span>ceiling panels</span> can be used as the main source or to highlight a specific area or to emphasize. </li><li>  <em>Long term of operation.</em>  LED lamp is designed for 50,000 hours.  This completely eliminates the need for frequent replacement. </li><li>  <em>Power.</em>  One large panel illuminates up to 50 square meters.  m </li><li>  <em>Ease of care.</em>  As a rule, such models do not require special care, which allows them to be placed in inaccessible places. </li><li>  <em>Harmonious combination with other light sources.</em>  Created compositions with classic chandeliers or lamps look original.  They add a touch of grace and chic to the ceiling. </li><li>  <em>Visual expansion of space.</em>  Thanks to reflective surfaces and soft scattering light, the effect of distancing the surface of the ceiling is created. </li></ul><p>  As a rule, this type of lighting does not have pronounced disadvantages.  But we can highlight such a nuance as cost.  LED panel, the price of which varies from 1500 r.  up to 10,000 p., will immediately require considerable investments, but over time they will fully pay off. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  <span>Scope of the</span> LP panels </h2><p>  This product is ideal for suspended and false ceilings.  Often used in models such as Armstrong.  Due to their unsurpassed properties and chic design, these panels are used for decorating upscale hotels, shops, and offices of prestigious companies.  Paying attention to the fact that such panels are completely environmentally friendly, they can also be installed in kindergartens, schools and medical institutions.  Recently, this type of lighting can often be found in residential premises: both in apartments and in private houses.  They are installed in rooms for various purposes: kitchens, halls, offices, living rooms.  Thanks to the original methods of fastening, the ceiling will acquire a unique and original design that can satisfy the taste of even the most demanding consumer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="led ceiling panels" class="if" height="392" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/772714.jpg" width="600"></div>
