As a rule, most people hear quite large cities, such as Minsk, Mogilev or Brest;  those that are smaller usually elude attention.  Meanwhile, Salihorsk deserves this attention.  Sights of Salihorsk (photos and descriptions are given in the article) are worth a visit. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="52.7899466" data-lng="27.53596170000003" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="13"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/8/3/8/5/18385.png"></div><h2>  Briefly about Salihorsk </h2><p>  Founded in 1958, this second largest city in the Minsk region is relatively young - it is only slightly over sixty years old.  Previously, it was called Novostarobinsky, since it appeared on the basis of the Starobinsky deposit.  However, later the name of the city was changed to Salihorsk, because it arose, in fact, due to the discovery and development on an industrial scale of potassium salt.  This happened a year later;  after another four settlements received the status of a city (initially it was considered a settlement). </p><p>  According to the latest data, a little more than a hundred thousand people live in the city.  Near the Sluch River flows, which can be attributed to the sights of Salihorsk.  However, it already has something to see, and this despite its relatively small size. </p><p>  Next, we will talk in detail about each place and / or object of the aforementioned settlement, which, in our opinion, deserve to be visited and seen.  In addition, for those who gather in this truly interesting city, we have a couple of useful tips.  So let's go. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  "Park of the Four Elements" </h2><p>  The youngest attraction of Salihorsk in Belarus is the "Park of the Four Elements".  This project was completed not so long ago by the Belarusian architect Alexander Sobolevsky, and the townspeople immediately liked the new resting place. </p><p>  Four locations coexist in the park, each of which is dedicated to a particular element - earth, water, fire or air.  Actually, for this reason the park is called so.  All these locations are located on the central, long-long alley of the park.  So the element of fire is a platform on which orange flags flutter beautifully in the wind.  Fluttering, they resemble soaring greedy flames of fire.  And nearby was the so-called platform of sunbeams, which was especially chosen by the kids.  These are special reflective elements with handles mounted near the water.  On a nice day, you can have a good time by launching sunny bunnies. </p><p>  A series of fountains is called the element of water, the largest of which, they say, has no analogues in all of Belarus.  The thing is that it is designed in a unique way.  Its jets (which, by the way, as many as 740) hit 20 meters upward, and the position of the jets and the pressure of the water are constantly changing, thus obtaining new forms.  In the evenings, this fountain is illuminated by several dozen flashlights. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rastishka.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Park of the Four Elements" class="if uuid-3257726" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59468/3257726.jpg"></div><p>  The element of air is represented in the green sights of Salihorsk with a kind of alley of ‚Äúsounding tubes‚Äù and a windmill, and the element of the earth is planted with exotic plants. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition to the four elements in the park there is something to see.  For example, a bust to Vladimir Ilyich.  It is located at the end of the alley, in the central square.  According to some reports, this bust was the last of all the statues of the leader of all peoples. </p><p>  Also in the park there is a dance floor, where music and laughter sound all the time, and on the weekend a pop-brass band generally works.  There is also an interesting bridge with a metal arch, which is twined with a wild vineyard.  Depending on the season, the color of the foliage is different, and the sight is extraordinary.  There are fountains in front of the bridge, so that it is perceived as a kind of observation deck from where a beautiful view opens.  The main fountain is located a little further, and next to it is a paradise for kids: trampolines, cars, all kinds of entertainment. </p><p>  The address of the "Park of the Four Elements": Kozlova street, 32. It works around the clock. </p><h2>  Sculptures on Kozlova </h2><p>  Two more sights of Salihorsk were located near the park (see photo below): the Eiffel Tower (it is interesting because it is located on a site that exactly follows the contours of France; there is a similar tower in Minsk) and the composition "The Wandering King", which was a diploma the work of one of the graduates of the Belarusian Academy of Arts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="soligorsk.city" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Eiffel Tower Salihorsk" class="if uuid-3257729" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59468/3257729.jpg"></div><p>  For eleven years, his project has been a bold reality.  Near the king - a good place for beautiful photographs as a keepsake. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="esoligorsk.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wandering King Salihorsk" class="if uuid-3257731" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59468/3257731.jpg"></div><h2>  "The tree of life" </h2><p>  Especially it should be noted among the sights of Salihorsk in Belarus (a memory photo here must be taken), which we are talking about, the next object.  This is a monumental wall panel called the "Tree of Life".  It was created on religious subjects by Belarusian painter Vladimir Krivoblotsky, and everyone who tries to interpret its meaning understands it in its own way.  Over the years since its inception, the panel has grown with many legends, the main ones of which say that the mysterious message for some initiates is hidden in the mosaic, and also that the mosaic has powerful otherworldly energy and local psychics draw their strength from it.  It is worth saying, however, that most art historians are inclined to believe that the panel does not have any special meaning, but is only a reflection of the spiritual world of its creator (the painter Krivoblotsky is a very religious person who visited the church from childhood). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lider-press.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Salihorsk Tree of Life" class="if uuid-3257734" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59468/3257734.jpg"></div><p>  You can find the mysterious and mysterious ‚ÄúTree of Life‚Äù and try to comprehend its essence at the following address: 65 Zaslonova Street. </p><h2>  Holy Protection Church </h2><p>  Salihorsk began with the village of Chizhevichi.  Today it is considered the outskirts of the city, but it is worth visiting this area: it is in Chizhevichi that the Holy Intercession Church is located - not only the ancient sight of Salihorsk, but also the oldest shrine for all Orthodox in this region.  The temple was founded at the end of the eighteenth century and survived, despite numerous fires, wars and other disasters.  Today it is a monument of wooden architecture and is still functioning.  Moreover, now it is part of a spiritual and educational center, which in addition to the temple itself also has a church and archaeological office, a laboratory for Christian anthropology, as well as a spiritual, educational and socio-cultural center.  Entering this building is certainly worth it: the exposition presented there is of genuine interest and is aimed, according to the rector of the temple, to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to get acquainted with the story live. </p><div class="photo" data-original="soligorsk.city" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holy Protection Church of Salihorsk" class="if uuid-3257735" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59468/3257735.jpg"></div><p>  Address of the Holy Protection Church: Central Street, 14. </p><h2>  Heaps </h2><p>  Being in Salihorsk and not visiting the heaps is simply not permissible.  This is the name of the places where potash production wastes are accumulated, or salt dumps, as they are affectionately called by the people.  And how else to prove that you have visited a salt city, if not a photograph, near the main attraction of Salihorsk? </p><div class="photo" data-original="vandrouka.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Saligorsk heaps" class="if uuid-3257733" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59468/3257733.jpg"></div><p>  Heaps are still visible at the entrance to the city - huge, purple-crimson.  And although you can‚Äôt come close to them - this is still a protected object, you can take a picture against them from almost anywhere in the city.  They are best seen from the territory of the children's beach on the local reservoir. </p><h2>  City center </h2><p>  There are several sights in the center of Salihorsk.  The first is, in fact, the central square.  It is located at the intersection of Lenin and Kozlov streets, and it is there that all the city‚Äôs mass events are held.  The second is an eighteen-story candle towering nearby (along Korzha Street), where "potash destinies" are just happening.  The third is the administrative building of the building trust on Kozlov, or rather, not so much as its spire - in the dark, it flickers with colored lights, and, according to Soligorsk residents, this spectacle is very spectacular. </p><h2>  Monument to the miner </h2><p>  Salihorsk is an industrial, mining city, and therefore it is not surprising that a monument to representatives of this profession is present in it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.esosedi.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to the miner Salihorsk" class="if uuid-3257736" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59468/3257736.jpg"></div><p>  It is a symbol of the city, but is still located on the same Kozlov street, near the house at number 33. Inside the sculpture is hollow. </p><h2>  Train Station </h2><p>  Two things at once make the station of the salt city unusual.  Firstly, it is a clock tower, which itself is a landmark of Salihorsk (according to reviews, it reminds many of London Big Ben), and secondly, the location of the tracks is not parallel to the station building (as in almost all cities), but perpendicular.  This is due to the fact that this station - Salihorsk - is a dead end (there are no further branches). </p><div class="photo" data-original="railwayz.info" data-author=":  , " data-source="https://railwayz.info/photolines/photo/27453"><img itemprop="image" alt="Train station Salihorsk" class="if uuid-3257732" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59468/3257732.jpg"></div><p>  Railway station address: Komsomol street, 38. </p><h2>  Squid trees </h2><p>  These wooden installations are really very reminiscent of creatures with tentacles.  You can find them at the crossroads of Lenin and Zheleznodorozhnaya streets, and what they mean is that everyone invents for himself. </p><div class="photo" data-original="esoligorsk.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Salihorsk squid trees" class="if uuid-3257737" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59468/3257737.jpg"></div><p>  In any case, these unusual trees deserve to be ranked among the sights of Salihorsk. </p><h2>  Top tips </h2><ol><li>  The cost of a hotel room starts from two and a half thousand, so take care of the required amount in advance.  In addition to hotels, you can turn your attention to hostels - it's cheaper there.  And to book a home, of course, is also in advance. </li><li>  Carefully plan your budget: prices in Soligorsk are high everywhere, including in stores. </li><li>  Be sure to visit the Salihorsk reservoir, but remember that swimming is prohibited there. </li></ol><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><ol><li>  Salihorsk is called the city of miners, but in addition to mines and potassium salts, there is one more thing: as many as as many as five hundred dollar millionaires live in this city. </li><li>  Salihorsk heaps (they are also called slag dumps) became the location of the video for one of Valery Kipelov‚Äôs songs. </li></ol>
