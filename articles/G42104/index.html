    <h2>  How was love for glass born? </h2><p>  Lily Gorbach traveled a lot around the world.  The artist was greatly impressed by the stained glass windows of Notre Dame Cathedral.  From them, the woman was breathtaking, and the creative master seized the master. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The beginning of the way </h2><p>  Acquaintance with the technique of fusing occurred in 2007.  In Russia, a woman miraculously caught the eye of the workshop where they made products in this technique.  She asked the owner of the workshop to take her as a simple apprentice.  She initially refused, but after seeing her sketches and zeal, she could not resist. </p><p>  The artist with great experience behind her agreed to just wash the floors in the workshop.  She studied with a drinking master, comprehended a lot on her own.  In fusing technique, Lilia Gorbach considers herself self-taught. </p><p>  Friends, seeing her work, forced her to leave the workshop and start her own business.  For a creative person it was not easy.  She had to become an entrepreneur and freelancer, purchase equipment and plan a budget, look for customers and promote her own name.  To achieve success, she was helped by talent, efficiency, responsibility. </p>

    <p>  Now Lily has her own workshop, where she feels like in paradise.  For the artist, this is a serious job.  She takes orders responsibly.  Rarely does repetitions of products, and jewelry does only in a single copy.  The master knows how important it is for a woman to wear exclusive jewelry. </p><h2>  What is fusing? </h2><p>  Briefly for those unfamiliar with the technique.  Fusing is a technique for fusing parts of a glass composition into one piece.  Work is baked in a special oven.  This is a fairly young direction in art.  The technology was first used in 1990 in Germany.  Fusing can not be called modern technology.  Sintering compositions began in ancient Egypt.  Later, a technique for creating stained-glass windows appeared related to fusing. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  So what is the process?  It is based on the amazing property of glass, which not everyone knows about.  Material, no matter how solid it is, turns into a liquid when exposed to high temperatures.  This allows you to connect different types of glass, create amazing shapes.  The technique is complex, but interesting, and mastering it is long and hard. </p><h2>  Lily about herself </h2><p>  Lilia Gorbach talks about herself as a positive person with a life-affirming position.  The artist believes that you can and should be praised, especially if there is a reason.  She is open to the world, to good people.  He has a blog where you can find not only her work, but also everyday photos, little secrets, ideas.  The blog is very lively.  The woman answers all messages, is pleased to meet new people. </p><h2>  Master's work </h2><p>  Most of all, the artist likes to make watches and frames for mirrors.  For such work, the master is taken first and foremost with great pleasure.  A watch is Lily's love. </p><p>  She also makes dishes, caskets, trays, paintings.  She can order amazing and functional interior items: sconces, chandeliers that will create a magical atmosphere in your home.  Lamps decorated with fusing technology look like a miracle strewn with precious stones. </p><p>  Like any lady, the artist loves women's jewelry and creates them with pleasure.  With her own hands, she makes unusual jewelry.  Her jewelry is already recognized and appreciated all over the world.  In her blog, she herself is a model.  With pleasure demonstrates the decoration on himself. </p>
