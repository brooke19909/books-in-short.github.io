    <h2>  Sunset Beach Resort 4 * <span>(Phuket): reviews of</span> Russian travelers </h2><p>  As many experienced tourists note, the great help when planning a trip abroad is the comments of those who have already visited this or that place.  After all, people leaving reviews about the hotel in which they stayed on vacation try to share not only information about the advantages, but also talk about the shortcomings that they had to face.  This approach allows you to create a more complete and close to reality picture of what will await you on vacation.  After all, no one wants to experience disappointment upon arrival on a long-awaited vacation.  As a rule, searching and studying reviews of tourists takes a lot of time.  We decided to save you some energy by offering to familiarize yourself with the generalized comments of our compatriots regarding their stay at Sunset Beach Resort (Phuket, Thailand).  Looking ahead, we note that many travelers were very pleased with their choice.  So, they absolutely do not regret the money spent and are ready to recommend this hotel to their relatives and friends.  But we learn about everything in more detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sunset beach resort 4 reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1053980.jpg" width="600"></div>

So, according to them, all the rooms here are very spacious, two-room, with large balconies.  Furniture and appliances, as tourists note, are not new, but all in good and working condition.  Almost none of the guests complained about any breakdowns.  But still, if something failed, then after contacting the reception the master fixed the problem very quickly.  The guests also liked that the rooms have everything that may be required during your stay - a safe (located in the closet), a hairdryer, a small kettle and <span>tea set,</span> and a clothes dryer on the balcony.  In addition, tourists call the big plus of this hotel the fact that the bathrooms have not only a shower, but also a full bath.  Travelers also liked that each room is equipped with air conditioning.  Therefore, if, for example, you are not afraid to catch a cold during sleep, you can turn on the air conditioning in the living room and turn it off in the bedroom.  Thus, the air will have a comfortable temperature with the interior door open, and you will protect yourself.  As for the location of the apartments, some guests advise, if possible, to ask the administrator at the reception to check in your room, whose windows do not open onto the road, since it can be quite noisy here.  In other cases, loud sounds do not bother you. </p><h2>  Cleaning </h2><p>  Guests of <span>Sunset Beach Resort 4 *, the</span> reviews we are reviewing, did not complain about the work of the maids.  According to them, they completely coped with their duties.  The rooms were cleaned every day, towels were changed several times a week, and bed linen was updated approximately every seven days. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the sunset village beach resort 4" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1053979.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Check in, departure </h2><p>  As our compatriots note, administrators try to provide room keys as soon as possible after arriving at the hotel to new arrivals.  Please note that upon check-in you will be asked to leave a deposit of two to three thousand baht.  At the same time, only local currency is accepted here, so if possible, exchange money on the way to the hotel, so that later you do not have to go outside in search of an exchanger.  Upon discharge from the hotel, the deposit amount will be returned to you.  As for the day of departure, the occupied room should be vacated before noon.  If you plan to leave the hotel only in the evening, you can extend your stay in your apartment for several hours.  According to tourists, it cost them about 800 baht. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sunset beach resort 4 phuket reviews" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1053978.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The price of accommodation at The Sunset Village Beach Resort 4 * ( <span>Phuket, Thailand)</span> includes breakfast only.  According to the guests, they are of the same type every day, however, it is quite possible to eat too much.  In addition, as tourists note, in the vicinity of the hotel there are many cafes and stalls where you can just have a bite or eat tightly for very little money.  So with travelers there are no problems with travelers.  By the way, with regard to lunches and dinners, many guests praise the cuisine of Sunset Beach Resort.  In addition, they said, prices here are sometimes lower than in the center of Patong.  Another part of the tourists enjoyed the dishes that are offered in the shops opposite the hotel, which begin their work in the evening. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sunset beach resort spa 4" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1053977.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  As our compatriots say, Sunset Beach Resort is across the street from the beach.  However, resting here is not very comfortable.  The fact is that when entering the water, the bottom is very rocky, so you can easily get hurt.  Therefore, almost all guests use the free shuttle service provided by the hotel.  So, every half hour tuk-tuk runs between the hotel and Bangla Road (the main attractions of Patong are concentrated here).  Across the road from this place is a great beach.  Here you can rent a deck chair or sit on a mat or towel brought with you.  Also on the beach there are several bars and cafes where you can order your favorite drink and refresh yourself during the day. </p><p>  As our compatriots note, a good beach can also be reached on foot.  The journey from the hotel will take you about 15-20 minutes.  However, you will have to go along the side of the roadway with heavy traffic (there is no sidewalk here).  So this option is hardly suitable for parents with young children or the elderly. </p><h2>  Staff, service </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews of tourists, they have no complaints about the staff of Sunset Beach Resort 4 *.  On the contrary, according to them, the staff here are very welcoming, smiling, helpful and ready to help in solving any situation.  True, some travelers who had not previously rested in Thailand thought that the workers were a bit slow.  However, experienced tourists claim that this is the norm for this country. </p>
