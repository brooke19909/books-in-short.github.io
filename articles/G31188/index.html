Why exactly this period of time?  Yes, because the construction of a fortress by order of Tsar Fedor Ioannovich belongs to this period.  The construction of this structure was necessary to protect the country in the south.  As you know, Samara is a fairly large settlement of the Russian Federation, located in the Middle Volga.  Thanks to the vast territory, it can be easily viewed not only on the map of our country, but also on a medium-sized globe.  By the way, today more than 1 million people live here permanently.

Where to go in Samara?</strong>  <strong>Local Attractions</strong> </h2><p>  A city that captivates from the first minutes of acquaintance is, of course, Samara.  Where to go on the weekend or what to see first, if fate has thrown you here for only a few days?  Let's try to advise. </p><p>  Invariably attracts the attention of tourists Orthodox convent Iversky.  Its foundation as a community of sisters of mercy is 1850.  Before the revolutionary events, the monastery developed, and therefore by 1917 there were already 4 churches on its territory.  In Soviet times, the Assumption Cathedral on the territory of the Iversky Monastery was blown up, and the bell tower, whose height was 65 m, was destroyed.  And only in the 1990s the Orthodox monastery was revived. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Samara where to go with a child" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/306602.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In your free time you can watch something related to the culture of the region.  For example, in the Samara Regional Museum of History and Local Lore - one of the oldest in the Volga region - there is a collection that has more than 200 thousand exhibits.  Both adults and young travelers will love it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Art Museum in Samara is also one of the largest in the Volga region.  By the way, it is worth paying attention to the fact that today it houses one of the richest collections of Russian art of the 17-19th centuries and a collection of graphics and paintings of the 19-20th centuries. </p><p>  The museum-estate of A. N. Tolstoy recreated the atmosphere of the provincial city of the Russian Empire at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries.  The archives of the writer and his mother are kept here. </p><h2>  <strong>Section 3. Where to go in Samara?</strong>  <strong>You need to know about it</strong> </h2>
