This article will help you find your way around, choose the best option and travel time on the Moscow-Pushkino route.  But first, let's talk about which metro station the station we are interested in is, how to get there, what to focus on.  In the article you will find other interesting facts and recommendations. </p><h2>  Where is this city? </h2><p>  Pushkino is a city near Moscow located in the north-west of the capital.  The distance to Belokamennaya is 31 kilometers, if we take the center of Moscow as a reference point.  And if you count from the Moscow Ring Road, then 21 kilometers.  The path to Pushkino lies through Mytishchi. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Pushkino" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39076/1285314.jpg" width="373"></div>

    <p>  Motorists use the M8 "Holomogory" highway (Yaroslavl highway) to get to Pushkino.  So we found out where the city is located approximately.  Now let‚Äôs talk directly about the station from which the Moscow-Pushkino electric train runs. </p><h2>  Yaroslavsky station </h2><p>  Have you heard about the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe three stations?  It is located almost in the center of <span>Moscow.</span>  <span>Komsomolskaya</span> Square, Building 5 - this is the address at which the building of the Yaroslavl Station is located.  It is from him that you can get to Pushkino. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Just keep in mind that the suburban ticket offices are not in the building, but on the street.  Need to go to the railway platforms.  Nearby there are ticket offices and pavilions with turnstiles.  Landmark - pavilions with a <span>green roof.</span>  It is worth noting that you need to arrive at the station well in advance, since there are lines at the ticket office at any time, especially on Friday nights and weekends. </p><p>  The fare on the route "Moscow-Pushkino" as of 2016: </p><ul><li>  82 rubles for an ordinary train; </li><li>  Express - from 140 rubles; </li><li>  REKS - 150 rubles. </li></ul><p>  REKS and express do not differ in time - 29 minutes from the Yaroslavl station to Pushkino, and on a regular train - from 45 minutes or more. </p><h2>  How to get to the Yaroslavl station? </h2><p>  If you are going to use the metro, then you need the Komsomolskaya station.  It is recommended to go along the ring line to immediately go to the Yaroslavl station.  You can get off the train on the <span>Sokolnicheskaya line.</span>  It is advisable to board the first car from the center (from the south) or the last (if you are traveling from the Rokossovsky boulevard). </p><p>  So, when we go outside, we will have two stations in front of us - Leningradsky and Yaroslavsky.  Go right to the white-green pavilions.  It is there that the suburban box office, which we spoke about earlier, are located. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pushkino how many kilometers from Moscow" class="if" height="470" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39076/1285313.jpg" width="400"></div>

Therefore, in order not to be late for a train or train, you should leave your home / work at least half an hour earlier. </p><p>  Soon we will talk in more detail about the trains that serve the Moscow-Pushkino route. </p><h2>  A bit about the long road </h2><p>  Yaroslavsky station is special in itself.  Do you know what?  It has very interesting long-distance routes.  It is from this station that one can leave for the Urals, Siberia, Baikal, and even to Vladivostok.  Just imagine that it is from this station that you have the opportunity to go around the whole country from west to east.  But, unfortunately, there are not so many trains per day, the demand among passengers for the north and east directions is not very large.  But with the suburban traffic the opposite is true. </p>

    <p>  For a beginner, it is very important not to confuse the train if you have the ticket ‚ÄúMoscow-Pushkino‚Äù in your hands.  There are not one or even two directions in suburban traffic, there are much more of them.  You can easily go to the wrong place.  Therefore, be very careful.  The scoreboard always says where and what kind of train is.  But, unfortunately, it is not indicated anywhere whether she is going to Pushkino.  Let's take a better look at which trains need to be oriented. </p><h2>  Do all electric trains follow there? </h2><p>  Take only those trains with one of the following arrival points written on the windshield or side window: </p><ul><li>  Sergiev Posad. </li><li>  Alexandrov-1. </li><li>  Balakirevo. </li><li>  Sofrino </li><li>  Krasnoarmeysk. </li><li>  Pushkino. </li></ul><p>  It is worth noting that basically only branded REKS electric trains have the route ‚ÄúMoscow - Pushkino‚Äù.  And the rest, as a rule, go further. </p><h2>  About <span>intermediate stations</span> and stop <span>stations</span> </h2><p>  So which stations will be along the way?  Note that not all trains stop on absolutely all platforms.  We will indicate exactly those that are in great demand, and there is always a parking lot for each electric train: </p><ul><li>  <em>Losinoostrovskaya</em> .  This station is located in Moscow, in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Losiny Ostrov forest park.  There is not only a forest nearby, but also a huge sleeping area.  People get to the metro far and inconveniently using buses, trolleybuses, moreover, it‚Äôs more expensive, so many people use the train. </li></ul>

    <ul><li>  <em>Mytishchi</em> .  <span>The railway station is</span> quite large, there are many platforms.  Of course, absolutely all trains stop here, even those that don‚Äôt follow Pushkino.  There is only one exception: the Moscow-Pushkino (REKS) electric train follows without stops, it does not stop even in Mytishchi. </li></ul><p>  By the way, it is after Mytishchi that the roads diverge.  Some electric trains go straight - towards Alexandrov, others - towards Fryazino and Fryazevo. </p><h2>  Return trip </h2><p>  In the city of Pushkino, take a ticket back to Moscow at the box office.  It will already be easier to navigate.  You don‚Äôt need to look for the necessary train, since absolutely all of them follow to Moscow.  If you don‚Äôt feel like standing up or you are in a hurry, then the Pushkino-Moscow-Yaroslavskaya train will do.  But, as we said above, this is an express REKS.  And the fare is almost double that of ordinary rolling stock. </p>
