    <p>  Bironovschina is the reactionary regime of the first half of the eighteenth century in Russia.  In the decade when Empress Anna Ioannovna reigned. </p><p>  Specific traits: </p><ul><li>  the dominance of foreigners - mainly Russia was invaded by the Germans, who occupied important posts in the public service; </li><li>  exploitation of the people - a similar attitude was characteristic of most rulers of the country; </li><li>  prosecution of dissatisfied - characterized by cruelty, encouraged denunciations; </li><li>  the depletion of the state treasury - this was facilitated by the inability to manage the state, excessive luxury at court, and theft by favorites. </li></ul><p>  The word "Biron" was coined by Field Marshal Minich.  He was the favorite of Peter the Great.  As a German, Minich hated the favorite Anna Ioannovna.  As soon as he had such an opportunity, he dealt with him.  But about this in order. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The coming to power of Anna Ioannovna </h2><p>  Bironovschina is a term that is associated with the reign of Anna Ioannovna.  Her coming to power was a complete surprise for both her and the courtiers.  The former Courland Duchess did not play a special role in the court struggle. </p><p>  She ascended the throne thanks to the February coup of 1730.  Anna Ioannovna became empress without signing any documents that would limit her power.  She received the full power of the Russian autocrat. </p><p>  Anna Ioannovna was not prepared for the role that she got.  She did not possess the necessary skills and knowledge, and indeed had no desire to learn.  At the time of her accession, she was thirty-seven years old.  According to contemporaries, she did not differ in pleasant appearance, had a large physique. </p><p>  In her youth, she was married to the Duke of Courland, who soon died.  For security reasons, Peter the Great did not begin to look for Anna's groom.  So she remained in foreign lands for eighteen years.  Despite her widow status, she was not alone.  At various times, she had prominent favorites.  One of them was Biron. </p><h2>  Biron </h2>

    <p>  Bironovschina is a term associated with the period when Biron was the favorite of Anna Ioannovna.  In fact, in the history of Russia there were four Biron, which at one time played a role in the history of the state.  The favorite was Ernst Johann.  He had two brothers who also served in Russia. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The older brother's name was Carl.  He is known for his escape from Swedish captivity, later he became Governor-General of Moscow.  The second brother's name was Gustav.  He distinguished himself during the capture of Ishmael. </p><p>  The favorite of the Empress had a son.  His name was Peter.  Biron sought to marry him to <span>Anna Leopoldovna,</span> who was to become the heir to the throne.  These attempts were unsuccessful. </p><p>  <span>Ernst Biron</span> was a native of small local nobles.  He began to serve under Anna Ivanovna from 1718.  He was married to the maid of honor of the Duchess.  In marriage, he had three children.  Some researchers suggest that some of Biron's children were born of the empress.  But there is no evidence for this. </p>

    <p>  Biron had a great influence on the empress.  Before her death, she appointed him regent.  He had to rule the state while <span>John Antonovich</span> was a minor.  The appointment took place in the presence of many witnesses, while the empress was in her right mind.  It was drafted orally and in writing.  But this did not save Ernst Johann from problems.  He was accused of capturing the regency and eliminated. </p><h2>  Who was the main figure at court? </h2><p>  Although Bironism in Russia is associated with the activities of Biron, many historians agree that Heinrich Osterman was engaged in the main internal and external state affairs. </p><p>  He was born into a pastor's family in Westphalia, and was educated at the University of Jena.  His life was changed by a duel.  He was forced to flee to Amsterdam, and then to Russia.  Once in a foreign country, he quickly learned Russian.  Three years later, in 1707, he became a translator of the <span>embassy order.</span>  Osterman gained trust from Peter the Great.  He was his adviser.  The ruler appreciated Osterman, granting him many lands. </p><p>  He was one of the associates of Peter the Great, and after his death he became the de facto leader of Russia's foreign policy.  Since 1730 he received count dignity. </p><h2>  State activities of the favorites </h2>

    <p>  With the concept of "Biron" is associated with the reign of Anna Ioannovna.  As Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin once noted, Biron was not lucky in that he was a German.  That is why they decided to hang on him all the sins of that time.  But if you study the activities of the rulers of that era, it becomes clear that at that time no one was thinking about the people.  Each new ruler sought to profit for himself and stay on the throne as long as possible. </p><h2>  The modern meaning of the concept </h2><p>  The term "Bironovism" today means the dominance of foreigners in the public and political life of the state.  It is used with a negative message. </p><p>  Associations with the term: </p><ul><li>  theft; </li><li>  espionage; </li><li>  looting the treasury; </li><li>  repression; </li><li>  crazy holidays. </li></ul><p>  In folklore, no mention of Bironism has been preserved.  This is due to the fact that the activities of Biron concerned the lives of nobles, officials, and guard soldiers.  The palace coups did not concern the life of ordinary people. </p>
