More recently, this hotel had only three stars on its sign.  But at the last renovation in 2014, the hotel acquired a nice additional three-story building ‚ÄúAnnex‚Äù.  It houses the best of the hotel rooms.  This innovation allowed the previously modest Sirma 3 * hotel to add another star to its class.  Many of the rooms in this hotel have small kitchenettes.  And thanks to this, the resort complex has transformed into a real apart-hotel.  And what services do tourists provide in Sirma 4 *?  Do guests there offer to cook their own food?  Here we have put together all the recent tourist reviews to make a brief overview of the service and comfort level of the Sirma 4 * hotel in Side. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sirma Hotel 4 Side" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2117464.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Where is Sirma Hotel 4 * (Side) located and how to get to it? </h2><p>  The location of the hotel tourists call ideal.  It is not in the very center of a noisy resort, but a little further away, but not at the very end.  Antique Side with its many attractions is two kilometers away.  And the center of a modern resort - with a market, a bus station and places of entertainment - is 1 km away.  Side is not as far from Antalya as Kemer and other cities on the Mediterranean coast of Turkey.  Therefore, a transfer from the airport will take forty minutes, a maximum of one hour.  Nature attractions are also nearby.  Five kilometers to the most beautiful Manavgat waterfall, and three to Cholakli.  But the main plus of the location of the Sirma Apartments hotel is that it is located on the seashore.  To get to the hotel‚Äôs own beach, its guests will need to overcome from 250 to 50 meters, depending on which building they live in. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sirma Hotel 4 Side Price" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2117473.jpg"></div>

Therefore, the hotelier managed to get a fairly vast territory with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãseven thousand square meters.  Through the efforts of landscape designers and gardeners, this dry coastal site has turned into a flowering <span>Garden of Eden.</span>  The first thing a tourist sees when he settles is the main building - the six-story Main Building.  The reception is in a beautiful, presentable lobby.  Nearby is the Annex building, which consists of three floors.  Fifteen cottages lined up in a graceful line toward the sea.  The buildings have elevators.  The villas consist of two floors.  All the free space between the buildings is occupied by lush Mediterranean vegetation.  There are green lawns in front of the cottages, on which pine trees casting an openwork shadow grow.  Near the buildings there is an outdoor swimming pool with a children's section.  The path along the villas takes you to a delightful sandy beach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sirma Hotel Apartments in Side" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2117472.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Room Categories </h2><p>  From the past of ‚ÄúSirma‚Äù, when it was a three-star hotel, there were only unpretentious economy rooms (15 square meters).  The main building houses standards for two to three guests.  Their area is slightly larger - 18 square meters.  m. On the top floor of the main building there are several double suites.  They are very comfortable.  The three-story "Annex" is filled with rooms of the Family Suite category.  Most of the tourists from Russia who left reviews lived in cottages.  These two-story villas contain family rooms.  In general, tourists rate their stay at Sirma Hotel 4 * (Side) as corresponding to the four-star status. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What is in the rooms? </h2><p>  All guest rooms are tastefully decorated.  The rooms have balconies - both those that are in the buildings, and those in the villas.  Moreover, the number of storeys does not matter.  Even at the first level you will have the opportunity to drink tea while sitting on the balcony.  As can be judged from the reviews, only family apartments - rooms and suites have kitchens.  And what is in the rooms of the Sirma Hotel 4 * (Side)?  The family room in the cottages consists of a spacious living room, which is combined with a small kitchen, two bedrooms and a bathroom.  The room adjoins two balconies overlooking on either side of the villa. </p><p>  In the living room there is a folding sofa, which, if necessary, can serve as a bed for another family member.  This room also has satellite TV, a coffee table and soft chairs.  Both bedrooms have air conditioning and very spacious wardrobes.  The bathroom has a shower.  Tourists recall that a clothes dryer is screwed on the balconies.  In the standards there are only minibars.  And in the apartments guests can cook their own meals - all conditions are created for this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sirma Hotel 4 Side reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2117465.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Despite the presence of a kitchen in most rooms, the Sirma Hotel 4 * hotel (Turkey, Side) offers its guests an all-inclusive concept.  An additional advantage that tourists noticed was that each room has a certain table in the restaurant.  The guests considered it very convenient.  Meals are represented by both European and Turkish cuisine.  We can say that the dishes in the hotel will satisfy the tastes of all guests, both vegetarians and meat-eaters, and sweet tooth. </p><p>  Family tourists claim that there was always something to feed the kids - casseroles, meatballs, not spicy soups, chicken nuggets and french fries, and for breakfast - delicious pancakes and healthy cereals.  The food in the hotel is plentiful, albeit on a schedule.  Between meals, snacks are constantly arranged - they either bake gozleme, or waffles, or roll out carts with a variety of cakes and cookies.  From morning until late in the evening there are bars - in the lobby, on the beach, near the pool.  You can have a snack there and just relax with a drink. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sirma Hotel Apartments prices" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2117474.jpg"></div>
