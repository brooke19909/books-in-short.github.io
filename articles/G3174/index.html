    <p>  In the process of removing the processed products from the human body, the rectum is assigned one of the main roles.  Also, it performs an important function during the absorption of liquid. </p><p>  The state of the internal organs and systems of the human body depends on how the rectum works. </p><h2>  What is the length of the human rectum </h2><p>  This question can only be answered approximately.  What is the length of the rectum in a person, is determined by age.  As they grow older, almost all organs grow.  Based on this, you can only approximately answer the question - how long is the rectum.  Scientists indicate only average values.  The length of the rectum of an adult is from thirteen to twenty-three centimeters.  This is one eighth of the size of the lower intestine. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The length of the rectum of the newborn is small in relation to the size of other parts of the gastrointestinal tract.  Doctors, like adults, know only approximate sizes.  Fifty millimeters is the average length of the rectum.  Representatives of both sexes of humanity have no significant differences in size. </p><h2>  Departments of the rectum </h2><p>  A detailed examination of the structure of the human rectum conditionally distinguishes three formations: </p><ul><li>  Crotch.  It has four borders.  Also, this section of the rectum is divided into two triangles.  The first of them is the genitourinary.  In men, there is a channel for urination in it.  In women, the vagina is attached to the canal, respectively.  In the anal triangle, regardless of gender, is the anus. </li><li>  Anus.  This is the final part of the gastrointestinal tract and rectum, respectively.  The passage opening visually resembles a slot leading to a channel.  The appearance of the rear opening in the male and female representatives is different.  The male anus is like a funnel.  And the female one is either completely flat and flat, or sticks forward. </li><li>  The skin around the anus.  It differs in color from the rest of the epidermis.  Also around the anus, the skin is very wrinkled.  The reason for this is the external sphincter.  The anus has a diameter of three to six centimeters, a length of up to five.  The anus and rectum have blood vessels and nerve endings that allow you to regulate the bowel movement (the process of excreting feces) of the body. <strong></strong></li></ul><h2>  Sphincters </h2><p>  In the rectum, two sphincters are distinguished - involuntary and arbitrary.  The first is inside the body.  It serves as a separator of the intermediate bend and the final part of the rectum.  Involuntary sphincter consists of muscles placed in a circle.  Sizes range from one and a half to three and a half centimeters.  In men, the involuntary sphincter is thicker than in the representatives of the beautiful half of humanity. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The arbitrary sphincter is located outside.  It is under human control.  The sphincter is a striated muscle going from the muscles of the perineum.  Size - from twenty-five millimeters to fifty. </p><h2>  Features and length of the rectum in women </h2><p>  Comparing the anatomy of both sexes, colossal differences are not found.  The length of the rectum is the same in men and women.  The weak half of humanity, however, has a number of anatomical differences. </p><p>  In the female body, the rectum is located in close proximity to the vagina, namely, located in front of it.  Of course, there is a layer between them.  However, it is so thin that it is not able to withstand the migration of purulent and tumor processes from one organ to another. </p><p>  In view of these female anatomical features, representatives of the weaker sex often suffer from rectal-vaginal fistula.  They are the result of injuries or severe tearing of the perineum during the birth of a baby. </p><h2>  Functions </h2><p>  The main function of the rectum is the elimination of waste products from the body.  The bowel movement is regulated by the human mind. </p><p>  The next most important function, after excretion of feces, is the absorption of fluid.  About four liters of water per day is returned to the human body during processing, pressing and dehydration of feces.  In addition to water, the rectal mucosa absorbs minerals and trace elements and thus reverses them back. </p>

    <p>  The human rectum also has a reservoir function.  This is explained by the following: feces collected in the ampoule of the intestine.  As a result, pressure is exerted on its walls.  They are stretched, a nerve impulse is given, indicating the need for defecation to begin. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Due to its importance, the rectum must function normally.  She is very sensitive to various kinds of painful sensations and conditions.  For example, constipation provokes stagnation of feces.  And this, in turn, leads to intoxication of the human body.  Also, at the end of fermentation of processed foods, intestinal relaxation is possible. </p><h2>  Rectal function </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the main task of the rectum is the removal of feces, toxins and other harmful substances from the human body.  The functionality of the entire digestive system depends on its proper operation.  In the rectum, all unnecessary substances accumulate and then are excreted. </p><p>  In the event of improper operation, all of this waste rot, gathering together and thereby poisoning the body.  That is why it is extremely important to monitor the health of the rectum. </p>

    <p>  Conventionally, the work of the rectum is divided into static and dynamic.  The first is the accumulation, as well as the retention of feces and harmful substances.  When excrement is collected in the intestine, it becomes wider, folds of the mucous membrane are stretched.  Harmful substances, due to the anal press and tightly compressed walls, fill the entire length of the rectum.  The photo above contains information on the direction of their output.  And the spontaneous release of gases and intestinal waste is prevented by the anal sphincter. </p><p>  Dynamic work consists in removing accumulated harmful substances from the human body.  The bowel movement is called bowel movement.  The moment when it should occur is realized through nerve endings.  It happens that a person has the urge to defecate, and the rectum is actually empty.  Such situations occur when a person has a disrupted gastrointestinal tract.  In most cases, this indicates the occurrence or development of a variety of diseases. </p><h2>  Malformations of the human gut </h2><p>  Unfortunately, rectal malformations develop before birth.  The reasons can be a variety of factors, and listing them makes no sense.  Basically, two sections of the intestine are affected - this is the perineum and the <span>anus.</span>  The most common defects: </p><ul><li>  <span>Stenosis (narrowing).</span> </li><li>  Cloaca. </li><li>  Atresia (infection). </li><li>  Fistulas are chronic inflammatory processes. </li></ul><p>  Congenital malformations without the formation of fistulas become noticeable after the birth of the baby, during the first day.  The cause of this ailment is a small bowel obstruction.  Symptoms of vice include neglect, nausea, vomiting, and over-excitement. </p><p>  The doctor recognizes the growth of the anus immediately after birth.  However, for accurate diagnosis, surveys will be needed.  Often this defect is a consequence of the formation of fistulas in the perineum or in the genitourinary system.  The main symptoms are the excretion of feces through the vagina.  Already on the basis of certain sizes, the doctor prescribes treatment methods.  Diagnosis of the fistula is carried out using x-ray studies.  This procedure is called fistulography. </p><p>  It is performed by a radiologist in conjunction with a surgeon.  An examination is carried out reporting the presence of an allergic reaction to iodine.  Before the procedure, its contents are removed from the fistula with a syringe.  The fistulous canal is washed.  Then, a catheter is inserted into the fistulous opening through which a contrast agent (containing iodine) is introduced.  The volume of the radiopaque fluid directly depends on the size of the fistulous canal.  It must be completely filled with contrast medium. </p><p>  After insertion, the fistula opening is closed with a gauze ball and sealed with a plaster.  X-rays taken.  <span>The radiopaque substance is</span> eliminated, or it leaks independently.  In some cases, it is permissible to carry out the procedure under anesthesia. </p><p>  In cases of diagnosing helpless atresia, the child is immediately sent for surgery.  In some situations, surgery is delayed until the age of two.  These include vaginal and vestibular fistulas.  Before reaching the required age, the child eats in accordance with a special diet, which includes products with a laxative effect.  And bowel movement occurs through enemas. </p>

    <p>  Pathology in the form of a narrowing of the rectum is diagnosed using proctography and rectoscopy.  Most of the treatment consists of nutrition according to diet and bougieurage.  The latter is the introduction of a flexible or rigid rod into the affected organ to stretch the intestine.  The input tool each time increases in diameter.  And in this way, the rectal opening is gradually stretched.  The number of treatments varies individually. </p><p>  Pathology in the form of congenital cloaca affects only girls.  This defect is as follows: the urethra, vagina and the entire length of the rectum are combined into a common channel.  In women, this pathology can be eliminated only with the help of surgical intervention. </p><p>  Based on many years of statistics, doctors are forced to agree with the fact that any damage to the intestine is vitally dangerous for the human body.  Especially fraught with internal gaps.  Only a timely visit to a specialist will save a life and will not cause inconvenience in the future. </p><h2>  Symptoms of rectal disease </h2><p>  Each disease has specific symptoms.  Nevertheless, it is worth highlighting common signs. </p>

    <p>  Common rectal diseases: </p><ul><li>  Proctitis - inflammation of the rectal mucosa.  As soon as the disease has arisen in the human body, symptoms will immediately appear.  Signs of proctitis include diarrhea, pain, false urge to defecate, and the presence of mucus and blood streaks in the stool.  The causes of the disease are great.  The treatment process is based on the elimination of symptoms of proctitis and the causes of its appearance. </li><li>  Prolapse of the rectum.  The disease is also known as a hernia.  It consists in the exit of the rectum beyond the borders of the anus.  In addition, its fixation is violated.  Frequent <span>prolapse of the</span> rectum is accompanied by bleeding.  Treatment is exclusively through surgery. </li><li>  Anal fissure.  Symptoms of the disease are cutting pain during bowel movements, scanty bleeding after defecation.  It is quite possible to diagnose a crack in the anus when examining the rectal lumen.  If the disease has passed into a chronic stage, surgical intervention will be required for treatment. </li><li>  Polyposis is a non-cancerous formation located in the lumen of the rectum.  The disease does not cause inconvenience to a person, and he simply does not notice it.  Polyposis reveals itself in case of injury or reaching large sizes.  This is expressed through anal bleeding.  The treatment of polyps is surgical removal. </li><li>  Coccygodynia is difficult to diagnose because pain in the rectum is not accompanied by visual evidence of its damage.  Activators of the disease - injuries and muscle cramps, causing the anus to rise up.  During the <span>treatment of coccyalgia, the</span> patient feels psychologically uncomfortable, therefore, it involves the presence of a psychotherapist, neurologist or neurosurgeon. </li><li>  Hemorrhoids - varicose veins of the rectum, namely in the anus.  The two main symptoms of this rectal disease are spotting and prolapse of the nodes from the anus.  Also, in addition to the listed signs of hemorrhoids, there is a feeling of heaviness and the presence of a foreign body in the rectum, itching, burning and pain in the anus, painful bowel movements.  The dilated parts of the veins interfere with the normal excretion of feces, are injured, thrombosed. </li></ul><p>  The causes of the disease are diverse: laxatives, frequent use of enemas, oral contraceptives, excessive hygiene of the anus, unbalanced nutrition, anal sex, regular cycling, horses, a motorcycle, pregnancy.  Often this disease affects people whose professions involve sedentary work, for example, drivers, programmers. </p><p>  There are many ways to treat hemorrhoids.  In each individual case, the specialist selects the necessary technique that will treat the disease, as well as minimize pain and inconvenience.  However, it is worth noting that quick and painless healing is possible only in the early stages.  Hemorrhoids tend to develop very quickly, and, as a result, you have to lie on the operating table under the surgeon‚Äôs knife.  And then follow the strict rules of the postoperative period. </p><ul><li>  Paraproctitis is a purulent inflammatory process that has formed on the fiber surrounding the anal canal.  The characteristic features of the disease are sharp pulsating pain in the perineum, compaction in the anal part, local redness and fever.  Treatment of this disease of the rectum is possible only with the help of surgery.  And at the wrong time, a medical intervention threatens with generalization of the disease and fever.  Chronic paraproctitis is a fistula of the rectum, since the inflammatory process is accompanied by a fistula, which breaks through the intestines or skin in the anus.  At this stage of the disease, healing is the treatment of the fistula in the acute stage and its surgical elimination after the inflammatory processes become less active. </li><li>  Crayfish.  The disease itself does not inspire hope, plus everything is extremely dangerous due to the asymptomatic course in the early stages.  The first symptoms a person discovers at a time when the disease has already affected a significant area.  Symptoms of cancer - pain and a feeling of a foreign body in the anal canal.  If these signs of the disease are detected, only a radical treatment is already possible.  Based on this, do not neglect the slight inconvenience in the anus or rectum.  Do not hesitate and consult a doctor. </li></ul><p>  There are still a great many diseases of the rectum.  They are found much less frequently, but this does not mean that they are less dangerous. </p>
