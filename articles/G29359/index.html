Therefore, it is extremely important to make the right choice regarding one or another method of allocating income and expenses, so that subsequently there are no misunderstandings with the fiscal authorities.  In the article below, we will talk about how it is possible to reflect the results of the operating activities of an enterprise in accounting. </p><h2>  The nature and classification of income in the enterprise </h2><p>  According to the current legislation, any profit that a business entity receives in the course of its activities and which can be calculated in value terms by various methods (there is a cash basis or accrual method) is accepted as income. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cash method" class="if" height="255" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26834/854862.jpg" width="418"></div>

    <p>  At the same time, there is a category of income to the entrepreneur‚Äôs budget, which is excluded from the income items and is not subject to taxation.  These include additional taxes (they are also called indirect), which are the added value of the goods that the buyer covers upon purchase. </p><p>  In general, the revenue part is determined by analyzing the primary and tax accounting documents, as well as others, confirming the fact of the transaction.  In other words, income is classified into taxable and those that are not subject to fiscal tax calculation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Profit as an object of taxation </h2><p>  It's no secret that <span>net profit</span> is formed from the total revenue minus a number of mandatory contributions, after which the total income is calculated in various ways (such as, for example, the accrual method and the cash method). </p><p>  The amount received is taxable and meets the following conditions: </p><ul><li>  financial flows should be the result of sales activities; </li><li>  revenue is deemed received even if it is presented not in cash but in kind. </li></ul><p>  However, there is such income that is considered to be non-operating and taken into account as a result of operating activities.  It should include various types of shares, interest on deposits, <span>exchange differences,</span> fines, penalties and others received. </p><p>  Such income in favor of a business entity as leased property, loans, as well as contributions to the authorized capital of an enterprise are not taxable. </p><h2>  The nature and classification of expenses </h2><p>  When it comes to expenses, many start-ups who do not have experience in entrepreneurial activity think that any operating costs reduce taxable profits.  However, this is a fallacy.  Yes, the expense is a certain amount, expressed in value form and calculated in any convenient way regulated by law (for example, one of these is the cash method), by which you can reduce income before tax.  However, there are a number of operations that do not have the right to be accepted for accounting for gross results. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cash method of recognition of income and expenses" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26834/854861.jpg" width="600"></div>

It should be understood that such can be even if the company has no profit.  Therefore, according to the decree of the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation, they should not be distributed relative to the revenue part (since they do not always fall on it), but in accordance with their own classification. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="accrual method and cash basis" class="if" height="408" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26834/854860.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The former include production and sales, material (or, as they are also called, raw), labor (wages of employees), depreciation and others. </p><p>  Costs that are not taxable are also called standardized.  Their list is regulated by Art.  270 of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation.  Among them may be shortages, <span>hospitality expenses,</span> as well as compensation for personal expenses of employees that were carried out in the process of business trips. </p><h2>  Cash method: definition and features of use </h2><p>  Finally, we got to the methods of calculating income and expenses for the reporting period.  First you need to understand that such a procedure covers only those operations that are legally subject to accounting.  The cash method of recognition of income and expenses is based on the arithmetic average, which is calculated for the entire period in aggregate and takes the value of <span>net profit</span> for its constant <span>.</span>  The latter, as stated in the explanations of the fiscal service, should be less than 1 million rubles per month. </p><p>  And this means that half a year should have a maximum of income - 6 million rubles.  How this amount will be distributed remains at the discretion of the business entity.  Therefore, it will be completely legal if the entrepreneur in the first three months does not receive any profit, and in the subsequent months it will amount to 2 million for each reporting period. </p><h2>  Cash Exceptions </h2><p>  The cash method has a lot of disadvantages.  For starters, as you have already noticed, it has limitations on the amount, which means that large business entities with an average revenue of more than 1 million rubles simply cannot apply it legally.  There is a list of institutions that are deprived of this method of recording the results of operations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cash cost accounting method" class="if" height="306" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26834/854858.jpg" width="570"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  So, according to the Tax Code, the cash method of recognition of income and expenses is excluded in its use for the following business representatives: </p><ul><li>  financial institutions engaged in banking; </li><li>  those business entities that take part in the aggregate management of the farm in accordance with an agreement on trust management of assets or on a <span>simple partnership.</span> </li></ul><h2>  Cash accounting </h2><p>  If the business entity has chosen this method of reflection in the financial results of its own revenue, then it is obliged to reflect this in the current accounting policy of the enterprise and in the future follow it.  The cash method of recognition of income and expenses in the income part has a number of features fixed by the current legislation, therefore, their observance is mandatory for any forms of business that are allowed to use this accounting option according to the Tax Code of the Russian Federation: </p><ul><li>  the recognition date of receipt is considered the day on which the funds were credited to the account of the business entity in a bank; </li><li>  the condition above also applies to any work and services for the benefit of business that are considered non-property; </li><li>  if the company provided loans to someone, then on the day of their repayment, income is also fully reflected. </li></ul><p>  In other words, the cash basis method can be based on actual operations.  Otherwise, proceeds in favor of a business entity are not recognized. </p><h2>  Cash costs </h2><p>  As you already understood, with such an accounting policy, expenses will be taken into account only if there was a documented fact of their implementation.  In the case of the costly part of the balance sheet, the cash method of recognition of income and expenses accepts the fact of direct payment and nothing more as confirmation.  The latter also speaks of the termination of mutual obligations between counterparties in accordance with the standards specified in the Tax Code of the Russian Federation. </p>

    <p>  And this means that the cash method of cost accounting excludes the inclusion in the cost part of those payments that are considered advance payments for services and goods, but have not yet been made.  In this case, the transaction flows will be included in the <span>financial result</span> on the day the goods are shipped or services are provided under the contract. </p><h2>  Accrual Income </h2><p>  If the cash method of income and expenses recognizes transactions only when they have actually been completed, then the accrual method, on the contrary, is required to reflect obligations in the financial results on the day they arise, regardless of the actual implementation of the terms of the transaction. </p><p>  According to the general rule for recording revenue from sales, the transaction will be shown as an operating result on the day of signing the act on the provision of work and the provision of goods. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cash accounting method" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26834/854856.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  However, there is also a special rule regarding those complex arrangements, the result of which cannot be reflected in one reporting period.  In this case, income is reflected evenly with respect to each fixed period of time, and this is regulated by the accounting policy of the enterprise. </p><h2>  Accrual expense </h2><p>  If the cash method of accounting requires actual confirmation of the costs incurred, then with the accrual methodology regarding costs, things are somewhat different.  The principles of the latter include the following: </p><ul><li>  costs are recorded in the period to which they relate documented, regardless of the date of the actual transaction; </li><li>  if the terms of the contract indicate the timing of the fulfillment of obligations, they fall into the financial result, otherwise the taxpayer can determine them at his discretion; </li><li>  the principles referred to in the paragraph above also apply to those forms of contracts that specify only the payment framework, but do not say anything about the shipment of goods and the provision of services; </li><li>  if expenses cannot be classified and attributed to any cost center, then their total amount is distributed evenly with respect to the entire revenue side. </li></ul>
