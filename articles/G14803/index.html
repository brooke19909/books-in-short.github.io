    <h2>  What is PortAventura </h2><p>  The first recreational facilities of the park were erected back in 1995.  The creation of the project and its implementation took place with the participation of three fairly large companies: two British and one American.  Since 2005, the entire structure has completely passed into the possession of one of the largest Spanish banking corporations, which it owns today. </p><p>  The development of the complex did not stand still.  The original <span>theme park</span> has expanded.  Now he represents the six worlds: </p><ul><li>  The Mediterranean. </li><li>  Polynesia. </li><li>  China. </li><li>  Mexico. </li><li>  Sesame Children's Street. </li><li>  Wild West. </li></ul><p>  The complex now includes 5 hotels, many restaurants and small cafes, including those in which you can quickly replenish the strength of fast food.  In addition, the entertainment complex has now added: </p><ul><li>  PortAventura Caribe Water Park </li><li>  Ferrari Land Park. </li></ul><p>  Actively accepting those who wish, and that part of the complex, where golf courses are broken.  Today, the park occupies more than a hundred hectares.  On its territory there are four dozen attractions.  During the day, almost a hundred diverse performances are held at park sites. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Ferrari Park in Spain: incredible adventures for the whole family </h2><p>  This part of the complex occupies about 0.07 square meters.  km  All rides are designed to pump visitors with adrenaline and drive.  Pavilions and facilities are made in the color of Rosso Corsa.  This is the same shade that is branded for <span>the Ferrari car,</span> after which the Ferrari Land park is named. </p><p>  The central structure was the Accelerator slide, which reached 112 meters.  She is the highest in not only the park, but throughout Europe.  The accelerator is located almost vertically.  The cars moving in the form of a sports model of the legendary F1 car move in design. </p><p>  The creators guarantee that the visitors on this hill get the same sensations as the Formula 1 pilots.  Having flown up to its top, the analogue of the car drops almost at a 90-degree angle down.  The length of the path is almost 900 meters.  It will take no more than three minutes.  At the same time, speeds of up to 180 km / h are achieved, and all this is completely safe. </p><p>  The second attraction in the newly opened Ferrari Park in Spain is a couple of towers.  Their height is 55 meters.  The mechanism imitates the operation of pistons in a car engine and provides a free fall from a height in a specially equipped lift.  Such an entertainment will undoubtedly attract everyone who wants to get a new dose of adrenaline. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  How to get to the park from Barcelona </h2><p>  The easiest option is to book a package offer consisting of a bus ticket and immediately to the theme park or to Ferrari Land.  At the same time, the latter will receive a 10 percent discount.  There are standard regular buses between Barcelona and Port Aventura, but on the whole the trip will be more expensive in this case. </p><p>  Connect two points and railway lines.  Moreover, a train ride is one of the most economical ways to get to the park.  Cash desks also sell a package, the price of which includes travel and attractions.  Better to buy them together.  After all, this way you can save a lot. </p>
