How to make a stupa, a broom and a hut?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Baba Yaga is one of the most striking fairy-tale characters of Russian folklore.  Many cartoons and films portray her differently.  This is an evil old woman who steals children and wants to eat them, but sometimes she shows pity for the hero, and in many films she is portrayed as funny and funny.  Perhaps that is why the kids still love her.  She wants to eat someone, threatens, but has not yet eaten anyone, has not killed.  She knows how to fly, but cannot catch anyone. </p><p>  Crafts of Baba Yaga are also all funny and not at all scary.  Children are happy to convey the image of this resident of the hut on chicken legs in their drawings, applications.  A <span>hooked nose</span> and a broom are molded from plasticine.  A mandatory attribute of this fabulous heroine is a flying stupa. </p><p>  Let's consider what crafts of Baba Yaga made of natural material can be done, what needs to be collected in the park, what additional materials will be needed to connect the parts together. </p><h2>  Figure of Baba Yaga </h2><p>  To make such a character, you need to have a fir cone, a small pine, Christmas tree branches, rowan berries for beads, a hemp rope for tying branches and making hair, twigs for a stupa. </p>

    <p>  The big shot is the torso.  To easily install the head, you need to cut off several upper scales from it.  A small pine cone, turned with a blunt part forward, is glued onto the plasticine in the resulting hollow so that it is more convenient to stick small details. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The body and head of the headstock are ready.  One branch of the Christmas tree is cleared of needles, which are attached to the neck on plasticine.  These will be the hands of a fairy-tale heroine.  Hair is knitted from a rope as follows.  Slices of the same length are cut, folded in half and connected by a knot from the side of the loops.  Then they are glued to a small bump on top.  The more segments, the more magnificent the old woman‚Äôs hair. </p><p>  From plasticine make eyes, mouth and hooked nose.  As a nose, you can use one curved pasta glued to the base. </p><p>  Now we‚Äôll take a closer look at how to make the main detail of Baba Yaga‚Äôs crafts - a flying stupa. </p><h2>  How to make a stupa? </h2><p>  In fairy tales, the grandmother moves through the forest exclusively on a stupa, controlling a broom.  The stupa has the shape of a truncated cone.  Therefore, in the manufacture of this transport using a plastic disposable cup.  First, the plasticine softens and the outer part is completely coated, so that the branches are firmly attached and do not slip on its surface. </p>

    <p>  They should not be thick, as the glass is deformed.  To stick well, you need to tie them with a thread.  It remains only to plant inside the crafts of Baba Yaga. </p><h2>  Broom </h2><p>  The transport of the fairy-tale character, which she also uses for flying, is a broom.  Making it from <span>natural material is</span> simple.  To do this, you need to have one thick twig and several small and thin, collected from the bushes.  They are cut into small equal segments, assembled in a bundle with a thick stick in the middle, tied with a rope. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  This attribute always finds its place in the crafts of Baba Yaga.  Usually a broom is either attached to an old woman‚Äôs hand or to a mortar.  She can still wear a scarf on her head, because before in Russia all women wore these hats.  In all films and fairy tales, she, too, is depicted precisely in a scarf. </p><h2>  A hut on chicken legs </h2><p>  If you ask any child <span>where Baba Yaga lives, the</span> answer will be the same for everyone - in the hut on chicken legs.  When making crafts by Baba Yaga, many craftsmen try to build her forest dwelling nearby.  This house is not easy, he himself is a fabulous character.  He can run, jump, turn, kick someone, sit down and refuse to obey his mistress. </p>

    <p>  Even a simple house made of branches is difficult to make, but here it still has to stand on two legs.  How to do this?  Let's try to explain in detail now. </p><h2>  How to make Baba Yaga's house? </h2><p>  In order for the structure to hold tightly on two pillars, you need to pick up either thick saw cuts of branches, or take two wooden spools of thread.  The second option is preferable, since they have a base that extends downward, which will securely hold the house. </p><p>  If you still use branch cuts, then you need to strengthen them with plasticine on the basis of the craft, making claws spread out in different directions.  They will give stability to the structure. </p><p>  The house itself is made from a flat foundation.  It can be plywood or a piece of very durable cardboard.  The ceiling above is the same.  Between these two planes even branches of any tree are glued.  You can fasten them with wire or tie a rope together. </p><p>  Also, for strength, the walls of the house sit on a layer of plasticine, which is attached around the entire perimeter of the house on the inside and on the floor of the house and on the ceiling. </p><p>  The roof can be made of cardboard by gluing a pyramid.  On top of it, put a layer of autumn yellow leaves on the glue.  Such a composition can be put up for the contest as an autumn crafts by Baba Yaga. </p><h2>  Variant of cones and nuts </h2><p>  Even a child of a kindergarten can easily make such an article by Baba Yaga from natural materials.  It will take one fir cone for the body, a walnut for the head, several branches for the broom and hands, plasticine, hair threads (they can be made from straw or willow leaves).  An old woman‚Äôs scarf can be cut out of paper, or cloth can be worn. </p>

    <p>  The parts are fastened together with the help of plasticine, from which small parts of the face are also made - nose, eyes.  Next to Baba Yaga, you can make her best friend the goblin at the exhibition.  It is also created from a cone of spruce by gluing a paper cone or plasticine hat of a mushroom mushroom on the head.  In his hand is a stick. </p><p>  You can still make a head from chestnut, and hands from the seeds of ash.  The stupa can be glued with small scales of cones or tree bark.  It‚Äôs interesting to cut a house out of pumpkins.  There are many options for using natural material for such crafts.  Looking at the samples, you can safely create your own work by adding your own details.  After all, you always want to do everything in your own way, not like the others.  Create and fantasize! </p>
