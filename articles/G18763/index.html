The mountains seem to approach the sea, the river valley and pebble beaches are a wonderful place.  Once, presumably in the 7th century, the Byzantines lived here, and it was from here that the trade route to the Caucasus began. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hosta vacation with children reviews" class="if" height="290" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12424/468682.jpg" width="304"></div>  In the 13-15 centuries.  Genoese trading post was located on the site of the future town.  To this day, the ruins of the Genoese fortress have been preserved.  In the 16th century, the Ottoman Empire ruled here.  In the 19th century, as a result of Russian-Turkish wars, Russia liberated these territories and began to populate and equip cities.  Hosta was founded in 1899.  The name of the city is translated from the Adyghe language as "clear water".  In the 20th century, the city developed rapidly, reviews about Khost as a resort town spread quickly.  The influx of residents was also due to immigrants from the depths of Russia.

    <h2>  Church of the Transfiguration </h2><p>  It is a unique architectural monument and deserves special attention.  The architecture of the pre-revolutionary church is characterized by a combination of classical and medieval traditions, there are examples of both traditional Russian architecture and Byzantine.

Reviews after the rest here tourists leave only positive.  Here you can visit the famous arboretum, see Japanese sakura and admire its flowering, walk along a palm alley, visit the English <span>landscape park.</span>  There is also a unique yew-boxwood grove, whose age reaches 25 million years.  This place, located on the banks of the river and on the slope of Mount Big Akhun, is like a miraculously preserved piece of fairy tale history.  About 400 unique species of trees grow here, cutting of which was prohibited in the 1930s.  In the far part of the grove, the ruins of an ancient fortress, namely fragments of parts of towers and walls, are preserved.  Also, history lovers should visit the <span>Vorontsov caves,</span> located 30 km higher on the mountain slope. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="host holiday reviews" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12424/468601.jpg" width="600"></div>  This is a unique monument of history and archeology.  Caves are a special world, more than 11 km long.  Mysterious labyrinths and passages will tell about antiquity, about how once there were sites of primitive people.  Rock paintings, sculptures, drawings - all this immerses in a special atmosphere of an unusual world.  At 8 km from the village is the picturesque canyon Navalishensky.  Here is an observation deck, which offers the best view of the <span>white cliffs,</span> extending down tens and hundreds of meters, and crystal clear waterfalls.  The gorge is about 2 km long and 150 m deep, so the route is quite long and difficult in places.  Trees and plants grow in the forest around, many species are listed in the Red Book.  Probably, it is here that one can fully experience the mystery of nature.  5 km from Hosta there is a wonderful picturesque canyon "Devil's Gate" - the narrowest place on the river, named after the devil himself does not crawl here (at the very beginning of the flood, when the water rises several meters and a narrow passage remains between the rocks )  Here the ancient forest of the preglacial period grows. <br><br>

    <h2>  Rest in Khost.  Reviews </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="host reviews" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12424/468605.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Here, tourists expect a quiet, comfortable, family leisure.  You can stay in a hotel, sanatorium, recreation center or in the private sector.  The most famous <span>hotels are Radisson-SAS-Lazurnaya, Sochi-Breeze Hotel,</span> and Pearl.  Several dozens of sanatoriums work here, each of which is unique in its own way.  Here they treat diseases of the musculoskeletal system and circulatory system.

Here the beaches are mostly pebble, but there are also sandy ones, they are prudently equipped with sun loungers, awnings, large umbrellas.  The road to the beach lies along the main street of the village, its name is Platanovaya.  There are many shops and cafes open for tourists.  It also takes you to the pedestrian suspension bridge over the Khosta River.

Tourists say that here all roads and local streets lead to the beach.  They also note that the beaches are rather narrow, but long, and stretch along the entire coast.  This is a feature of the geographical location of the village.  If you go beyond the cape called Vidny, you can find that the beaches here are more inaccessible, a sharp descent into the sea.  It is worth noting the free beaches from the sanatoriums with water activities, small and medium pebbles and a gentle beach.
