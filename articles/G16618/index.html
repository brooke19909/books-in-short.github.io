    <p>  In 1939, the section of the coastal territory that was located between the railway bridge and the Volodarsky route was expanded.  In 1957-1959 another site appeared, the end of which is located at the power plant.  Now his name is Right-Bank Thermal Power Plant.  These banks of the Neva gained their administrative division mainly during the thirties of the last century. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Until 1973, this territory was named after the Right Bank, and only then became the October Highway.  Such a turn is connected with the revolution.  It was emphasized as an event historically significant for the Soviet Union.  In those days, many streets of the city were renamed in honor of revolutionaries and incidents. </p><h2>  Left-hand side </h2><p>  The banks of the Neva are places where you can walk endlessly, especially if there is a guide rich in valuable information about local attractions.  On the left side is the Admiralty, near which there were three large areas, paved in such a way that together they formed a single composition.  Admiralty Square  - A place in which festivities were often held for people.  Alexander II laid a garden here and named it by his name. </p><p>  No less remarkable can be called the Promenade des Anglais, the total length of which is 1.3 kilometers.  The local architectural buildings are able to delight with its beauty. </p><p>  The left bank of the Neva is the place where you can admire the palace that belonged to Vladimir Alexandrovich, the Grand Duke, as well as the mansion of the baron Sugar factory Stieglitz.  Charms the classic English church.  The palace with the work of I.P. Martos, a beautiful high relief, known as "Apollo on Parnassus." </p>

    <h2>  The most interesting about the glorious city </h2><p>  And this is far from the most chic than the banks of the Neva can please their guests.  The front part can be seen by going to the Nikolaevsky Palace, on Labor Square.  The classical building with an eight-portico portico, which became the seat of the <span>College of Foreign Affairs, was</span> rebuilt by J. Quarenghi.  In these walls Tyutchev, Fonvizin and Griboedov, as well as Pushkin worked. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Another attraction adorning the city on the banks of the Neva is the wedding palace.  Also here is the Naryshkin house, which many people know about thanks to the wonderful and hospitable receptions that were held here in the past.  In addition, here you can see the palace owned by the Sheremetyevs.  There is also the Laval house, which was built in the period from 1805 to 1810.  The site on which it is located was previously owned by A. Menshikov, who lost the right to own it when he went to exile.  Managed to live here and Trubetskoy. </p>

    <h2>  Great review </h2><p>  The banks of the Neva are very clearly visible from Sq.  Senate because it has a rounded shape.  In the middle of it is a rider made of copper, which served as the first monument to the city.  It is as if he is looking at the waters of a river. </p><p>  Another attraction that deserves attention is the Palace Bridge, which began to be built in 1901.  The process of building such a large-scale project took 10 years.  They wanted to carry out <span>strength tests</span> in November 1913.  However, this process somewhat suspended the war. </p><p>  The opening took place in 1916.  Initially, there were railings made of wood, which were replaced by cast-iron cast material in 1939.  It was the symbolism of the Soviet Union in the form of stars with five ends, banners and emblems. </p><h2>  Masterpieces of Architecture </h2><p>  On Palace Square is the famous Zimny ‚Äã‚ÄãPalace, designed by B. Rastrelli in the Baroque style from 1754 to 1762.  In addition, on the banks of the Neva River you can see the Alexander Column, erected in 1834, the <span>Arc de Triomphe, the</span> crowning element of which is a figure depicting Glory riding a chariot. </p><p>  The building, which previously housed the Guards Corps, is also interesting.  This is the architectural work of the authorship of Bryulov, built in 1840.  Winter Palace somewhat encloses the territory of Palace Square from the river, but there is a considerable clearance through which you can see the bridge, the Rostral Columns and Strelka. </p>

    <h2>  Famous places of St. Petersburg </h2><p>  Many tourists dream of getting into the local Hermitage, where there are sculptures of Pomona and Flora.  The building was designed by J. Wallen-Delamot in the 1764-1767-ies.  An arch above the groove connects the building to the theater.  Here you can feel the spirit that the Renaissance possessed.  This place is mentioned in "The Queen of Spades" by Alexander Pushkin.  It was here that the last of the dates of Herman and Lisa took place. </p><p>  Nearby used to be a post office, so the local embankment was nicknamed Postal.  If you turn right towards the staircase, you can see the Atlanteans, still nearby - the building of the Maritime Archive, the barracks of the <span>Preobrazhensky regiment.</span>  This is a corner not only of extreme beauty, but also of great importance.  There were institutes of oriental studies, as well as archeology, built in the eclectic style by A. Stackenschneider. </p>

It was built from 1768 to 1785.  There are very beautiful sculptures by Shubin and Klodt‚Äôs frieze.  And this is not all pleasant discoveries that can impress a person who first got on the banks of the Neva River.  Locals, in turn, are very fond of walking here, enjoying the incredible beauty of their native and such a familiar city.
