  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Where to Buy a Refrigerated Table?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Successfully selected high-quality refrigeration equipment is practically the key to success both in food production and in the professional kitchen of a cafe or restaurant.  After all, food mainly deteriorates quickly and becomes unusable, respectively, without refrigeration units no work with them is possible. </p><p>  Nowadays, the choice of refrigeration equipment is huge, which can be simpler than choosing a company with this specialization, dialing the right number, getting advice, placing an order ... But there is one catch: you need to know exactly what you need, because you can be sold as unnecessary additional equipment, and equipment with those characteristics and properties that you do not need.  But why pay more, especially in the field of trade and professional food production?  Therefore, firstly, carefully study the market, do price monitoring, try to understand exactly what you need now, and even anticipate what you may need in the future, with the development of the business.  And only after all this make an order. </p><p>  Among the refrigeration equipment, a separate direction can be distinguished - walking and freezing tables. <noindex>  <span>Refrigerator table</span> </noindex>  may also have a subspecies - pizza table.  The use of these tables allows you to save space, since they work both as a surface and as <noindex>  <span>cold store</span> </noindex>  . </p><p>  Its cooling unit is a sealed system through which freon circulates.  Its composition is a capillary tube, an air cooler and the refrigeration unit itself. </p><p>  These tables can go with one or more doors, the doors themselves can be glass, backlit, and solid, can, if necessary, be equipped with drawers, steel tanks and shelves. </p><p>  The function of the freezer tables is also the storage of frozen foods and semi-finished products, but not for long.  Its main advantage is that it maintains a consistently low temperature of products (on average it is from minus twelve to minus eighteen degrees), and thanks to this, your refrigerator will not be overloaded. </p><p>  Choosing such a table, decide on several parameters: the number of partitions you need (to store products by type and grade), the volume of the chamber itself, the material from which it is made.  Expensive table models can work at very high temperatures, up to plus forty-three degrees.  But if you know for sure that your kitchen will not have such "climatic overloads", then feel free to choose a simpler and cheaper model. </p><p>  Here are the main recognized brands that manufacture refrigeration equipment for trade: Inox Electric, Hicold, Desmon, Fagor, Bolarus, Hicold.  Many companies in the CIS supply equipment to these companies.  The equipment lines of all these brands have their pluses and minuses, so you should not chase only the brand name, expensive materials and the "tricked out" model, just understand the features of your premises, your needs, and make the best choice. </p></div></article>
