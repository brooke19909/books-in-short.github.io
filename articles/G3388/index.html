    <h2></h2><h2>  Historical essay </h2><p>  Until the end of the XVI century, on the site where the city was built, there was a small settlement of Onegaborg.  Petrozavodsk was founded in 1703.  By order of Peter I, a cannon-foundry ironworks was built here, named after the Emperor Petrovsky.  It made ship equipment, shells, guns, cold steel and firearms.  Later, a settlement called Petrovskaya Sloboda was organized around the enterprise. </p><p>  When the Northern War was over, the plant was closed.  True, already during the war with the Ottoman Empire, the Alexander Cannon Plant was built in the region.  This enterprise was considered one of the best defense plants in the country.  In 1777, the village received the name Petrozavodsk, and already in 1784 it was proclaimed a provincial city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of petrozavodsk and surroundings" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/348982.jpg?1394205289605" width="600"></div>

In the XX century.  from the city a railway was drawn north to Murmansk.  During World War II, Petrozavodsk was significantly affected by the Finnish occupation.  On the territory of the settlement, 7 concentration camps were organized, where they were imprisoned and a huge number of civilians were shot.  In 2007, the city was given the official name Petrozavodsk City District. </p><h2></h2><h2>  The main attractions of Petrozavodsk </h2><p>  The city is decorated with the ancient Lenin Square (XVIII century).  Before the revolution, it was called Round, and then - on October 25.  It received its current name only in 1960.  The ensemble is made in the style of early classicism and is considered the only preserved architectural monument of the XVIII century in the city.  In honor of the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the Aleksandrovsky Plant, it was decided to erect a <span>monument to Peter I</span> on the square <span>.</span> Later, the monument was moved to the city embankment, and in its old place from 1933 a granite monument to Lenin flaunts. </p><p>  What to see in Petrozavodsk on the Round Square yet?  Various administrative buildings rise near it: the governor's residence, former government offices and two outbuildings. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="petrozavodsk attractions" class="if" height="427" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13346/349884.jpg?1394347600263" width="600"></div>

Its expositions tell about the history and nature of the region, as well as about the culture of the multinational people of Karelia - Karelians, Russians and Vepsians.  Here you can see unique archaeological finds: rock petroglyphs that give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe spiritual culture of primitive people, as well as various objects on the fauna and flora of this region.  The museum presents the interior of one of the main halls of the governor's house of the mid-19th century. </p><p>  The most interesting in the museum is the archaeological and geological collections, as well as the exposition of products from <span>Karelian birch,</span> printed and manuscript books of the 16th-19th centuries, folk costumes and hats of the 10th-20th centuries.  The institution also stores ancient spinning wheels from Zaonezhye, Pudozhja, Pomerania, young and middle Karelia.  There are also military products and art castings of the Aleksandrovsky factory, photographs of the 19th-20th centuries, portraits of merchants and governors of the <span>Olonets province,</span> household items, shoes and clothes of Finnish concentration camp prisoners, a collection of weapons, various folklore elements, etc. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Governor's Park </h2><p>  Not far from Lenin Square you can see other attractions of Petrozavodsk.  Governor's Park is very popular.  Near its entrance there is a collection of objects that are related to the mining business in Karelia, and products that were produced at the Alexander factory.  In the central part of the park stands a monument to Gavril Derzhavin.  It should be noted that this famous poet was the first Olonets governor.  The height of the sculpture is 4.5 meters, and the latter is installed on a pedestal made of granite. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2></h2><h2>  Kirov Square </h2><p>  Kirov Square is another amazing <span>architectural monument</span> that adorns Petrozavodsk.  The sights of the city directly testify to the difficult history of this region.  Before the revolution, this square was called Cathedral Square, because several cathedrals stood around it.  Later, they were all destroyed by the Soviet government, and a monument to Kirov was erected on the square itself, in connection with which it received its modern name. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="museums of petrozavodsk" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/348985.jpg?1394206107353" width="550"></div>

    <h2></h2><h2>  Art Museum </h2><p>  In the northern part of the square are the buildings of the former male and female gymnasium, not far from them - the City Administration House.  The building of the male gymnasium currently houses the Republican Museum of Fine Arts.  This institution was opened in 1960 in order to preserve the artistic heritage of Karelia.  The collection consists of exhibits from the local history museum, as well as various donated works of art from the Tretyakov Gallery, the Russian Museum, and the State Hermitage Museum.  Today, folk art objects, many works of Karelian masters, samples of Western European <span>art, ancient Russian</span> painting, collections of icon paintings and works of Russian masters of the 18th-19th centuries are exhibited here. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Kizhi Museum </h2><p>  In the southern part of the square there is a two-story building where the mining factory was located.  Today it is occupied by the exhibition hall of the Kizhi Museum.  By the way, its branches, which are called visit centers, are literally dotted with the whole of Petrozavodsk (a photo of the sights is presented below). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Petrozavodsk photo sights" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/348973.jpg?1394206144588" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Between the visit centers are the main sightseeing routes of the city.  Every day, the exhibition areas of the museum-reserve on the island of Kizhi, which is located on Lake Onega, are visited by many tourists.  According to legend, all the buildings built here were made with an ax, without using any other tools.  Culture Square and the National Theater are also located on Kirov Square. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Old quarter </h2><p>  Studying the unique sights of Petrozavodsk, you should look into the old quarter.  Walk along the streets of Kuybyshev, Malaya Slobodskaya, Neglinka and Fedosova.  The first buildings erected during the development of the city (XIX century) have been preserved here.  True, only Lazorev‚Äôs house, Kuchersky‚Äôs house, the building of the provincial hospital with a chapel and a blacksmith's workshop have survived in their original form. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Religious monuments <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to go in petrozavodsk" class="if" height="278" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/348975.jpg?1394205899727" width="250"></div></h2><p>  In the Zarechny district of the city is the temple of Alexander Nevsky.  This building was erected in 1832 near the Alexander Plant.  During the years of Soviet rule, it did not function and was opened only in 1993.  At that time, large-scale work began to restore the appearance of the temple, and in 2002 it was consecrated again.  The building is made in the spirit of late classicism.  Near the temple is a belfry with 8 bells. </p><p>  Where else to go to Petrozavodsk to see religious shrines?  In addition to the Alexander Cathedral in the capital of Karelia, the Cross Exaltation Cathedral of 1852 and the Catherine Church of 1878 have been preserved. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Onega Embankment </h2><p>  Locals and tourists are very fond of walking along the Onega embankment.  It consists of two lines.  The first was built in 1994.  Along it, various original sculptures were installed, which were presented to the city by foreign twin cities.  For example, the Germans presented the sculptural composition ‚ÄúTyubinsky panel‚Äù, the Americans - the steel structure ‚ÄúFishermen‚Äù, the Finns - the sculpture ‚ÄúWave of Love‚Äù, and the Swedes - the composition ‚ÄúWish Tree‚Äù.  In a small square on the embankment there is a monument to Peter I. The second line runs along the quarter of the historical buildings of the city. </p>
