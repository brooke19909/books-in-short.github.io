    <h2>  Washing in LG E1296ND3 </h2><p>  Before loading the laundry into the washing machine, it is necessary to sort it.  For more specific information about this process, you need to read the section in the instructions that come with the kit.  Then you should put things in the laundry compartment and close it.  After that, you need to open the powder box and put detergent there.  Now you need to turn on <span>the LG E1296ND3 washing machine.</span>  After that, a specific washing mode is selected, and then additional options are set depending on what type of laundry was loaded (optional).  Now you should start the process itself by pressing the start button. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Before carrying out the first wash after purchase, you must start the trial process without laundry.

This action is necessary in order to get rid of the water that could remain after testing the machine at the factory. </p><h2>  Model LG E1296ND3: reviews </h2><p>  Many note the really quiet operation of the washing machine, which is a huge advantage.  After all, there are many devices that are very noisy and heard even by their neighbors.  This problem is especially acute in prefabricated houses.  Another advantage is the sound signal that the device emits after the wash.  Housewives note a pleasant appearance, its diversity in washing modes, and a long service life.  People like the fact that the price really matches the quality of the machine.  Few people are dissatisfied with their purchase. </p><p>  Among the shortcomings that consumers most often talk about, you need to talk about an inconvenient powder box.  It is difficult for many to fill in the powder and fill in the rinse aid.  <span>The characteristics of the LG E1296ND3,</span> announced by the manufacturer, are fully consistent with reality, therefore, there are no complaints in this matter. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lg e1296nd3 specifications" class="if" height="426" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1284823.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Buying a washing machine </h2><p>  It is best to order the device in the online store.  This is due to the fact that most often there it is much cheaper than if you take it at a specialized point of sale.  However, choosing the Internet as a place of purchase, some guarantees should be provided, and also not ordered on suspicious sites.  It‚Äôs best to choose time-tested resources and consumers.  You should not use the services of stores that offer to make full payment immediately after placing an order.  Firstly, there is no guarantee that the device will come in whole (if at all), and secondly, it is unlikely that the money will be returned after some kind of error.  It‚Äôs better to look for a sales outlet longer than to regret your stupidity.  Have a good shopping! </p>
