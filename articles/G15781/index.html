Headphones and their characteristics</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The company, whose products will be discussed in the article, was founded in 1927.  Now the Japanese manufacturer occupies a fairly stable place in the sales market.  He was able to achieve this level by creating high-quality devices.  Earphones with a wooden diaphragm appeared on the roar not so long ago - in 2008.  However, they quickly became popular and in good demand. </p><p>  The article describes the most famous models, as well as those that consumers called the best. </p><h2>  Five best models </h2><p>  Everyone should understand that the JVC company, whose headphones will be described in the article, constantly competes with other manufacturers.  The latter are much longer in the market and have maximum fame. </p><p>  Due to this, the Japanese brand is trying not to overestimate prices in order to attract more consumers.  It should be noted that the ratio of cost and quality is pretty good.  The ranking will feature budget models that have received excellent reviews from customers. </p><ul><li>  Headphones JVC FX1X from the HA series. </li><li>  JVC HA-G101. </li><li>  JVC HA-S44X. </li><li>  JVC HA-FX32. </li><li>  JVC HA-FX101. </li></ul><h2>  JVC HA-G101 </h2><p>  Headphones JVC HA-G101 are widespread due to the optimal cost.  However, it must be said right away that the only plus they have is maximum operational comfort.  They sit comfortably, soft to the touch and light weight.  This model will be most suitable if you use it for a computer or TV.  This is due to the fact that the accessory has a design that completely covers the entire auricle.  The bass is audible, although it is impossible to say that playback is at the best level.  As a regular budget option, this model from JVC will be quite adequate.  Headphones fully justify their cost. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Of the positive aspects, consumers note the price, ease of use.  Although the materials used do not inspire solid trust, they weigh very little.  There is minimalism in the design.  Making extra attention does not attract. </p><p>  Of the negative sides, a short operational period should be noted.  Music lovers should not take these headphones, as disappointment may follow.  There is no special playback volume control on the wire, which some users report as an inconvenience. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="jvc headphones" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1675278.jpg" width="284"></div>
