  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A trip from Yekaterinburg to Omsk in different ways</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The distance from Yekaterinburg to Omsk is about 950 kilometers.  Since both cities are located on the Trans-Siberian Railway, it is best to travel from one to the other by train.  However, other options are also worth considering. </p><h2>  Rail ride </h2><p>  The most convenient way to organize a trip.  By train, the distance from Yekaterinburg to Omsk can be traveled on average in 12 hours.  Both cities are connected by the Trans-Siberian Railway, so trains run between them around the clock.  If the trip is planned at night, it is best to leave at 18:42 by train number 82. He will arrive in Omsk the next day at 08:56. </p><p>  Some formulations are branded.  They are distinguished by high ticket prices, for example, Yenisei, Russia and Tomich.  Not all trains are formed by Russian Railways, there are also compounds of the formation of neighboring countries: </p><ul><li>  No. 43. Follows to Beijing, formed by the Chinese railways, runs once a week. </li><li>  ‚Ññ 6. The composition of the Mongolian formation to Ulaanbaatar, goes once a week or even two. </li><li>  No. 104 and No. 64. These trains are formed in Belarus, they run more often, prices are the lowest, and wagons can be very decent.  For example, a reserved seat with many sockets in almost every place. </li></ul><p>  There are no sitting cars, the prices for reserved seats start from 1,000 rubles, on a coupe - from 1,800. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="New station of Yekaterinburg" class="if uuid-3135369" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117615/3135369.jpg"></div><h2>  Features of the bus ride </h2><p>  There are no direct buses from Yekaterinburg to Omsk, so you need to use a flight to the regional center of Pavlodar in the north-east of Kazakhstan.  It leaves from the Northern bus station, which is located next to the railway station and the Uralskaya metro station.  But he walks infrequently.  There can be only one flight per week. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A ticket costs about 2,600 rubles.  The bus leaves at 23:00 and arrives in Pavlodar after 32 hours. </p><p>  In Pavlodar, you need to take a bus to Omsk.  It can be a passing flight from Semey, which leaves at 00:30 and arrives in Omsk at 08:30.  Or maybe local.  He has such an exit schedule: </p><ul><li>  08:00; </li><li>  12:00; </li><li>  20:45; </li><li>  22:45. </li></ul><p>  The road will take about 8 hours.  The brands of buses are Volvo or Haiger. </p><p>  It should be noted that during such a trip you need to cross the border with Kazakhstan twice.  This takes some time due to border controls.  But it is not necessary to have a passport, it is enough Russian. </p><p>  A ticket from Pavlodar to Omsk costs about 4,800 tenge (about 900 rubles). </p><p>  Even a short transplant in Pavlodar makes it possible to get to know this city a little.  It has the following attractions: </p><ul><li>  Museum of Local History.  Located on Lenin Street.  The exposition is somewhat commonplace.  Perhaps the most interesting are archaeological and ethnographic collections. </li><li>  The house museum of the local historian and photographer Bagaev. </li><li>  Museum of Song Creativity. </li><li>  Regional Art Museum. </li><li>  Museum of Art and Literature. </li><li>  City mosque and cathedral. </li><li>  House of Friendship of the peoples of the region. </li><li>  Various monuments, both typical Soviet and modern Kazakh (to the singer Mayra and to various batyrs). </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="pixabay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Evening Omsk" class="if uuid-3135372" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117615/3135372.jpg"></div><h2>  By car and airplane </h2><p>  From Yekaterinburg to Omsk flights are operated by the Nordstar airline.  The plane leaves Koltsovo Airport at 13:40 and flies to Omsk for two hours.  But due to the time difference of one hour, he lands at 16:35.  He does not fly every day.  The exact schedule of flights depends on the time of year.  A one-way ticket costs about 3,000 rubles. </p><p>  By car from Yekaterinburg to Omsk really get in 12-13 hours.  It is best to go along the E-22 highway to Tyumen, go around this regional center from the south side and then follow the same road to Ishim, where you turn onto the E-30 highway.  She will lead to Omsk.  On the way there will be small regional centers, for example, Tyukalinsk.  Also along the route there will be not only cafes, shops and places to sleep, but also various sights.  For example, in Borovsky (just beyond Tyumen) there is a children's railway, which operates in the summer, and Lake St. Andrew with beaches and an archaeological museum. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pixabay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Omsk center, ancient buildings" class="if uuid-3135371" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117615/3135371.jpg"></div><h2>  What to visit in Omsk? </h2><p>  Omsk differs from Yekaterinburg in fewer attractions.  For example, the city has no children's railway, less diverse architecture.  It is generally poorer; museums are simpler.  It is worth visiting the typical art and local history, theater and literature, as well as a complex of military glory.  If it seems a little to get acquainted with Yekaterinburg and the environs of the week, then there are enough days off for Omsk. </p>
