To date, Crete has become one of the most popular destinations for many Russian citizens.  Which is not surprising, since this largest island of Greece, most of our compatriots in their reviews calls this paradise. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nicolas Villas 3 Crete reviews" class="if" height="438" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1408264.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Crete itself is small, but it has several indisputable advantages: amazing nature, incredible hospitality of local residents and a huge number of attractions (many of us know about some from books on mythology).  For example, it is here that the highest mountain on the island is located, where, according to legend, Zeus was born, the cave in which he grew up, the famous Knossos palace, etc. </p><p>  Crete has a very developed tourism infrastructure.  Almost the entire coast is built up with hotels.  Along with olive oil, which is produced in almost every rural economy, tourism is the second no less important source of income for the islanders. </p><p>  The choice of a hotel where you can stay depends primarily on the capabilities of the guests, as well as on their personal preferences.  I must say that many Russians choose three-star hotels.  For those traveling with young children, the issue of transfer duration is especially relevant.  And in this case, the three-star Nicolas Villas hotel is perfect for them, which is only seventeen kilometers from the international airport located in the capital of Crete, Heraklion. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  general information </h2><p>  The island itself is small.  Here lives a little more than six hundred thousand people.  But in the high season, the population of Crete at the expense of tourists almost always exceeds one million.  People come here to rest from all over Europe.  Some prefer to stay in fashionable "fives" located in large cities, such as Rethymnon, Chania, Heraklion, but there are also those who choose three-star hotels built in small towns, for example Nicolas Villas 3 *. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nicolas Villas 3 Greece" class="if" height="171" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1408252.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  <span>Crete, reviews</span> of which most Russians leave only positive, has gained incredible popularity over the past few years.  Small hotels like Nicholas Villas are completely crowded during the high season.  I must say that the <span>holiday</span> season <span>in Crete</span> ends quite quickly: from the end of September the flow of tourists has stopped.  The fact is that strong winds begin on the island at this time, and therefore it is almost impossible to swim in the sea. </p><p>  Hotel Nicolas Villas 3 * (Greece, Crete) is located in a small village called Agia Pelagia.  Tourists who come here, the first thing they see in the window of the bus carrying out the transfer is stunning panoramic views of the narrow serpentine road with steep cliffs and the turquoise-blue expanse of the sea. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  "Nicholas Villas", judging by the reviews, is more suitable for those people who, on vacation, prefer a combination of comfort and peace.  The distance to the airport is twenty-three kilometers, the transfer lasts a maximum of thirty minutes. </p><h2>  Territory and location </h2><p>  Nicolas Villas 3 * (Crete), reviews of accommodation in which many Russians rate four with a plus, is built on the second line from the sea.  He has a small but fully thought-out landscaped area.  Those who buy vouchers for June should be aware that at this time the hotel is almost empty.  The main flow of tourists goes here in early July. </p><p>  This hotel is absolutely not suitable for those who are looking for noisy companies and active entertainment.  On its territory is always quiet and calm, you can not hear music and animation.  Nicolas Villas 3 * (Greece) - it‚Äôs clean air, comfortable rooms, beautiful views from small balconies: mountains and hills, planted with olive groves, rare houses and, of course, the sea.  All of this will be glad for those who are going on vacation in order to restore spiritual strength, to plunge into the atmosphere of calm and beauty, which Greece is so famous for. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nicolas Villas 3 Greece about Crete" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1408248.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Hotel "Nicholas Villas" has a rather good location.  It is convenient to go on excursions from here.  Fifty meters from the hotel there is a bus stop, from which every half an hour there are departing basses in the direction of Heraklion, Chania and Rethymnon - the largest cities on the island, where you can not only see local attractions, but also have great shopping. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Many tourists in their reviews leave positive reviews for the services that <span>Nicolas Villa (Agia Pelagia, 3 *)</span> offers <span>.</span>  Crete, which has many three-star hotels, is somewhat different from many European resorts.  The local atmosphere reigns in the local hotels; guests can express their comments directly to the owners, who are almost always at the registration desk. </p><p>  The infrastructure of this hotel and hotel services are fully consistent with the declared category.  On the territory there is a small free parking lot, which does not need to be reserved in advance, there is also an Internet corner, a large hall in which comfortable furniture is installed. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  The reception is open around the clock.  Here you can book some excursions around the island, rent a car and explore local attractions on your own.

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The nearest swimming area is a fifteen minute walk.  This beach is municipal, and therefore there are always a lot of people on it.  Sun beds and umbrellas are paid here: they cost two euros.  This beach, called Psaromura, is sandy, only at the entrance to the water there is a little pebble.  Adults may well dispense with special slippers. </p><p>  Every day three times a small minibus leaves the hotel, which takes people to the beach or to the city, and then takes it back.  The bus schedule is given to guests upon check-in at the reception. </p><p>  At a distance of a kilometer from the hotel there is another beach - "Mononavtis", however it is completely pebble, and therefore is not very popular among tourists. </p><h2>  For children </h2><p>  For those who are going to relax with the whole family, Nicolas Villas 3 * is perfect.  Greece, about.  Crete in particular, in its climate, is great for young children.  And if you take into account the advantage of this hotel, which consists in a short transfer, it becomes clear why many parents choose Nicholas Villas. </p><p>  The infrastructure of this hotel for children includes a children's outdoor, not fenced area with grass.  Here children can swing on a swing, ride a slide.  On the territory there is a shallow pool in which the children splash with great pleasure and joy to parents. </p><p>  Upon request, guests can get a playpen in the room.

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Those who choose this particular three-star hotel for relaxation should clearly understand what entertainment and other services they can get in Nicolas Villas 3 *.  Greece, about.  Crete in particular is a country in which there is much that is worth a look.  Therefore, many Russians in their reviews note that they were in the hotel very little time: their main pastime was swimming, as well as visiting local attractions. </p><p>  To go on an excursion, some rented a car.  Crete is an island where it is difficult to see traffic police, however, for speeding or parking, tourists can receive a pretty decent fine, the existence of which they can find out when crossing the border to return home.  Therefore, those who are going to drive a rental car in this country should be extremely careful when driving. </p><p>  The second option is to buy sightseeing tours from your operator or at the hotel.  It is somewhat more expensive, but more reliable.  Many attractions are within a few hours drive from Nicolas Villas 3 * (Greece, Crete). </p><p>  Heraklion, Chania and Rethymnon must be visited to see the Venetian Loggia, the Cathedral of St.  Titus, the old fortress, port and, of course, wander along their narrow cobbled streets. </p><h2>  Additional Information </h2><p>  Entertainment that is offered directly on site is not so much.  Those who wish can rent equipment and tables for billiards, play table tennis for free.  The hotel has a small outdoor freshwater pool where you can do aqua aerobics in the morning under the supervision of an instructor. </p><p>  A wide range of water entertainment programs is offered on the beach.  All of them are paid.  Here you can rent a fishing boat and all the necessary equipment, swim with a scuba gear and a mask, which you can also rent, do parasailing, ride a banana, etc. I must say that this is not the whole list of what guests can do, staying at Nicolas Villas 3 * (Crete). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nicolas Villas 3 Greece about Crete Heraklion" class="if" height="171" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1408247.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  To say that the Russians like to relax on this largest Greek island is to say nothing.  Not a single review can do without enthusiastic impressions about the nature of Crete, about amazing sights and about the hospitality and friendliness of local residents. </p><p>  As for the Nicholas Villas hotel, many liked it, especially against the background of a successful combination of price and level of services provided.  Regarding the numbers, no one expresses particular discontent.  There are, of course, reviews in which guests negatively regard the separate fee for using the safe and TV, but those who spent little time at the hotel did not bother. </p><p>  The buffet restaurant offers quite tasty food.  And this is confirmed by many tourists staying at Nicolas Villas 3 *.  Crete, whose reviews about the cuisine is only positive, is famous for its olive oil, of which there are many in the dishes offered at the hotel.  Apparently, it is with this that their excellent taste is connected.  There is no dissatisfaction with the local drinks served at the bar.  According to many, both beer, and crayfish, and whiskey tasted quite normal. </p><p>  Tourists express some discontent about the remoteness of the beach, but this problem was solved at the hotel with the help of a minibus plying between Nicolas Villas and the bathing area.  The sea ... It is amazing in Crete: clear water, such a beautiful <span>azure color that</span> is difficult to describe, in a word, complete delight in all reviews.  Of course, the pebble cover of one beach and the small strip at the entrance to the water on the other are somewhat uncomfortable, but those who brought in or bought special shoes on the spot closed this problem once and for all. </p><p>  Many thanks to many Russians are expressed to staff who work in good faith and instantly solve all problems.  Of course, communication with the administration seemed somewhat uncomfortable to those who did not know Greek or English, since the workers at the registration desk did not speak Russian.  However, this problem can be solved by asking someone to translate the request or question. </p><p>  Hotel "Nicholas Villas" is perfect for relaxing with young children, as well as for those who prefer a quiet stay, without noisy discos and parties.  Therefore, young people rarely come here, and those who still choose this hotel go to have fun in the center of the village of Agia Pelagia, where there are not only many taverns, but also places where you can have a great evening. </p><p>  Summing up the reviews, we can say that the vast majority of Russians who had a rest in this hotel were satisfied, moreover, some hope to return here again. </p>
