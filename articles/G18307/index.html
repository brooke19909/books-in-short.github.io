    <h2>  Diamond embroidery with rhinestones </h2><p>  If you have ever worked with beads or sequins, creating patterns and whole pictures from small elements, then you have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow laborious and painstaking work it is - to sew each part to the base in accordance with the scheme.  Diamond embroidery with rhinestones is similar, but the process of creating a <span>mosaic picture</span> in this way is simpler.  You do not need a needle and thread, since the painting is made by applying parts to a fabric base with an adhesive layer applied. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rhinestone embroidery sets" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/1173432.jpg" width="561"></div>  Work, of course, will require a lot of time and patience, but the result you will get much faster than in the case of embroidery with beads or sequins.  Convenience of work and a great impression of the finished panel, obtained as a result, made this type of needlework very popular among modern craftswomen.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Materials and Tools </h2><p>  Embroidery with rhinestones is a responsible and painstaking work that will require you to organize the process and the workplace well.  To do this, you will need the following: </p><ul><li>  Fabric basis. </li><li>  Pattern outline. </li><li>  Glue. </li><li>  Rhinestones matching the pattern of flowers. </li><li>  Tweezers. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="embroidery with rhinestones icons" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/1173437.jpg" width="541"></div></li><li>  Containers for sorting rhinestones. </li><li>  Elements of the design of the picture (frame, glass, mount for hanging). </li></ul><p>  And also necessary - a flat free surface for work and good lighting. </p><h2>  Embroidery kits </h2><p>  One of the most interesting types of needlework, allowing you to create real mosaic masterpieces, is embroidery with rhinestones.  Sets that have everything you need for work greatly facilitate and speed up the process of creating a picture.  The range of such sets is very wide, however, their cost is quite high: from several hundred rubles to thousands. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="diamond embroidery rhinestones" class="if" height="459" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/1173439.jpg" width="600"></div>  The price is determined by the size of the product received (it is usually indicated on the packaging and in the product description), as well as the type of strass themselves.  Naturally, Swarovski crystals are more expensive than plastic parts.  The sets always indicate what is included in the kit, as well as how much the canvas is filled with elements of the pattern (partial calculation or one hundred percent, that is, the entire field of the picture).  Thus, working with sets is, of course, more convenient, especially for the first experiment.

Choose the best option for the price, size of the canvas, the number of colors, the quality of the crystals and the complexity of the work. </li><li>  When the desired purchase is in your hands, prepare the workplace.  It should be free and bright. </li><li>  Unpack the box and place the contents on the table.  Analyze the kit.  If the kit does not have a container for rhinestones, find at home suitable objects (lids, jars). <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="embroidery with rhinestones paintings" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/1173436.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ol><h2>  Embroidery: Step by Step </h2><ol><li>  Take a look at the pattern template.  It‚Äôs more convenient to start from the upper left corner if you are working with your right hand (for the left-hander - vice versa), so prepare bags with those rhinestones that are located in the corresponding zone. <br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rhinestone embroidery sets" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/1173438.jpg" width="577"></div></li><li>  Put the rhinestones of the desired shades in the prepared container. </li><li>  Fold back the protective film from the part of the picture that you will begin to work with.  Do not remove the entire film at once, otherwise the adhesive layer will begin to dry out, and it is unlikely that it will be possible to lay out the entire mosaic at a time. </li><li>  Lay out part of the first row. </li><li>  Trim the elements with a ruler. </li><li>  Lay out as many details of the second row and align both rows vertically and the bottom horizontally. </li><li>  Do the work, laying out row after row. <br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="diamond embroidery rhinestones" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/1173433.jpg" width="368"></div></li><li>  When all embroidery is ready, cover it with the attached adhesive to fix it.  If no additional tube is included, use clear varnish. </li><li>  Place the picture in a frame under glass, or leaving a relief surface with crystals. </li></ol><p>  So, you saw in what sequence the embroidery with rhinestones is performed.  The paintings performed according to the ready-made scheme are easy to make, but laborious. </p><h2>  Custom embroidery </h2><p>  Embroidery with rhinestones icons and multicolor photorealistic paintings is very difficult.  And although the selection of blanks is now very large, you may run into the problem that you will not find a suitable plot or, having mastered several purchased plots, you want to make an exclusive picture.  The technology of embroidery itself is no different, the difference will be in preparation for work.  The sequence of actions is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Find the picture you like. </li><li>  Edit it in Adobe Photoshop or a specialized <span>program for creating embroidery schemes for an</span> image consisting of cells with a suitable number of color shades. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="embroidery with rhinestones paintings" class="if" height="290" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/1173435.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  Print the blank. </li><li>  Buy the necessary rhinestones and clear glue. </li><li>  Glue the color scheme to the glass horizontally. </li><li>  Put the fabric base on the glass, and put the light on under the glass. </li><li>  Work similarly to the previous method with the only difference being that you must first apply the adhesive layer to the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe fabric where you will lay out the pattern yourself. </li></ol><p>  So, you have learned how to make embroidery with rhinestones.  Choose your preferred method of implementation using a ready-made kit or with the development of your own individual version.  Get the necessary materials and tools.  Start creating your masterpiece. </p>
