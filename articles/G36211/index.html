If there are such, then their units.  In a mobile device, reliability is also appreciated.  Paying attention to the range that is presented in specialized stores, we can conclude that the highest quality gadgets are sold at a high price.  However, there is still an alternative - devices from the Middle Kingdom.  Currently, Chinese manufacturers have achieved high results.  Their gadgets not only have a nice appearance, but also have a low cost.  This is exactly how the <span>ZTE</span> Blade A510 mobile <span>phone is</span> .  This "state employee" has significant advantages, and which ones will be described in the article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone zte blade a510" class="if" height="414" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2003972.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Packaging and equipment </h2><p>  The first thing that meets the buyer is packaging.  It is framed in white.  There are no familiar phone images on it.  Instead, designers used a device diagram drawn with dashed lines.  Technical capabilities are presented in the form of notation.  On the front panel and side faces, you can see icons in the form of letters, bulbs, joysticks and others, which tell about what will be available to the user who will purchase this model. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Many buyers are no doubt wondering what exactly the ZTE Blade A510 comes with.  The instruction manual and other documentation are necessarily included in the package.  In addition to them, there is also a warranty card, which provides free after-sales service for one year.  Also, inside the box, the buyer will find a power adapter and a cable with a USB connector.  The latter is used not only to charge the device, but also to connect the gadget to other devices, for example, to a computer or laptop.  Also in the box, the buyer will see an additional plastic cover.  Unfortunately, the manufacturer does not provide a headset in the kit.  However, you can buy it at any store.  With the choice of a specific model of headphones, there will be no problems, since the phone is equipped with a standard audio port and works with a headset of any brand. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  The first thing a buyer sees when unpacking a package is a beautiful and elegant telephone.  The standard color of the case is dark blue.  Each user can easily give their device a little brightness, using the additional socket that comes with the kit. </p><p>  When designing the phone, designers used clear symmetry.  It is clearly visible if you pay attention to the location of the spoken speaker and microphone.  The corners of the case are slightly rounded, which makes the gadget soft.  The photo of the ZTE Blade A510, located below, 100% confirms this statement. </p><p>  The front panel is framed by a plastic frame.  Due to the fact that it is small, the device looks quite compact.  Of course, the main decoration of the front panel is the screen.  The manufacturer protected it with a special glass, which is coated with an oleophobic coating.  His advantage is obvious.  During operation, fingerprints practically do not accumulate on the screen.  Also, glass protects against the formation of chips, minor scratches and other damage. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At the bottom of the device, directly below the screen, a control panel is displayed.  There are three buttons on it.  In the center in the form of a circle the "Home" key is framed.  For the rest, the designation in the form of points is selected.  These keys perform the functions of ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù and ‚ÄúBack‚Äù.  At first, this may seem uncomfortable, but over time you quickly get used to this arrangement and designation.  Above the screen, in addition to the spoken speaker, there are also light sensors, proximity sensors, an event indicator and, of course, a ‚Äúwindow‚Äù of the front camera. </p><p>  At the top end, the manufacturer brought only a connector for audio devices.  At the bottom there was a place for the USB port, a small hole for the microphone and speaker.  As for the side faces, only the right one is functional.  On it, according to the standard scheme, there are volume and power keys. </p><p>  What is on the back cover of the phone?  Here, the manufacturer placed the LED flash and the main camera lens.  In the role of decoration used the logo, painted with silver paint.  In the same tint range, the strip is located, which is located in the lower part of the case. </p><p>  In order to install SIM-cards, you will need to remove the back cover.  Under it are two micro and nano format slots.  The connector for an external drive is also displayed here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone zte blade a510 reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2003973.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Ergonomics </h2><p>  According to most users, the cell phone ZTE Blade A510 leaves only a positive impression when using it.  Due to the fact that it weighs only 130 g, the hand does not get tired even with a long conversation.  Moreover, its body has such a shape that it is most convenient to interact with the gadget.  Many users claim that you can wear the device not only in a bag, but also in the pockets of a shirt, trousers, jacket and other clothes. </p><p>  It is especially necessary to highlight the thickness of the body.  It is only 8.2 mm.  This indicator can be considered the standard of modern mobile devices.  It is not so small that the phone is damaged in the event of an accidental fall, but also not so large, due to which the user will get tired after a long interaction. </p><p>  The build quality of the Chinese device exceeded all expectations.  All parts are fitted as accurately as possible.  There are no creaks and backlashes. </p><h2>  ZTE Blade A510 Phone: Display Features </h2><p>  The manufacturer in his offspring used a 5-inch matrix.  Its quality can compete with any other brands.  In the manufacture of the display used IPS technology.  Due to the fact that there is no air gap, the image displayed on the screen is highly detailed.  The most optimal for this diagonal size is a resolution of 1280x720 px.  This is exactly what is used in this model.  Image clarity also depends on pixel density.  Its rate is 320 ppi.  Even if you look at the picture in close proximity to the eyes, it is impossible to notice the "squares". </p><p>  The manufacturer did not forget about such an option as multi-touch.  This model supports up to 10 simultaneous touches.  The sensor is highly sensitive.  An instant reaction follows even after light touches.  It was previously noted that the manufacturer used <span>an oleophobic coating.</span>  It significantly reduced the brightness level of the screen, but this does not mean at all that fingerprints do not remain on the glass at all.  But you should not worry, as they are easily erased by any soft cloth.  The developers did not use a special film, explaining it this way: the properties of the glass are so high that the screen is protected without it too. </p><p>  The display in this model is characterized by excellent color reproduction and maximum viewing angles.  In any light, the user can count on a comfortable brightness.  It changes automatically thanks to sensors.  For example, when used outdoors in sunny weather, the brightness level rises to the maximum limit, and in the room it is set to average.  In order to work comfortably in the dark, you can reduce the brightness to a minimum. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zte blade a510 phone specifications" class="if" height="255" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2003975.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Like many other modern gadgets, the ZTE Blade A510 phone has two cameras.  The main one is based on a 13-megapixel matrix.  With its help, you can take pictures with a resolution of 4160x3120 px.  According to this criterion, this smartphone model can compete even with devices of the middle segment.  The developers used phase autofocus, which allows you to take the most detailed pictures.  Only the main camera is equipped with a flash, as it is located on the back of the case.  Going into video mode, you can record videos with a resolution of 1280x720 px.  The change of frames per second is 30 units. </p><p>  According to most users, the quality of the optics impressed everyone without exception.  For such a price category this is more an exception than a rule.  The best quality pictures are obtained in good light.  They are distinguished by a high level of contrast and real color reproduction.  A slight noise may appear in low light.  This can be considered a drawback that spoils the high praise of optics. </p><p>  For the front camera, the developer chose a fixed focus.  It is based on a 5-megapixel sensor.  The maximum resolution of photographs is 2592x1944 px.  In their reviews, users often pay attention to the fact that it is not very suitable for a selfie, since the image is clearly visible in the pictures. </p><h2>  Hardware "stuffing" </h2><p>  Phone ZTE Blade A510 on the criterion of performance did not cause sharp comments from users.  It is based on the chipset of the MediaTek MT6735P trademark.  This processor runs on 4 computing modules of the Cortex-A53 type.  The row of the system is 64 bits, which allows users to install the most modern applications on the gadget.  The graphics card is the Mali-T720.  She does an excellent job with all types of images, including animated ones. </p><p>  Performance features are complemented by one gigabyte of RAM.  This allows the operating system to freeze up.  Each user can notice that the desktops smoothly and quickly switch.  The orientation of the picture changes literally in one second.  If you work with non-resource-intensive applications, then they open very easily.  The indisputable advantage of this model is that many 3D-games run with a bang. </p><p>  To work with the phone, the user is provided with 8 GB of integrated memory.  Of course, not all of them will be available.  A certain amount is occupied by system files.  For those who will not have enough remaining capacity, it is recommended to install memory cards.  With their help, the storage for downloading additional software will be expanded to 32 GB. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cell phone zte blade a510" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2003974.jpg" width="568"></div>

    <h2>  Platform </h2><p>  This smartphone model is based on the sixth version of Android.  The manufacturer used a new shell, so some users may find it difficult to first set up the ZTE Blade A510 phone.  However, do not worry, all changes are very easy to figure out.  For example, a lower swipe to the desktop will open an additional menu.  It provides an opportunity to change the effect that appears when switching between screens.  It also became easy to change the wallpaper, set the display style of the icons.  In principle, the rest of the settings remained the same as in the ‚Äúclean‚Äù Android 6 version. </p><p>  According to users, the operating system looks pretty harmonious, and the new shell has opened up many new opportunities.  The changes did not affect the keyboard, phone book and dialing.  The manufacturer in the factory configuration used a minimum of pre-installed programs.  However, this does not matter, since in the Google Play Market you can download all the necessary software. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mobile phone zte blade a510" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2003976.jpg" width="435"></div>

    <h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  <span>The ZTE Blade A510</span> is equipped with a rechargeable battery with a capacity of 2,200 milliamps per hour.  It is worth noting that its characteristics are not outstanding.  The results of battery life can be assessed as satisfactory.  If you reduce the load on the gadget, then you can count on 1.5 days.  With active interaction, the user will have to charge the battery in the evening. </p><h2>  Communication opportunities </h2><p>  The communication manual ZTE Blade A510 will help you deal with communication capabilities.  It says that the device is designed to work with two SIM-cards of mobile operators.  There is support for fourth-generation networks.  Also, using headphones, the device can be used as a radio station. </p><p>  Many users have noticed a great navigation module.  It works very fast: in less than 30 seconds it can find up to 4 satellites.  In addition, the device is equipped with bluetooth version 4.1, GPS, and Wi-Fi module standard 802.11 b / g / n / ac. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="photo of the phone zte blade a510" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2003977.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  ZTE Blade A510 Phone: Owner Reviews </h2><p>  Having studied all the reviews of the owners presented on the network, we can highlight the main advantages and disadvantages of this phone.  The advantages undoubtedly include: </p><ul><li>  Bright high-quality screen. </li><li>  Excellent camera features. </li><li>  Decent level of performance. </li><li>  Broad communication opportunities. </li><li>  Modern elegant design. </li></ul><p>  But the shortcomings are practically not mentioned in the reviews.  The only thing that can be attributed to the weaknesses of this gadget is the relatively short battery life with increased load. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="setting up your zte blade a510 phone" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2003978.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Of course, Chinese gadgets are no different original solutions.  Most often, the prototype for them are models of well-known brands.  The ZTE Blade A510 was no exception.  However, if you study in detail its characteristics, then the external resemblance to the "apple" products can be safely written into advantages.  Of course, the difference still exists, however, it fully pays off at a low cost.  In 2016, the Blade A510 was sold for about 8,000 rubles, while Apple devices are delivered to stores with a price tag of two, or even three times higher. </p>
