  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Caucasoid race</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The human race is a group of people historically formed within the species Homo sapiens.  They differ in secondary physical features - eye shape, skin color, hair structure, etc. </p><p>  The large Caucasian race (about 42% of the world's population) is divided into three groups according to the intensity of skin and hair pigmentation: southern, northern and intermediate.  Depending on the characteristics of pigmentation and the ‚Äúhead indicator‚Äù, small races (2nd and 3rd order) are also distinguished in these groups. </p><p>  The head indicator refers to the proportions of the skull and the ratio of the width of the head to its length.  For example, the Baltic and Nordic minor races stand out in the northern group.  In its intermediate group, the Alpine, East European and Central European races are distinguished.  In the southern group, in the Indo-Mediterranean race, the Mediterranean and Armenoid small races are distinguished. </p><p>  The Caucasian race is characterized by straight or slightly wavy light brown (from light to dark shades) hair, fair skin;  <span>gray, brown-green, gray-green,</span> blue eyes wide open;  a narrow protruding nose, a moderately developed chin, medium thickness lips, developed hairline in men on the face. </p><p>  The Caucasoid race is one of the main large races.  It is divided into several types: Nordic, sub-Adriatic, Atlanto-Baltic, Fallish, East Baltic, Mediterranean, Central East European, Balkan-Caucasian, Caspian, Near East, Indo-Afghan. </p><p>  The European race, the origin of which is associated with the general initial habitat of the bulk of its representatives, was originally distributed in the territory covering certain regions of <span>southern Europe,</span> southwest Asia and northern Africa.  Now Caucasians live on all continents. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Nordic type is widespread in Northern Europe among the Kashubians, Western Latvians and Estonians, the Komi, part of the Russians, North Karelians, south-western Finns, Norwegians, Irish, Swedes, Germans in the north-western regions, the British, Dutch, northern French and others. the signs of this type are the following: meso- and dolichokephaly;  leptosomal, normo-bone physique;  high growth;  straight or wavy hair structure;  blond, <span>blond, ashen</span> hair color;  high base of the nose;  deep lower jaw;  narrow, angular chin;  developed growth of a beard and mustache;  average body hair growth;  thin <span>white skin</span> with a pinkish tint. </p><p>  Although initially the range of the formation of the race was close to Europe and Western Asia (the Caucasian race was formed there), the characteristics of its subgroups in different parameters differ significantly depending on the geographical features of the places of further settlement of its representatives, their living conditions, etc. </p><p>  The Atlanto-Baltic type is especially common in Latvia and Estonia, Great Britain, and the Scandinavian countries.  It is characterized by especially light pigmentation of the skin, as well as hair and eyes, mesokephaly, a long <span>nose, high</span> growth, and a developed tertiary hairline. </p><p>  The subadriatic (Nori or Norik) type is described as sub brachycephalic, which is characterized by medium height, brown hair.  Distributed in Luxembourg, Champagne, Franche-Comt√©, in the Dutch province of Zealand, in the north of the Duchy of Baden, in the Rhine provinces, in southeastern Bohemia, in eastern Bavaria;  found among Slovenes in Lombardy and the Venetian region. </p><p>  The Falsky type is characterized by the highest growth among Europeans, mesodichyokephaly, stocky physique, broad shoulders, massive lower jaw, cheeky, broad face, developed superciliary arches, blue or gray eyes, low rectangular eye sockets, stiff wavy blond (reddish) hair.  This type is common in Westphalia and Scandinavia. </p><p>  The Caucasoid race in various classifications can be called differently.  Often you can find such synonyms of this term as the Caucasian or Eurasian race. </p>
