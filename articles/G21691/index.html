  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hotels near Domodedovo Airport: list, description, service, visitor reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The largest passenger traffic in Russia, Domodedovo Airport is located 45 kilometers from the center of Moscow.  Even if you head to the air harbor via the expressway or express train from the Paveletsky station, the journey will take at least forty minutes. </p><p>  Do you start or end your trip at <span>Moscow</span> Domodedovo Airport, and do flights or landings occur at night?  Getting to the city will be problematic. </p><p>  The airport infrastructure is underdeveloped, especially in the summer, when the turmoil begins with charter flights to resorts.  Then there‚Äôs nothing to sleep, there‚Äôs nowhere to sit down.  Therefore, if you value your health and mood, it is better to look for hotels near Domodedovo Airport (Moscow). </p><p>  In this article, we will review such hotels - expensive and budget, those that accept pets, those who provide a free shuttle service, and even those where hourly rates are practiced.  The only thing that unites all these motley hotels is their proximity to Domodedovo air harbor. </p><p>  In the review, we were guided not only by information from hotel sites, but also by reviews of tourists. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.motel-angelina.ru" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.motel-angelina.ru/pochasovyie-gostinitsyi-v-aeroportu-domodedovo/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotels near Domodedovo" class="if uuid-2605776" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2605776.jpg"></div><h2>  Airhotel Express </h2><p>  To get to this hotel, you do not even need to leave Domodedovo Airport.  The hotel near Terminal 1 is two hundred meters from the passenger check-in room for the flight.  Despite the high price, this hotel is in demand. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Wealthy travelers have the most positive reviews about it.  Clean, great service, all amenities.  This room can order one or two separate beds. </p><p>  The main thing - and this is noted by all the guests - the rooms are very quiet.  I can‚Äôt even believe that a huge airport is noisy around, liners take off and land.  The only minus that spoiled tourists discovered was the too small room area. </p><p>  But if you want to spend a quiet night, then this circumstance will be unprincipled for you.  The price for a double room ‚Äústandard‚Äù is 13 000 rubles (‚Äúsuites‚Äù for 17 and a half thousand).  The hotel accepts pets and practices hourly pay. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.travel.ru" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.travel.ru/hotel/russia/moscow/aerotel_domodedovo/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotels near Domodedovo Airport with free shuttle service" class="if uuid-2605789" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2605789.jpg"></div><h2>  "Domodedovo Aerotel" </h2><p>  This hotel is also located on the territory of the flight town, although in a separate building.

Here you can use the services of the spa, and leave the child in the care of a nanny. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The room has air conditioning, refrigerator, TV with satellite channels, iron with ironing board, hairdryer.  Since most passengers staying here are in a hurry for early flights, breakfast is not included in the price. </p><p>  But you can use the free shuttle service to the Domodedovo terminal.  Good news for those traveling with a pet: the hotel allows pets.  The hotel is easily recognizable by a tall white building with a sign. </p><h2>  Hotels near Domodedovo Airport with transfer </h2><p>  There are no more hotels in the air harbor.  But at a distance of 2-6 kilometers there are a lot of them.  Which one to choose?  Of course, with a free shuttle service. </p><p>  But, as a rule, hotels located at a distance of several kilometers from the air harbor, all offer it to attract customers.  And here we must choose wisely. </p><p>  If you are a Muscovite and settle in a hotel room just to avoid traffic jams, then it is better to give preference to those hotels near Domodedovo Airport that are adjacent to the highway.  Ibis is one of them. </p><p>  The hotel is located on the 40th kilometer of the A105 highway.  It is 2 km from the airport.  The price of a double room starts from 11 and a half thousand rubles.  Tourists in the reviews note the stylish decoration of the rooms, cleanliness, delicious breakfast in the restaurant, the hospitality and competence of the staff. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.booking.com/hotel/ru/ibis-moscow-domodedovo-airport.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel &amp; quot; ibis &amp; quot; near Domodedovo" class="if uuid-2605798" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2605798.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotel Planernaya and HotelJet </h2><p>  If you travel with animals, hotels near Domodedovo Airport can be cheaply rented as low as five thousand rubles per room.  Both objects - the Hotel Planernaya and HotelJet are located three kilometers from the flight town. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  You need to look for them in the village of Domodedovo.

The hostels have a shared kitchen.  You can cook your own breakfast or dinner with your own products, which is much cheaper than eating in a cafe, and even at the airport. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.4122589" data-lng="37.84078150000005" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/5/3/1/6/5316.png"></div><p>  A room at Aviation Domodedovo can be rented for six thousand rubles.

The list is based on the price per room (increasing). </p><ul><li>  Hostel-hotel Rus (Aviation district, Zhukovsky St., 14/18, 700 rubles). </li><li>  Hotel "Yamskoy" (Yam village, Pochtovaya str., 17, 1900 rubles). </li><li>  Castle-hotel "Domodedovo" (the village of Novosyanovo, ul. Shkolnaya, 41, 2,500 rubles). </li><li>  Guest house "Cherry" (Domodedovo, Vishnyakova St., 103A, 2 610 rubles). </li><li>  Health complex "Bor" (10 kilometers from the Domodedovo airport, 2 800 rubles). </li><li>  The above-mentioned ‚ÄúRoshchinskaya‚Äù, ‚ÄúTatyana‚Äù, ‚ÄúPilot‚Äù, ‚ÄúYamskaya‚Äù (from three to four thousand rubles). </li><li>  Art Hotel Uletny Gorod (on Kashirskoye Shosse, 4 thousand rubles). </li><li>  Hotel "Dash-Hall" (Domodedovo, st.

If the delay is two to three hours, then do not leave the limits of the air harbor.  You can stay in one of the waiting rooms. </p><p>  But if the flight was postponed for 6-8 hours?  Well, if it's night time.  What if a flight delay occurs during the day?  Are you a small child or are you too tired to bear the long wait? </p><p>  I do not want to pay for a hotel room for the whole day.  And it is not necessary!  For this category of travelers and practice hotels near the Domodedovo airport hourly pay. </p><p>  What is the advantage of such hotels?  You do not need to book a room.  You pay only for the time you spend at the hotel.  You can take a shower, put yourself in order, gain strength before the flight. </p><p>  Typically, such hotels are either within walking distance from the terminals, or provide a free shuttle service.  Here is a list of hotels that practice hourly pay: </p><ul><li>  "Angelina" (der Kamkino, dead end Ovrazhny, 1). </li><li>  "Ramada." </li><li>  Atlas Park. </li><li>  Domodedovo Aerotel. ‚Äù </li><li>  "Green Park". </li></ul><h2>  Hotels for passengers with special needs </h2><p>  Even a young and healthy person is hard to bear the long wait at the airport.  So what can we say about the elderly, the disabled, and small children?  Such passengers need special conditions.  And they are offered by hotels near Domodedovo Airport. </p><p>  Free shuttle service, rooms fully adapted to the needs of people with disabilities, cribs, bathtubs and pots, silence, air conditioning in comfortable rooms, the ability to eat at any time of the day - this is an incomplete list of the services that such hotels provide. </p><p>  First of all, it is necessary to recall the Aerotel Express.  There is no need for a transfer here - the hotel is located on the second floor of the terminal.  Among the hotel rooms, one is reserved for people with disabilities.  You can pay for a hotel from two hours to a day. </p><p>  Guests receive a 20 percent discount for visiting the restaurant.  They are also kind to their guests in the neighboring Aerotel Domodedovo complex.  You don‚Äôt even have to arrange a transfer.  Every 15 minutes, a free shuttle runs from the hotel‚Äôs gate to the terminal (exit number 3). </p><h2>  Hotels near Domodedovo Airport with free airport shuttle </h2><p>  But the first thing that travelers are guided by when choosing a hotel is its proximity to the terminals.  Alas, there are only two hotels on the territory of the airport terminal, with a rather high price category. </p><p>  They accept hourly pay, but it is also comparable to the cost of a room in other hotels per day.  Therefore, it is worth looking for hotels that provide a free shuttle service. </p><p>  There are many of these in the village of Domodedovo and the surrounding villages.  Almost all hotels of the middle price segment (from three to five thousand rubles) include a transfer in the price. </p><p>  And from budget housing, you can recommend the hotel "Angelina".  A single room in it costs 2,500 rubles per day, and hourly pay is also practiced. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.101hotels.ru" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.101hotels.ru/main/cities/kotlyakovo"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel &amp; quot; Angelina &amp; quot; with free transfer" class="if uuid-2605908" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2605908.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Hotels a few kilometers from the Moscow Ring Road are in demand only for those travelers who depart from Domodedovo late at night or arrive in Moscow at this hour. </p><p>  Also, those passengers whose flight is delayed for a long time decide to pay for the hotel room.  In any case, the guest needs somewhere to "have a good rest" in comfortable conditions. </p><p>  Therefore, the presence of a pool, spa, gym and other services for a tired person is not important.  The main thing he needs is a free shuttle service.  Hotels near Domodedovo Airport with this service are in the highest demand among travelers. </p>
