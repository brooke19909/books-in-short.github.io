So, the hotel reception is open around the clock.  Therefore, if you plan to check in at an inopportune time, or if you have any problem that needs to be addressed immediately, you can always contact the duty administrator.  Here you can call a taxi in the direction of Mahmutlar - Atlanta Hotel. </p><p>  Also at the hotel you can take advantage of laundry and dry cleaning services, call a doctor if necessary, and rent a car.  At the reception you can leave valuables in the safe (this service is paid).  On-site parking is available, the use of which is free for guests.  Also in public areas of the hotel you can use free Wi-Fi. </p><h2>  Cost of living </h2><p>  Rest at this hotel can be classified as budget.  So, a seven-day vacation for two in Atlanta 4 * with a flight from Moscow will cost about $ 800. </p><h2>  Atlanta Hotel reviews </h2><p>  When choosing a hotel in a particular country, a lot of people are guided by the reviews of vacationers who have already been here.  In this regard, we decided to bring to your attention the generalized comments of our compatriots who stayed during their trip to Turkey at the Atlanta Hotel (Alanya). </p><p>  In general, most tourists rated Atlanta Hotel 4 * (Turkey) as an acceptable place to spend a relaxing and peaceful vacation on the beach.  The location of the hotel made a considerable impression on vacationers.  So, she is at the very end of a string of hotels.  Thanks to this, the water in the sea is much cleaner here than in other places.  In addition, "Atlanta 4 *" is located on a hill surrounded by picturesque cliffs, and from the windows and balconies of absolutely all rooms a magnificent view of the sea and the surrounding area opens.  Also, tourists really enjoyed swimming here with masks, because near the coast you can find many different marine animals. </p><p>  As for the beach, many tourists note discomfort when entering the sea due to the presence of large stones at the bottom.  Therefore, enter the water carefully.  If you come to rest with children, stones can be a real problem.  In this case, experienced tourists recommend not going to the hotel‚Äôs own beach, but to the municipal beach located a couple of hundred meters from it.  The water there is not so clean, but the entrance to the sea is sandy and gentle. </p>

    <p>  Extremely positive emotions are caused by the hotel pool.  It is filled not with standard chlorinated, but with real sea water.  At the same time, swimming in it is allowed even at night. </p><p>  As for the rooms, they do not cause any particular complaints.  Despite the fact that the furniture and appliances in them are quite old, everything is very clean and comfortable.  Cleaning is carried out carefully and regularly.  True, some guests complained about the frequent lack of hot water. </p><p>  The greatest number of complaints from tourists was caused by food at the Atlanta Hotel.  So, the vast majority of vacationers found the local food very meager and for the most part tasteless.  Many tourists would not recommend coming here with children, as it will be quite difficult to feed the kids here. </p><p>  As for the hotel staff, there are practically no complaints.  The vast majority of tourists noted the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff.  Opinions of vacationers were divided about the animation, which, by the way, in Atlanta 4 * is not at all.  Someone after previous trips to Turkey got used to the fact that they are entertained by animators from morning to night, while someone liked that there is an opportunity to spend time in peace and quiet. </p><p>  In a word, if Alanya is chosen as the destination for your vacation, Atlanta Hotel will become a good economical option for not very demanding people who do not care about the animation in the hotel. </p>

    <h2>  Alanya Attractions </h2><p>  The main attraction of this popular resort in Turkey is the Ich-Kale fortress, located on top of a hill towering above the city.  Its walls stretch for six and a half kilometers.  There are no less than 140 watchtowers.  On the territory of the fortress today you can observe the ruins of a medieval castle, as well as ancient churches, baths and other buildings.  Also inside the fortress there are a number of residential villas that were built here relatively recently - in the 19th century.  In general, Ich-Kale is a real open-air museum, accessible to all who wish. </p><p>  In Alanya, there are other attractions, among which you can distinguish the mosque built on the orders of the Sultan Aladdin Keikubat, the mausoleum of Aksebe Turbesi and the Tersane shipyard.  All these structures date back to the 13th century. </p><p>  In Alanya, there are also very interesting museums.  One of them is the ethnographic museum located in the Kyzyl-Kul tower, as well as the archaeological museum, which presents the rarest floor mosaics created by the hands of ancient masters in the second century BC.  By the way, the Kyzyl-Kul tower is one of the main attractions of the city.  She is even depicted on the flag of Alanya.  The tower is an octagonal structure made of red brick, the height of which is 33 meters and the diameter is 29 meters. </p><p>  Another noteworthy Alanya museum is dedicated to Turkish reformer Kemal Atat√ºrk.  It is located in the house where Ataturk stayed during his trip to Alanya in 1936.  The museum opened its doors to visitors in 1986.  His exposition is represented by personal belongings, documents and photographs of this politician. </p>

    <h2>  Natural attractions of Alanya </h2><p>  In addition to architectural monuments, this region also boasts interesting ancient caves, some of which are open to visitors.  One of them is Damlatas cave.  It is located in the western part of the peninsula and was discovered in the middle of the last century.  You can get into the cave by walking along a narrow passage 50 meters long.  Inside your gaze you will see many <span>stalactites and stalagmites of</span> various colors and shades, whose age exceeds 15 thousand years. </p><p>  Also worth noting are the ‚ÄúCave of Lovers‚Äù and the ‚ÄúPhosphoric Cave‚Äù.  The latter got its name due to the interesting lighting effect created in its bowels due to the high phosphorus content in the walls.  It will be interesting to visit the "Pirate Cave".  However, you can only get there by boat. </p>
