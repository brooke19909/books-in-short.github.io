This <span>hydraulic structure</span> was conceived and completed in the thirties of the last century as one of the elements of a common system that provides Moscow with water resources and maintains <span>the water level in the Moscow River</span> at an acceptable level for shipping.  But in addition, the Pestovsky reservoir has become one of the favorite vacation spots for several generations of Muscovites.  Fortunately, it is located not far from the capital. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pestovsky reservoir" class="if" height="265" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/293290.jpg" width="491"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Geographical and natural features of the reservoir</strong> </p><p>  The Pestovo reservoir was formed in its current coastal shape in 1937, after the completion of the construction of the hydroelectric complex on the Vyaz river.  This body of water is relatively smaller than the nearby Uchinskoe and <span>Klyazma reservoirs.</span>  In length, it stretches six kilometers, and its width does not exceed two kilometers.  The maximum depth reaches fourteen meters.  The water in the reservoir is flowing, its turnover is regulated.  This, among other things, favorably affects the environment and creates an optimal regime for maintaining fish stocks at a high level.  And this is one of the reasons why the Pestovsky reservoir has gained such great popularity among Muscovites and even guests of the capital.  Good fishing and outdoor recreation are always provided here.  And with the passage of time along the entire coast, a tourist infrastructure has been developed that is sufficiently developed for this.  To have a good rest, it is absolutely not necessary to spend time and money on flights to distant tropical seas and oceans.  For a person accustomed to the climate of the middle zone, the near Moscow region is quite enough for a good rest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pestovsky reservoir how to get there" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/293289.jpg" width="492"></div>  And many choose this: rest by the water, a campfire, a tent or a more comfortable camp site.  The Pestovsky reservoir can provide this to everyone.  A convenient recreation center is located on the southern shore of the reservoir, near the dam that forms it.  Fans of sailing and water-motor sports feel very well here.  The most popular among them are the wharfs Khvoyny Bor, Tishkovo, Pestovo and Lesnoye.  Closer to the northern shore of the reservoir there are two islands covered with dense forest.  This is a very good place both for fishing and for stopping to rest in a tent.  In general, the northern coast is most suitable for <span>offline</span> recreation, it is called "Coniferous Forest" and is fully consistent with its name. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hostel pestovskoe reservoir" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/293288.jpg" width="498"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Pestovsky reservoir.</strong>  <strong>How to get to it</strong> </p><p>  You can get to the pond both on Dmitrovsky and on the Yaroslavl highway, but it is separated by a considerable distance from both of these freeways, which you have to overcome on country and secondary roads.  The distance from the Moscow ring road to the Pestovsky reservoir is about fifty kilometers.  Departure directly to the coastline in many places along the coast is problematic.  But on the northern shore of the reservoir, you can find many convenient parking lots in the forest. </p>
