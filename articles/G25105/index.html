Photos and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Cetinje monastery is perhaps the most famous spiritual relic in Montenegro.  Every year thousands of pilgrims from all over the world seek its gates.  Such popularity is due primarily to the fact that it is here that the greatest shrines of the Christian world are located in the vaults of the monastery, and, of course, it attracts the atmosphere of deep faith and asceticism that has survived to this day. </p><h2>  From the history of the monastery </h2><p>  The Christian shrine is located in the historical capital of the country - the city of Cetinje.  The Cetinje Monastery, also known as the Monastery of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, was built by the lord of the Principality of Zeta, Ivan I Chernoevich.  After that, the department of the Zeta diocese was located in it. </p>

    <p>  The monastery was repeatedly destroyed.  For the first time until its very foundation, it was demolished as a result of the invasion of the Turks in 1692 and was rebuilt again by Vladyka Danila.  The place was chosen a little away from the original.  However, the stones of the old monastery and a plate with the seal of I. Chernoyevich were used in the construction. </p><p>  For the second time, the Turks burned the Cetinje Monastery (Montenegro) in 1714.  After that, it was repeatedly restored and rebuilt.  The last reconstruction of the temple complex was made in 1927.  Now in the monastery several iconic shrines of Christianity are stored at once. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Monastery architecture </h2><p>  Historians suggest that the temple was built with the help of masters from Primorye, which is confirmed by the features of the architectural style.  In the middle of the monastery, there was supposedly a church surrounded on three sides by cannonade.  On the perimeter of the site were monastic buildings and the church of St. Peter.  The outer walls of the complex had loopholes, and behind them was a deep moat and a fence of stakes.  The modern Cetinje Monastery (Montenegro) partially preserved some fragments to the present. </p>

    <p>  Now the central element of the complex is still the Church of the Nativity of the Virgin.  It is built of carved natural stone and inside contains the greatest Montenegrin shrine - the relics of St. Peter of Cetinje, as well as relics of the Order of the Knights of Malta.  In addition, it has a rich carved iconostasis - the work of Greek masters of the 19th century. </p><p>  The treasury of the monastery has collected a unique and rich collection of ancient printed books and manuscripts, personal belongings of the Montenegrin metropolitans, <span>church utensils</span> and much more.  Many exhibits were received as a gift from Russia. </p><h2>  Hand of John the Baptist </h2><p>  For several decades, the Cetinje Monastery (Montenegro), the photo of which is presented in the article, is the place of storage of the right imperishable hand (right hand) of the prophet John the Baptist.  It is one of the most revered shrines in the Christian Orthodox world.  The Bible indicates that <span>John the Baptist</span> laid his right hand on the head of Christ during the rite of baptism. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The right hand does not have two fingers: the little finger, which is now kept in the museum of Istanbul, and the nameless one, located in Italian Siena.  The shrine is enclosed in a gold ark made by order of Paul I. </p>

    <p>  The Evangelist Luke brought the hand of John the Baptist to Antioch right, where it was stored for ten centuries.  During the time of Julian the Apostate, the relics of saints were removed from the graves and burned.  The townspeople hid their hand in one of the towers; in the 10th century it was transported to Chalcedon, and then to Constantinople.  When the city was captured by the Turks, in 1453 the shrine was transported to the island of Rhodes and further to Malta.  The right hand came to Russia from the Order of Malta during the reign of Paul I, when he became their great master. </p><p>  After the revolution began, the ark, for the sake of salvation, traveled a long way from our country to Belgrade.  It is difficult to say how she got to the Cetinje Monastery in Cetinje, but after many years during which the shrine was considered lost, she was found there in 1993. </p><h2>  The relics of St.  Peter Tsetinsky </h2><p>  In the world, Peter I Petrovich Negosh was the ruler and metropolitan of Montenegro, he was canonized under the name of Cetinsky, was canonized by the Serbian Orthodox Church.  Born in Negushi in 1748, the priest at the age of 17 became a deacon and was sent to Russia to study.  After the death of the anarchist Arseny Plamenac in 1784, he was elected to the throne by the Montenegrin Cathedral. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The saint died at the age of 81 and was buried in the monastery church.  Four years later, by decree of Peter II, the coffin and imperishable relics were opened.  At the same time, he was counted <span>among the saints.</span>  Now Cetinje monastery relics of St.  Peter Tsetinsky is stored in the open ark, along with posthumously made troparion and kondak. </p><h2>  Particles of the holy cross </h2><p>  The Life-Giving, or Holy Cross, is a <span>cross on</span> which, according to the Bible, Jesus Christ was crucified.  It belongs to the most important Christian relics.  There is a whole cycle of legends telling about its creation and subsequent acquisition by believers.  The latter, in particular, speak of him as being newly found since 326.  It is believed that he was discovered in Jerusalem by Queen Empress Elena during her pilgrimage.  In addition to the cross, 4 nails were also acquired.  In honor of these events, one of the most significant church holidays was established - the Exaltation of the Holy Cross.  It has different calendar dates for Catholics and Orthodox. </p><p>  Particles of the Holy Cross are stored separately.  One of them fell into the Tsetinsky monastery.  History connects all this with the same <span>order of Malta of the</span> Knights.  From them, particles fell into the Russian Empire, where they were until the 1917 revolution.  Then, like the right hand of St.  John the Baptist, parts of the Holy Cross ended up in Montenegro. </p><h2>  Crown of King S. Decansky </h2><p>  Stefan Decansky was canonized by the Orthodox Church of Serbia as the Holy King.  During his reign, at the expense of the Byzantine Empire, Serbia expanded its borders, achieved prosperity and became the strongest state on the Balkan Peninsula. </p><p>  Regarding his mysterious death, two versions are always put forward.  According to the first, at the end of his life, the king succumbed to the influence of his young wife and decided to transfer the throne to his youngest son from his second marriage.  The eldest son made such a decision and did not argue, but retired to Constantinople.  After some time, the king died in the Zvecan fortress by natural death, it is believed that from a heart attack. </p><p>  According to the second version, S. Decansky was strangled by an angry son.  It was her who was accepted by the church, canonizing the king as a martyr.  However, there is no documentary evidence of this or that version, each of them could happen with the same probability.  The crown of the great king of Serbia is still preserved by the Cetinje Monastery as one of the sacred relics. </p><h2>  Epitrachilles of Saint Sava </h2><p>  Epitrachilus is a part of liturgical vestments characteristic of an Orthodox priest and a bishop.  It has the form of a long ribbon that goes around the neck and with both ends in front descends to the chest.  It is worn on top of a cassock or creeper.  According to the canons of the church, it is impossible to be sacred without it. </p>

    <p>  The Cetinje Monastery is the storage site of the epitrachili of St. Savva, one of the most revered saints in the Serbian Orthodox Church, a cultural and religious figure who lived around 1169-1236.  He is considered the patron saint of schools. </p><h2>  Cetine </h2><p>  Speaking about the Cetinje Monastery, one cannot fail to mention the wonderful city in which it is located.  The Constitution of Montenegro equalizes its rights with the official capital Polgorica.  The city has the official residence of the president and the country's ministry of culture.  It is small in area, the population (according to 2011) is almost 14 thousand people.  Located in a picturesque region: intermountain hollow, at the foot of the Lovcen massif. </p><p>  According to statistics from meteorologists, it is one of the rainiest cities in Europe.  The history of its existence begins presumably from 1440, after 44 years the Cetinje monastery was founded in it, where, as already mentioned, one of the main shrines of the Orthodox Church is located. </p>

    <p>  Of great interest is the city itself.  Beautiful architecture, old streets and friendly people - all this has and remains in the memory for a long time.  Bright and peculiar Montenegro has always been close to our country, but this is not only a beach holiday on the Adriatic coast.  In order to get to know the country better, you should look at it from the inside, visit the small villages in the mountains, rural churches and ancient monasteries, enjoy the picturesque views and "taste" it.
