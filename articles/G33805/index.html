  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Economics and sociology of labor as a socially positive process in society.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Labor is a multidimensional phenomenon that directly affects all spheres of human life.  As a rule, the concept of ‚Äúlabor‚Äù is defined in the form of expedient human activity, which was aimed at creating material and cultural values. </p><p>  Labor is not only an economic, but also a social category, since during labor, the worker and his group enter into some social relations and interact with one another.  When such an interaction occurs, the state of each social group and individual employee changes. <br>  The subject and the <span>means of labor</span> do not function as such unless they are included in living labor, which in the form of a single human relationship to nature and relationships among participants in the procedure, in the sense of social relations.  For this reason, labor itself is not just a mechanical combination of the main components, but an organic unity, the decisive factors of which are the people themselves with their labor activity. </p><p>  The economics and sociology of labor are relations among members of a social community and this community (their <span>social position,</span> way of life, and, ultimately, the <span>formation and development of the individual,</span> and a very different social community). <br>  The economics and sociology of labor are determined by the relations of labor, since any worker joins in labor activity, not considering who he will work with.  But over time, workers in their own way manifest themselves in relationships with another member of the labor team.  In this way, <span>social relations</span> in work are also able to form. <br>  The economics and <span>sociology of labor</span> are able to exist in inextricable interaction, mutually enrich and complement each other.  Thanks to social and labor relations, the social significance, purpose, position in the society of an individual and a collective is determined.  Neither the employees nor the members of the labor company function outside of social labor relations, out of mutual responsibility, out of interaction. <br>  The sociology of labor studies the functioning and social aspects of the labor market.  Using the sociology of labor, it is possible to understand how employers and employees behave in response to an economic and social incentive to work. <br>  For this reason, the sociology of labor studies the structure and mechanism of social and labor relations, the social process and the phenomena in the field of labor.  The economics and sociology of labor are studying the problem of regulating the social process, labor motivation, labor adaptation of an employee, stimulating labor activity, <span>social control</span> in the field of labor, rallying labor groups, managing labor groups and democratizing labor relations, labor movements, planning and social regulation of labor activity. <br>  The sociology of labor and economic sociology study the socio-economic relations that take shape during labor activity between employers, employees and the country on how to organize labor. </p><p>  The principle of a market economy is actively being introduced into the sphere of attracting and using <span>workers, social and labor</span> relations, organizing and paying for labor activity, as well as the formation and use of employee income, and improving people's living standards.  Labor economics studies the socio-economic problem of labor, the efficiency and productivity of labor activity, taking into account the basis of scientific organizations.  The most important aspect is the study of people's attitudes to work, the formation of satisfaction, with the help of labor, in the system of social and labor relations taking shape at various levels of the economy. </p>
