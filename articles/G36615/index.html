The conclusion of the contract does not follow. </li><li>  Financial transactions are protected by law.  Confidential data does not pass to third parties. </li><li>  Together with the translation, you can open a text message, which should not be more than 10 words. </li></ol><h2>  rules </h2><p>  MoneyGram transfers are provided according to general rules.  They are taken into account by agents during registration and disbursement of funds: </p><ol><li>  In Russia there are no restrictions on the amount.

According to customer reviews, they are as follows: </p><ol><li>  Only individuals can receive and send transfers.  You can not send funds for entrepreneurial activity. </li><li>  The sender must notify about the currency of receipt. </li><li>  When sent to countries where Euros or dollars are not used, funds are lost due to conversion. </li></ol><h2>  Sending and receiving </h2><p>  According to reviews, there are MoneyGram in many communication stores.

It is provided on the support line.  A sender or a transfer agent can call.  With this payment, the company will be the sender in the application, and the United States will be the country.  When funds are paid in euros, then the country will be Albania.  If 45 days have passed from registration, the commission is not given.  Refund is possible only if the funds were not issued to the recipient. </p><h2>  The control </h2><p>  The company runs the Compliance program, which helps protect and stop illegal financial procedures, fraud, and terrorist financing.  Therefore, system transactions are monitored.  Particular attention is paid to large amounts, suspicious transactions.  This work is carried out by a special department. </p><p>  If there is a suspicion, the translation is blocked.  You can unlock it after a call to support.  Depending on the case, clarifications are required from the sender or receiver.  If it is impossible to unlock, the operator notifies the client about this and recommends taking the funds. </p>
