Family trading began in the 18th century.  Their contribution to the development of the economy and culture of Russia is commensurate in scale with such names as the Morozovs, Bakhrushins, Putilovs, Demidovs.  The mansion on Basmannaya belonged to Nikolai Dmitrievich Staheev, an enterprising and intelligent man who managed to increase the inheritance received from his father several times. </p><h2>  Reputation and condition </h2><p>  Nikolai Stakheev was born into a family of skillful and successful merchants.  They inherited 5 million rubles - a huge fortune.  Talent allowed him to increase start-up capital several times and become one of the richest people of his time.  Trading was conducted in many directions, contemporaries believed that it was easier to list what Staheev did not do.  He had gold mining, trade in bread, groceries, at the disposal was the merchant fleet he had built and the railway lines.  The shares of the Stakheyev Trading House were so reliable that their part was owned by Emperor Nicholas II. </p><div class="photo" data-original="." data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="stacheev mansion excursion" class="if uuid-2554025" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31591/2554025.jpg"></div><p>  Merchant-owned retail chains covered all of Russia.  At the end of the 19th century N. Stakheev moved to the capital.  There were rumors that the reason for the move was marriage - allegedly Nikolai recaptured his wife from an official, having paid a considerable sum.  The arrangement in Moscow was accompanied by the development of a new direction of financial interests - Staheev began to build apartment buildings on the purchased land, which brought him large incomes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Staheev in Moscow </h2><p>  For his family, he built a luxurious mansion.  The legend says that when asked by the architect about what style the house will be in, the merchant answered: ‚ÄúIn all!  Enough money for everything. ‚Äù </p><p>  The rebuilt mansion became home to him and a large family.  In addition to his offspring, Nikolai Staheev was an exemplary guardian of seven nephews, whom he took up after the death of his brother.  What Russian man can live without passion, albeit destructive?  Nikolai Dmitrievich was loved in all gambling houses of Monte Carlo. </p><div class="photo" data-original="appassionata-lr.livejournal.com" data-author=": appassionata_lr, "><img itemprop="image" alt="stacheev's house" class="if uuid-2554047" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31591/2554047.jpg"></div><p>  He lost broadly, without maliciousness and very much.  They say that when he came to the next game, the shares of all casinos went up.  Once, without flinching, he lost 11 million, the family, although he was shocked, did not work out a scandal - his income was many times higher than all the losses.  Fortune, who loved him so much in her work, completely turned away from her favorite as soon as he sat down at the gambling table.  Stakheev almost never won - he only let his fortunes down, but he never became poor. </p><p>  The spouse, who had long endured "passionate impulses", nevertheless filed for divorce.  The gap occurred peacefully, she got a manor on Basmannaya, children - apartment buildings in Moscow.  Nikolai Dmitrievich went to Italy, but occasionally appeared with his ex-wife, where he was gladly received.  By this time, Staheev began to transfer capital into compact things - he bought up precious stones, gold, as they say, hid everything in his wife‚Äôs house, where many hiding places were arranged, which only the owner and architect knew about. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The legend of Staheev and Dzerzhinsky </h2><p>  The revolution that erupted in Russia caused him trouble and deprived most of his capital.  There is a legend that, having arrived in revolutionary Moscow and at night having made his way to his house on Basmannaya, he took part of the jewelry.  Putting them in a bag, he prepared to secretly leave the capital under the guise of a doctor.  He was seized and sent for interrogation.  Realizing that leaving so simply would not work, he bargained for his freedom from Dzerzhinsky himself, opening the caches and giving all his savings. </p><p>  The <span>House of Culture</span> was built on these funds <span>,</span> and Staheev allegedly received a life-long pension, for which he lived in his beloved Monte Carlo.  History formed the basis of the novel "12 Chairs" by I. Ilf and E. Petrov.  How reliable it is - God knows, but so good that they will always tell it while the genre of urban legends is alive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="snap361.com" data-author=": @zoja_fsgs, "><img itemprop="image" alt="stacheev's mansion on basmannaya" class="if uuid-2554067" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31591/2554067.jpg"></div><p>  Gambling passion added peppercorn to the character of Nikolai Dmitrievich, and philanthropy made him one of the most eminent citizens of Russia.  His labors and cares opened the resort of Alushta.  The city owes its current position and architectural monuments to Staheev, where he built a good half of the infrastructure and attracted the attention of the general public to the resort.  In a word, the man was extraordinary and his house on Basmannaya became just as bright, which we can admire today. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Home story </h2><p>  One of the decorations on Novaya Basmannaya Street is the luxurious house of the merchant, gold producer and philanthropist Nikolai Stacheev.  In the early 1890s, he acquired an extensive estate with buildings and a capital outbuilding.  Earlier, the famous philosopher P. Ya. Chaadaev lived in it, eminent guests - A. Herzen, I. Turgenev, N. Gogol and other writers often visited the house. </p><p>  The house project was developed by architect M. Bugrovsky.  Stakheyev had long-standing business relations with him, the master was engaged in the design and construction of several apartment buildings for the industrialist.  The place for the future mansion was drastically cleared - they demolished all the available buildings, including the famous house.  The sculptor V.G. Gladkov was involved in the design.  The built house cost the owner a huge amount - a million rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="shagau.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="museum manor" class="if uuid-2554021" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31591/2554021.jpg"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The palace built by Bugrovsky is a vivid example of eclecticism.  The external solution is made in the neoclassical style, the interior is a mixture of time and style.  Stacheev's mansion is an example of typical Moscow buildings of the late 19th century.  It is separated from the roadway, in front of the facade is a front garden.  It is decorated with the Goddess of the Night fountain, brought from France, made of metal in the form of a female figure holding the lamp on an outstretched arm.  It can still be seen today in the same place.  The front porch of the house is located on the side of the main facade. </p><p>  In the decoration of interiors, the thoroughness of the elaboration with which the smallest elements are made is striking.  During the period of Soviet rule everything was perfectly preserved here.  Stained-glass windows, numerous stucco work, inlaid inlaid parquet, natural stone and much more remained intact. </p><p>  In the lobby there is a white marble staircase leading to the hall of the second floor.  It is made in the Greek style and decorated with columns, pilasters made of artificial marble in pink.  French columns were installed next to the columns and in the wall niches.  The visitors are most impressed by the beautifully preserved Gothic dining room.  It presents skillful woodcarving on coffered ceilings, wall decoration, and furniture. </p><p>  Unfortunately, almost all the furniture from the Staheev‚Äôs mansion was requisitioned, and nowhere settled down, obeying the revolutionary whirlwinds.  Only in the Gothic hall did the buffet remain untouched, decorated with Mephistopheles smiling masks and a dining group of chairs with carved backs and armrests.  The centerpiece of the room is a majestic fireplace. </p><h2>  Collector and esthete </h2><p>  During the life of Nikolai Dmitrievich, the eastern wing of the building was reserved for an art gallery.  What was in his collection is not known for certain, but according to the memoirs of his contemporaries, it was of high value.  It is generally accepted that Stakheev undoubtedly was the owner of a certain number of paintings by Ilya Shishkin, who was a relative of his wife.  In the western porch of the house were offices and offices. </p><div class="photo" data-original="raven-yellow.livejournal.com" data-author=": RAVEN_YELLOW, "><img itemprop="image" alt="new basmanny" class="if uuid-2554020" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31591/2554020.jpg"></div><p>  In the Stacheev mansion there are several more rooms that deserve close attention, for example, a <span>Moorish-style</span> smoking <span>room.</span>  Finishing walls, ceilings, floors is almost a piece of jewelry, and natural stone was used in the design of window openings. </p><p>  A thorough study of each element during restoration work took 1.5 months.  The remaining rooms in the house are decorated in the style of Baroque, neoclassicism and many others.  Behind the house was a park where the Belvedere ruin grotto attracted attention.  Thanks to the lucky star of this house, you can still enjoy the grotto and the park area today. </p><h2>  After the revolution </h2><p>  The Stakheev mansion on Basmannaya was incredibly lucky after the 1917 revolution.  He was not given for communal apartments; they did not arrange public places or crowded committees here.  The building was placed at the disposal of the People's Commissariat of Railways, later reorganized into the Ministry.  In 1940, the premises were transferred to children by organizing the Central House of Children of Railway Workers. </p><p>  The merchant Stacheev‚Äôs house was filled with children's voices and numerous circles.  The first steps on the creative path in the youth palace were made by Oleg Dal, Valentina Tolkunova and many others.  Here they were engaged in singing, dancing, art studios and many other clubs of interest. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bjahova.livejournal.com" data-author=": BJAHOVA, "><img itemprop="image" alt="stacheev mansion excursions" class="if uuid-2554037" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31591/2554037.jpg"></div><h2>  Modernity </h2><p>  The museum-estate of Stacheev survived without much damage.  Today it is under protection, being an object of cultural heritage, transferred to the balance of the Ministry of Culture.  The interiors of the premises of the estate are familiar to many lovers of mysticism and fans of the television show "Battle of psychics."  The plot of the program, TNT television company, shoots in the interiors of the house of the merchant Stakheev. </p><p>  In the ceremonial halls, various events are held, concerts are given.  A small number of children's art circles are still functioning.  The estate museum attracts a large number of visitors. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  The house of Stakheev is of interest to many.  Someone from an aesthetic and historical point of view, and someone is drawn to find treasures hidden by the millionaire.  Not everyone believes that all the savings of the house on Novaya Basmannaya were given in exchange for freedom.  Several generations of adventure lovers continue to try to find signs that indicate hiding places, but so far the searches have failed.  Who knows, maybe the treasure is really waiting for a successful seeker. </p><div class="photo" data-original="usolt.livejournal.com" data-author=": USOLT, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikolai Dmitrievich Stacheev" class="if uuid-2554055" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31591/2554055.jpg"></div><p>  In the Staheev mansion, excursions are conducted regularly, often with a large full house.  The visitors have a lot of impressions, which they generously share and recommend to visit an amazing house, where time and people showed respect for culture and history. </p>
