This solves the main problem that is relevant for many today - the quality of the output image.  Naturally, to organize the viewing of digital TV, more modern equipment is needed, and you won‚Äôt cook porridge with the old Ruby or Horizon. </p><p>  Nevertheless, the requests from the new TV format are not so tough.  It is enough to have a TV with the ability to receive a signal according to the DVB-T2 standard and a special set-top box - receiver (tuner) - to decode the image.  If we talk about the budget segment, then the first and second will not cost so much.  Small TV ‚Äúkids‚Äù of 17 inches cost about 5,000 rubles, and the cost of consoles starts at 800 rubles. </p><p>  Today's TV tuner market offers a chic assortment of models that support the DVB-T2 standard.  On the shelves of stores you can find both ultra-budget options and advanced gadgets of the premium segment.  But among other devices you are likely to come across a brand D-COLOR.  It offers a good selection of TV tuners of various price categories. </p><p>  We will consider one of the most remarkable models of the brand - the digital prefix D-COLOR DC1302HD.  Reviews about it are not always unambiguous, but many consumers liked the device, so there is something to understand.  In addition, marketers of the company reward the gadget with too attractive epithets from the category of "exceptional", "super convenient" and the like. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, we present to your attention a review of the set-top box D-COLOR DC1302HD.  Problems, user reviews, features of operation and other important points will be considered in the article.  The receiver is sold in almost every specialized store and costs a little more than 1000 rubles.  So there should not be any problems with the purchase and testing. </p><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  The prefix comes in a beautifully designed box made of thick cardboard.  On the front of the package you can see the image of the device and its most attractive characteristics.  Behind is a mini specification, as well as random reviews of the tuner DVB-T2 D-COLOR DC1302HD.  Naturally, the latter were selected from the general positively tuned mass. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dvbmarket.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dvb receiver t2 d color dc1302hd reviews" class="if uuid-3222933" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3222933.jpg"></div><p>  On the sides are barcodes, labels, certification icons and other elements necessary for the sale.  Judging by the reviews on the DVB-T2 D-COLOR DC1302HD receiver, many people liked the ‚Äúwrapper‚Äù and the interior.  All accessories are well-packed and each lie in its place.  It‚Äôs even a pity to throw out the box after unpacking. </p><p>  Contents of delivery: </p><ul><li>  D-COLOR DC1302HD receiver; </li><li>  remote control; </li><li>  set of two batteries for PU; </li><li>  cable type RCA; </li><li>  user's manual; </li><li>  warranty card. </li></ul><p>  Unlike the competing analogue represented by the Oriel brand, D-COLOR equips its devices with tulips (RCA) and more detailed instructions that reflect the chipset's schemes.  Judging by the reviews on the DVB-T2 D-COLOR DC1302HD receiver, the owners were especially pleased with the warranty period - two whole years.  In the budget segment, this is a rarity.  The same "Oriel" does not give such guarantees. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The upper and lower parts of the console are made of metal, and also have ventilation grilles.  On the base you can see four rubberized legs that prevent the device from sliding on smooth surfaces. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sima-land.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tv tuner d color dc1302hd reviews" class="if uuid-3222935" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3222935.jpg"></div><p>  The front panel of the receiver is made of plastic and is framed around the perimeter with a silver border.  Separately, it is worth noting that the front surface is matte, and a segmented display is hidden behind a seemingly opaque coating. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews of the D-COLOR DC1302HD set-top box, everyone liked this solution.  Especially when you consider that other manufacturers supply their devices with glossy panels that absorb fingerprints, dust and other dirt like a sponge. </p><p>  The display is located in the central part of the gadget on the front panel.  When the unit enters standby mode, a clock appears on it, and in the working format, the channel number.  On the right side of the display are the channel switch buttons and the device shutdown key. </p><p>  On the left side of the front panel there is an infrared sensor, an event indicator and a USB interface.  In idle mode, the LED lights up red, and during operation - green.  The back panel is reserved for various interfaces.  A set of patch connectors can be called classic for consoles in this price category.  Here we have standard antenna interfaces RF IN and RF OUT, modern HDMI and ‚Äútulips‚Äù (composite output like VIDEO and audio jack L-AUDIO-R). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Judging by the reviews of the D-COLOR DC1302HD TV tuner, a good half of ordinary consumers of this kit are quite enough.  Especially when you consider that for the console to work with a modern TV, only HDMI is enough with the head. </p><h2>  Connection </h2><p>  If you look at the reviews about the D-COLOR DC1302HD receiver, you can conclude that users do not experience serious connection problems.  First, you need to connect a standard television antenna operating in the DMV range to the set-top box (RF IN interface). </p><div class="photo" data-original="spin-rf.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dvb t2 d color dc1302hd reviews" class="if uuid-3222934" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3222934.jpg"></div><p>  Then you need to connect the corresponding cable to the audio output.  For "tulips" this is AV IN.  The color of the cable for all RCA connectors, as a rule, does not change: white - the left audio channel, red - the right, and yellow - the image.  If the TV works in mono format, then you need to connect only the yellow and white wires. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews on the D-COLOR DC1302HD TV tuner, the model fully reveals itself when connected via an HDMI interface.  In this case, the image will be of the highest quality.  So if your TV supports both tulips and HDMI, it‚Äôs better to give preference to the latter. </p><h2>  Connection Features </h2><p>  After connecting all the interfaces, you need to plug the device into a power outlet, and select the appropriate AV output in the menu.  Separately, it is worth noting one nuance.  The fact is that the wire at the console can not be called long - just 80 cm. </p><p>  Reviews about the D-COLOR DC1302HD TV tuner in this regard are far from the most flattering.  What prevented the manufacturer from making the wire at least a meter and a half, is unclear.  You have to place the carrier directly behind the TV or in the cabinet on which it is located.  In cases where furniture comes without wings and rear walls, this solution looks unaesthetic. </p><h2>  Beginning of work </h2><p>  At the first start of the tuner, the master settings should turn on.  In the first window, you need to select the language and country, after which you can begin to search for channels.  It is also worth noting that control occurs through the remote control.  Full-fledged tuning without it, alas, is impossible.  Users also leave not the best reviews about the D-COLOR DC1302HD DVB-T2 about this. </p><p>  As for the control panel itself, it is not much different from similar models from competing counterparts.  Its length is slightly more than 12 cm, and its width is about 4. Rubberized buttons are small, but judging by the reviews on the D-COLOR DC1302HD TV, it‚Äôs convenient to use them.  The only ones who left negative feedback about the ergonomics of the remote control were people with thumbs, of which there are not so many.  In this case, the purchase of third-party PUs helps. </p><h2>  Customization </h2><p>  On the first window, where you need to select the language and country, there is a line ‚ÄúChannel settings (Search)‚Äù.  When you click on it, the receiver will begin to search for all available programs.  The number of channels found depends on the broadcast area and can be very different. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.onlinetrade.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="d color dc1302hd receiver reviews" class="if uuid-3222939" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3222939.jpg"></div><p>  If we take into account the DVB-T2 standard, then several programs can coexist on the same frequency range at once.  Providers call them multiplexes, where everyone is able to broadcast on 10 channels in classic resolution (SDTV). </p><p>  In addition to television programs, additional radio, exact time, transmission schedule, subtitles and more can be broadcast.  During automatic channel search, the receiver scans the entire range of frequencies available to it. </p><p>  On the main screen you can see two windows.  In one are found digital programs for TV, and in the other - radio stations.  If you do not change the default settings, then the channels are sorted by logical numbers (LCN). </p><p>  After the tuner scans all frequencies and finds some programs, it automatically switches to its usual broadcast mode on the first number found.  Judging by the reviews of the D-COLOR DC1302HD, the receiver scans for quite some time and thoughtfully processes each hint of the channel.  Some users note that the search on the model works more efficiently, in contrast to the competing "Oriel". </p><h2>  Functional </h2><p>  As for switching channels, there are several ways available to users.  You can select the desired program through the digital unit on the remote control or go up and down using the likeness of a joystick located in the middle of the remote control. </p><div class="photo" data-original="." data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tv d color dc1302hd reviews" class="if uuid-3222936" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3222936.jpg"></div><p>  Users in their reviews of D-COLOR DC1302HD have repeatedly thanked the manufacturer for the ability to switch channels without the participation of PU.  On the front panel of the receiver is a pair of buttons (up / down), with which you can select the desired program. </p><p>  To quickly move to the previous channel on the control panel there is a special LAST button.  To switch to broadcasting radio and back to digital TV, there is a TV / R key.  Functionality for managing teletext, if provided by the provider, is also available. </p><p>  In addition to the usual features for such devices, the model allows you to display additional information on the screen: signal quality, announcements, channel data, weather forecast, and more.  The functionality is opened by pressing the INFO key, and to return to the usual broadcast mode, press the EXIT button. </p><p>  The remote also has an EPG key for the program guide.  By clicking on it, the ‚ÄúProgram Guide‚Äù window appears, where detailed information about broadcasts on TV channels is presented.  Judging by the reviews of the D-COLOR DC1302HD, most users have enough of the available functionality. </p><h2>  Main menu </h2><p>  Local sections of the menu are practically no different from similar branches of competing counterparts.  Almost all receivers in this price segment have a set of chipsets from MStar Semiconductors.  It is he who is responsible for the set of commands and the appearance of the interface.  The only thing that competitors' menus may differ is the name of the sections and more. </p><p>  The TV tuner interface has 7 sections: </p><ol><li>  Programs. </li><li>  Image output. </li><li>  Search for channels. </li><li>  Time and date. </li><li>  Settings </li><li>  System. </li><li>  USB </li></ol><p>  In some firmware, the names may be different, but similar in meaning (‚ÄúSettings‚Äù -&gt; ‚ÄúOptions‚Äù, ‚ÄúImage Output‚Äù -&gt; ‚ÄúImage‚Äù and further).  Judging by the reviews of the D-COLOR DC1302HD, getting lost in the receiver's interface is quite difficult.  Moreover, localization is not clumsy (in the latest firmware), and all sub-items are in intuitive places. </p><p>  Let's consider the sections in more detail. </p><h2>  Programs </h2><p>  Here you can edit the TV channels: change the number, block, move, create a group and change the name.  It is worth noting that the local system does not perceive the Cyrillic alphabet and puts question marks instead of symbols.  So you must enter the information strictly in Latin. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tvsat38.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="digital prefix d color dc1302hd reviews" class="if uuid-3222937" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3222937.jpg"></div><p>  There is also a task scheduler where, with the help of a timer, you can configure some tasks for recording or broadcasting at a certain time. </p><h2>  Image output </h2><p>  In this section, you can change the aspect ratio of the screen, as well as the choice of resolution.  The default is 1080 r, but if the TV set is designed for a maximum of 720 r, then it makes sense to set the desired value.  Otherwise, frame synchronization and other inconsistencies may be observed. </p><p>  If necessary, here you can change the standard of TV broadcasting in the item ‚ÄúTV format‚Äù, changing the value to PAL or NTSC. </p><h2>  Channel search </h2><p>  In this section, either automatic or manual search for programs occurs.  Here you can also change the country for reception and turn on the power supply to the active antenna amplifier, if installed.  Judging by user reviews, there are no complaints about the automatic search. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sat54.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tuner dvb t2 d color dc1302hd reviews" class="if uuid-3222938" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3222938.jpg"></div><p>  But with a manual one, it takes a very long time to mess around.  And the point is not even in the volume of frequency ranges, but in the interface.  Constantly moving on three lines in search of the optimal wave is not very convenient.  Most users believe that one of them is clearly redundant here and only interferes with normal tuning. </p><h2>  Time and date </h2><p>  These settings are automatically synchronized and depend on the selected region.  If there is such a need, you can choose the time zone yourself.  Here you can also set a timer to automatically turn off the device. </p><h2>  Settings </h2><p>  This section provides access to the choice of localization, subtitle and audio settings, as well as digital sound settings.  You can experiment with the last item, because there are enough presets to choose from with your head. </p><h2>  System </h2><p>  In this section, you can configure parental control, set a password that will need to be entered each time you turn on or change the settings, and also reset all parameters to factory presets.  There is also detailed information about the device itself. </p><h2>  USB </h2><p>  The section provides access to work with external drives.  Using a USB stick, you can play video, audio and view photo materials.  The latest firmware versions received the AC-3 codec, so there should not be any serious problems with playing files from the Internet.  Judging by user reviews, the receiver ‚Äúdigests‚Äù about 70% of the video and audio content, and rejects the rest due to the lack of codecs. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  If we take into account the responses of the owners of the console, then in general this model turned out to be successful.  Yes, it has some disadvantages, but they are more than compensated by the low cost of equipment and the reliable reception of a television signal.  So the model copes with its direct task perfectly. </p><p>  Of course, you can find more intelligent receivers in terms of functionality and capabilities.  The competitor of VVK has many such options, but the cost of the models will be noticeably higher.  So the D-COLOR DC1302HD is an excellent budget option that fully justifies its cost. </p>
