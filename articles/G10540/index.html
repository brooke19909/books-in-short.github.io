Riding a motorcycle is often a rare opportunity to shut up.  But movement in a group is a completely different case.  You can, of course, take a long trip without saying a word for all the time, but it‚Äôs not so safe and not so fun when you can chat.  For example, this will warn of imminent danger, protect each other from the wrong turn and collectively discuss local attractions.  The only problem is that good quality Bluetooth headsets are expensive.  The limited means of motorcyclist cannot afford the pleasure of attaching to the helmet a device that is 3 times more expensive than the helmet itself.  But there are more affordable models of communicators.  One of them is the Cardo Scala Rider G9x headset. </p><p>  The system provides communication while driving with 8 interlocutors at a distance of up to 1.6 km or 4-way conference calling.  Establishing a connection is very simple - an easy collision of two headsets is enough.  In addition, the model allows you to listen to music from your smartphone or built-in FM-radio, broadcast it to your passenger, as well as make phone calls.  Voice control eliminates the need to use hands. </p>

    <h2>  Ambiguous reviews </h2><p>  According to motorcyclists who used the device for many thousands of kilometers in different areas and with different interlocutors, it performs some functions excellently, and others with many shortcomings.  The differences between the Scala Rider G9 and G9x, according to owners, are that the latest model is more expensive than the first and less reliable.  Otherwise, they look like two drops of water.  The Scala Rider G9x Powerset motorcycle headset includes two sets of paired G9x devices. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Installation </h2><p>  Installation of the device is simple.  Just remove the hood and mount the microphone and speakers Scala Rider G9x.  This procedure takes no more than 15 minutes.  If desired, the speakers can be replaced with headphones that provide better sound quality.  The device has a removable removable electronic component that can be removed for recharging or when the helmet has to be left with the motorcycle.  Wirelessly connecting your headset to your smartphone or GPS allows you to make phone calls, listen to music, or receive directions from your device.  In addition, the headset can pair with two other Scala Rider models, making up a chain of 9 bikers.  Communication is also established in a simple collision of two devices. </p>

    <h2>  Ease of use </h2><p>  Working with the Scala Rider G9x is not so simple, but not too complicated.  If the helmet is on your lap, then changing songs and connecting to different people you talk to is pretty easy.  The picture changes somewhat when the driver puts on leather gloves, and his cruising speed becomes three-digit.  The placement of the buttons is not the most intuitive: 3 of them are on top and 3 are on the side.  Without visual control of which one is pressed, it is quite easy to make a mistake.  According to user reviews, they often increased the volume level to the limit when they tried to simply move on to the next song and repeatedly got in touch trying to listen to music.  And the intention to talk with a passenger sometimes ended with accidentally turning on the radio. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Voice control </h2><p>  Scala Rider G9x comes with a VOX voice control system, which is designed to ensure the execution of all commands without the need for manual manipulation.  There is support for the Russian language.  But voice recognition does not work well.  After a short use of the VOX system, it becomes annoying by the fact that it is constantly activated when a sound signal is heard, coughing or crying out, interrupting the playback of the musical composition and ongoing conversations for a few seconds, then saying Not Available.  When you try to configure the Scala Rider G9x by reducing the sensitivity, the headset begins to completely ignore user commands.  Such a reaction to beeps is unacceptable and indicates a low level of voice recognition system. </p>

    <h2>  Limited compatibility </h2><p>  Keep in mind that the Scala headset does not pair with any other Bluetooth system, while, for example, Sena and Midland can do this.  Users perceive this as a sign of arrogance, as Cardo is a leading manufacturer in the market of motor communicators.  In general, the headset is not very convenient, because in high-risk conditions it forces the user to control the motorcycle with one hand. </p><h2>  Battery life </h2><p>  This is one of the areas where the Scala Rider G9x moto headset does its best, as the battery life easily exceeds 10 hours of continuous use in one form or another.  Charging does not take too long.  It takes 3-4 hours to fully restore the battery, and 1 hour is enough for half a day of work.  During long journeys lasting more than 20 hours, you have to charge the device on the road, but this is not the biggest problem.  What really pisses you off is the inability to use the headset while it is charging.  Why is that?  The funny thing is that previous models were capable of this.  After all, it is impossible to imagine that something like this could happen with a cell phone. </p>

    <h2>  Working distance </h2><p>  Another task that the device does surprisingly well is the clear communication distance.  According to user reviews, in many cases, even after losing visual contact, you can still continue the conversation.  If the road is relatively straight, then, regardless of traffic intensity, you can safely talk with your partner while he is within a radius of 1.5 km.  And that‚Äôs great.  However, the hilly terrain somewhat impairs the functioning of the Scala Rider G9x, which, however, is quite expected.  The working distance of the headset decreases sharply in winding areas, so you should plan your formation well if you need to maintain a conversation with more than 4 motorcyclists.  The device has a small antenna, which can be turned up to ensure the maximum communication distance, although users note that there is no dependence of the reception range on its position.  In general, the owners are very pleased with this characteristic of the model. </p>

    <h2>  Reliability </h2><p>  According to user reviews, the headset is amazingly unreliable.  It may work at one moment and not work at another without any explainable reason.  In many ways, this can be attributed to an unsuccessful version of the software, since before that the device worked perfectly and without errors, which makes sense if you recall the story with iOS 8. </p><p>  Motorists who tried to maintain a constant 6-way communication, in 20 days of travel were able to achieve only less than 20 minutes of conversation.  As soon as one interlocutor joined, another immediately left.  This happened until 2 separate groups were organized. </p><p>  Connecting the two headsets seems very simple, but in practice is a big problem.  Music played from the phone is interrupted for several seconds on some days, although at other times it can play continuously for many hours in a row.  Sometimes, with a long press on the power button, the Scala Rider G9x does not turn on, and at times it functions flawlessly. </p><p>  In general, you can‚Äôt rely on the G9x.  The headset always has its own opinion, which does not always coincide with the opinion of its owner. </p>

    <h2>  Build quality </h2><p>  The design of the headset is nothing special.  It is made soundly, but the buttons are really very strange, especially the top ones.  They cause a feeling of unreliable indecision, in contrast to the expected clear and concise actions from them.  It is not difficult to install and remove the device, although it takes some time to get used to it. </p><p>  According to the manufacturer, the product is dustproof and waterproof, and many owners have tested this in practice using the headset in the rain.  Unfortunately, users complain a lot that their Scala Rider G9x is out of order even during light rainfall.  The manufacturer, of course, replaces damaged devices.  Although the headset seems durable and lightweight, users are not entirely satisfied with the quality of its assembly. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Motorcycle owners who are considering buying a Bluetooth intercom system should weigh the pros and cons.  Cardo Scala is owned by Touratech, a giant conglomerate that produces insanely popular accessories for bikers.  But the G9x was not entirely successful.  One of the reasons for this, perhaps, was the <span>complete dominance of the</span> company in the market, which negatively affected the quality of its products. </p>
