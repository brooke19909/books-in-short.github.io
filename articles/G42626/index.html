    <p>  Golovinka is a quiet and calm village.  Every year it becomes more and more popular.  The infrastructure is developing, new hotels are being built, the territory is being improved.  However, this place remains clean and peaceful.  There is no fuss, dirt and noise of big cities.  Harmony with nature and a relaxing holiday are the main characteristics of a local holiday. </p><p>  Wide pebble beaches, clear sea, crystal mountain air and pristine wilderness - these are the factors for which tourists come here.  Fans of nightclubs, restaurants and beach parties, perhaps, need to choose a resort with a more developed infrastructure, especially since there are many such in the Krasnodar Territory. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Golovinka is suitable for a quiet family vacation.  The local population is famous for its hospitality and friendliness. </p><p>  Another, no less important advantage of vacation in this village is the cost of housing, which is much lower than in more developed resort cities. </p><h2>  Morskaya Dal - hotel in the village of Golovinka </h2><p>  In the quiet and cozy village of Golovinka, Morskaya Dal boarding house (park hotel) is waiting for vacationers.  It is located near the sea.  The shore in this place is steep and high, so the boarding house is located on a hill with a beautiful seascape. </p>

Most likely, this is because the hotel operates on the All Inclusive system, which is familiar to Russians for their holidays in Turkey and Egypt.  For our country, this principle of operation of boarding houses is quite new and is just starting to gain momentum.  Naturally, vacationers are in a hurry to share their impressions, and the hotel administration, in turn, can draw conclusions for itself by reading the wishes and comments of customers. </p>

    <p>  Park Hotel Morskaya Dal (Golovinka), reviews of which are quite versatile, new.  He works this year only the first season.  Hence, perhaps, some flaws.  The reconstruction work was not completed on time, at the beginning of the season there were still workers and builders in the territory, creating inconvenience to some vacationers, who, in turn, were quick to express their negativity, leaving a review.  Park Hotel Morskaya Dal (Sochi), according to many tourists vacationing in June 2016, was not ready to receive vacationers.  The rooms had minor defects, the rooms were not properly washed after the same repair, some furniture was understaffed. </p><p>  It is worth saying that those vacationers who rested in late July, in August or in September, mostly leave good reviews about their stay in this hotel.  Yes, of course, there are some negative points, but in general there are much more positive reviews. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  In 2016, the Morskaya Dal Park Hotel (Sochi) turned out to be a rather popular vacation spot for Russians.  Reviews of tourists allow us to note the following advantages of this resort complex: </p><ul><li>  new fresh repair in the rooms, nice design; </li><li>  comfortable modern furniture, comfortable beds; </li><li>  high-quality linen, appliances; </li><li>  hearty and tasty food; </li><li>  a good assortment of alcoholic beverages (wine, champagne, beer); </li><li>  quality work of waiters; </li><li>  the territory of the hotel is also well-groomed - many flowers and trees, coolness, fresh air; </li><li>  there is a pool; </li><li>  friendly friendly staff; </li><li>  excellent animation for children and adults (almost all tourists note the work of the animator); </li><li>  a good beach - wide, there was enough space for everyone; </li><li>  reasonable prices for holidays; </li><li>  interesting excursion routes; </li><li>  television - more than 200 channels. </li></ul>

    <p>  These are the main positive points about which vacationers spoke.  Of course, there were complaints about the kitchen and everything else, but judging by the majority, the conclusions are the same. </p><p>  Almost all vacationers were delighted with the animators, especially those who were on vacation with children.  Very interesting programs, games, contests were offered, and evening discos did not let the hotel guests get bored. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Of course, it is worth noting the disadvantages of this resort complex, which, like any vacation spot, are also available.  Based on the reviews of some vacationers, we can say about the following negative points: </p><ul><li>  construction work, hotel unavailability for the season; </li><li>  some tourists are unhappy with the rise from the sea; </li><li>  lack of sunbeds and umbrellas on the beach; </li><li>  there are no <span>places for smoking</span> and, as a result, they smoke everywhere; </li><li>  the kitchen is monotonous; </li><li>  poorly arranged cleaning staff service; </li><li>  lack of Internet in the territory (only in the administrative building); </li><li>  the All Inclusive system works until 20-00, later - all for money; </li><li>  far from shops, village infrastructure; </li><li>  in the evenings mosquitoes bother, but there are no mosquito nets (fumigators and sprays do not eliminate the problem). </li></ul><p>  Judging by the negative reviews about such a vacation spot as Park Hotel Morskaya Dal (Krasnodar Territory, Sochi), almost all the problems here are due to inexperience and shortcomings of both staff and the administration.  Almost all the disadvantages can be eliminated if desired.  Also, perhaps, the requirements of vacationers are somewhat exaggerated, since this guest house is still at the level of "three stars", and not 5. Accordingly, the prices in it are for three. </p><p>  In general, Sochi, Golovinka, Park Hotel Morskaya Dal leave a positive impression of the rest.  Silence, comfort, pacification are the most valuable advantages of the hotel.  In the future, the hotel administration promises to develop this place of rest, it is hoped that this will not greatly affect the pricing policy. </p>
