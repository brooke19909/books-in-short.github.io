    <h2>  Central market </h2><p>  The main city market of Tarragona recently celebrated its centenary; it was founded in 1915 and aimed at bringing together all the shops and stores, thereby centralizing all trade.  Unfortunately, today the market is closed for reconstruction, the end of which is scheduled for 2018.  Purchases can be made in the adjacent building, where trade is temporarily moved.  If you go shopping in Tarragona, then you just need to visit the central market. </p><p>  The market cannot boast of outlets, but nonetheless, finding quality things at an affordable price is not so difficult here.  Of course, this will take time and perseverance, but the result will not disappoint.  And if you arrive in January or February, you can get to a grand sale, where things are sold at discounts of 70-80% of the initial cost. </p>
