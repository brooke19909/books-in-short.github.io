They were the witnesses of three revolutions, and some remember the city from the time of its foundation. </p><p>  Senate, Nevskaya <span>Square,</span> Uprising <span>Square of</span> St. Petersburg are fraught with many secrets.  Who is not interested in opening the curtain and opening them?  It‚Äôs good that now everyone can touch the history of the city.  After many reconstructions, changes in the appearance, St. Petersburg Square still attracts local residents and tourists. </p><h2>  Uprising Square </h2><p>  This is one of the central attractions.  The Uprising Square of St. Petersburg will never be confused with others, since the famous obelisk "Hero City of Leningrad" is installed on it.  It symbolizes the great willpower, courage and loyalty of the townspeople who were ready to give their lives for their homeland and valiantly resisted the many times superior forces of the Nazi invaders. </p>

    <p>  A separate page in the life of St. Petersburg is the metro.  ‚ÄúUprising Square‚Äù is also the name of the station.  One of the historical pages of St. Petersburg opens in the interior of the ground lobby - bronze bas-reliefs on the walls depict the battles of the uprising. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  In the past Znamenskaya </h2><p>  Previously, the Znamenskaya Church stood on the site of the obelisk, and until 1918 the area was called the Znamenskaya Church.  But due to the events unfolding in this area - the manifestations of the <span>February Revolution,</span> it was renamed the Uprising Square.  The church, which stood here, was demolished in 1930.  In its place, the new Nikolaev railway station was built, because the atheistic Bolsheviks were not particularly worried about the architectural monument.  And since ideology recognized <span>religion as an opium for the people, there was no</span> question of preserving the church. </p><p>  The obelisk, which stands in the center of the square in honor of the receipt of the title of Hero City by Leningrad, was opened only in 1985.  The best engineers of the time worked on the construction of the monument, which made it possible to establish a monolithic sculpture weighing 360 tons - this was the first work after the famous Alexander Column.  It is noteworthy that, as conceived by architects, the star at the top of the obelisk is in harmony with the ship on the Admiralty‚Äôs tower, which emphasizes the contribution of the <span>Northern Fleet</span> to the overall victory. </p>

    <h2>  History of Nevsky Square </h2><p>  It was not founded as an independent object initially.  The monastery built in 1710 for a long time had an unformed area in front of it.  Over time, the wasteland was transformed into an agora, which became the final part of the Alexander Nevsky Lavra, in honor of which it got its name. </p><p>  Over time, the Bolsheviks renamed it Red.  Again Nevskaya this square of St. Petersburg became only in 1952.  But the name no longer concerned the laurel. </p><p>  Agora was lucky to be transformed beyond recognition. In 1965, when the Nevsky bridge was completed.  Many buildings were demolished, and in their place appeared transport interchanges. </p><p>  The Alexander Nevsky Lavra is still valid today.  Nevskaya Square of St. Petersburg, contrary to popular belief, was named not because of the Neva River, but in honor of Alexander Nevsky.  Whereas the name Zanevskaya Square comes from the river. </p>

    <h2>  Senate square </h2><p>  A lawn surrounded by greenery, stone-paved territory, a heavy marble pedestal on which Peter I is on a horse.  This is Senate Square.  Nearby is the unsurpassed beauty of the building.  The monument itself is almost one of the main symbols of the northern capital. </p><p>  This is not only one of the most famous sights of the city, but also the oldest square of the districts of St. Petersburg.  It was founded back in 1704.  And it got its name after the Senate was placed on it in 1763.  Now at this place is the building of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  It is difficult to settle in the immediate vicinity of the square, as the nearest hotels are within a kilometer radius, and their cost is not accessible to everyone.  Getting from anywhere in the city is simple.  Senate Square of St. Petersburg is located near <span>the Admiralteyskaya metro station.</span>  It can also be reached by public transport or by car.  Do not neglect hiking.  The Admiralty district is famous for its magnificent architecture, as it belongs to the oldest part of the city, built under the direct supervision of Peter I. </p>

    <h2>  Former Decembrists Square </h2><p>  Senate Square of St. Petersburg has become a permanent residence of the famous "Bronze Horseman" - a monument to the founder of the city.  After the establishment of the pedestal, the agora was renamed Petrovsky, however, the popular tradition of calling it Senate won, and the new name did not take root. </p><p>  The Senate, like the Uprising Square of St. Petersburg, witnessed the coups.  Military men gathered at it and refused to swear an oath to Nicholas I. A hundred years later, in 1929, she began to be called the Decembrist.  The historical name of the Senate Square of St. Petersburg returned to itself only in 2008. </p>

    <p>  The legendary "Bronze Horseman", a monument to Peter, turned out to be not copper at all.  It is cast in bronze.  And in order to find a pedestal for the statue, I had to submit an advertisement to the newspaper.  This square of St. Petersburg is a favorite place for the indigenous people, girls make appointments here for guys whom they do not want to meet.  This is a rather original way to refuse a boyfriend, since there is no copper Peter in the northern capital. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  All three squares of St. Petersburg, which we described in this article, have witnessed a variety of coups and regime changes.  St. Petersburg itself is called the city of three revolutions, because it was from him that the beginnings of the overthrow came. </p>
