    <p>  The new complex is based on the old security and telemetry platform.  Actually, the technical and functional basis has remained the same.  Innovations affected minor structural data.  For example, in the NEW version, the VALET button appeared to enter the unlock security code.  It existed in the standard version, but in a less pronounced appearance.  The antenna for wireless communications has also undergone updates.  For her, her own connector was provided, and the organization of the interaction of the central unit with the transmitter now lends itself to some settings - however, this is more about ergonomics rather than functionality.  Plus, it is worth adding the introduction of new sensors and communication channels.  As for the first, the alarm Pandora DXL 5000 NEW is equipped with several temperature sensors with extended wires.  Communication channels are implemented through a GPS receiver with a radio signal.  The emphasis on radio modules and navigation aids is also a fundamental innovation of this complex. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Other versions </h2><p>  Improvement of the basic device could go in different directions, and the NEW system demonstrates the most attractive direction from the consumer point of view.  It relies on convenience, functionality and versatility.  But there is also a version of Pro, which can be considered as a continuation of NEW.  In this case, the developers put more emphasis on the stability of the main transmitters with an increased frequency of 868 MHz.  GPS and GLONASS navigation modules have been preserved, but where they are not needed, the system works with greater efficiency on the main radio module.  For comparison, the Pandora DXL 5000 NEW car alarm system has standard protection against third-party jamming, while the Pro version implements a rather narrow frequency corridor that minimizes the risks of third-party interference.  In addition, filtering can be manually adjusted depending on the operating conditions of the system. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2>

    <p>  The main set of components has remained the same, except for the design and external cosmetic nuances.  Each device is contained in a separate box.  The smallest box contains a keychain with a liquid crystal display.  The kit also includes several RFID tags, an auxiliary key fob without an LCD display, antennas and modular devices.  The main remote control is powered by an AAA format battery, and its range of action has increased by 30‚Äì40% on average - this indicator depends on the presence of interference in the radius of activity.  Separately, GPS and GLONASS receivers are included in the kit, and in new versions - with reduced hot and cold start times.  Equipped with an alarm Pandora DXL 5000 NEW and an accelerometer.  This device is used to record emergency situations.  That is, if the sensitive sensors do not detect signs of alarm, but at the same time certain functions of the complex were actually violated, the accelerometer automatically triggers, sending the user the corresponding signals according to the alarm notification principle. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Alarm Principle </h2>

    <p>  The communication process is implemented through a tag.  In general, the vehicle unlocking technique occurs according to the classic Handsfree principle.  The owner approaches the car, after which the alarm automatically picks up the tag signal and removes the security function.  Another thing is that there may be different approaches to the organization of interaction between the user and the system.  Like previous versions, the Pandora DXL 5000 NEW alarm is focused on the most progressive method of using the remote control for a distance.  But as an alternative and for greater reliability, you can configure the system to control the button.  That is, not using wireless communication, but due to direct contact through a keychain and a tag. </p><p>  Car alarms that work through wireless means of communication have long been no wonder.  But in this case, it is assumed that not just giving commands from a distance, but the possibility of building a dialogue with the exchange of complex signals.  Dialogue radio communication is carried out between three components - a RFID tag, a key fob and a Pandora DXL 5000 NEW microprocessor.  The manual notes that the dialog code is completely protected by an encryption algorithm that the user can configure.  This means that together with the command, a cipher is sent each time, which is processed by the processor.  Therefore, it is impossible to crack the system with a similar key RFID tags, even if they are in principle compatible. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Software </h2>

    <p>  The software is provided by the Pandora Info platform, which is managed by clients for Androrid and iOS.  The developers left the same set of software tools, not trying to expand it with functional additions, which in principle do not change the service complex for the better.  An interesting feature was the endowment of one of the hardware buttons of the central control unit with multifunctionality.  She can assign any task from the security spectrum or assign activation of pre-heating.  However, the Pandora DXL 5000 NEW car alarm was calculated not only on hardware buttons.  The instruction indicates that all functionality can be controlled through the iPhone.  Moreover, it is smartphone applications that best reflect the tracking capabilities of the alarm.  Pandora Info's proprietary programs make it possible to locate a car through Google maps without a car navigation system, get directions, save data to archives, etc. </p><h2>  Install Alarm Components </h2>

    <p>  Basic installation operations are carried out with a central control unit, antennas and an RF module.  The microprocessor unit is installed in a place isolated from external influences.  It is advisable that the case be removed from sources of elevated temperature.  Fixing is carried out by means of the fixing accessories which are included in the package.  After that, antennas are mounted for navigation and providing a radio signal.  Typically, receivers are mounted on the windshield or in the circuit of its interface with the car body.  The installation of a blocking radio relay, which is also part of the Pandora DXL 5000 NEW complex, deserves special attention.  The installation of this component is carried out together with the integrated accelerometer not in the cabin, but directly in the engine compartment.  A rigid and reliable fastening of the hardware to the body must be ensured, since this zone is subjected to high vibration loads during movement. </p><h2>  Installation of electrical wiring </h2><p>  During installation work, special attention is paid to cable lines.  In particular, the CAN bus is laid only after the power supply to the central control unit is turned off and, if possible, with the inclusion of thermal insulation.  Signaling wiring at junctions can be paired with either twisting or lead-tin soldering.  But in both cases, when connecting, it is important to attach importance to the materials of the switched cables, as well as their cross section.  A win-win option would be to use only the Pandora DXL 5000 NEW complete wiring.  Installation of lines in the cabin is carried out with complete accessories, fasteners, insulators and auxiliary fittings.  Laying places are selected with the expectation of minimal moisture and electrochemical destruction. </p><h2>  Customization </h2>

    <p>  Initially, the system is programmed in several areas of operation.  First of all, the user must configure the safe and emergency operation modes.  Next, the keyfob functions are configured, including the tasks of the universal buttons.  After that, you can proceed to the operating modes in the armed state.  In this part, you should determine which channels the Pandora DXL 5000 NEW key fobs and car alarms will interact with.  The installation of <span>GPS antennas,</span> for example, enables virtually unlimited communication.  But for fast control without delays, it is recommended to configure basic radio channels with tags. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  The system is one of the best multifunctional alarms on the domestic market.  According to the owners, the developers were able to offer a high-tech, modern, convenient to use and reliable security tool for the car.  Separately, users highlight the advantages of wireless communications, and the electrical stability of the components of the Pandora DXL 5000 NEW.  Reviews also emphasize the implementation of wireless services.  Particularly noteworthy is the software shell and the possibility of interaction between the security complex and the smartphone. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  The criticism is mainly the complexity of the system.  Although the creators have done a lot to simplify the alarm management process, the initial setup for convenient use is difficult for many.  Many note the high cost at which the Pandora DXL 5000 NEW car alarm is implemented.  Reviews say that for the same 35-40 thousand rubles.  the machine can be provided with a combined set of mechanical and electronic safety devices. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>
