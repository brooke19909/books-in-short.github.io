General instruction</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  This review will step by step describe the algorithm for setting up channels on your Philips TV.  Moreover, both digital and analog television programs.  In this case, the broadcast signal source can be an ether antenna or cable equipment.  Usually, newly-minted owners of such devices are afraid of this operation and hire specialists to carry out it for an additional fee.  But gradually performing the steps outlined below, it will not be difficult to implement it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hdtelevizija.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to set up digital channels on a Philips TV?" class="if uuid-2937882" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2937882.jpg"></div><h2>  What are analog and digital channels? </h2><p>  Before setting up the channels on the Philips TV of any modification, we will understand what format the broadcasts are currently broadcast on.  Until recently, programs could only be watched in analog broadcasting.  With this approach, only one channel could be on one frequency.  The frequency range in this case was divided into decimeter and meter.  There were 60 such channels in total, and the maximum number of programs was limited by this number.  Also, the quality of the resulting image was quite low. </p><p>  Now, an increasing number of programs are switching to digital format.  In this case, television programs are specially encoded and up to eight channels can already be on one frequency.  In addition to this, picture quality improves significantly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to set up the Philips TV to receive channels?" class="if uuid-2937883" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2937883.jpg"></div><h2>  What do you need to receive them? </h2><p>  Separately, it is also worth noting the fact that some television programs are broadcast in analog or digital format.  In the first case, you need a regular tuner.  And in the second case, the specifications of the multimedia center should include the DVB-T2 marking.  This means that the tuner in the device supports digital broadcasting. </p><p>  Other television programs in the form of a signal come from the equipment of various cable operators via wires.  In this case, the tuner must support DVB-C or DVD-C2 modes.  Again, transmissions can go both in analog format and in digital. </p><p>  As a result, the old Philips TV cannot receive digital broadcasts.  It is impossible to tune channels on such devices for the reason that the tuner installed in them can only receive analogue television programs.  But to receive digital broadcasts, you will need a prefix for decoding the signal. </p><p>  In other cases, the presence of a modern TV is enough.  You will also need a signal cable through which TV programs from the provider's equipment will be received at the input of the device.  You will also need an antenna to watch live programs. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Assembly of the TV.  His connection </h2><p>  How to set up digital channels on the Philips TV of any current modification today?  The first stage in such an operation is its assembly according to the attached instructions and switching. </p><p>  After a new similar device is delivered, it must be removed from the packaging and assembled.  Then it should be installed at the place of use.  The next stage is the supply of communications.  First we bring the power cable, which will receive power from the power supply network.  Then one end of it with a connector is connected to the corresponding socket of the multimedia system.  And the second, on which the plug is, is connected to a power outlet. </p><p>  At the final stage, we bring the signal wire and install its plug into the ANT IN socket.  With the help of the latter, the picture of television programs will be delivered to the multimedia center. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hdtelevizija.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Old Philips TV. Customize feeds" class="if uuid-2937885" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2937885.jpg"></div><h2>  Program Search </h2><p>  The next step is how to set up the Philips TV to receive channels in various formats.  This is a search for available broadcasts using the automatic mode.  To do this, just turn it on, go to the device‚Äôs main menu and select the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù sub-item.  In it you need to select the "Channels" section.  Then select ‚ÄúAuto Search‚Äù in it.  Next, you will be asked what signals the device should look for.  Therefore, you need to specify the type of connection: ‚ÄúOn-air‚Äù or ‚ÄúCable‚Äù.  We also set whether the received signal has an analog, digital, or analog-to-digital format.  After that, the system will analyze the entire spectrum and find all available programs.  It will take from 10 to 15 minutes.  As you can see, it‚Äôs not so difficult to tune the channels on the Philips TV.  Next, you need to save the list according to the scan results.  After that, you can start using the multimedia center for its intended purpose. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.philips.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to tune channels on a Philips TV?" class="if uuid-2937889" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2937889.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In this review, we explained how to set up channels on your Philips TV.  This algorithm is universal and can be used on any such entertainment system.  It is quite simple, and there should be no problems with its implementation. </p>
