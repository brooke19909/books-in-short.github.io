Mistakes in choosing a hotel should not be made.  Otherwise, the vacation will most likely be ruined and a good rest at the resort will fail. </p><p>  One of the best ways to get information about a particular hotel is to visit specialized sites and forums in order to familiarize yourself with the reviews of its former guests.  In this article, we will deal with all the details of the opinion on the Ela Quality Resort Hotel 5 * network and whether it is worth renting a place here.  We think that this information is sure to be useful to someone from domestic vacationers who have chosen Turkey for their vacation. </p><h2>  Hotel Location Features </h2><p>  The Ela Quality Resort Hotel 5 * is located 2 km from the village of Belek (Antalya Province), on the seashore.  It is 25 km from the nearest airport.  To hire a taxi in order to get to the place, some tourists who have rented a room in this hotel do not need to.  The hotel provides its guests (who have booked expensive rooms and villas) with a free shuttle service.  Of course, the presence of such a service greatly adds to the hotel attractiveness in the eyes of domestic vacationers with plenty.  In particular, a free shuttle service can be convenient for those tourists who came to rest in Turkey for the first time.  After all, looking for a taxi in an unfamiliar country, and even overcoming the language barrier, is actually very difficult. </p>

    <h2>  Aspendos Town </h2><p>  This attraction attracts guests of the Ela Quality Resort Hotel 5 * hotel, first of all, with ancient ruins and a preserved amphitheater.  According to legend, the city of Aspendos was founded at the beginning of our era as a soothsayer Pug.  Historians know that at first this settlement belonged to the Persians.  In 333, he was conquered by Alexander of Macedon.  Later, the city came under the jurisdiction of the Roman Empire.  Over time, this crowded ancient metropolis began to lose ground and gradually became depopulated.  In the XIII century, no one lived here. </p><h2>  Keprylu Canyon National Reserve </h2><p>  This interesting park is located 60 km from Belek.  The reserve is a dense forest with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã500 hectares.  In total, more than 550 species of various plants grow in the reserve (pine, cedar, cypress, eucalyptus, pistachio trees, etc.).  There are also many rare animals and birds.  If you wish, in the reserve you can buy a trip along the Kepryulu river on inflatable bots.  Judging by the reviews of tourists, the entertainment is actually very interesting.  So, many guests of the Ela Quality Resort Hotel acquire such excursions. </p><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  Thus, if you focus on the reviews of tourists, Ela Quality Resort - the hotel is really good and justifies its five stars.  Of course, like any other hotel, there are not very good reviews about it.  For example, some tourists believe that the hotel rooms have a musty smell, and the furniture in the rooms is not as new as we would like.  However, in general, tourists still had a good opinion of this hotel, and most of its former guests recommend it to their friends. </p>
