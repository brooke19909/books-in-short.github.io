What was the ruler‚Äôs childhood?

    <p>  According to legend, on August 25, 1530, at the very moment when Ivan the Terrible was born - the first-born of Grand Duke Vasily III and his second wife Elena Glinsky, a terrible thunderstorm broke out in the whole kingdom, in which contemporaries saw a bad omen.  The baby was named Ivan in honor of the predecessor of Jesus Christ - <span>John the Baptist.</span>  The name of Ivan was also the grandfather of the little prince.  His father, Prince Vasily, lived only three years after the birth of the heir. </p><p>  The court records say that the terminally ill Vasily III blessed his offspring to rule the state, and ordered his wife, whom he considered courageous and wise, to keep the state ‚Äúunder his son‚Äù until he came of age.  There is another source indicating that Prince Vasily transferred control not to the princess, but to the boyars.  This version seems more plausible, because he had no right to violate ancient traditions and centuries-old customs that did not allow women to participate in government affairs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reign of Ivan the Terrible briefly" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10953/70807.jpg" width="300"></div>  At the patient‚Äôs bed, the board was handed over to the boyars, the ‚Äúseventh‚Äù guardianship council, which was headed by the unit prince Andrei Staritsky.  Soon after the day when the Grand Duke passed away, the efforts of the boyars three-year-old Ivan was crowned.  The nominal <span>reign of Ivan the Terrible began.</span>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is rather difficult to briefly describe the thirteen years that have passed between the coronation and the wedding to the kingdom.  Ivan was an 8-year-old boy when his mother Elena Glinskaya died.  Feelings of abandonment and loneliness developed in him the habit of constantly looking around and listening. </p><p>  Ivan the Terrible, surrounded during ceremonies by royal luxury and subservient humility, in everyday life fully experienced shyness in everything, indifference and neglect on the part of the boyars and princes.  Children's hardships were exacerbated by the fierce struggle for power of the boyar groups, accompanied by killings, intrigues and violence. </p><p>  The childhood of Ivan the Terrible became the time when unattractive features of his character were formed: secrecy, suspiciousness, pretense, duplicity and cruelty. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ivan the Terrible childhood" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10953/70806.jpg" width="600"></div>  At 12, an embittered teenager tormented and mutilated animals, throwing them from high towers, at 13 gave the order to kill one of the boyars.  According to a contemporary, from the age of 15 the future tsar has a new fun - to ride with young men on horses in the streets and markets, to beat and rob ordinary people.

    <p>  Ivan the Terrible became the king of all Russia in January 1547, when a wedding to the kingdom took place in the Assumption Cathedral - a solemn ceremony borrowed from Byzantium.  The future sovereign was dressed in royal clothes during the wedding and laid a crown on him.  Thus ended the childhood and adolescence of the <span>first tsar of the Russian</span> kingdom. </p>
