You can dial 0890 at any time of the day and the operator will answer you.  You can call from anywhere.  Dialing the specified number both in the home network and the coverage area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe intranet roaming is absolutely free.  Moreover, the MTS subscription service will answer you even when your subscriber SIM-card is locked. </p><h2>  In what cases does it make sense to call </h2>

    <p>  Before contacting the Call Center, it is advisable to find out what questions you can get answers there.  So, the MTS subscription service is ready to consult all its users in case of any problems associated with the provision of services.  In addition, by dialing 0890, you can ask the operator to activate or deactivate some service, ask you to credit the promised payment, or help you figure out the Internet settings. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Before you call, consider how best to pose the question.  After all, the faster the operator understands the essence of the problem, the sooner it can be solved.  Note that the number of operators is limited, and you are not the only person who wants to get answers to questions of interest from a living person, and not from an automaton of an information service. </p><h2>  Alternatives </h2><p>  The main drawback of the MTS subscription service is the constant employment of operators.  Not many have the patience to get through.  The fact is that all calls are automatically received, but everyone who dialed a number has to wait until the operator is free.  At this time, he only hears the machine, which insistently offers to wait and stay on the line.  That is why, even knowing the telephone number of the MTS subscription service by heart, it is not always possible to contact the operator. </p>

So, in addition to this, there are several more ways to obtain the necessary information.  You can take the opportunity to independently manage tariffs and services by dialing * 111 #.  You can find out your phone number if you just press the combination of numbers 0887. But in order to find out which tariff plan you are servicing, dial * 111 * 59 # and press the "call" button.

In this case, a single number 0890 is not useful, it only works on the internal network.  If you have any questions about the operation of MTS, and there is no phone with this operator‚Äôs SIM card at hand, then you have two options. </p>

    <p>  You can find out all your questions on the official website of the company, while you can even use the online assistant.  By asking a question on the site, within 24 hours you will receive an answer to your question.  But if you want to talk, then dial the number of the MTS subscription service from your phone - 8 800 250 0890, and it does not matter which operator you have.  You can dial this number even from a regular landline phone.  Do not be afraid, the call will be free. </p><h2>  Roaming Actions </h2><p>  Often questions regarding the operation of services and billing may arise in roaming.  But many believe that calling an operator from other countries is too expensive, so they prefer to search for answers to questions on the Internet or wait for their return to the country.  But MTS thinks about its users who travel often.  It is for them that there is a special free number +7 495 766 0166. According to it, the MTS subscription service is available around the clock, and calls will be free.  Please note that if you are in the territory of neighboring states - Belarus or Ukraine - you can call the usual number 0890. In these countries, he works as usual, calls will be absolutely free. </p><h2>  Additional features </h2>

    <p>  If you want to change the tariff plan, find out the balance, make the amount of the ‚Äúpromised payment‚Äù, block or unblock the number, then it is not necessary to find out which MTS subscriber service is.  A short number is also not useful to you.  You can do all the necessary operations with the help of additional services. </p><p>  For example, managing tariff plans and the list of services provided is quite easy.  To do this, you can simply dial * 111 #.  Using the proposed menu, you can find out the status of the account, find out your tariff plan and phone number, find out which numbers are ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù.  But this number does not just provide the information you need, with it you can connect a variety of services, options, change tariff packages. </p><p>  True, the owners of smartphones and tablets, having typed the specified combination, will receive a link by which the download of the corresponding application will begin.  And users with regular phones can immediately use the menu in USSD-mode. </p><p>  You can find out the necessary information and manage the number from your personal account, for which you will have to register.  Each subscriber can also use a mobile assistant.  To do this, simply dial 111 and follow the prompts of the system. </p><h2>  VIP customer service </h2>

    <p>  If a client has spent at least 5000 rubles on communication over the past three months or is served on an Ultra tariff plan, the company provides him with special opportunities.  For privileged users, the MTS subscription service is available at an individual number 0990. It, like 0890, works around the clock, but unlike the latter, customers do not have to wait for an operator's response for more than 30 seconds.  But the specified number will work only if you call from a mobile MTS.  Moreover, a call is possible even if the balance is negative.  In other cases, it is better to dial +7 495 766 00 01. This number is suitable for calls from other operators, from city numbers and for communication in roaming. </p><h2>  Powers of operators when communicating with individuals </h2><p>  Even those who often use the MTS contact center number do not know the full list of opportunities that open after they get through.  So, the powers of Call-center operators include the following: </p><ul><li><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="MTS subscription service short number" class="if" height="303" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12301/379443.jpg?1398157126464" width="201"></div>  Connect or disconnect various services.  Exceptions are made only for such features as invoice delivery, the provision of detailed information on the movement of funds, the installation of an additional number to which data or faxes can be transmitted. </li><li>  The installation of international and national roaming and international access is possible only for those people who replenish their balance monthly on a yearly basis for the last year or six months, but in the latter case they must spend at least 650 rubles on communication every month. </li><li>  Change of tariff plans on which subscribers are served. </li><li>  Change phone number. </li><li>  Providing support for various network services. </li><li>  Connecting a subscriber number if the debt has been paid off. </li><li>  Issuance of lost PIN and PUK codes. </li><li>  Fax invoices. </li></ul><p>  If you can wait for a response from the operator, then any of these services must be provided by the MTS subscription service.  A call from a mobile phone will be enough.  You can safely complain about the actions of the center operator if he refuses to provide any of the listed services. </p><h2>  Counseling </h2>

    <p>  In addition to technical support, people answering calls to 0890 can provide you with complete information on service issues, pricing of various services, payment methods, debiting money from your account.  In addition, the operator can explain the structure and content of the bills you receive, provide details of all conversations, combine or disconnect personal accounts. </p><p>  But legal entities need to know the code word to gain access to tariff plan management capabilities, otherwise the MTS subscription service will not provide them with account information.  In this case, Moscow does not differ from other regions, the residents of the capital are available the same list of services in the contact center as people from other regions. </p>
