    <h2>  Fresh ideas </h2><p>  It is clear that fashion is a variable phenomenon.  In pursuit of fresh images and new silhouettes, designers and fashion designers resort to various tricks.  The location of the pockets, the size of the collar, the number of embossed seams, the design of the sleeve ridge, the cuff, the length of the product and other elements draw the image of the product, its style and appearance.  Proper arrangement of parts, fasteners, a properly constructed pattern that repeats the bends of the body, are the key to an ideal fit.  And even if the second thing did not sit quite well on the figure, it can be modified.  But is it possible to independently, and most importantly, how to alter a sheepskin coat?  Fashionable and stylish solutions will be very handy.  It is worth looking around or looking through outerwear fashion magazines to determine the most suitable option for yourself. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Alteration Options </h2><p>  Firstly, you need to look at the model of the sheepskin coat and determine which elements can be updated.  It can be new cuffs or a fringing of a hood.  You can also consider options that provide for the complete opening of things at the seams with subsequent inserts of natural or <span>artificial fur</span> or leather, insulated padding polyester. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cross-linked sheepskin coats before and after" class="if" height="354" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1095953.jpg" width="354"></div>

    <p>  An equally interesting option is the use of sheepskin coat material as an interior finish.  In this case, you need to pick up fabric for the top.  Given that the sheepskin coat is quite dense, the base should be made of thin material.  For this purpose, raincoat fabric or thin skin can be used.  In both cases, the result will look original. </p><p>  At first glance, it might seem that changing the style of outerwear on your own is not a good idea.  But if you figure out how to alter a sheepskin coat at home, it turns out that this process is not so complicated.  And if you try and make every effort, the result will be quite decent. </p><h2>  Difficulties and their overcoming </h2><p>  The difficulty level depends on the material of the sheepskin coat.  Naturally, for sewing genuine leather you will need a <span>furrier machine.</span>  Of course, in the home such an aggregate is a rarity.  And therefore, for the alteration of such a product, all the seams will have to be laid manually.  At the same time, they should be small steps and strong enough not to diverge.  But with the artificial material, a household sewing machine can quite cope, which greatly facilitates the work.  Not every craftswoman will be able to alter an old sheepskin coat from natural material, and it is better to entrust such painstaking work to specially trained craftsmen with the appropriate equipment.  But small alterations, which consist in finalizing small parts, can be done independently. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="alter an old sheepskin coat" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1095947.jpg" width="388"></div>

    <p>  You should also make a preliminary calculation of the consumption of additional material. </p><h2>  Work stages </h2><p>  To get beautifully alter your sheepskin coat with your own hands, you should break the whole process into stages: </p><ul><li>  tear off unnecessary decorative elements from the product; </li><li>  if necessary, undo the thing at the seams, first repulse the lining; </li><li>  to cut the trim elements of the cuffs and hood, as well as various inserts and decorative details; </li><li>  to finalize tucks and embossed, shoulder seams, if necessary; </li><li>  to notice the cuffs and other details developed for the new model of the sheepskin coat, and <span>stitch</span> them with a <span>machine seam</span> ; </li><li>  steal all joints of the joint so that the coarse parts become a single whole; </li><li>  change buttons or zipper as necessary. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="alter men's sheepskin coat" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1095961.jpg" width="483"></div></li></ul><h2>  Ideas for female models </h2><p>  For several seasons in a row, fashionistas have shone in original fur vests.  Of course, this looks like a very warm product, but, given that girls have to wear a thing over a spring jacket or a warm knitted sweater, we can only assume that in such clothes it is not very warm, especially when the thermometer creeps down.  But if you modify such a thing, then a completely comfortable fur coat will come out.  And here you should consider options for how to alter a sheepskin coat.  Fashionable and stylish solutions with fur shelves and a back and sleeves from inverted leather - a great solution! </p><p>  For such a product, you can either take a piece of faux fur under the mink or arctic fox, or connect your favorite fur coat to the alteration, which is worn out in order and even rubbed in places.  Thus, you can kill two birds with one stone and get an excellent little thing for the winter cold. </p><p>  Another stylish option is a striped coat made of sheepskin and fur material.  Here it will be necessary to spread the sheepskin coat and cut all the details, evenly removing strips of 10 cm in size, in place of which to sew identical pieces of fur. </p><p>  How do cross-linked sheepskin coats look before and after?  The answer to this question lies in the professionalism of the master.  Of course, such a project will not be able to be mastered by a person who has never operated a sewing machine and didn‚Äôt cut things on his own, because the basics of sewing and cutting are necessary for such an alteration.  However, you definitely need to fantasize over the future style of the thing before giving it to the workshop. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to alter a sheepskin coat at home" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1095964.jpg" width="384"></div>

    <h2>  Ideas for Male Models </h2><p>  Men are less capricious in choosing clothes and often wear purchased things, as they say, to the holes.  And if you want to alter a male sheepskin coat, then, most likely, because it completely lost its appearance.  And here are a few options.  It is clear that inserts made of artificial or natural fur for solid outerwear of the stronger sex are not an option.  But still, the appearance of a sheepskin coat can be transformed if you sew a cover for it in the form of a thin windbreaker from raincoat fabric or denim.  In the case of the latest material, you can even achieve the result in the form of parks popular this season.  The patch pockets on the buttons, the cord on the belt and on the bottom inserted into the inner drawstring, the hood with fur interior trim - and the updated jacket is ready to wear.  And so that the top layer does not move, it needs to be fixed in the armholes and neck. </p><p>  Thus, a warm jacket with fur inside and with a fabric base on the outside will come out, which even if it gets wet, it will be imperceptible, since the product has its own secret, which outsiders do not need to know about.  And to do such a thing, you just need to choose the most acceptable option for how to alter a sheepskin coat. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to alter a sheepskin coat" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1095963.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Fashionable and stylish solutions for children </h2><p>  In the case of children's sheepskin coats, you can also work, especially if they are made of natural material.  As a rule, a child wears such things for a couple of years, and then grows up, and as if by magic, the sleeves become small, and the sheepskin coat itself is more like a jacket.  But in view of the fact that, according to the standards used in factories, things are usually sewn quite wide, this fact can be very useful. </p><p>  If the thing is wide enough and only a little short, why not add it with mink fur?  Even if artificial, but if you make a frill of fur around 10 cm wide around the cuffs, hem and hood, then the child will be able to show off in a beautiful fur coat for a couple of years.  Of course, this option is more acceptable for girls, but for boys you can try the option with a jacket-parka. </p>
