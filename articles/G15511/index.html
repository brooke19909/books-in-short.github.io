    <p>  The result of any activity is the sale or sale of goods and services for profit.  Any society is built on the production of material goods using available resources, and their distribution.  <span>The essence of marketing</span> consists precisely in the rational distribution of goods and services, the search for new <span>distribution channels</span> and the study of patterns of customer behavior. </p><p>  Marketing can be a certain concept or a specific model of behavior, that is, a way to put it into practice. </p><p>  There are several concepts of this science.  Each scientist in the field of economics gives his own assessment and in his own way defines the role of marketing.  If we summarize these values, we can say that this is a set of methods, techniques and institutions that implement them, to bring proposals to the specific consumer who needs them. </p><p>  The essence of marketing is the implementation of all types of labor aimed at <span>promoting goods</span> or services to the buyer.  Available values <span>(goods and services)</span> are contributions to this process.  And customer satisfaction is considered the end result. </p><p>  The following <span>marketing goals are</span> distinguished: </p><p>  1. A thorough study of the desires and needs of potential consumers. </p><p>  2. Orientation of goods and services to the needs of customers. </p><p>  3. Conducting promotions in order to bring information about the product and services to the consumer.  Here, special attention is paid to interest and force to make a purchase. </p><p>  4. Delivery of goods to the places with the greatest demand exactly at the time when it is necessary.  The quantity of goods or services and their price should also correspond to the needs of consumers. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The essence of marketing lies in the implementation of planning, control over the budget and performance. </p><p>  Its main principles include: </p><p>  1. Market research, needs, demand before making production decisions. </p><p>  2. Fulfillment of the necessary requirements that will correspond to modern requirements and the market situation.  Production should focus on the needs of the consumer and be able to rebuild in connection with the emergence of new factors. </p><p>  3. Influence on the choice of the buyer and the entire market using special tools.  Here, an important role is played by advertising as a means of influencing the consumer. </p><p>  The essence of marketing has changed depending on the period of development of production processes and market relations.  There are several stages. </p><p>  Initially, the activity was based on the development of product orientation.  That is, the <span>quality of goods</span> and services was improved without taking into account demand and needs. </p><p>  Then the manufacturers began to focus on marketing products through advertising, long-term planning and other methods.  This is a marketing orientation. </p><p>  This is followed by a market concept, which is associated with improving the quality of goods and services against the backdrop of high demand. </p><p>  And finally, the last decades have been marked by the flourishing of a marketing orientation, which implies the use of all the methods necessary to influence the consumer in order to increase demand. </p><p>  The following types of modern marketing are distinguished: </p><p>  Social marketing studies the political and social factors that influence demand. </p><p>  Consumerism focuses more on consumer protection. </p><p>  Behavioralism takes as a basis the psychological model of customer behavior. </p><p>  <span>Strategic marketing</span> is one of the most popular areas.  All factors affecting demand are taken into account here.  These include not only external manifestations, but also internal reserves and capabilities of the company. </p><p>  Each of these areas aims to study the demand and desires of consumers. </p>
