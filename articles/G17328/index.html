  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Modernity and learning technologies</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The education system around the world is very conservative.  Learning technologies have not changed much since Herbart, who proposed a class-lesson system.  This system, as well as the lesson schemes proposed by the same Herbart, are still adhered to in <span>modern schools</span> . </p><p>  The content of the educational process, of course, has changed, and new <span>teaching aids</span> have appeared <span>,</span> but the paradigm adopted in the 19th century, which can be described as ‚Äúa teacher - a textbook (which in modern understanding means the whole system of teaching aids) - a student‚Äù, has remained unchanged, and it is unlikely that anything new will be possible in this regard in the near future - an established system is too familiar. </p><p>  Thus, it can be said with full responsibility that all very often-heard statements that a student should turn from a learning object into a subject of the educational process remain only statements that are not put into practice. </p><p>  Nevertheless, some new teaching technologies are gradually beginning to penetrate the educational process.  Despite the fact that a teacher who received a diploma about 150 years ago, today could enter the classroom and calmly conduct a lesson (according to the American teacher Connie Stout), the teaching technologies that have appeared recently have nevertheless changed enough in the educational process many. </p><p>  The role of the school as the main, basic link in education is extremely great in modern society.  It‚Äôs just that a rather paradoxical situation is emerging when the school, which should most sensitively respond to all the needs of modern society, remains conservative and does not allow scientific and technological progress into its walls.  This means that teaching technologies remain largely unrefined, as they often do not find a response in the hearts of teachers. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Still, modern teaching technologies at school are slowly penetrating the educational process, since today almost all developed countries have realized that it is absolutely necessary to radically reform educational systems.  And this must be done precisely so that a university student or a school student in fact becomes the main figure in the educational process, so that banal teaching finally turns into a process of active learning. </p><p>  Moreover, many famous people believe that the strength of the knowledge gained at school does not matter much, since this knowledge becomes obsolete even sooner than the student has time to learn it.  That is why it is possible to declare with full responsibility that the traditional education system is extremely ineffective, because it provides an outdated, extremely averaged, but no one needs a set of information that a school or university student forgets shortly after graduation. </p><p>  It is much more important if young people who come to the economy will be able to independently work with information, improve their knowledge and acquire new ones, and in various fields, and even master, and completely independently, new professions, because these skills are now needed for success in work and activity.  As for the basic school knowledge, this can be said in the words of one school physics teacher: ‚ÄúThere is no need to know the formula.  Knowing where to find them and how to use them is much more important. ‚Äù </p><p>  And the teaching technologies in elementary school also need to be improved, since the ‚Äúnew‚Äù methods of teaching in elementary school, planted ‚Äúfrom above‚Äù and consisting in drawing circles in school notebooks, like some ‚Äúreforms‚Äù carried out by the Russian Ministry of Education and Science, may well lead to complete "Debilitation" of modern education. </p>
