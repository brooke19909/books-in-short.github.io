    <p>  Book your hotel in advance so that the next day guests can regain their strength - enjoy a walk in the woods or visit the pool. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Sofrino is a hotel whose management does not cease to strive for the best.  This can be judged by the reviews of vacationers.  Even 3-4 years ago, negative reviews prevailed, which spoke about poor quality of cleaning, rusty water, poor heating in winter. </p><p>  Today Sofrino welcomes guests with an updated number of rooms and a magnificent sports complex.  Friendly staff and animators will make your stay comfortable and interesting.  Of course, it has not done without comments yet - most of all the guests are dissatisfied with the high prices for accommodation, but for vacation homes situated near Moscow this is quite an ordinary complaint. </p>
