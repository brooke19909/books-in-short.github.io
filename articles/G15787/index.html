  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Currency operations of commercial banks. Other operations of commercial banks. Concept and essence.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  According to the legislation of the Russian Federation, foreign exchange operations of commercial banks must go exclusively through the Central Bank of Russia or through banks of a certain type that are licensed to conduct such operations.  Operations on the sale and purchase of foreign currency carried out by Russian organizations outside the above banking institutions are illegal.  Thus, residents who have a certain form of ownership are required to credit foreign currency to bank accounts, which is obtained as a result of foreign economic activity. </p><p>  Foreign exchange operations of commercial banks and securities are divided into current and operations due to capital turnover.  Foreign exchange operations of commercial banks of the current type take the following forms: transfers to and from our country of currency for performing settlement transactions without deferring payment on the movement of goods, services and works, providing loans for more than six months, transfers of non-commercial purposes to and from our country, plus transfers of amounts, alimony and other property.  Foreign exchange operations of commercial banks, which are caused by the movement of capital, contain direct investments and portfolio investments.  In addition, transfers in payment of the owner’s eligibility for non-residential property, as well as other operations that are not current.  Foreign exchange operations of commercial banks are carried out by residents without restrictions, which is facilitated by the resolution of currency legislation.  But only those financial institutions that have special permission have this right.  As for non-residents, they have the right to have a current account in the currency of a foreign country and in the currency of our country, they also have the right to unlimited transfers and imports of valuables in foreign currency in the Russian Federation when following the borders of <span>customs control,</span> as well as to acquire and sell foreign currency and the currency of our country. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>Cash operations of a</span> commercial bank take place upon receipt of a license.  Note that the main customers of commercial banks remain individuals and legal entities.  Organizations in the form of legal entities have the right to draw up an agreement with a bank for a settlement-cash type service.  All the above <span>activities of a commercial</span> bank are carried out in accordance with the standards for the implementation of cash work.  That is, in order to fully service customers of a commercial bank, it is necessary to create cash nodes in the bank. </p><p>  Cash nodes have the following contents: cash desks, cash-type cash desks, currency cash desks, evening cash desks, cash advance cash desks, cash counting and cash counting cash registers.  In addition, cash elements of the bank can be built outside its limits.  Of course, they are created if the bank has a special license.  The equipment and arrangement of cash register units must comply with safety requirements and basic rules. </p><p>  <span>Deposit operations of a</span> commercial bank are determined by attracting deposits of the population.  Thus, a contribution can be considered funds that are in the form of cash or non-cash property, in Russian or foreign currency, which are handed over by the clients to the bank for safekeeping under the specified conditions, are determined by the credit institution itself.  Usually, deposit conditions are similar in different commercial banks.  The essence of the deposit of commercial banks comes down to the fact that this is the main type of operations of such banks of a passive nature, based on this, deposits are the main resource for conducting operations of credit active type. </p>
