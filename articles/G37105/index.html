    <h2>  Phuket </h2><p>  This is a popular, diverse and very controversial place.  Some consider it quite respectable for families with children, others - lecherous and indecent.  Therefore, in order not to get into a mess, experienced tourists are advised to find a place on the island to taste.  If you like hanging out, having fun, taking a walk at night and having fun in full, Patong is right for you.  It offers typical budget hotels in Thailand, which are far from the sea, but close to restaurants, clubs and shows.  Active lovers of water sports and diving - welcome to Karon.  And if you are a fan of nature, solitude and "island paradise", then it is better to choose Kamala.  Well, those who like the sea and beautiful beaches, where there are not very many people and you can freely find a place in the sun, go to the west of the island.  In the south there are boutique hotels for romantics and honeymooners.  In the west is Naithonburi Beach Resort 4 *.  The map of the island shows us the place where the bay and the beach of the hotel are located.  This is just the west coast, located in relation to the ocean in an ideal place - the sea here practically does not recede. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Naithonburi beach resort 4 map" class="if" height="477" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/538865.jpg" width="261"></div>

Unless the local "fives" are much more expensive than the rest.  On their territory there are usually exclusive restaurants, entertainment complexes, shops - in a word, everything that tourists need.  Only here the prices there are often sky-high.  These hotels are located on the outskirts, and getting to the center from them is usually problematic.  Some of the "fives" even practice the all-inclusive system so that customers do not complain that far from restaurants.  All of them are beach - that is, only a small road separates them from the sea.  The "fours" (including Naithonburi Beach Resort 4 *, the photo of which you see as an illustration) are not much different from the "fives" except at a lower price and democracy.  They are also not located in the center of the resort, and they are chosen by people who are not the first time coming to Thailand and wanting to enjoy its sea, nature and paradise life without any interference.  Far from the hustle and bustle, in peace and quiet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Naithonburi beach resort 4" class="if" height="215" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/537710.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The hotel is located in the northwestern part of the island, near the airport, in the village of Knighton.  If you settled in Phuket Naithonburi Beach Resort 4 *, then this means that you do not have to face many problems awaiting tourists arriving on the island.  Firstly, this hotel is located directly on the beach, and you will not need to go to it through the entire resort village or go by very expensive transport.  Secondly, it is located in the small bay of Naithon Buri, where in addition to it there are several more hotels.  Very close is the five-star hotel ‚ÄúPulman‚Äù.  Therefore, you will feel very comfortable here, and not like in the city hotels of Phuket and on the crowded streets of the resort village.  Of course, it takes forty minutes to go to Patong, but to some extent this is even a plus.  Tourists believe that such a location of the hotel creates an atmosphere of relaxation on the island.  In addition, there are minimarkets, cafes and restaurants not far from the hotel (on both sides of it), so you won‚Äôt feel far from the holiday of life.  It is not far from the airport - just ten or fifteen minutes by transport.  If you want a nightlife, then you can get to Patong or Phuket Town by taxi.  True, this can be a little expensive.  But a couple of times still recommend a trip. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Thailand Naithonburi beach resort 4" class="if" height="215" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/537719.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <h2>  Food at Naithonburi Beach Resort 4 *: traveler reviews </h2><p>  Guests are pleased that this hotel has adopted three food systems.  This is breakfast, half board and FB.  That is, you can take another lunch and dinner.  But many <span>hotels in Phuket</span> offer exclusively included in the price breakfast.  The main restaurant of the hotel is The Jasmine Rice.  It has excellent Thai cuisine, although you can order more familiar dishes.  In the lobby there is a cozy bar with good cocktails.  There is live music every day - you can just come here, sit down at a table or even lie down on a sofa and listen.  The Chaolai Bistro is on the beach, as well as a cafe with snacks.  And the products of the Nyton Delhi bakery are simply of the highest class.  Some gourmets go to Thailand solely for the sake of the cuisine.  Naithonburi Beach Resort 4 * - a place for them.  Breakfast here is of excellent quality and varied.  There is soup and Thai rice with shrimp or chicken, and stewed vegetables, bacon and ham with omelet or scrambled eggs, stewed vegetables, sausages, pancakes, salads, pastries, snacks, yogurts - all that your heart desires.  Other Phuket Quartets mainly offer three types of food to choose from.  You can order any food from neighboring restaurants directly to your room.  During the day, the hotel bakes pizza at prices no higher than in street cafes.  You can always find what to eat for children.  By the way, tourists in their reviews advise those who prefer restaurant cuisine to have dinner at the hotel - the prices here are about the same or even lower, and the quality of the food is not inferior. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Hotel Naithonburi Beach Resort 4 * has its own coast.  Not every Phuket hotel of even the highest category can boast of this.  The sea is fifty meters from the rooms.  This <span>is Knighton Beach.</span>  Of course, it is across the road, but there are practically no other options in Phuket.  Sun loungers, umbrellas, sunbeds, swimming boards and kayaks - all this is free for guests.  Drinking water is available in any quantity.  Surfing facilities are available on the beach, there is a diving school.  On request, they will arrange a chic fishing trip - you will see for yourself what you can catch in the local waters.  Fishing rods and boats will give out.  And the catch will be fried in a cafe. </p><p>  At Naithonburi Beach Resort 4 *, the beach is just perfect for vacationers.  It is long, about one kilometer.  The sea is very clean, very few people.  To understand what a bonus it is, you just need to take a ride on the famous <span>beaches of Kata</span> or Karon, crammed with people "to the eyeballs", with paid (and expensive) sunbeds.  On the beach, you can safely leave your things and go to dinner without worrying that someone will steal them.  True, lately, loungers have been removed from the sea in Thailand, so most vacationers are lying on towels.  And most importantly, there is practically no ebb, which is very important. </p><p>  To the left and right of the beach are cliffs where you can dive with masks and watch the fish.  In addition, the hotel has several good outdoor pools with decoration in the form of elephants, letting water flow from the trunk.  One of them with a sandy bottom.  It has an island in the middle.  Around sunbeds, umbrellas, a sunbathing terrace.  You can swim in a large pool as much as you like and whenever you want.  In addition, there is a jacuzzi. </p>
