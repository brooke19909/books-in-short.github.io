    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The nearest international airport, accepting flights from many cities of Russia, is located in Antalya.  It is only 126 km or 2 hours from the Gunes Suntime Hotel (Alanya) along an excellent asphalt highway.  Basically, all tours to this hotel provide a comfortable shuttle service.  The problem may be that sometimes tourists travel to different hotels with one bus, so travel time is stretched.  If a transfer is not provided for the tour, you can order a taxi at the airport yourself or take the shuttle bus.  There are a lot of them from Antalya to Alanya, both direct and passing.  Travel time is a little over 2 hours.  Ticket price - from 10 dollars.  Near Alanya, just 40 km or a 30-minute drive, lies the town of Gazipasa.  There is also an airport there, but direct flights from Russia there are not operated there, only with a transfer in Istanbul. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gunes Suntime Hotel 3" class="if" height="306" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/742521.jpg" width="437"></div>

    <h2>  Gunes Suntime Hotel (ex Gunes House Suntime Hotel) 3 * </h2><p>  Across the street from Gunes Suntime is a subsidiary of Gunes House.  In some brochures, it is declared as a four-star, but this is the usual three, only new.  They have one owner who does not prevent guests from using the bars, pools and other services of both hotels.  Many tourists, arriving at Gunes Suntime, are asked to relocate them to Gunes House, which is done without hindrance.  The rooms here are more spacious, the furniture and appliances are newer, the bathroom has shower cabins, but there are no refrigerators either.  The rooms are cleaned daily.  The quality of cleaning depends on the integrity of the maids.  Some make up beds, wash floors, wipe dust, others only take out the trash and change towels.  Such a problem exists in the Gunes Suntime Hotel 3 *.  Reviews of tourists who came to different maids are different.  In some, there are complaints about cleaning. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gunes Suntime Hotel ex Gunes House Suntime Hotel 3" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/742534.jpg" width="494"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  In brochures, it is sometimes indicated that Gunes Suntime Hotel 3 * has two restaurants and two bars.  However, its guests eat at the Gunes House.  Breakfast here is not as varied as in the "five", but everyone has enough.  The menu includes several types of cereal, eggs (boiled or scrambled eggs), sausages, ham, vegetable salads, milk and milk soups, fruits, pastries, cereals, cheese, tea, coffee, cottage cheese.  For lunch and dinner there are always several types of dishes from potatoes, chicken or turkey, rice, pasta, many salads, snacks, there are fish and seafood, hot dishes, sweets, cakes, pastries, seasonal fruits, juices.  The bars of both hotels offer soft drinks (fanta, cola, water) and alcoholic drinks (beer, vodka, gin, white and red wine).  It is in bottles and barrels, from which you can pour as much as you like.  Drinking water is in coolers, you can pour it in containers and take with you to your room.  If you believe the reviews of people resting here, in the hotel restaurant no one watches how many people ate what, no one measures portions and does not prohibit taking an additive of both food and drinks.  On the one hand, this is wonderful, but on the other hand, if you arrive late in a restaurant, the dishes that most vacationers like may not be enough. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gunes Suntime Hotel 3 pics" class="if" height="272" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/742522.jpg" width="471"></div>

The proximity of dozens of outlets will appeal to shoppers.  In the reviews, people write that here you can profitably buy leather products (jackets, coats), shoes, bags, summer clothes, but you need to be able to bargain, since initially sellers inflate prices by about 3 times.  Once a week, a large market operates on the street adjacent to the hotel.  Closer to the center there is another bazaar where you can also make profitable purchases.  The most popular among Russian tourists are the shops "Waikiki", "Rodi Mood", "De Facto", YKM, and the supermarket "Migros". </p><p>  In addition to shopping, tourists are waiting for exciting excursions.  You can buy tours from tour operators or on the street from private traders.  Jamal is especially popular.  He is a professional in his field, and his tours are 2-3 times cheaper than in a hotel.

Sun beds and umbrellas here cost from 2 to 4 lire per day (depending on the season), but you can buy a beach pass at the hotel.  Then everything will be cheaper.  By itself, this beach is not bad, sandy, with a gentle entry into the water.  However, the depth where you can comfortably swim begins far from the coast.  Sunset at sea, although gentle, but along the way there is a strip of stones about a meter wide.  The water in the sea here is not quite transparent, and after stormy weather, algae float in it. </p><p>  Many tourists prefer to relax on the <span>beach "Cleopatra".</span>  There you can walk in about 30 minutes, or you can drive in 2 lira by dolmushka.
