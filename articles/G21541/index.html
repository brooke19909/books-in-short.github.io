    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  A great advantage for travelers planning a vacation in Paphos itself or its environs is the fact that the city has its own airport.  Several Russian and European air carriers make regular flights here.  Queens Bay Hotel is about 20 kilometers from Paphos Air Harbor.  So after landing at the airport on the way to the hotel, it will take you no more than half an hour.  It is very convenient, especially for those tourists who travel with children.  You can get to the hotel from another <span>airport in Cyprus,</span> located in Larnaca.  However, in this case, the road will take more than two hours, since this air harbor is 120 kilometers from Paphos.  Therefore, if possible, it is better to choose a flight directly to Paphos air harbor. </p><h2>  Description and photos of the hotel "Queens Bay" (Paphos, Cyprus) </h2><p>  Queens Bay first opened its doors in the last century.  However, in 2005 it underwent a massive renovation, so today it is a modern and well-decorated hotel, equipped with everything necessary for comfortable accommodation of tourists.  Queens Bay 3 * Housing Facility (Cyprus) includes two hundred standard and family rooms.  From the windows of most of the rooms, guests can enjoy the sea.  The windows of the remaining rooms overlook a very picturesque banana plantation.  The hotel has a restaurant, a bar, swimming pools, a sun terrace and a gym.  This hotel is perfect for a relaxing family vacation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  As for the Queens Bay Hotel 3 * rooms, our compatriots described them as quite spacious and pleasantly decorated.  The furniture here is comfortable and in good condition.  The technique is all new.  Experienced travelers recommend, if possible, checking into a room with windows facing the sea, as the view will be magnificent.  There were no complaints about cleaning the rooms, as well as changing linen and towels, since all these procedures were carried out regularly. </p><p>  The hotel area, according to tourists, is small.  It has everything you need (pool, sun terrace, gym, restaurant, bar), but there is no place for walking.  Loved the guests own hotel beach.  It is sandy and very clean.  The entrance to the water is gentle.  In addition, there are almost no waves, so this beach is perfect for tourists with children, as well as for those who can not swim. </p><p>  As for food at Queens Bay Hotel, in general, our compatriots were satisfied with its level.  So, despite the fact that some of the breakfasts seemed a little monotonous, lunches and dinners compensated for this drawback, as the guests were offered a very wide selection of meat and fish dishes, fresh vegetables and fruits, as well as desserts.  Those who paid half-board at the hotel went to dinner at nearby restaurants, where, according to them, you can eat delicious food at an affordable price. </p><p>  An extremely pleasant impression was left among tourists and the hotel staff.  So, our compatriots were pleased with the fact that despite the fact that most of the guests consist of English and other Europeans, almost all hotel staff speak Russian.  Thus, you will not have any communication problems here.  In addition, the staff at Queens Bay Hotel is very pleasant, friendly and always ready to help. </p><p>  As a conclusion, we say that, according to tourists from Russia, this hotel is perfect for family people with children, as well as older travelers who want to spend an excellent vacation in a peaceful place just a stone's throw from the sea.  For young people who are accustomed to noisy fun in nightclubs, this hotel may seem boring. </p>
