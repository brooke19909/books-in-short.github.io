Description and photo</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Afghanistan, as well as all countries, has its own state monetary unit.  Currency <strong> </strong>  received the name of the country - Afghani.  Currently in use are banknotes and coins.  One afghani equals 100 pools.  Interestingly, the use of debit and credit cards in this country is almost impossible, since ATMs where you can withdraw cash or pay off debts are located only in Kabul.  <span>The history of Afghan</span> money is quite interesting.  We invite the reader to read it. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  Afghanistan (AFN) was introduced in the twenty-sixth year.  But until 1927, the Indian currency was used in Afghanistan.  The first Afghan money was minted in the form of a silver (900-th test) ten-gram coin.  Then, until the seventies, the monetary units of different states were used in everyday life.  Afghanistan became the only official currency in 1978, after the entry of Soviet troops into it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="afghanistan currency" class="if" height="253" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1512855.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The first banknotes began to be issued by the National Afghan Bank in 1935. Then, the "Yes Afghanistan Bank" was established.  And in 1939, the latter began to issue new national banknotes.  In both banks, before World War II, banknotes were freely exchanged for silver.  After the April Revolution, the money of Afghanistan was printed in the Soviet Union.  In the nineties, Afghanistan used the services of Russia in this matter. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Afghanistan is the national <span>currency of the</span> state of <span>Afghanistan.</span>  <span>The currency that</span> circulated in the country before the withdrawal of Soviet troops from it lost its strength in 1991, but was still in circulation for some time.  During the period of anarchy, various Afghans were used in the country.  And until 2002, 2 types of currency were more and more approved in circulation: government pressure and general dostumi.  Outwardly, they did not differ much.  But the general currency was priced somewhat cheaper. </p>

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  Today in circulation are coins of three denominations - 1, 2 and 5 Afghani.  They replaced the old paper notes.  All coins have a common design.  On the front side, in the middle, is the emblem of the country.  It is depicted in the form of a mosque, which is surrounded by a wreath. </p><p>  The Muslim temple is facing the department and the prayer niche to Mecca.  Two flags are located diagonally on opposite sides of the mosque.  The denomination is indicated in the center of the reverse, below is the year of issue of the coin.  The inscription ‚ÄúCentral Bank of Afghanistan‚Äù in Pashto is engraved at the top.  Externally, the coins have slight differences: </p><ul><li>  diameter; </li><li>  edge (rib); </li><li>  material from which they are made. </li></ul><p>  Afghanistan is the national currency of the state of Afghanistan.  1 unit currency is minted from copper-clad steel.  It has a smooth edge.  In a coin with a face value of 2 units, copper is replaced by nickel.  5-unit afg is minted in brass and with a grooved edge. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="money of afghanistan" class="if" height="258" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1512856.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Banknote design </h2><p>  Afghan banknotes are made from special paper containing <span>watermarks.</span>  They depict a mosque.  To the left of the bills is a protective thread.  According to Islamic customs, portraits on banknotes cannot be printed, as this violates the commandment, which sounds like the biblical "Do not get yourself an idol."  Above and below, the bills are decorated with national ornaments on both sides.  On the reverse is a frame.  Above is the emblem of the bank.  The banknotes mainly depict various mosques and the Sultan's tomb. </p><h2>  Exchange rates in the state of Afghanistan </h2><p>  The Afghan currency under the Taliban exchanged up to 85,000 units for one US dollar.  In 2002, the course was already 40,000 to one.  After the change of government, the ratio changed by 14,000 to one.  In December of the same year, a monetary reform was carried out and, as a consequence, the denomination of Afghanistan.  The country's leadership began to print money in Germany.  The exchange of the old currency for a new one lasted 2 months.  By the end of 2012, the Afghan exchange rate against the euro was 10: 0.15;  against the dollar - 10: 0.2; against the Russian ruble - 10: 6.19.  Now one dollar can be bought for about 67 Afghani. </p>
