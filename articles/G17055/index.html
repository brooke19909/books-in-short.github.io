    <p>  The main drawback of the standards handed over at Dragut Point is tourists consider them to be very small.  The showers in the rooms of this class in the hotel, judging by the reviews, are quite tiny.  Their dimensions are only 70 x 70 cm. Of course, bathing in such rooms is not even too high and fat tourists are not particularly convenient.  Suite rooms in Dragut Point, judging by the reviews, unlike the standards, are quite spacious.  And the baths here are equipped with more comfortable ones.  In addition to the watering can, in the bathrooms in these rooms there is also a jacuzzi. </p><p>  Travelers also relate to the hotel's pluses that the safe deposit boxes in the rooms here can be used for free.  There are no references to cases of theft at Dragut Point on the Web.  However, to be safe, putting valuables under the castle, here, as in any other hotel, will, of course, not be amiss.  A serious drawback of the rooms rented at Dragut Point is the absence of balconies here.  In the humid climate of the Aegean coast, beach items, unfortunately, dry very slowly.  Without a balcony, this process can drag on for hours. </p><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  Living in the Dragut Point North Hotel 3 *, according to travelers, is quite convenient, including because all sorts of amenities are offered to guests here directly on the territory.  Many domestic holidaymakers are advised to rent cars in Turkey.  Having transport, you can get acquainted with this wonderful country and its rich history much closer, faster and in more detail.  Many of our compatriots rent cars in Bodrum, in fact.  For such guests, Dragut Point also provides free parking.  Bodrum guests can rent, in fact, the car itself directly at the hotel.  A car rental point is also functioning here. </p>

    <p>  This hotel, of course, has its own swimming pool.  The hotel also has a small paddling pool.  Moreover, it is equipped not directly in the adult pool, as in most three-star Bodrum complexes, but separately.  Of course, its guests and laundry can use Dragut Point.  If necessary, the residents of the complex directly on its territory are provided with medical services.  Of course, animations are held in the courtyard of this recreation center. </p><h2>  Dragut Point North Hotel 3 *: guest reviews on service and infrastructure </h2><p>  The staff at this hotel praises most of its residents.  Diligently, not only maids, but also administrators, porters, waiters, etc., carry out their work at Dragut Point. The staff of this hotel are friendly to guests, including Russians.  Regarding the development of the Dragut Point infrastructure, there are also mostly only good reviews on the Web.  The presence of parking and laundry tourists, of course, are attributed to the undoubted advantages of the hotel. </p><p>  The pool at this hotel, as noted by vacationers, is large enough.  The water in it at the same time has a comfortable temperature for swimming.  However, unfortunately, hotel employees add a lot of bleach to it.  Tourists with sensitive skin should take a closer look at the hotel.  But be that as it may, the presence of bleach in the hotel pool - this, according to some vacationers, is not so bad.  After all, everyone knows that the Koksaki epidemic periodically "rolls" through Turkish hotels. </p><h2>  Hotel disadvantage </h2><p>  The disadvantages of the service in Dragut Point North Hotel 3 * travelers living in it include only not too good and frequent animations.  Unfortunately, there are few entertainments at this hotel for guests. </p><h2>  What is the dining room of the complex? </h2><p>  This is an all-inclusive hotel for rent.  Tourists consider this, of course, a plus of the hotel.  In addition, the food itself in Dragut Point North Hotel 3 *, judging by the reviews, the residents are offered just excellent.  Meat is served daily in this hotel's restaurant.  The same goes for fish.  Garnishes tourists have the opportunity to take 2-3 varieties.  There are a lot of vegetables in the hotel's dining room.  Of course, travelers can enjoy all kinds of desserts in the hotel restaurant, as well as pastries. </p>

    <p>  In general, there are no special pickles in the dining room of Dragut Point, since this hotel is only a three-star, of course, is not offered.  But in terms of food quality, she, according to vacationers, surpasses other five-star complexes in Turkey.  As for the services in the Dragut dining room from tourists on the Net, there are also good reviews.  The waiters at this hotel are not too quick, but responsible and extremely polite.  In any case, the queues at the Dragut Point restaurant are never observed. </p><h2>  Beach Hotels </h2><p>  About the rooms, service and food at the Dragut Point North Hotel 3 * on the Internet there are basically only good reviews.  Unfortunately, tourists did not have a particularly good opinion of the hotel‚Äôs beach.  Firstly, it is very small in size.  Sunbeds, for example, are installed here only in one row.  If you put them in two, as vacationers note, people on the shore will simply have nowhere to go.  Occupying a free sunbed on the hotel beach for its guests can be very problematic.  To do this, you need to get up and come to the beach early in the morning. </p>

    <p>  Thus, for obvious reasons, guests of Dragut Point prefer to visit other beaches in the village.  For example, many residents of the hotel just walk along the seashore several tens of meters to the right.  Here is a pretty spacious and not crowded good little beach.  Tourists in this place can sunbathe and swim with relative comfort.  In any case, in all parts of the coast, located near the Dragut Point North Hotel 3 *, the sea is always clean and quite calm. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Unfortunately, there is no tour desk at the Dragut Point Hotel.  But its guests, if desired, at any time can buy some interesting trip from their tour operator or simply on the beach.  The closest attraction to the Dragut Hotel itself is Rabbit Island.  Tourists consider this place suitable for relaxing walks.  The island has a very interesting history, and just a huge number of rabbits live here.  Among other things, tourists here can feed these animals with their hands. </p><p>  The rather well-developed infrastructure of the Turgutreis village is one of the reasons for the popularity of the Dragut Point North Hotel 3 * hotel.  Guests can find plenty of entertainment for themselves at this resort.  In local cafes, for example, tourists are offered including hookah.  Of course, guests of the hotel in this town can visit bars, restaurants and clubs. </p>
