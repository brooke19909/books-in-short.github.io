Particular attention is paid to putting into practice the principle of self-accrual as such a mechanism that corresponds to the tax system of the developed countries of the world.  If a large percentage of tax payers do not voluntarily fulfill their obligations to the state, then the <span>tax system is</span> not able to successfully cope with its obligations.  Tax administration will be effective only if it is based on an understandable <span>regulatory framework,</span> streamlined work technology, as well as a clear understanding of taxpayers about what they can expect from the tax system. </p>
