  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Let's answer the question, who invented the phone?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Progress is constantly gaining momentum and every year new inventions and discoveries appear faster and faster.  Many new devices are entering our life that yesterday seemed fantastic, and familiar household appliances are being replaced with newer and improved ones.  Just ten years ago, in every apartment there was a regular color TV with a remote control, which was considered the ultimate dream, now we are witnessing the appearance of flat plasma panels with 3D technology support.  Laptops, tablet computers and, of course, phones are so firmly entrenched in our lives that it would be very difficult to imagine it without them. </p><p>  The standard of our life allows us to acquire numerous household appliances that are now filling our house, but keeping up with the change of generations is becoming more difficult, first of all, because an ordinary person does not know anything about new products. </p><p>  In the frenzied rhythm of life, it is sometimes useful to stop and look back, to turn your eyes to history, and to remember who stood at the origins.  Let's answer the question, who invented the phone?  Without a doubt, this is one of the most popular devices among those around us.  A man without him now feels literally helpless.  But not everyone knows who invented the phone, who first conveyed a few words from a distance. </p><p>  At the origins of the invention </p><p>  It's about transmitting sounds from a distance.  Under this definition, many devices fall.  For the first time, something like this appeared in China in 968.  Of course, then the ‚Äúphones‚Äù were not similar to what we see now, they were bulky mechanical devices consisting of many pipes.  A similar principle of sound transmission is used now, for example, on large ships. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another variety, known, probably, to everyone, is a ‚Äúcordless telephone‚Äù.  It can now be made from two diaphragms and a cord stretched between them.  Despite the fact that these mechanisms have nothing to do with modern technologies, they served as a prototype in which the principles that are relevant now are used.  But who <span>invented the phone</span> in the form that is used now? </p><p>  Electrical appliance </p><p>  In 1860, the Italian Antonio Meucci demonstrated a device that can transmit various sounds and speech over wires.  He even received a patent for his invention.  About a year later, a German named Johann Reis introduced something similar, but equipped with a microphone and speaker.  And in 1876, <span>Alexander Bell</span> showed the world a device called the "talking telegraph", combining the ideas of previous designs.  He is considered the inventor who contributed, but he is not the one who invented the first phone. </p><p>  In 1878, a Russian scientist and electrical engineer created an apparatus of an original design that was different from Bell's invention.  His device is considered the first Russian phone.  In the following years, many scientists worked to improve it, including <span>Thomas Edison.</span> </p><p>  But answering the question of who invented the mobile phone is somewhat more difficult, because it has become a natural continuation of walkie-talkies and other similar devices.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating something similar appeared in 1947, and the world's first model, which can be considered a mobile phone, was assembled by the Russian scientist Golubitsky in 1957, though this device weighed almost 3 kilograms. </p><p>  We can say that the question of who invented the phone does not have such a clear answer.  Many scientists from different countries at one time worked on this, and now we can enjoy the results of their work at a completely different level.  And it is so natural that you even stop thinking about it. </p><p>  Both mobile devices and ordinary stationary ones have nothing to do with what was almost a century ago. </p>
