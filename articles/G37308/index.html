It is he who makes it possible to get rid of dust and debris in such a way that he does not stay on all horizontal surfaces of the house or apartment, as happens with the usual sweeping.  And the time with this unit is spent on cleaning much less.  In order to filter out the air passing through it as much as possible, manufacturers have developed water filters.  One of the models equipped with such a filter is the LG V-K99161NAU.  Let's take a look at its main characteristics, as well as pay attention to user reviews to find out how good this model is and whether to buy it for your home. </p><h2>  What is a water filter? </h2><p>  A water filter, or an aquafilter, is a special cyclone installation that is used instead of the usual garbage bags or containers.  Its advantage is that particles in the air passed by the vacuum cleaner, under the force of inertia, fall into the water, absorb it into themselves and settle on the bottom of the tank. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mvideo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lg v k99161nau" class="if uuid-2779580" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2779580.jpg"></div><p>  As the test results show, this approach allows you to more efficiently clean the air and filter more fine dust, which usually does not stay in other types of filters.  Yes, and the maintenance of an aquafilter is easier - it is enough to rinse it after use with water, dry it - and it is ready to fulfill its functional purpose again. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The main characteristics of the model </h2><p>  This model of vacuum cleaner comes with an engine power of 1600 watts.  This is enough to do everyday cleaning at home.  The model LG V-K99161NAU is purely household and is not designed to work for a long time.  Therefore, in order for the vacuum cleaner to last as long as possible, it is recommended to take breaks every 15‚Äì20 minutes of operation so that it can cool. </p><p>  During operation, you can adjust the suction power through a regulator located on the body of the vacuum cleaner.  The peak power value is 300 watts.  When working with delicate light carpets or furniture, it is recommended to reduce power so as not to damage them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mvideo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="vacuum cleaner lg v k99161nau" class="if uuid-2779581" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2779581.jpg"></div><p>  The volume of the tank for water and garbage is 3 liters.  It is enough to not be distracted by cleaning during the cleaning of the apartment.  After each cleaning, it is necessary to rinse the tank, since it will be quite difficult to remove dried dust from it.  With the LG VK99161NAU washing vacuum cleaner, it will not be possible to leave garbage in the container to throw it away immediately before the next use. </p><p>  In addition to the water shutter, several more filters are used, as well as an output HEPA filter.  This ensures maximum air purification and prevents fine dust from entering the environment. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The manufacturer made sure that the vacuum cleaner was as versatile as possible.  In addition to the device itself, in the box you can find many nozzles designed for use in different situations.  Given that the price of the LG V-K99161NAU is only about 11,000 rubles, this is a rather interesting approach, showing the concern for future users by the developer.  They are mounted on a telescopic metal tube, which, in turn, is connected to the vacuum cleaner with a flexible hose 2 meters long. </p><div class="photo" data-original="otzovik.com" data-author=": vita-d, "><img itemprop="image" alt="nozzles lg v k99161nau" class="if uuid-2779586" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2779586.jpg"></div><p>  The main nozzles include a turbo brush designed for cleaning pet hair, a standard ‚Äúhalf-carpet‚Äù nozzle with a switch, a narrow crevice nozzle and a furniture cleaning fixture.  This kit is enough for most everyday tasks.  However, given the fact that the LG V-K99161NAU vacuum cleaner can be used as a washing tool, the manufacturer added a nozzle for washing windows, for working with shampoo, as well as a smaller version of the latter for hard-to-reach areas. </p><h2>  Wet mode </h2><p>  The advantage of this model is the ability to do wet cleaning, including washing carpets.  For this, a 1.5-liter tank is provided in which shampoo or other detergent is poured before cleaning.  In this mode, it is fed to the special nozzles mentioned earlier.  After a while, the composition can be easily assembled with the usual nozzle used for cleaning carpets.  Thus, thanks to the LG V-K99161NAU vacuum cleaner, you can significantly save on dry cleaning of rugs, since now this operation is available in home mode. </p><div class="photo" data-original="irecommend.ru" data-author=": Mermaid87, "><img itemprop="image" alt="vacuum cleaner washing lg vk99161nau" class="if uuid-2779584" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2779584.jpg"></div><h2>  Positive feedback about the model </h2><p>  In order to verify the advisability of buying such a vacuum cleaner, you should read the reviews of the owners of LG V-K99161NAU, who already had the opportunity to operate it for some time in the domestic environment.  Among the main positive points noted by them, the following can be distinguished: </p><ul><li>  Nice value.  LG was able to create good competition with other manufacturers by offering a washing vacuum cleaner with good functionality at a very affordable price, ranging from 11 thousand rubles. </li><li>  High power.  Suction power is enough to clean garbage from the depths of the carpet, which could lie there for quite a while, without any problems.  Dust simply has no chance. </li><li>  Compact size.  Although this model is larger than ordinary vacuum cleaners with a bag, it is much more compact than other washing vacuum cleaners, which makes its operation in a small apartment more convenient. </li><li>  Good equipment.  A wide selection of nozzles allows you to make the most of all the features of the LG V-K99161NAU vacuum cleaner, making various types of cleaning with it. </li><li>  Simple service.  Some washing vacuums require a rather complicated wash after use.  There is no such problem in this model: the filter is cleaned under running water in a couple of minutes. </li></ul><p>  As you can see, the vacuum cleaner has a good list of positive aspects.  However, it also has quite serious shortcomings that should be considered before deciding on a purchase. </p><div class="photo" data-original="otzovik.com" data-author=": vita-d, "><img itemprop="image" alt="lg vk99161nau specifications" class="if uuid-2779585" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2779585.jpg"></div><h2>  Vacuum cleaner negative reviews </h2><p>  Among the negative aspects, users most often note the following: </p><ul><li>  Poor shampoo hose attachment.  Because of this, it often flies or simply leaks at the junction, which greatly interferes with cleaning. </li><li>  Quite a high level of noise.  In washing mode, an additional pump for shampoo is connected, which leads to a strong and sharp noise.  Also, the sound of the vacuum cleaner is amplified as the container is filled with garbage. </li><li>  Some users at the beginning of operation encountered the fact that during the second or third use, the suction force ceased to correspond to the characteristics of LG VK99161NAU.  The problem was solved through the warranty department of the manufacturer, but this indicates a certain amount of marriage on sale. <div class="photo" data-original="www.eldorado.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lg v k99161nau price" class="if uuid-2779582" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2779582.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  This model is one of the most inexpensive among washing vacuum cleaners.  It is capable of performing much more tasks than a regular cleaning tool.  However, for low cost you have to pay with quality and convenience, and as a result, some functions are difficult and uncomfortable to use.  Therefore, before buying the LG V-K99161NAU, you should think about exactly which functionality you plan to use most.  As for dry cleaning with an aquafilter, most users do not have any problems.  However, difficulties may occur during washing. </p>
