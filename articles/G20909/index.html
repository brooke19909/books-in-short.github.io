    <p>  It‚Äôs always nice to do something with your own hands: the process and the result bring pleasure.  And if we take as material what was considered unnecessary trash and to be destroyed, taking into account the low cost of finished products, it becomes doubly nice.  So, how is a vase made of plastic bottles with your own hands?  Take a plastic bottle (preferably a cylindrical shape, any volume), scissors, glass balls or sea stones (for decoration). </p><p>  Cut the bottle so that its bottom is approximately 15 centimeters.  We will use it as a basis.  Along the entire upper circumference, measure the same thin strips and make cuts.  Bend all the resulting strips so that an even edge is obtained along the entire length.  Now begin to weave the strips together.  To do this, it is necessary to bend the edge of one strip, put it on the adjacent one and hold it under the next two.  Bend the second strip the same way, but you need to weave it with two adjacent ones and carry it under one (third).  Bend the third strip in the same way as the first, the fourth - the second, etc. Bend the last three strips under each other.  Congratulations, a vase of plastic bottles is made by yourself! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Creativity from nothing: a plastic tree</strong> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself tree made of plastic bottles" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12967/204638.jpg" width="344"></div>

    <p>  More recently, a couple of years ago on New Year's Eve, in one of the <span>cities of Lithuania,</span> residents admired the amazing building in the city center.  A Christmas tree made of plastic bottles was installed on the square as the main New Year attribute!  With her own hands she was made a beauty in the forest in the name of saving life.  It took about 40,000 plastic bottles to make it!  And we will take just a few and make a good desktop version.  It is better to use green bottles, then they will not have to be painted.  It is necessary to cut off the top of the bottle with a height of about 10 cm. Make something like a flower from this part and put the blanks one after another on the base (you can use a simple wooden stick) or glue them together.  We decorate at our discretion - and the tree is ready! </p><p>  <strong>Plastic decorations for the garden</strong> <strong><br></strong> </p><p>  Do not rush to get rid of plastic containers if you have already made a Christmas tree and a <span>vase from plastic bottles with your own hands</span> , but the ‚Äúmaterial‚Äù remains.  It can be sent to the country as a container for all-all-all.  First of all, for seedlings - this is not a secret for gardeners.  But the design of the garden from plastic bottles can be much more diverse!  We will not talk about the fact that from this material it is possible to make a convenient mobile washbasin (from containers with a capacity of 1.5-2 l) or a shower (bottle of 5-6 l), this is already known to everyone.  But did you know that such bottles can turn into a flower bed, a broom, a bag, slippers and even dumbbells! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself bag of plastic bottles" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12967/204685.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  A practical and necessary thing in the country is a broom.  In order to make it, you need to take several small plastic bottles, cut them into strips and attach to a wooden handle - you are ready to clean the area! </p><p>  Do-it-yourself making bags from plastic bottles with your own hands is also not difficult.  One has only to take two bottoms of identical bottles, sew a zipper to them, and that's it - the original bag is ready!  It is useful for storing money or any other small things. </p><p>  But do not we walk after the rain in ... plastic slippers?  This is a quick fix for those whose shoes are still dry.  Taking a pair of identical bottles (if you make slippers for children - 0.5 l each, for adults - 1.5-2 l), cutting off the bottom and half of the middle of the bottle, you can get wonderful summer slippers. </p><p>  Plastic bottles can also come in handy for athletes.  With their help, you can improve your body.  How?  Having made dumbbells from them.  To do this, you need to take four identical bottles, cut off on each neck and bottom, connect them back with electrical tape (already without the middle part).  The blanks can be filled with sand or any grits.  Connect them in pairs with covers, additionally securing with electrical tape - and go ahead, train! </p>
