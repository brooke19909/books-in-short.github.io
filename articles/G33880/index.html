    <p>  In today's article, we talk about a single marking mark, which is very important for any buyer.  We are talking about the PCT sign.  What is it and why does the manufacturer put it on the device - more on that later. </p><h2>  Certification procedure </h2><p>  Let's start with general information about why certification of goods is required, what it means.  This is a mandatory procedure that is carried out to confirm the <span>quality of products.</span>  With it, you can certainly say that a particular product belongs to a certain class of quality if it was certified. </p><p>  This stage is mandatory according to the legislation of the Russian Federation.  For example, a <span>product category</span> such as machinery is subject to certification.  Of course, this also applies to iPhones - they must also undergo such a procedure if they are sold legally.  And on each of the products that have passed it successfully, a symbol is placed indicating that this PCT phone corresponds.  What this means, read on. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Electronics Certification </h2><p>  The procedure is carried out by a state body authorized by law.  It is called RosTest.  It is this reduction that contains the icon that is applied to your iPhone.  The PCT (what this means, you already know) indicates the possibility of using the model in the domestic market.  Thus, specialists guarantee that the phone is safe, properly adapted and configured for our conditions.  In addition, an iPhone with such a symbol will last longer, and this is again guaranteed by RosTest. </p>

    <h2>  What does this sign mean on the iPhone? </h2><p>  The meaning of the logo that we describe in the article, you know.  It indicates the device has passed certification.  But you must also understand that there are a number of other points that affect the phone with and without a sign. </p><p>  For example, the price.  The cost of certified products is 20-35 percent higher than that of a simple device imported illegally.  This is because the procedure itself costs money and takes time.  Consequently, the distributor (shops) transfers these and other costs to the buyer.  He pays for the PCT symbol.  That this is the right to choose (pay more and be sure or save but take risks) is clear to everyone.  Products that are certified will be precisely adapted to work in our market, have high quality and function in the networks of mobile operators in the Russian Federation.  For this we pay more.  Of course, with phones without a PCT (what kind of models it is, it does not matter), no one can guarantee this. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Differences between devices </h2>

    <p>  In practice, you can identify several signals by which it will become clear whether the phone has passed certification or not.  The first, of course, is the symbol.  The second is the keyboard.  Devices imported in the gray way were officially released for another country.  This means that they do not always have a keyboard with a Cyrillic alphabet.  Third, domestic networks.  You need to understand what the PCT means, that it is a compliance check.  Since the same ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù can be blocked, say, for working in the network of the AT&amp;T operator operating in the USA, it is obvious that in Russia it will not work with it.  RosTest checks and guarantees that everything will work properly. </p><p>  Finally, the fourth is guarantees, which we are talking about.  Without the PCT symbol, the iPhone (which model it is, does not matter) will not be accepted for free warranty repairs by Apple official service centers in the Russian Federation.  In contrast, of course, from certified equipment.  Such measures, by the way, are being taken by the manufacturing company primarily to combat the illicit trafficking of gray devices.  True, as the reviews of the owners of the "apple" products show, even with gadgets purchased from unofficial distributors, you can safely contact the manufacturer's warranty centers, and in case of refusal to sue the center. </p><h2>  Be careful! </h2><p>  In this article, I would like to mention another important factor that you should know.  These are regular cases of online store fraud and manipulation of the PCT logo.  What kind of violations this is, one should not think for a long time: everything is corny simple.  Very often, sellers, wanting to fill the price of their product, imitate the mark on the certification device passed.  Thus, they deceive the buyer, mislead him. </p><p>  Checking whether your smartphone is officially imported into the country, or whether it is ‚Äúgray‚Äù and imported illegally, is quite easy.  Just visit the Apple website for an IMEI verification section.  Having driven the address of your device into the field, it is easy to understand what is the history of your gadget. </p><h2>  Which is better to buy? </h2><p>  And, of course, as a result, we answer the question of which model should be bought.  At first glance, it would seem that you should take certified products at a higher price.  This will give confidence in the quality of the phone, will provide a guarantee for the model. </p>

    <p>  On the other hand, it makes no sense for someone to overpay 20-30 percent of the initial cost of the phone.  After all, since the product was released by Apple, it will be of high quality in any case, and you can do without Cyrillic (especially when it comes to PCT). </p><p>  ‚ÄúIPhone‚Äù - what is it?  Very high quality device.  Therefore, you can do without Russian certification.  As for work in certain networks, you can check it using the device itself.  As soon as you insert a SIM card and start the device, the seller can smell something wrong and start his escape. </p><p>  Thus, everything, as you understand, depends on the model of the device, the seller and the price at which the transaction takes place.  Given this information, the buyer has the right <span>to make a choice</span> between the two specified data. </p><p>  Of course, if we take information about the number of ‚Äúwhite‚Äù and ‚Äúgray‚Äù phones, then in certain situations the volume of illegal sales exceeds the number of legitimate ones.  Thus, it shows the attitude of most people to the original certified devices. </p>
