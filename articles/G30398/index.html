The cradle of ancient civilization really justifies its nickname.  It seems that Rome is a separate state that allows you to find out how the ancestors of modern Italians lived centuries ago.  In this open-air museum, an incredible number of historical monuments are concentrated, harmoniously blending into the frenzied rhythm of the capital of Italy. </p><h2>  Amazing artifact </h2><p>  A curious attraction, near which tourists are always crowded, is a round-shaped marble slab with a bas-relief depicting an ancient deity with an open mouth.  The mouth of the Truth in Rome, shrouded in legends, is in the small church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin on the left bank of the Tiber.  Previously, the little-known temple was famous for its unique find installed in the wall of the portico. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.easyviaggio.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bocca della verita" class="if uuid-2536229" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2536229.jpg"></div><h2>  Several versions of scientists </h2><p>  A marble disk, reaching a diameter of two meters and weighing more than a ton, appeared around the 4th century BC, but to this day archaeologists do not represent its true purpose.  Some experts put forward a version according to which it is not a stone mask, but a sewer hatch.  Others claim that the size of the slab is too large, and most likely the decorative stone was once the decoration of a luxurious fountain.  But not one of the scientists can tell how the stone bas-relief appeared in the church. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The oldest "lie detector" </h2><p>  If earlier the marble disk performed practical functions, then during the Middle Ages, set upright, it sharply acquired mystical properties and became an important element of the trial.  In one of the 12th century ancient manuscripts, the Mouth of Truth in Rome is already referred to as a ‚Äúlie detector‚Äù that you cannot fool.  And after two centuries, the modern name is firmly entrenched in it. </p><h2>  Who is depicted on a huge mask of light marble? </h2><p>  According to one version, this is the ancient god Triton, who commanded the depths of the sea.  However, art critics believe that, in fact, the gloomy face of Neptune appears on the disc, personifying one of the elements of the world - water.  Other sources mention the gods Mercury and Tiberin.  Some experts claim that the image carved on a marble mask is a collective image of a faun or oracle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Marble slab comes to justice" class="if uuid-2536248" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2536248.jpg"></div><p>  To establish who exactly the ancient Romans depicted is now impossible.  But the inhabitants of medieval Rome believed that the plate depicts Erkol the Winner - a mythical character who could not stand the lie and cut off the hands of all who are soul-breaking. </p><h2>  Marble slab comes to justice </h2><p>  Bocca della Verita - this is the name of an interesting attraction in Italian.  The mysterious Mouth of Truth in Rome, according to most experts, is the oldest "lie detector".  The tiny church, built by the Romans, was always located near the port market Bull Forum.  In ancient times, as well as now, there have always been dishonest people who tried to deceive the buyer or, conversely, steal goods from the seller. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  When the scammers were caught, but it was not possible to prove their guilt, a marble slab came to the rescue.  The accused, who put his hand into the open mouth of the mystic deity, had to loudly declare his innocence in the crime.  It was believed that the stone mouth will bite off the upper limb if a person lies.  Thieves immediately confessed to the crime, fearing to lose a hand.  And the criminals, who did not believe in the seriousness of what was happening, took out a bloody stump.  But most often, the fear of the sinister mask was so great that the accused confessed to all sins on the way to it. </p><h2>  Demonstration Executions </h2><p>  True, in historical chronicles there is a mention of the executioner, who stood unnoticed behind the marble artifact and mercilessly chopped off the hands of liars on orders.  Therefore, it is not surprising that the fame of the Mouth of Truth in Rome spread very quickly throughout the city.  To intimidate all those who cheated, the authorities resorted to demonstrative executions.  In addition, men brought their wives here, suspecting that their spouses were unfaithful to them. </p><h2>  What do tourists need to know? </h2><p>  Not a single tourist leaves without capturing himself next to the legendary bas-relief.  Even the most famous and popular personalities did not ignore the marble slab located on Piazza della Bocca della Verit√† in the Basilica of Santa Maria in Cosmedin. </p><div class="photo" data-original="civitavecchia.portmobility.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The inconspicuous church in Rome" class="if uuid-2536231" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2536231.jpg"></div><p>  Any tourist can visit the mouth of the Truth in Rome (address of the attraction and church: Piazza della Bocca della Verit√†, 18). </p><p>  Temple hours: </p><ul><li>  9.30 - 18.00 (in summer); </li><li>  9.30 - 17.00 (in winter); </li><li>  siesta, when the entrance for guests is closed, from 13.00 - 15.00. </li></ul><p>  Taking pictures with a local attraction, which is now located outside the church (next to the front door), is free, but you have to wait a long queue.  Note that only one shot is allowed. </p><h2>  The Mouth of Truth in Rome: how to get there? </h2><p>  You can get to the tourist attraction not only as part of an organized excursion, but also on your own. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="41.8888257" data-lng="12.481481799999983" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/1/9/6/4196.png"></div><p>  Buses 44, 44 F, 83, 170, 716, 781 will take travelers to Della Boca Della Verita Square. </p><p>  And those who walk along the famous <span>Piazza Venezia,</span> where six streets intersect, will reach the desired place on foot in 10 minutes. </p><p>  The nearest metro station is Circo Massimo (Grand Circus), line B. </p><h2>  The Mouth of Truth in Rome: Interesting Facts </h2><p>  In the last century, a stone idol recognizing a lie is forgotten.  However, in the 50s, after the release of the cult film ‚ÄúRoman Vacations‚Äù with the charming O. Hepburn in the lead role, the ancient artifact with the image of an ancient deity gains world fame.  The actress‚Äôs partner Gregory Peck made fun of her: he put his hand in the mouth of the stone mask and screamed terribly, pretending to have lost his limb.  This was a real shock for the impressionable Audrey, who was really scared and almost lost her feelings.  The director did not cut the episode, and film critics called him the liveliest in the film. </p><div class="photo" data-original="civitavecchia.portmobility.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="&quot;Roman holiday&quot;" class="if uuid-2536230" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2536230.jpg"></div><p>  And now the stone bas-relief is the most popular tourist attraction of the Italian capital.  Crowds of foreigners line up to the marble disk every day to capture the Mouth of Truth in Rome in the photo. </p><p>  The famous artist Lucas Cranach the Elder on the canvas, bearing the same name, depicted a woman who puts her hand in the stone mouth of a terrible monster resembling a formidable lion. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikiwand.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bocca_della_Verit√†"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lucas Cranach the Elder &amp; quot; Mouth of Truth &amp; quot;" class="if uuid-2536249" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2536249.jpg"></div><p>  But not only the ancient "lie detector" is famous for an inconspicuous church.  Her main relic is the skull of St. Valentine, the very one in whose honor Valentine's Day is celebrated on February 14. </p>
