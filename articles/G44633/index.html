  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IPad evolution from first to last</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The evolution of the iPad affects the beginning of the 21st century.  In the mid-zero, Steve Jobs introduced the new product - the first tablet in his company, which was based on the iOS operating system.  The idea was to make the buttons virtual, located on the sensor itself.  The glass multitouch made a splash - a small square machine made it possible to print, view images, and videos. </p><p>  The prototype with the inertial scrolling function prompted the creator to introduce the function of dialing a phone number, but the idea was postponed until better times.  They returned to her only after the release of the iPhone.  And the project of the ingenious device was implemented a few years later.  Now we can observe the evolution of the iPad from the first to the last generation. </p><h2>  Apple's pioneer in nanotechnology </h2><p>  Only in 2010, the tablet was presented to the world from the apple leader.  First-generation iPad devices were different from tablets on the electronics market.  They were compared to iPod Touch, which was based on the work of steroids.  The same design, the same functions, but completely new goals and opportunities.  It was possible to taste the highlight only after the start of use: </p><ol><li>  This type of technology stood between the rows of smartphones and computers. </li><li>  The "tablet" had a diagonal of 9.7 inches. </li><li>  Resolution reached 1024 x 768 pixels. </li><li>  Performance was carried out due to the A4 processor with a frequency of 1000 MHz. </li><li>  RAM is only 256 MB. </li><li>  The modules were a choice - either Wi-Fi, or Wi-Fi- and 3G-module. </li></ol><p>  But the built-in memory could already be calculated in the range from 16 to 64 GB.  Bill Gates commented on the release of technology: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><blockquote><p>  This is a good reader of books without a stylus and keyboard, and it is hardly possible to use it fully. </p></blockquote><p>  However, the first iPad was a hit.  They bought it no worse than the iPhone. </p><h2>  The follower of the first tablet is on a ‚Äúdiet‚Äù, but with tasty features </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.lifewire.com" data-author=": Getty Images / Justin Sullivan, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Presentation of the first tablet" class="if uuid-3075729" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/84916/3075729.jpg"></div><p>  After the sensational opinions about the pioneer, a second-generation tablet went on sale.  The new iPad was comparatively lighter and cooler: </p><ul><li>  In 2011, a touch computer with a thickness of 4.6 mm less than its predecessor was presented to the world at a presentation. </li><li>  At 79 g, it became easier to see, put on a "diet", as users said. </li><li>  Internet connection modules were based immediately on 117 g. </li><li>  The processor with two cores is A5, and the frequency remains unchanged. </li></ul><p>  The cameras became an innovation - two at once, front and back.  RAM increased to 512 MB.  The model that was loved by the world was released until 2014, and the system supported updates to iOS 8. </p><h2>  Beyond the serial number: the third tablet from the apple company </h2><p>  While each iPhone was released under its own serial number, the third-generation iPad tablets lost such values.  Instead of the usual numbers, additional words began to appear in the names.  So, the third issue was simply called the ‚Äúnew iPad‚Äù: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Improved generation of technology had a unique screen created by Retina technology. </li><li>  The pixel density reached 264 compared with the "oldies".  They have this indicator limited to 132. </li><li>  Color saturation increased to 44%. </li></ol><p>  RAM reached 1 GB, which allowed the user to use the technique not only for its intended purpose - reading, watching videos and photos.  The new camera with five megapixels created a photo with a maximum resolution of Full HD.  The A5X processor made the device so fast that the first tablet was called "backward" in terms of performance.  Networks supported LTE.  Despite the fact that its thickness has increased, it still remains in demand among devices from the iPad line. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="j2oCcouUVh0" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2oCcouUVh0" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/4/2/7/4/14274.jpg"></div><h2>  A powerful analogue of the third tablet model: better, faster, smarter </h2><p>  Six months later, the developers introduced a new model.  This is the fourth-generation iPad, dubbed the richest epithet.  In 2012, the demand for the purchase rose to 87%, which indicated the success of Apple.  Brief characteristics: </p><ul><li>  Dual core A6X processor. </li><li>  The frequency reached 1.4 GHz. </li><li>  The front camera has acquired a resolution of 1.2 megapixels. </li><li>  The range of network support has grown to 4G. </li><li>  A new Lightning connector has appeared - now on all devices instead of the 30-pin standard. </li></ul><p>  Before the new year, the company sold all tablet models, and in early January 2013 a fourth tablet model with an internal memory size of up to 128 GB was on sale. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Reduced version of the fourth tablet: 2012 makes changes </h2><div class="photo" data-original="tech.co" data-author=": @shashamir, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Professional iPad 5 for business" class="if uuid-3075732" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/84916/3075732.jpg"></div><p>  Along with the release of the fourth model, Apple reviewed the iPad in a smaller version.  A more compact, convenient and miniature powerful computer, about which there were rumors back in the previous year.  Apple iPad mini - the so-called "little brother" of the fourth tablet: </p><ul><li>  The diagonal was only 7.9 inches. </li><li>  The lateral interval of the frames narrowed to the possibility of wrapping it around with one hand. </li><li>  The display remained "old", without Retina technology. </li><li>  Resolution, like the first tablet. </li></ul><p>  The model was identical in characteristics to the penultimate model, the second, only the size was slightly reduced.  Demand for it was scanty, which is why sales fell to 78%. </p><h2>  Rehabilitation Apple iPad mini - ‚Äúair‚Äù reduced four with new features </h2><p>  The prefix Air was chosen for a reason.  The manufacturer emphasized the lightness of the new tablet, focusing on functions and performance that did not suffer, despite the similarities with the miniature version of the four: </p><ul><li>  The flagship iPad in 2013 became thinner by 2 mm. </li><li>  The dimensions of the iPad Air were 16.2 mm - this is 20% less than the previous one. </li><li>  The side frames are even smaller. </li><li>  Weight reduced by 29%. </li></ul><p>  The design remains the same, apart from the subtlety and miniature.  Weight allowed to carry the device with you constantly.  The battery lasted up to 3 days without recharging, which was especially pleasing to customers.  The processor remained 2-core, but was already based on a 64-bit architecture. </p><h2>  Second Generation Mini Generation </h2><p>  Together with the Air-tablet released the same year the second version of the Mini model.  It should have arranged users more than the first miniature device.  The changes have been significant: </p><ul><li>  The design has remained unchanged, but the functions are completely improved. </li><li>  The diagonal is reduced to 7.9 inches. </li><li>  The filling of the equipment is identical except for the processor - performance is slower at 100 MHz. </li></ul><p>  Why it was necessary to reduce the already not impressive functions of the "little brother" is unclear.  However, the purchase went quite sharply - more than 90% of sales were realized in the first quarter of the year.  As it turned out later, the price fell significantly, which allowed some segments of the population to please themselves with an apple suite. </p><h2>  Top iPad tablets from evolution </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.lifewire.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="IPad tablet evolution" class="if uuid-3075731" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/84916/3075731.jpg"></div><p>  Steve Jobs's dream has turned into a fashionable flagship of our time.  He wanted to create a convenient prototype of the phone so that a person could work on it, like on a computer.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a tablet was born before the first iPhone, but Jobs decided to postpone creativity samples for later. </p><p>  If we consider the evolution of the iPad over the years, then the third model was the last in the life of the creator.  He released Retina technology, introduced new features, and maximized model performance.  Jobs believed that the only design and weight could be more important than convenience in speed and mobility.  He died a few months before the presentation of the ‚Äútroika‚Äù (or iPad mini).  The official press release was not transferred: </p><ol><li>  The interests of the company were already represented by other founders of Jobs's idea. </li><li>  Tim Cook introduced the revelation to the public - the Retina display.  The ingenious achievement of the founder. </li><li>  Gadgets were equipped with new processors, powerful and fast. </li></ol><p>  Negative residue remained with buyers after the death of Steve Jobs.  What turned his dream into?  Many believed that once a genius left the business, nothing more should be expected from progress.  Indeed, then the iPhone 5, 6 became ‚Äúbuggy‚Äù, users noted a significant discrepancy between the devices.  Bugs were detected at the testing stage, when tests for download speed were inferior to the first device.  The company suffered millions of losses without Jobs and his genius. </p><h2>  The debuted three in a mini-complete set and the advanced two "light" </h2><p>  The evolution <span>of iPad models</span> continued until the release of the third mini-iPad.  Compared to its predecessor, technically the model was no different.  The camera has changed - 8 megapixels versus 7, a Touch ID sensor in a gold frame has been added.  To excite the audience, another new model was released - the second Air.  This is the thinnest tablet that can not be compared even with an ultrabook: </p><ol><li>  The processor has been upgraded to A8X - more powerful than A8 in iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. </li><li>  Performance increased by 45% on par with the original Air. </li><li>  Graphic works were processed 2.5 times faster than previous models. </li></ol><p>  The design remained unchanged.  Two models could be distinguished only by the speaker grill and the missing sound lever.  There was no fingerprint scanner, which somewhat struck users.  The filling has changed a little, although much attention has now been paid to the functionality: </p><ul><li>  Using the scan sensor in the Home button, it was possible to enter a password code from various applications. </li><li>  Unlocking was carried out in two touches. </li><li>  Buying an application in the App Store could be done without entering a password - attach a finger and scan the fingerprint. </li><li>  The pin code became necessary only to lock the device after turning it on and off. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.trustedreviews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Characteristics and filling of the iPad 9.7 inches" class="if uuid-3075745" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/84916/3075745.jpg"></div><p>  The camera has also been updated in functionality.  You can shoot in different types of shooting - slow and fast.  Matrix resolution increased to 8 megapixels, and the screen became innovative - with anti-reflective coating.  The reflection level decreased to 57%.  Work with Wi-Fi and LTE networks has also accelerated.  The color scheme of the "elder brother" remained within three colors - silver, gold and gray. </p><p>  If you compare the first and last tablet, the difference is noticeable.  It is worth sorting out the details. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td><p>  <strong>Year of issue</strong> </p></td><td><p>  <strong>Model</strong> </p></td><td><p>  <strong>Options</strong> </p></td><td><p>  <strong>CPU</strong> </p></td><td><p>  <strong>IOS version</strong> </p></td></tr><tr><td>  January 2010 </td><td><p>  iPad Original, Apple's First ever </p></td><td><p>  Variation in color - black frame, silver case.

Media in 2010 said that it was an extra waste of time and effort, and reporters from the NY Times recognized the gadget as the most fashionable and necessary in the history of technology.  Further more. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td><p>  <strong>Year of issue</strong> </p></td><td><p>  <strong>Model</strong> </p></td><td><p>  <strong>Options</strong> </p></td><td><p>  <strong>CPU</strong> </p></td><td><p>  <strong>IOS version</strong> </p></td></tr><tr><td>  March 2011 </td><td>  iPad 2 in two variations: with support for Wi-Fi and 3G </td><td><p>  Models were available in two colors - black and white. </p></td><td><p>  Apple a5 </p><p>  1.0 GHz </p></td><td>  iOS 4 - iOS 9 </td></tr></tbody></table><p>  In the same year, another serial model was released, which fell into the line of the best tablets. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td><p>  <strong>Year of issue</strong> </p></td><td><p>  <strong>Model</strong> </p></td><td><p>  <strong>Options</strong> </p></td><td><p>  <strong>CPU</strong> </p></td><td><p>  <strong>IOS version</strong> </p></td></tr><tr><td>  March 2012 </td><td><p>  iPad2,4, which were produced in black and white cases. </p></td><td><p>  Built-in memory remained the same </p></td><td><p>  Apple A5 1.0 GHz </p><p>  (32 nm) </p></td><td>  iOS 5 - iOS 9 </td></tr></tbody></table><p>  Then, in 2012 and throughout 2013, the iPad 3, iPad 4 and iPad mini were released.  They were distinguished by an operating system that had already started with the 6th version.  The processor was improved, and the color scheme expanded to the appearance of the iPad2.6 A1454 (4G) in a gray "robe". </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="l6BXGm__c-0" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6BXGm__c-0" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/4/2/7/5/14275.jpg"></div><p>  The processor was equipped with three cores.  This was a feature of gadget followers with less performance.  The memory has increased to 128 GB with the ability to send files to the storage. </p><h2>  Pro generation line - a new round of innovation and progress </h2><p>  The evolution of the iPad does not end, and in 2015, the world introduced the Pro version tablet.  For the first time, the diagonal has reached impressive dimensions - up to 12.9 inches with a screen resolution of 2732 x 2048, which provides a pixel density of up to 264 pixels per 1 inch.  There are already four grilles on the case - two on top and bottom of the device.  On the left is a Smart Connector for connecting an external keyboard.  The processor remains the same - two cores with the A9X model, and the frequency reaches 2.2 GHz.  A smartphone tracking system has been introduced thanks to Apple M9.  Other features: </p><ul><li>  RAM 4 GB. </li><li>  Storage expanded to 32 and 128 GB. </li><li>  The color scheme in silver, gray and gold. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.slidemagic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="2018 iPad Pro Presentation" class="if uuid-3075738" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/84916/3075738.jpg"></div><p>  The case was also updated - thinner, compatibility with old accessories was lost.  The new orientation has created a number of innovations.  Following these gadgets appeared iPad Pro 9.7 and iPad 5g.  The "big" release gave way to consistent graphics quality and performance.  Form factor distinguishes the new tablet in size: </p><ul><li>  Interpretation of 9.7 inches was referred to as a professional device. </li><li>  The first True Tone on the fly adjusted the color temperature of the image. </li><li>  A consumer iPad 5g after a year did not cause the same flurry of emotions, although it was no worse than its predecessor. </li></ul><p>  The cheaper version was created for ordinary users who did not need pro-formats, versions of ‚Äúmaximum‚Äù ideas and chips tailored to work.  The case was thicker, there was no switch to silent mode, an accelerated processor type A9 and an improved camera.  Everything for amateur shooting in detail to enjoy the product and its quality.  The color scheme has become even more diverse - gold, pink gold, space gray, silver. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="QI9CMshFcaI" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QI9CMshFcaI" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/4/2/7/6/14276.jpg"></div><p>  Later, the company decided to touch the ‚Äúlarge‚Äù tablet version of Pro and make some changes.  In 2017, a new gadget with a diagonal of 10.5 inches and an updated classic Pro 2 with a diagonal of 12.9 inches appeared before users: </p><ol><li>  The second version of Pro received True Tone technology with the A10X Fusion processor. </li><li>  The display frequency has increased to 120 Hz. </li></ol><p>  The rest of the model is copied from 2015.  But more genuine interest aroused Pro with a diagonal of 10.5 inches, while maintaining the dimensions of the previous model.  This means that the filling slightly ‚Äúbulged out‚Äù, although the case did not show any changes.  The heart of the tablet is a chip with ProMotion technology.  It allowed you to change the display frequency in a wide range, displaying at least 120 frames per second. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.macworld.com" data-author=": Apple, "><img itemprop="image" alt="9.7-inch iPad Pro" class="if uuid-3075735" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/84916/3075735.jpg"></div><p>  Later at the beginning of 2018, the range of iPads was replenished with a beginner - a minor update with a saved design and characteristics from 5g - ‚ÄúiPad 6g‚Äù.  He had a new processor-SoC A10, a graphics subsystem, accelerated chip performance and a half times.  The OS reached version 11, which allowed the use of any crossed systems and applications from various base devices. </p><p>  Later came the third-generation model with the same diagonal, as well as 11 inches.  Before testing, this seemed to be the only difference between the two gadgets.  Some considered it to be analogues of the top models, others found significant differences.  However, in 2018, the company released three tablet models.  Each is not very different from each other.  Only the functionality is saved, but the filling becomes more powerful.  The design has also changed - the body is thinner already.  Along with the screen, the side faces are practically invisible.  On this, the evolution of the iPad is completed, but not far off 2019, and Apple is preparing a number of new products: </p><ol><li>  Two models of the Mini series from a number of budget tablets will be updated. </li><li>  One model will be released in a narrower frame, like a 9.7 inch diagonal, only it will already be 10.0 inches. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.pcmag.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="3rd Generation Pocket iPad Mini" class="if uuid-3075744" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/84916/3075744.jpg"></div><p> How convenient it will be to work with the gadget at such a size is unknown.  Users are also discussing the change of Chinese to Japanese assembly.  Apple plans to increase profits through a ‚Äúquality‚Äù parts supplier.  The Chinese market, in turn, does not lose customers and will supply tablet models to third world countries.  Of course, these are just rumors, but how will design and quality now affect functionality if there is a complete replacement of all accessories and configuration systems? </p>
