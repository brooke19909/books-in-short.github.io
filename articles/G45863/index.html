Cork is located on the Lee River.  Most of its streets are canals along the banks of which are colorful houses.  Cork was originally laid on marshy lands, for which it was awarded its name - corcaigh translates as ‚Äúswamp‚Äù. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lovin.ie" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What to see in Cork" class="if uuid-2718421" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2718421.jpg"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The city of Cork in Ireland is located in the southwest of the country, on the coast of the Atlantic Ocean.  This is a large industrial center where the computer and pharmaceutical industries are actively developing, replacing the old factories that have fallen into decay. </p><p>  Despite the fact that Cork is a city located in a territory that is remote from the sea, in fact it is connected with it by the narrow Passage West canal and the harbor.  The city center is an island sandwiched between two tributaries of the Li River, which are called the North and South canals.  Several bridges were built across the river that flows into Lake Mahon. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="51.8968917" data-lng="-8.486315699999977" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="11"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/7/4/2/5/7425.png"></div><h2>  History of the founding of the city </h2><p>  Researchers attribute the first mention of the city of Cork in Ireland to the VI-VII centuries.  In these ancient times, St. Finbarr founded a monastery on this land.  By the XII century, the settlement formed around the monastery turned into the main city of the kingdom of the Southern Munster.  Irish rule was short-lived - by 1185 the city was under British control.  After that, he changed hands many times because of the ongoing struggle between the British and the Irish. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The peak of Cork's heyday falls on the 18th century.  However, a century later, famine in County Cork in Ireland actually deprived Cork of the population - some of the inhabitants hastily left it, some died of hunger.  As a result, a sharp decline in the birth rate.  The originally Irish city of Cork played a special role in the struggle for the independence of the country.  An IRA officer and mayor, Thomas McCourtan, was killed in 1920 by members of the British Special Forces.  Terence McSweeney, who was his successor, died after a hunger strike lasting 75 days at Brixton Prison in London. </p><p>  On December 11, 1920, the same special forces unit actually burned the central part of the city during a punitive action against IRA activists.  The city of Cork in Ireland, whose photo you can see in the article, became a place of active hostilities until the end of the War of Independence (July 1921). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.citi.io" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cork History" class="if uuid-2719003" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2719003.jpg"></div><h2>  Climatic conditions </h2><p>  The North Atlantic Current has a significant impact on the climate of Cork.  Thanks to him, an oceanic temperate climate has formed here.  Winter in the city is humid and warm (+4 ... + 7 ¬∞ C).  At this time, storms and hurricanes are frequent in the city. </p><p>  In summer, the weather in Cork (Ireland) is quite mild, it does not have a lot of rainfall, the average temperature is +20 ¬∞ C.  The most favorable time for visiting this city is the period from July to August inclusive. </p><div id="sjcont"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Nature </h2><p>  It should be noted that tourists often travel to Cork in Ireland just to visit the Wildlife Park and see with their own eyes more than a hundred species of exotic animals: giraffes and penguins, pandas and zebras and many other rare representatives of the fauna.  Geese, swans, ducks feel comfortable near the water bodies of the park. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Due to the long and interesting history of the village, the sights of Cork in Ireland may interest even the most sophisticated travelers.  We will introduce you to some of them in this article. </p><h2>  St.  Finbarra </h2><p>  The City Anglican Cathedral was named after St. Finbarr, whom the locals revere as the patron saint of Cork.  The cathedral is located near the city center, where, according to historians, an ancient monastery was founded, founded in the 7th century.  The school founded by him was a citadel of knowledge in Ireland during the Middle Ages. </p><p>  Later, there were several temples on this site, the last of them was destroyed in the early sixties of the last century specifically to build the Cathedral of St.  Finbarra.  The temple was erected in a neo-Gothic style from decorative Bati stone and Cork limestone.  Its walls are faced with red marble. </p><p>  The interior and exterior decoration of the cathedral, including more than 1,200 sculptures, mosaics, furniture, was designed by William Burges.  Some elements were completed after his death.  The magnificent stained glass windows depicting scenes from the New and Old Testaments deserve special attention.  They are recognized as one of the best in the country.  The amazing department, the ancient organ (1870), and floor mosaics are also very interesting. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Finbarra" class="if uuid-2719010" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2719010.jpg"></div><h2>  Elizabeth Fort </h2><p>  Thousands of tourists visit Cork in Ireland every year.  What do history buffs see here?  An ancient fortress built at the beginning of the 17th century by order of Lord Chairman George Carew.  The name of the fort was given in honor of the Queen of England and Ireland, Elizabeth I, who ruled in those years. </p><p>  An important historical site - the Elizabeth Fort - was transferred to the Cork City Council.  Today the fort is being actively developed as a tourist attraction and it is only partially open for visitors, but those who wish can climb the fortress walls and enjoy the enchanting panoramic views.  Occasionally, fairs and festivals are held at the fort. </p><h2>  English market </h2><p>  The Municipal Food Market is located in the heart of Cork in Ireland (see photo below).  It is one of the largest in Europe and one of the most popular and visited attractions of the city.  The construction of the market began in September 1786, and only two years later the first pavilions were officially opened, in which they sold only meat. </p><p>  Subsequently, a huge market grew around them, which significantly expanded the range.  By the middle of the XIX century, it was called the "English Market".  It has become more prestigious than the nearby St. Peter's market, which was better known as the Irish Market, founded nearby in the forties. </p><p>  In the summer of 1980, a severe fire severely damaged the complex.  The City Council allocated considerable funds for repair work and ordered the contractor to restore the market in accordance with the original plans, preserving the unique Victorian style. </p><div class="photo" data-original="imprintsoflight.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="English market Cork" class="if uuid-2719017" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2719017.jpg"></div><h2>  Blackrock Castle </h2><p>  On the picturesque banks of the Li River, two kilometers from the center of Cork, is Blackrock Castle - one of the most interesting sights of Cork County.  The first castle tower was erected in 1600.  Initially, the castle was built as a defensive structure, but very soon it became a place where balls and other entertainment events were held for the local nobility. </p><p>  After a severe fire of 1827 and the subsequent reconstruction, Blackrock was transformed.  It was at this time that he received his current architectural appearance.  The most ancient castle structure is a well-preserved round massive tower 10.5 meters in diameter with 2.2 meter thick walls.  At the very beginning of the XXI century, as part of the Cosmos in the Castle project, with the participation of an unknown private philanthropist, the Cork city council and the Blackrock Institute of Technology, a scientific center with an observatory was established, which is equipped with modern technologies. </p><p>  Tourists take great pleasure in visiting the country's first interactive astronomical center, where they have the opportunity to participate in a virtual tour of the universe. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hotelisaacscork.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Blackrock Castle" class="if uuid-2719024" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2719024.jpg"></div><h2>  Crawford Art </h2><p>  Art lovers should definitely visit the Cork State Art Gallery in Ireland.  It is located in the city center and is one of the most interesting cultural attractions of the country.  More than 200 thousand art lovers visit it annually. </p><p>  The exposition of the Crawford Art Gallery is vast and diverse - these are sculpture, painting, engravings, drawings.  The collection has over 2.5 thousand copies of fine art from the XVII century to the present day.  They perfectly illustrate the history of the development of not only Irish, but also European culture. </p><p>  From 1825 to the present, the collection is located in the customs building.  Over its history, which is estimated at three centuries, it has undergone two major reconstructions (1884 and 2000).  The oldest part of the structure was erected in 1724.  The gallery regularly hosts various exhibitions, educational seminars and lectures.  On the ground floor there is a cozy cafe where you can have lunch or a cup of coffee with cake. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.guidedtourfinder.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crawford Art" class="if uuid-2719066" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2719066.jpg"></div><h2>  Red Abbey Tower </h2><p>  One of the iconic landmarks of the city of Cork in Ireland.  The Abbey Tower was erected in the Middle Ages and today is the oldest building in the city.  This is the only building that has survived to our time from the Red Abbey, which the Augustinian monks founded in the early XIV century.  It was so named because of the reddish sandstone used in the construction of the monastery. </p><p>  At the beginning of the 18th century, the Augustinians built a new monastery at Fishamble Lane and never returned to the old monastery.  A sugar factory was located on the territory of the Red Abbey for some time, but after the fire (1799), most of the abbey was so badly damaged that it could not be restored.  Later, all buildings, with the exception of the tower, which once served as the bell tower of the ancient monastery church, were demolished. </p><h2>  University College Cork </h2><p>  University of Cork in Ireland.  By Queen Victoria‚Äôs decree, the university was founded in 1845.  He became one of the three Royal Colleges located on the Emerald Isle.  They were founded in Belfast, Galway and Cork.  The new institution is located in a very picturesque place on the edge of a cliff overlooking the Li River. </p><p>  For residents of the city this place is symbolic, and it was not chosen by chance.  It is believed that it is closely connected with St. Finbarr, who paid much attention to education.  Today, University College is one of the leading research institutes and a prestigious educational institution in the country.  He is a member of the Union of Universities of Ireland, is a member of the Association of European Universities. </p><p>  Throughout its history, the college has undergone numerous changes.  They are associated not only with its name, but also with a significant expansion of the boundaries of the institution.  Today it is a huge knowledge center with research and academic buildings, campus, art gallery, etc. More than 20 thousand students study here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.myidcard.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="University College" class="if uuid-2719072" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2719072.jpg"></div><h2>  Church of st.  Anna </h2><p>  The construction is located in the oldest district of the city of Cork - Chandon - and is considered one of its business cards.  The church bell tower is a tower more than 50 meters high.  The walls of its northern and eastern sides are faced with red sandstone, and the southern and western walls are covered with white limestone and decorated with huge clocks. </p><p>  On the spire of the tower is a weather vane in the form of a huge fish.  Its length is more than four meters.  It is believed that it symbolizes the fishing industry, which played an important role in the economic heyday of Cork.  The tower is well visible from different areas of the city and is a good guide for tourists.  The tower also has an observation deck, located at an altitude of 40 meters, from which there are magnificent views of the city and the Li River. </p><p>  Great and the interior design of the temple.  Of particular interest here is the stone font, which was still in the old temple, which dates from 1629, and stunning stained glass windows. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of st. Anna" class="if uuid-2720163" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2720163.jpg"></div><h2>  Cork in Ireland: tourist reviews </h2><p>  The vast majority of travelers to this Irish city were satisfied with their trip.
