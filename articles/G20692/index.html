One of the pearls of the region is the Goryachiy Klyuch resort (Krasnodar Territory).  Reviews of people who moved here note a sharp improvement in their health, thanks to the cleanest air and medicinal herbs, the fame of which has long gone beyond the boundaries of the region. </p><h2>  Hot key.  General information </h2><p>  The Goryachy Klyuch resort <span>in the Krasnodar Territory, the</span> description of which must begin with its amazing nature, is rightly called a unique place in the Kuban.  It is located on the banks <span>of the Psekups River,</span> which flows along the northern foothills of the Caucasus.  The nature of this quiet place, sheltered by mountains on three sides, is truly unique.  The valley of the mountain river, covered with dense forest, softens the summer heat and makes the winter especially mild.  Hot Key (Krasnodar Territory) boasts an unusually large number of warm days.  Only Anapa, rightfully considered the sunniest resort in Russia, surpasses it in this parameter.  However, unlike him, in the Hot Key, the southern sun is not so scorching.  It softens the fresh air of the mountains and the coolness of the river. </p>

    <p>  This resort town is located 65 km from Krasnodar and the same distance lies between it and the Black Sea coast.  Goryachy Klyuch consists of one <span>urban-type village</span> and 6 administrative districts, which include 28 rural settlements.  The total number of residents is more than 52 thousand: almost 30 thousand of them live in urban areas, and 22 thousand live in rural areas.  It is noteworthy that there are almost no young people who leave to work in large cities.  However, few of them can completely disconnect from their hometown.  Every year young people come here to visit their parents and enjoy their holidays in their small homeland.  Despite the lack of noisy entertainment, young people say that they are never bored in their hometown. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Resort History </h2><p>  The history of the city of Goryachy Klyuch <span>(Krasnodar Territory)</span> began from the moment a military hospital was built on its current territory and began to equip it.  First of all, they built hospitals and equipped cranes designed for the extraction of underground mineral waters. </p><p>  In the description of the history of this resort city there is one interesting case that allows its residents to consider their city a blessed heaven.  This is due to the fact that at the moment when the priest consecrated the sources of mineral waters, in response to the words of blessing, a bright ray of sunshine pierced through the cloudy sky.  He lit up the whole clearing and every person who was on it at that moment.  This day, July 15, 1864 is called the birthday of the Goryachiy Klyuch resort (Krasnodar Territory).  The reviews of those who moved to this area mark the strength of the faith of the indigenous people in the importance of this phenomenon, which is considered a real sign here. </p><p>  Three years later, in 1867, Grand Duke Mikhail Nikolaevich came to a new treatment site.  It was he who named the main street of the city - Mikhailovskaya. </p><p>  The hot spring was called so because of mineral waters, the temperature of which in some places can reach 62‚Å∞.  These sources are not the only reason hundreds of tourists come to the city every year.  The nature of this city is considered one of the most beautiful and clean on the planet.  It is noteworthy that near the city there is not a single industrial enterprise that could release harmful substances into the atmosphere.  Even cars do not have the right to enter the resort area, an imposing fine is provided for violating this rule.  However, such fines are rare.  Local residents, as well as guests of the resort who came to relax, appreciate the cleanliness of this unique place and do not violate existing prohibitions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The healing power of the Hot Spring mineral springs </h2><p>  This resort is a unique place where the healing properties of Essentuki mineral water for drinking are organically combined with hydrogen sulfide baths such as Sochi-Matsesta.  After a person begins to drink water from local mineral springs, the healing effect is achieved very quickly.  There is an improvement in respiration, blood circulation, skin and general metabolism.  More oxygen begins to flow into the body, protein metabolism, as well as the tissue's regenerative ability, also improves. </p>
