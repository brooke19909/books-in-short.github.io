In addition to beautiful nature, it is also interesting for its history, which is very popular with citizens and tourists.  The park has places for relaxation, as well as a cafe and a stage for performances.  There is a sandy beach near the ponds, where people like to sunbathe in the summer.  But swimming in water is not allowed.  However, this does not affect the popularity of this place among visitors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vao-mos.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="entrance to the park" class="if uuid-2436964" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55971/2436964.jpg"></div><h2>  general information </h2><p>  The pride of the place of rest is the relic oak forest.  Therefore, in addition to the main name of the park, you can still hear others.  The most popular of them is Terletsky oak forest.  Many trees in it are over three hundred years old.  Pine trees have been growing on its territory for more than half a century.  In addition, Terletsky Forest Park is rich in many species of trees, thanks to which the air brings real health benefits.  Among them are oak, alder, linden, maple, as well as many others. </p><p>  The park itself was founded in 1972.  Then he separated from the Izmailovsky Forest Park and became more and more visited every year.  <span>Terletsky ponds are</span> well known throughout the country, as they have a fairly long history.  They exist in this place since the 18th century.  Water open spaces have become not only a favorite place for visitors.  Here you can also see a variety of birds fed by guests of the park. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  In ancient times, this territory was in the possession of many famous personalities of Russia.  Among them are the Sheremetyevs, Golitsyns, Stolypin and Torletsky.  At the moment, you can see the buildings that have remained since past centuries.  Among them are the Torletsky estate, built in the 19th century, as well as the Spasskaya Church.  The merchant A.L. Torletsky traveled a lot and loved to enjoy nature.  Therefore, he dreamed of making clean ponds in his estate.  Since earlier the area was rather swampy, he did his best to keep the ponds clean.  For this, he used, for example, cattail, which is quite similar to reeds.  Now Terletsky Forest Park cannot boast the same crystal clear water in the ponds, but the reservoirs are always carefully monitored and cleaned. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mos-holidays.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="landscape design" class="if uuid-2436957" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55971/2436957.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Most Muscovites know the location of the park, but not everyone can give the exact address.
