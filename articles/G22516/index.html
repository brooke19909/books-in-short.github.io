He also served as deputy commander in many military districts. </p><p>  For invaluable services to the country, Alexander Belousov was awarded numerous orders and medals, and at the end of his service, the Ministry of Defense presented him with a registered pistol. </p><p>  When Belousov became <span>deputy defense minister,</span> he repeatedly visited the military units of the country with checks.  He personally became convinced of the preparedness of the officer corps of the units, and also tried to fully and in-depth study the service, life and life of all military personnel.  He obtained from the officers complete military training not only in theoretical knowledge, but also in practical.  He strictly demanded constant training of officers at the training grounds and the complete testing of all kinds of military operations. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Fame and fame </h2><p>  Alexander Belousov, whose photo cannot be seen in ordinary magazines or newspapers, very rarely gives interviews, because he does not like "empty talk and gossip."  Despite the many difficulties that awaited him in the military field, this man did not lose heart and was always full of strength and confidence.  His military exploits, his tactics of warfare, as well as his lifestyle in general, set an example for modern students of military schools. </p><h2>  Social work </h2><p>  During the <span>service, the general</span> periodically checked the knowledge of soldiers who served under the contract.  He believed that knowledge is power during a war.  But, unfortunately, not all soldiers were trained and passed exams safely. </p><p>  When Belousov was appointed head of the military academy, under his guidance, the academy began to train specialists with higher education in operational and strategic appointments.  He personally developed a training strategy and put forward requirements for the training of officers, as well as all troops and executive bodies, which are required by law to undergo military service, proposed strategies for working in the country's defense and military security sectors. </p><p>  Belousov did his best to consolidate the status of the academy as the central military and scientific center for the training of the military forces of the Russian Federation, since it was his academy that took a direct part in the development, and then in the implementation of the development strategy of education in military affairs and the training of highly qualified officers who were sent to the military districts of the country. </p>

    <p>  Now he puts forward the following goal: the importance of politics and military education for young people.  The general believes that modern youth lacks military education and love for their own country.  As president of the union, he often gives speeches at All-Russian military conferences. </p><p>  Military service in many parts of the country gave him true military training and endurance.  He never stood still and always went forward, he still inspires the same with his wards. </p><p>  Despite the fact that Belousov is retired, his opinion is still listened to and trained soldiers who serve under the contract, in accordance with those requirements that were approved by the general and repeatedly worked out.  The general is highly respected, because all his methods related to military training work flawlessly, as evidenced by the fact that he never had a single miss in the conduct of hostilities. </p>
