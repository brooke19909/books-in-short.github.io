Hotel reviews are formed by the hotel.  The status of the institution is affected by everything related to comfort and pleasures, including the food system.  Although the restaurants do not have a wide variety of dishes, tourists say, nobody is starving here. </p><p>  The buffet offers dishes of fish, chicken and beef, soups and salads, sweets, drinks.  There is a cut of sausage, cheese, fruits and vegetables.  The guests are especially impressed by the pastries.  Meat rolls, tuna dishes and baked beef are served separately.
