    <p>  Unfortunately, often working on the currency exchange attracts financially illiterate people.  They crave easy and quick profit, but most often they lose a huge amount of money.  In order not to fall prey to the Forex market, it is important to understand and regularly apply a few simple rules. </p><p>  Often, brokers claim that earnings on the exchange are unlimited and very simple.  Remember, they usually say that only for the sake of attracting customers.  Many companies, in addition to advertising, offer a free lesson in which you are unlikely to learn the basics of analyzing <span>stock quotes.</span>  Most likely, you will be told a huge number of stories when ordinary housewives and janitors earned millions.  In a light, relaxed atmosphere, they will inspire you to do so.  You just need to open an account for a small amount and buy a training package of books or CDs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first rule to remember: earnings on the exchange are not instantaneous.  It‚Äôs impossible to make millions out of <span>$ 100 in</span> a couple of months. </p><p>  In addition, it is a mistake to think that no knowledge is required for trading.

The work of the trader involves constant self-improvement, regular analysis of information, readiness for change and the search for new, more profitable strategies.

    <p>  Do not trade Forex for the last money.  The amount you deposit to your account should not be material to your budget.  Develop a <span>trading strategy</span> and strictly follow it.  If at some point the deposit is drained, do not rush to replenish it again.  Better stop and think what you did wrong.  Maybe you can improve your trading strategy. </p><p>  It is important to learn how to control your emotions.  Spontaneous actions rarely allow you to increase earnings on the exchange.  On the contrary, much more often they lead to significant losses.  Even if you are sure that certain actions will be beneficial for you, try never to back down from your goals and strategies. </p><p>  But the devil is not so terrible as he is painted.  In any case, earnings on the Forex exchange </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="earnings on the forex exchange" class="if" height="495" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10492/52839.jpg" width="600"></div>  provides a patient trader a huge number of opportunities:
