How to unlock the device?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Modern smartphones and other gadgets are equipped with various means of protection against theft and loss.  Only by no means do they always play into the hands of the population.  Did the man find iPhone 6?  How to unlock it?  And what if a person discovered an "apple" device?  As a rule, you have to build on the situation.  Therefore, we will further try to analyze all possible scenarios.  A lot of them.  And you can keep an ‚Äúapple‚Äù smartphone in isolated cases.  This is due to the fact that Apple provides high protection of its devices from theft. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bgr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="To whom to give the found iPhone 6" class="if uuid-2878700" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2878700.jpg"></div><h2>  Unlock probability </h2><p>  Is it possible to unlock iPhone 6 if I found it on the street or in another place?  In fact yes.  It is almost impossible to achieve the desired result only in practice.  Therefore, most often, unlocking the iPhone is not the best solution. </p><p>  In service centers, such services are not provided.  They can be used only if there is evidence that the device really belongs to the client-applicant.  In our case, this is simply impossible.  So what if I find an iPhone 6?  How to unlock it?  And how to behave in principle? </p><h2>  Charge check </h2><p>  First you have to check whether the device is turned on, whether it has a SIM card, and also pay attention to the battery charge.  It is advisable to keep the device turned on.  This will help to contact the owner of the "apple" device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It‚Äôs best to just connect the phone to the charger, and then to the power source.  This is the only way to keep the smartphone battery charged all the time. </p><h2>  Check lock code </h2><p>  Most often, the so-called screen unlock code is installed on Apple devices to protect information.  Without a special combination, a person will not be able to access the main menu of the smartphone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.imore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Enter screen unlock code" class="if uuid-2878703" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2878703.jpg"></div><p>  Found an iPhone 6?  How to unlock his screen?  It is worth seeing if there is protection in the form of an unlock code.  The absence of such is a huge fortune.  Then contact the owner of the device is not difficult.  Having a request to enter a screen unlock code is a significant issue.  It makes no sense to pick up a secret combination. </p><h2>  If no code </h2><p>  Suppose there is no unlock code on the iPhone.  Now what?  You can use the device, but only at your own peril and risk.  It‚Äôs better to immediately try to contact the owner of the device and tell him that the caller has found iPhone 6. How to unlock it, you won‚Äôt have to think - only the owner of the device can do this. </p><p>  So, to contact the real owner of the "apple" phone, you need: </p><ol><li>  Open the main menu of the smartphone and go to the "Settings" section. </li><li>  Click on the inscription AppleID. </li><li>  Examine the information with the contacts of the owner of the device. </li></ol><p>  After the actions done, it remains only to contact the owner of the "apple" smartphone and discuss with him the conditions for returning the phone.  There is nothing difficult or special about this. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Important!  You can also call someone from the iPhone‚Äôs phone book and report the find. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.recover-iphone-ios-8.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What to do if I found an iPhone 6" class="if uuid-2878697" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2878697.jpg"></div><h2>  Connect to the Network </h2><p>  How to unlock iPhone 6 if it is locked?  The answer to this question should be sought only by the owner of the "apple" device.  It is useless for others to think about the task - any attempts to hack into the device will lead to its damage.  In the end, instead of a multifunctional phone, a person will receive only a useless "brick" of iron and plastic. </p><p>  If the iPhone you found does not have a screen unlock code, and it is also on, it‚Äôs time to connect to the Internet.  For example, using Wi-Fi.  This will help to quickly contact the owner of the "apple" gadget. </p><h2>  Option "Find iPhone" </h2><p>  So, the gadget was found.  How to unlock the phone?  IPhone 6, like other Apple products, is almost useless in the wrong hands.  This is due to the fact that the manufacturer was worried about a variety of means of protecting their products. </p><p>  As soon as a person has found an iPhone, he needs to check if the ‚ÄúFind iPhone‚Äù mode is activated on the smartphone.  If such an option takes place, you can not even think about self-unlocking.  Even resetting to factory settings will not help access the device‚Äôs system. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  If you are looking for a phone </h2><p>  How to unlock iPhone 6 without knowing the password?  This is usually not a good idea.  Moreover, it often ends in failure.  Especially if the owner of the "apple" device activates the option "Find iPhone". </p><p>  As soon as the corresponding mode is launched using iCloud, a message appears on the phone screen with information to contact the owner of the device.  Using it, you can get your smartphone back. </p><div class="photo" data-original="iphonegeek.me" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to return a found iPhone" class="if uuid-2878701" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2878701.jpg"></div><p>  Important.  In the wrong hands, an iPhone with activated "Find ..." mode is useless.  Unlocking it requires data from AppleID. </p><h2>  Siri and his help </h2><p>  Did the man find iPhone 6?  How to unlock it in one case or another?  We have already said that in the wrong hands the corresponding device is almost useless.  Unlocking this is possible in exceptional cases.  And therefore, most often you have to look for the owner of the smartphone and return it for a fee. </p><p>  Apple‚Äôs built-in voice assistant, called Siri, will help to cope with this task.  You need to enable it after connecting to the network first.  After that, you should ask a question that will help you find contacts for communication with the owner of the phone.  For example, ‚ÄúCall Brother‚Äù or ‚ÄúShow AppleID Mail.‚Äù </p><h2>  Unlock Methods </h2><p>  Found an iPhone 6?  How to unlock it in one case or another?  If for any reason a person received data from AppleID, you can cope with the task as soon as possible. </p><p>  Unlocking "apple" devices can be carried out: </p><ul><li>  Via iTunes </li><li>  by resetting to factory settings; </li><li>  through iCloud. </li></ul><p>  In reality, everything is not as difficult as it seems.  The main thing is to know the AppleID profile information.  Until this data is available, all user manipulations will be useless. </p><div class="photo" data-original="geek-nose.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Unlock iPhone from PC" class="if uuid-2878702" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2878702.jpg"></div><h2>  Through reset </h2><p>  Did a man find a <span>locked iPhone</span> 6?  How to unlock this device?  Usually, only the owner of the device can ask such a question.  Third parties will not be able to achieve the desired goal by any means. </p><p>  For starters, you can unlock via iTunes or by resetting your settings.  To do this, you will have to synchronize the device with the computer in advance.  It is advisable to backup data.  In this situation, there should not be any problems with unlocking and restoring data on the phone. </p><p>  Instructions for unlocking the iPhone through the function menu looks like this: </p><ol><li>  Connect the smartphone to the PC using a wire. </li><li>  Turn off the mobile device and press the Home and Power buttons simultaneously. </li><li>  Press the "Home" key. </li><li>  Release the button after a message appears on the device indicating that the system is in "Recovery" mode. </li><li>  Select the "Restore" option. </li></ol><p>  As a rule, now it remains only to wait.  Nothing difficult or incomprehensible.  After recovery, you can turn on the phone, and then log in to AppleID. </p><h2>  iTunes to help </h2><p>  How to unlock iPhone 6 if it is locked?  Unfortunately, it is not always possible to cope with this task.  Especially when it comes to the found "apple" device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.imeichanger.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="IPhone Power Maintenance" class="if uuid-2878699" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2878699.jpg"></div><p>  As soon as the smartphone is returned to the owner, he can try to unlock and restore the OS via iTunes.  Usually you have to act like this: </p><ol><li>  Connect the "apple" phone to the computer and launch ITuns. </li><li>  Wait for device synchronization. </li><li>  Open the main menu of the smartphone via iTunes, go to the "General" tab. </li><li>  Select the "Recovery" option. </li><li>  Confirm the operation. </li></ol><p>  After a while, the system will restore the iPhone and reset the password.  You can restore data from a backup! </p><h2>  iCloud and reset </h2><p>  Need to unlock an iPhone?  iCloud is a service that will help to achieve the desired result.  Only first on the smartphone will have to activate the option "Find iPhone".  Suppose that it takes place.  Now what? </p><p>  It is further proposed to proceed as follows: </p><ol><li>  Connect your apple phone to the Internet. </li><li>  Open iCloud.com website from any other device, log in using AppleID. </li><li>  Go to the "Find iPhone" section. </li><li>  Choose among the available devices that you want to unlock. </li><li>  Click on "Erase ...". </li><li>  Confirm the operation by specifying data from AppleID. </li></ol><p>  At this stage, it remains only to wait.  Did the man find iPhone 6?  How to unlock this device?  We figured out the answers to such questions.  As you can see, without information about AppleID, all of the above manipulations are useless. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Unlocking "apple" devices is not an easy task.  A person will have to try pretty hard to achieve the desired result.  Some scammers are still successfully cracking Apple products, but this does not happen so often.  Therefore, you can not hope for a similar alignment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.independent.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What to do if I found someone else's iPhone 6" class="if uuid-2878698" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2878698.jpg"></div><p>  What to do with a found iPhone?
