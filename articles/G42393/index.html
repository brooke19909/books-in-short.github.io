The pier and walking street can be reached in tuk tuk in 15 minutes. </p><p>  According to users, the hotel is very comfortable.  Cleaning and linen change is carried out daily. </p><p>  All photos in the catalogs presented on the hotel website, according to users, are true.  The authors of the reviews draw the attention of tourists to the fact that the photos do not have Standard / Economy rooms.  According to them, these rooms are very small (so much so that, according to them, they can go to the toilet directly from the bed. The shower is not fenced off from the rest of the combined bathroom with even minimal sides, water is sprayed all over the room, filling the toilet next to it).  If you want to stay in the room, "as in the photo," you should choose at least Deluxe rooms. </p><p>  Network users who are familiar with the conditions of stay at By Dee Jomtien 3 * (Thailand, Pattaya), report that the hotel breakfast is served monotonous, not suitable for especially demanding tourists.  Usually they bring an already ‚Äúassembled‚Äù plate with food: eggs of various cooking variations (fried eggs / roll / omelet), chicken breast or sausages, cabbage salad, toasts with jam, fruits (pineapple or watermelon), a powder-like drink.  Breakfast is quite hearty.  During the day, you can drink tea, cocoa, and coffee unlimitedly. </p>

    <p>  Scooter rental is available at the hotel.  Rental price per day: 200 baht (approximately 400 rubles).  According to users, it is safer to book a scooter at the hotel than on the beach, since they do not require any deposit and almost do not check for chips, scratches, etc. They also do not check the amount of gasoline (according to the rules, you should give the scooter so the amount of fuel with which it is received). </p><p>  This hotel is not recommended to stay with a small child, because there is no swimming pool, but for adults, according to the authors of the reviews, this is a great choice. </p><p>  By Dee Jomtien 3 * is an excellent budget option with an ideal ratio: price - quality.  The advantages of the hotel include the fact that it is clean, new, located in a quiet area, close to the beach.  Polite, ‚Äúsweet and smiling‚Äù employees work here.  Guests are impressed by the fact that the room has a safe.  Cons consider monotonous breakfasts, the lack of a wardrobe, balcony, pool, humming air conditioning, and the "tiny" sizes of some rooms.  Nevertheless, many people really like the hotel, and they thank the staff for organizing an excellent stay. </p>
