This is not only a country of beautiful tulips, delicious cheese, vibrant diamonds and wealthy bankers.  There is still royal power and a constitutional monarchy has been approved, but part of the rights are transferred to the government and the General States. </p><h2>  General information about the state </h2><p>  The official name of the Netherlands is the Kingdom of the Netherlands (Koninkrijk der Nederlanden) - a state in Western Europe, most of which is located on the North Sea (450 km of coastline).  It has borders with Germany and Belgium.  It also includes the Caribbean island of Aruba with special status and the Antilles. </p><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚ÄãHolland is 41 526 km <sup>2</sup> , the population is 17 million people.  The date of independence is July 26, 1581. The official language is Dutch.  The state is divided into 12 provinces, the capital is Amsterdam, and the royal residence and parliament are located in The Hague. </p><p>  Religion - Protestantism and Catholicism.  The largest cities are Amsterdam, The Hague, Rotterdam, Utrecht, Eindhoven.  The following is a fairly brief history of the country of Holland. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tourister.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Map and coat of arms" class="if uuid-2865712" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46001/2865712.jpg"></div><h2>  Ancient times and the power of Rome </h2><p>  Even in ancient times, settlements of primitive people existed on the territory of Holland, as evidenced by excavations dating back to the period of the last glaciation.  In the post-glacial period, the population of these lands was subjected to frequent floods, so for security reasons, the first settlements peasant herders began to build on the hills (terps).  In the more southern regions, people were more involved in farming. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As early as 1-2 centuries BC  in the territory of modern Netherlands there lived tribes of Frisians and Batavs, which were then conquered by Rome.  Information about this is given in the historical documents of Ancient Rome: the army of Julius Caesar first invaded Gaul, and then onto the lands of modern Germany and Great Britain, en route conquering a strategically important territory in the Rhine Delta.  We can say that the history of Holland dates back to the period when the Romans built a road and dams here to protect them from floods. </p><p>  In 3-4 centuries A.D.  first Germanic tribes began to settle here, then Frankish and Saxon, German (Germanic) was the common language for them.  The Franks then went further, forming the state of France and changing the language to Latin (later French). </p><div class="photo" data-original="nl.wikipedia.org" data-author=": Willem Blaeu, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vintage map of Holland" class="if uuid-2863287" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46001/2863287.jpg"></div><h2>  Medieval holland </h2><p>  In the Middle Ages, lands located in the lowlands of the Rhine, Meuse and Scheldt rivers (Holland, Zeeland and Friesland) and along the shores of the North Sea were called ‚Äúcoastal low lands‚Äù.  Gradually, this descriptive term became a household word, as the name "Netherlands" translates as "low land". </p><p>  During the VIII-IX centuries.  in these territories the Frankish kings of the Merovingian and Carolingian dynasty ruled.  After the reforms of Charlemagne in politics and economics, the population was converted to Christianity.  With regular redistribution of land, the Netherlands often passed into the possession of various Frankish kings, as a result of which in 1000 they even became part of the Holy Roman Empire. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At that time, the inhabitants of the coastal areas were subjected to constant raids by the Vikings from Scandinavia, but gradually this came to an end.  Merchant and fishing ships began to actively sail in the North Sea, and in the southern part of the Rhine Delta (the provinces of Flanders and Brabant), manufacturing enterprises began to build and develop, where they made fabrics and clothes from imported wool. </p><p>  In the Netherlands, cities began to actively develop, where the organization of workshops involved in crafts in various professions (cloth makers, etc.) was established.  The guilds of merchants who successfully traded with other cities and countries also flourished.  As a result of the reorganization of management and the transfer of power into the hands of the townspeople, conflicts began between wealthy burghers and artisans.  In the XIV century.  several uprisings took place, civil wars were fought because of the fierce competition of urban settlements and the rivalry of family dynasties.  In 1370, all local counties were united in the trade and political union of the Hansa, which acted as a mediator between the European West and East.  Thus began the economic history of Holland. </p><p>  In the 14th century, the territories of present-day Netherlands became independent regions.  At this time, the Duke of Burgundy, who ruled in Flanders and Artois, then his heirs annexed the lands of Holland and Zealand.  The Burgundian rulers were considered the most powerful in Europe, they had a large army and surrounded themselves with excessive luxury.  Money for this went through the taxation of local cities. </p><p>  The Netherlands could only become independent under Mary of Burgundy (1480s).  Uprising began to break out, the opposition formed, and 10 years later the country came under the rule of the Habsburgs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.discoverholland.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Royal Palace" class="if uuid-2863346" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46001/2863346.jpg"></div><h2>  Holland revolution </h2><p>  In 1463, the General States were formed in the Netherlands, which were then transformed into the first parliament of the country.  By the beginning of the XVI century.  the lands were united with Belgium and Luxembourg under the rule of Charles V - this is how the Habsburg-Burgundy Empire appeared. </p><p>  A difficult period began in the history of Holland: the ruling Catholics established a court of the Inquisition, thanks to which they could deal with all those who were objectionable.  As a result, religious protests swept through the cities as the opposition and Calvinists began to smash the Catholic churches.  All this grew into an uprising, in response to which the Spanish rulers sent punitive troops. </p><p>  Thus began the people's war for independence, which lasted 80 years (1566-1648).  The representative of the opposition was Wilhelm of Orange, who led the resistance in the squad of "sea gez", who won their first victory in 1572, when they were able to capture the port of Bril.  They were supported by Calvinists, who called themselves "forest giza". </p><p>  In 1574, the inhabitants of Leiden, who became the stronghold of the rebels and led by William of Orange, defeated the Spaniards.  The goal of Oransky was not only the expulsion of the Spaniards, but also the unification of all the provinces of the Netherlands (17 regions).  The General States were convened, and in 1576 the text of ‚ÄúGhent appeasement‚Äù was adopted in Ghent on the creation of a single state under the leadership of Prince William of Orange.  However, the power of King Philip was also recognized, foreign troops were withdrawn.  The form of government was approved by the liberal. </p><p>  However, directed by Philip II to the governor, the Duke of Parma (A. Farnese) declared the prince illegal - the war began again.  Farnese was able to conquer the southern provinces, where the Union of Arras was concluded (1579), which granted political rights to the citizens of these lands under the rule of the Catholic religion. </p><p>  The northern provinces in response to this, together with Flanders and Brabant signed the Union of Utrecht, in which they proclaimed their goal the struggle for the political independence of the state and complete freedom of religion.  7 rebellious provinces declared their non-recognition of the authority of Philip II.  In 1584, William of Orange was treacherously killed, and Count Leicester was appointed sovereign to the Netherlands. </p><p>  Later, the General States assumed control of the country, which gradually led to decentralization of power and increased influence of the provinces.  In 1609, a ceasefire for 12 years entered into force, which meant the de facto independence of the country, but in 1621 the war with Spain resumed.  France became an ally in the war, and the Dutch fleet won several significant naval battles with the Spanish fleet. </p><p>  In the brief history of Holland, it should be noted that the Netherlands officially gained independence only in 1648, after which they began to be called the Republic of the United Provinces.  Since then, this is the first country to organize a bourgeois republic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Philip 2 and William of Orange" class="if uuid-2865618" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46001/2865618.jpg"></div><h2>  Golden age </h2><p>  During the 17th century, Holland was involved several times in the wars with France and England, figuring out relations in politics and trade.  However, despite the constant military battles, this period is considered the golden age for the economy of the Netherlands.  During these years, Amsterdam became the largest port and center of trade in Europe.  The Republic held very successful West and East India companies and seized colonies in Southeast Asia and North America. </p><p>  Founded in 1602, the Netherlands Company of the East Indies (OIC) had a monopoly on trade in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, importing spices and other exotic goods.  Thanks to its influence and huge profits, Holland got the opportunity to accelerate the economic development of the state. </p><p>  The West Indies company seized ships belonging to Spain and Portugal, as well as transporting slaves to America.  Its strongholds were located on the islands of the Caribbean Sea and in the American colony New Holland (in its place now are the states of New York and New Jersey, USA).  Later, these territories under the contract were given to England. </p><p>  The most important thing for the economy in the history of Holland was maritime trade, it was associated with the development of shipbuilding, the active construction of windmills for energy, the manufacture of clothes and sugar.  Banking and trading developed, which became the impetus for the prosperity of cities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Return of the ships from the East Indies, 1599" class="if uuid-2865671" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46001/2865671.jpg"></div><h2>  Parliament and Human Rights </h2><p>  Thanks to economic prosperity, the United Provinces of the Netherlands has created a unique state structure.  The General States ensured political power in the country, in this parliament each province had the right to vote and the possibility of vetoing, and while solving the internal issues of the province remained independent.  Decisions of provincial states depended directly on the city magistrate, where the oligarchic system reigned, as members of the magistrate could be appointed for life.  Representatives of wealthy families who had income from this usually came there. </p><p>  The history of human rights in the Netherlands is connected with the main direction of government policy and is based on a harmonious combination of trade interests and philosophical principles.  This had a beneficial effect on the Dutch gaining personal freedoms.  In those years, for European countries, this was an exception to the rule. </p><p>  The Reformed Church in Holland was recognized by the state, which abolished taxation for it.  All Protestant organizations were free to preach, as well as Lutherans, Baptists, Jews, etc. Censorship was not very strict, freedom of the press and expression was accepted, although not absolute.  In the XVII century.  Huguenots emigrated from other European countries to Holland, who contributed to the development of the country's culture and art. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.discoverholland.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amsterdam canals" class="if uuid-2863344" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46001/2863344.jpg"></div><h2>  New Holland: Colony History </h2><p>  In search of the northern route for trade with the East, the Dutchman H. Hudson sailed to the American continent and founded the city of New Amsterdam at the mouth of the river, which now bears his name.  On the current island of Manhattan (New York), a colony of New Holland was founded.  The history of the islands of Tasmania and New Zealand also begins with the discovery by their traveler named A. Tasman (who came from the province of Zealand in the Netherlands).  At the same time, a new continent, Australia, was opened in the South Pacific, which was initially called New Holland, but decided not to develop it.  Its name lasted 150 years, and England took up the development of these territories, setting up a prison there for its compatriots sentenced to death. </p><p>  Another New Holland was created by the Russian Tsar Peter I in the form of 2 man-made islands in St. Petersburg, where in 1721 the military port of Russia was built. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.1800flowers.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amsterdam, Holland and tulips" class="if uuid-2863355" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46001/2863355.jpg"></div><h2>  Ruled by Napoleon </h2><p>  A new turn in the history of Holland occurred after the capture of the country by Napoleon in 1795, under whose authority the territories were until 1813, when, with the support of the Russian army under the command of Benckendorf, liberation came.  Sovereign of the Netherlands was proclaimed Prince William the 1st, a descendant of the last stathauder. </p><p>  At a congress in Vienna, European statesmen decided to create a united kingdom of the Netherlands.  Bourgeois reforms took place in the country, colonial lands were returned, and industrial development was rapid. </p><p>  Subsequent events of the 19th century took place in the struggle of 2 main parties in Holland - liberals and conservatives, as well as ongoing disputes between the Catholic Church and the government, mainly in the field of education.  The second half of the XIX and the beginning of the XX century.  characterized by the heyday of Dutch painting, music, science and architecture. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fr.dreamstime.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cheese Fair, Gouda" class="if uuid-2865688" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46001/2865688.jpg"></div><h2>  XX century: world wars </h2><p>  During the First World War, the Netherlands took a neutral position, although sea trade was significantly affected by the imposed blockade on transportation.  To prevent hunger, the Dutch government introduced a tight distribution system.  In these years, important political reforms were carried out: from 1917-1919.  all citizens were given the right to vote. </p><p>  The consequence of the ‚Äúcrisis in school education‚Äù was the 1917 law on the provision of equal subsidies to primary schools between religious denominations and the state. </p><p>  In 1929, during the period of economic depression, political tension intensified: a party of National Socialists (Nazis) arose with the support of the bourgeoisie, and the Social Democratic forces, together with liberals and religious parties, formed a coalition (1939). </p><p>  In 1940, fascist troops invaded the Netherlands, which at that time was neutral.  The queen and the government urgently left for England; the occupation regime was established in the country, which lasted until May 5, 1945. Over the years, 240 thousand inhabitants were destroyed (110 thousand of them Jews).  In the postwar years, the country did everything in its power to restore the economy and trade, and strengthen ties with European countries. </p><p>  <span>The colonial empire of the</span> Netherlands broke up: in 1962, relations with Indonesia were broken, which caused tangible material damage to the country, and in 1975 gained Suriname independence. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.roadscholar.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holland, Amsterdam" class="if uuid-2863339" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46001/2863339.jpg"></div><h2>  The end of XX - beginning of XXI centuries. </h2><p>  The political course of Holland in the second half of the 20th century was determined by participation in the movement for integration processes in Europe.  In 1948, the customs union of 3 Benelux states was concluded, and in 1960 - the economic one, whose goal was the full economic integration of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.  In 1949, Holland renounced neutrality by joining NATO, and in 1958 joined the European Union. </p><p>  Modern Holland is an economically developed and free country with a distinctive culture.  The standard of living of the Dutch is quite high, class and religious differences gradually disappeared and hostile relations ceased. </p>
