But what if the kebab is needed right now and there is no time to pickle meat?  Hardly many are ready to purchase ready-made semi-finished products in the store - this is an expensive and dubious pleasure.  Molecular cuisine, known for its cooking methods using the laws of physics, came to the rescue of modern housewives.  Meet the vacuum express mariner. </p>

    <h2>  What it is? </h2><p>  Vacuum mariner is a relatively young household appliance in the kitchen appliances market, which allows you to reduce the time of pickling products from 6-8 hours to 9-15 minutes.  With the help of the mariner, they prepare not only kebab, but also pickled mushrooms, lightly salted cucumbers, various dishes of vegetables and fish, salads and much more. </p><p>  The taste of products prepared in a high-tech way does not differ at all from those that lay in the refrigerator for several hours.  The device saves a lot of time, while not taking up much space in the kitchen and is relatively inexpensive. </p><h2>  How the pickle works </h2><p>  The vacuum marinator is a simple construction, the main elements of which are a cylindrical container, pump or built-in electric pump for pumping air and a stationary rotary device.  Using the device is easy and simple, just load the products and components for the marinade into the container and pump air out of it.  After that, the container is installed on the station, which begins to rotate it, evenly distributing the marinade.  The process takes no more than 9 minutes, after which the marinator is automatically turned off. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Device advantages </h2><p>  Why does any housewife find it useful such a device as a pickle? </p><ul><li>  The vacuum container allows you to store unused products in the refrigerator longer than usual. </li><li>  Familiar food, previously pickled in the device, acquires new taste. </li><li>  The corrugated plate inside the pickle adds softness and tenderness to the pieces of meat, as if beating them. </li><li>  The device independently mixes all the components inside the container, evenly distributing the marinade. </li><li>  The container is spacious, but the device itself is easily disassembled and does not take up much space in the kitchen. </li><li>  The device copes with its main task perfectly - it pickles in just 9 minutes. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vacuum express pickle" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41221/1337452.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Choose wisely </h2><p>  Today, devices for express marinating food are becoming increasingly popular, in connection with this, an increasing number of models of such equipment appear on the market.  The main manufacturer of the wonderful device is the Celestial Empire, and among the models stand out the “Marinator 9 minutes”, “Marinator VES”, Supra, Viconte and some others.  How to choose among this variety so that the appliance does not gather dust in the kitchen and does not deteriorate too quickly?  There are several points that you should pay attention to before buying: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Marinators differ in volume and mass of loading.  For family dinners and picnics, it is better to choose a device with a capacity of 4-6 liters, with a load of up to 4 kg. </li><li>  Not all models have such a useful detail as a corrugated plate for beating meat. </li><li>  For pumping air, a manual pump or an electric pump is used.  The latter option is more expensive, since it is much more convenient to use it.  But in the event of a breakdown, the manual pump is easy to replace, whereas in the event of a malfunction in the electric pump, the pickle will have to be thrown away. </li><li>  The vacuum container may be made of metal, <span>clear plastic</span> or glass.  Metal is the most durable option, glass is the most useful.  You can find an alternative in the form of a container made of <span>tempered glass,</span> it will definitely be able to contain shocks and falls from a small height. </li><li>  Higher power of the device will not significantly reduce the cooking process, but it certainly will not save electricity. </li><li>  A safer model will be with a timer and auto-off function. </li></ol>
