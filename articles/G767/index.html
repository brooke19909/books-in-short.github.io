A certain ‚Äúelite‚Äù of manufacturers has formed.  Therefore, it is very difficult for a new brand to break into the market.  And if this happens, then such an event does not go unnoticed.  This always causes a certain interest.  This is not the situation with Digma laptops, the reviews of which we will analyze in this article.  This manufacturer has settled exclusively in the Russian market.  Therefore, it does not feel much competition.  But are laptops from this company so good?  It is clear that the manufacturer extols its brainchild.  But what do those who have purchased these devices say on this score?  We will consider the reviews of the owners.  But first, let's talk a little about the company. </p><div class="photo" data-original="logos-download.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="digma logo" class="if uuid-3019123" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3019123.jpg"></div><h2>  Digma company </h2><p>  Digma company was established in 2009 in Hong Kong.  The main areas of production are small computer peripherals, tablets, e-books and navigators.  The company's products have become very popular in the Russian market mainly due to low prices for gadgets.  E-books and tablets were in great demand.  Especially after the last 3G-modems were introduced.  Navigators are also very popular.  They added GLONASS support, and domestic buyers began to acquire them in large quantities.  And now the company has focused on the release of laptops.  But is a Digma laptop good?  The reviews suggest that consumers have different views on this matter.  That is why it is worth considering them.  But first, on the technical characteristics of some models.  Without this, it is impossible to understand how high-quality devices a manufacturer has.  Let's start with the most popular model. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="topsto-crimea.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="laptop digma city reviews" class="if uuid-3019134" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3019134.jpg"></div><h2>  Digma City E202.  Key Specifications </h2><p>  The first in the list is a transformer laptop with a touch screen.  Notebook Digma City E202, reviews of which we will consider in the next chapter, has a good design and unusual design.  Its screen can rotate almost 360 degrees.  In addition, it is equipped with an Intel Atom X5 processor with a clock frequency of 1.4 GHz.  The amount of pre-installed memory is 4 gigabytes.  There is a built-in drive like SSD 32 gigabytes.  Not enough for a good laptop.  And the performance of Atom raises serious doubts.  The screen size is 11 inches.  Resolution - 1920 by 1080 pixels.  It's not bad.  Naturally, there is no drive for reading CDs.  The integrated graphics card from Intel is responsible for processing the graphics.  Of course, you won‚Äôt squeeze a lot out of this laptop.  It belongs to the class of netbooks and is intended exclusively for work and surfing the Internet.  But what do users say about this laptop? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.svyaznoy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="laptop digma eve 1402 reviews" class="if uuid-3019162" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3019162.jpg"></div><h2>  Digma City Owner Reviews </h2><p>  Is the Digma City Laptop Good?  Owner reviews in this regard are unambiguous: it is clearly worth the money that is being asked for it.  But compared to other products, it is hopelessly behind.  Many users categorically did not have enough space on the drive.  For others, after a month of using the laptop, it began to get very warm.  Still others noticed problems with the screen.  And this is all the fault of the manufacturer.  Of course, no one is safe from marriage, but not on the same scale.  However, given the price of the device, it becomes clear why all these problems began to appear.  If you need something better, then you should contact other manufacturers.  Although the Digma laptops that we are currently reviewing are not bad.  Perhaps the problems are only with this model?  Need to continue the review.  Then we'll find out. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="e96.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="laptop digma eve 1401 reviews" class="if uuid-3019166" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3019166.jpg"></div><h2>  Digma EVE 1401. Key Specifications </h2><p>  This laptop can be attributed to the full-size models of the company.  It has a screen of almost 15 inches.  But the matrix resolution is weak - only 1366 by 768 pixels.  And the matrix itself is not particularly high quality.  Notebook Digma EVE 1401, reviews of which we will consider in the next chapter, refers to budget devices.  So expect more from him is not worth it.  On board there is a quad-core <span>Intel Atom processor</span> with a clock frequency of 1.4 gigahertz.  The amount of RAM is 4 gigabytes.  The integrated graphics card from Intel will not be able to cope with the games.  There is also a solid state drive.  And again at 32 gigabytes.  There is no CD drive.  In general, the performance of the gadget will be at the level of a normal working device.  You can only watch movies in HD.  There is nothing to count on games.  Now let's see how the laptop works in real conditions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gomel.kupi.tut.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="laptop digma eve 300 reviews" class="if uuid-3019168" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3019168.jpg"></div><h2>  Digma EVE 1401 Owner Reviews </h2><p>  As you can understand, after reading the reviews, the Digma EVE 1401 laptop received much more positive comments than the model discussed above.  Users note that the performance of the laptop is enough for work, surfing the Internet and entertainment (such as listening to music or watching movies).  The owners also say that the laptop works surprisingly well.  For a year of work there were no problems.  This is a great indicator for a budget laptop and a new company.  At the same time, users say that they were disappointed with the quality of the materials.  Plastic is cheap and of poor quality.  Just like in a Digma EVE 1402 laptop. User reviews on his account are also disappointing in terms of quality of materials.  But there is nothing surprising in this, because 1402 is the twin brother of 1401. Also, the unrealistically small size of the built-in drive upset many users.  It can, of course, be replaced.  But it‚Äôs strange for the manufacturer to install such a volume in a full-fledged mobile computer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ixbt.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="laptop digma city e202 reviews" class="if uuid-3019172" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3019172.jpg"></div><h2>  Digma EVE 300. Key Specifications </h2><p>  Another offspring of this company, which is trying hard to pretend to be "MacBook."  But he does it very poorly.  Notebook Digma EVE 300, reviews of which we will consider a little later, has a design that is close to laptops from Apple.  But the similarity ends here.  The processor here is the same Intel Atom with a clock frequency of 1.4 GHz (again), 2 gigabytes of RAM, an integrated video card from Intel and an SSD-type drive with 32 gigabytes (again).  At the same time, the laptop has a good 13-inch screen with a resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels.  But the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãordinary - TN.  Among other features of the laptop are wireless interfaces, USB ports and other necessary things.  But how does a laptop behave in real conditions?  To answer this question, you need to consider the reviews of the owners of this miracle of technology. </p><h2>  Digma EVE 300 Owner Reviews </h2><p>  How does this Digma laptop behave in real conditions?  User reviews about it are mixed.  Approximately the same amount of both positive and negative.  Let's start with the pros.  The owners note that the device has a very high-quality screen.  With long work with him, his eyes do not hurt.  Also, many were pleased with the high resolution of the matrix.  Even users say that this is an almost ideal laptop for work: it is compact and lightweight.  And he has enough performance to carry out work tasks and some multimedia entertainment.  That's just about the games you have to forget.  Now about the negative sides.  The owners say that the plastic shell is not high enough.  It pushes through even with minimal effort.  Also, the extremely small volume of the drive upset many.  Another thing that upset users is a poor-quality charger.  It "dies" after six months of use.  And under warranty it is not repaired. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we looked at Digma laptops.  Reviews about these devices make it clear that they are not bad.  But the manufacturer should pay more attention to workmanship. </p>
