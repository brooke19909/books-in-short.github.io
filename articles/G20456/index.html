Sales of new items started in the fall.  The device attracted the attention of buyers with a low cost.  For just 5 thousand rubles, anyone can buy a gadget with 4G support.

    <h2>  What is in the box? </h2><p>  The phone is packed in a pretty attractive box.  It is made of plain cardboard with a glossy finish.  Designers thought out packaging design as much as possible.  The combination of two colors was chosen optimally.  Neutral white was used as the basis, but red was perfect for the inserts.  It was with the help of the latter that the accents were correctly set, which should draw the attention of buyers to the main characteristics of the Prestigio Muse G3 LTE smartphone.  On the side of the box there is information about the version of the operating system, screen size, memory, battery and, of course, 4G. </p><p>  The front panel is decorated with a photograph of the gadget.  The company logo and model name are printed above it.  The dimensions of the box are small.  It opens like a book.  Opening the top cover, you can immediately see the phone, neatly packed in a plastic bag.  In addition to the device, the box contains a standard set, which includes a USB cable, a manual, a power adapter, and, of course, a coupon, indicating a guarantee from the manufacturer.  A nice bonus was the protective film.  It is definitely useful to customers in order to prevent damage to the screen during use. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone prestigio muse g3 lte reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2175228.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Appearance Features </h2><p>  In reviews of <span>the Prestigio</span> Muse G3 LTE <span>phone,</span> users say that the manufacturer provided rather interesting color solutions.  Most praise is addressed to the Red Corps (Marsala).  The device looks very elegant and attracts the attention of mostly the beautiful half of humanity.  Wine red color is effectively combined with a black front panel.  Also, many drew attention to the golden option.  The back panel, decorated in this color, makes it expensive.  The manufacturer did not forget about those who prefer the classics.  For them there is a black copy on sale. </p><p>  Designs are rarely discussed by buyers, since no special elements were used in the device.  Plain rectangular plastic case.  Everything is standard and faceless.  There are a lot of such smartphones on the market today.  But users respond well about the build quality.  The phone does not play, the rigidity of plastic surfaces is sufficient.  Praise deserves a low level of soaking.  During use, fingerprints on the back cover practically do not remain. </p><p>  Dimensions smartphone Prestigio Muse G3 LTE standard.  The height of the case is 146 mm with a width of 74 mm.  This model cannot be attributed to narrow ones, since the case thickness reaches almost 10 mm (9.6 mm). </p><p>  The back panel is removable.  Opening it, the owner gets access to the slots of SIM cards and flash drives.  As for the latter, it is separate, so there is no need to sacrifice a second SIM card.  This is an indisputable plus in the opinion of users.  On the back of the phone are a flash and a camera lens.  They are derived on the same vertical line.  The logo flaunts a little below.  It is printed in white letters, so it immediately catches the eye.  The hole for the main speaker is at the bottom.  It has an oblong shape. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="prestigio muse g3 lte psp3511 duo reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2175229.jpg"></div>

Above it, the developers brought out the "peephole" of the selfie camera, light and proximity sensors, as well as a conversational speaker.  Under the screen there is a familiar control panel.  There are three touch-type keys on it.  No backlight. </p><p>  Most of the positive reviews Prestigio Muse G3 LTE received due to the fact that the developers used glass for the screen with a 2.5D effect.  Rounded edges look beautiful and give elegance to a rectangular case. </p><p>  The power and volume buttons are on the right side edge.  The top end is filled with mini-jack and microUSB connectors.  On the opposite side there is only a small microphone hole. </p><p>  During use, discomfort is not felt.  It does not slip in the palm of your hand.  You can control the phone with one hand.  The owners of the buttons did not have any comments on the location of the buttons - they are within reach. </p><h2>  Screen Specifications and Reviews </h2><p>  The 5-inch screen is equipped with a Prestigio Muse G3 LTE smartphone.  Reviews about him vary.  Some owners assure that the price fully justifies all the characteristics.  However, there are many comments on the Web that talk about the sensor‚Äôs malfunctioning.  For example, when you click on one icon, neighboring ones are also activated.  The most difficult to type on the keyboard, because in addition to one letter, others are typed. </p><p>  As for the characteristics of the screen, they fully correspond to the price segment.  The picture is displayed in HD quality.  Multi-touch for only two touches.  The color is saturated, more close to the cold palette.  The average pixel density is 294 ppi.  Viewing angles are quite acceptable.  The brightness range is enough for comfortable work, the maximum limit is 320 cd / m2. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The advantage of the screen is Asahi Glass 2.5D.  However, users attributed the lack of oleophobic coating to the disadvantages, and this leads to the fact that the fight against fingerprints turns into torment.  Also, the manufacturer did not provide an anti-reflective layer, because of this it is difficult to read the text on the screen in the sun. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="prestigio muse g3 lte 8gb reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2175230.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Hardware equipment </h2><p>  Smartphone performance is the main criterion that buyers pay attention to.  In this matter, the Muse G3 LTE model has nothing to boast of.  The Spreadtrum SC9832 chipset is responsible for performance.  It is based on four computational elements.  Type of cores - Cortex-A7.  The maximum capabilities of the gadget are limited to a clock frequency of 1300 MHz.  The graphics accelerator model did not surprise users.  In tandem with the main processor, a Mali-400 MP2 graphics card is installed.  Such performance indicators are not able to ensure the smooth functioning of the gadget.  Users pay attention to the fact that the smartphone often freezes and can even shut itself off spontaneously. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the amount of RAM in one gigabyte is no longer enough for modern software to work.  Owners will have to limit themselves to simple applications and games in order to avoid system crashes.  This is the most significant drawback of the gadget, which is confirmed by reviews.  Prestigio Muse G3 LTE 8 GB will not please the amount of integrated memory.  As the name implies, only 8 GB is intended for storing files.  However, in the comments, the owners say that only about 4 GB will be available.  You can only correct situations by installing an external drive.  As mentioned above, for him, the developers have provided a separate slot. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone prestigio muse g3 lte reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2175233.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Communication </h2><p>  Of course, Prestigio Muse G3 LTE received the most praise due to the fact that the developers implemented support for the 4G standard in it.  This function is oriented to the range frequencies of all Russian mobile operators.  The option works fine.  The reception is good, the download is fast, the connection is high-speed.  The device also works with two micro-format SIM cards.  In standby mode they are in active state.  If a call comes in to one SIM card, the second one is automatically deactivated. </p><p>  The smartphone is equipped with a navigation module that is able to track location.  GPS works fine, connecting to satellites takes about one minute.  Also in the device, wireless modules are implemented - Bluetooth of the fourth version and Wi-Fi with support for all modern standards. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="prestigio muse g3 lte" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2175232.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Autonomy Reviews </h2><p>  It's time to talk about the weaknesses of this model.  Reviews about the Prestigio Muse G3 LTE in terms of autonomy are not very encouraging.  The problem is that the manufacturer decided to install an insufficiently capacious battery on the gadget.  Most owners say that the 2400 mAh battery is not able to provide decent working hours.  For example, when connecting to the Internet via 4G, the device will have to be charged after 4-5 hours.  When watching videos or movies, the battery resource is only enough for 4 hours. On average, the battery life will be no more than one day.  If you increase the load, then, accordingly, this period will be reduced by approximately 5 - 7 hours. </p><h2>  Camera Reviews </h2><p>  The developers installed an 8-megapixel module as the main camera.  It is equipped with flash and autofocus.  The pictures taken by this camera are rather mediocre, as evidenced by numerous reviews.  Prestigio Muse G3 LTE is not positioned as a camera phone.  More or less high-quality photos are obtained only with excellent lighting, for example, on the street in sunny weather.  But in the evening, the image detail is significantly reduced.  Digital noise is easy to spot with the naked eye.  Color rendering also changes significantly and not for the better. </p><p>  But the selfie camera reviews are only negative.  Currently, the 0.3-megapixel sensor no longer meets the requirements of modern users.  In the budget segment, you can easily find models that are equipped with 5-megapixel matrices. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone prestigio muse g3 lte" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2175231.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Software </h2><p>  The developers installed the sixth version of the Android operating system on the phone.  The advantages include the lack of a third-party launcher.  Users who prefer ‚Äúclean‚Äù ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù were satisfied with the software.  As a preinstalled software, Yandex service programs and proprietary applications acted.  The device supports updating the system by "air". </p><h2>  Summarize </h2><p>  In conclusion of the review of the Muze G3 LTE model, we note that users have found many shortcomings.  First of all, they include poor performance, short battery life, low-resolution cameras, system failures. </p><p>  But not everything is as bad as it might seem at first glance.  There is a certain category of buyers, which believes that low cost fully covers all the disadvantages.  Also, the strengths of the users include a good screen, 4G support and interesting body colors. </p>
