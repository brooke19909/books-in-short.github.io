In addition to canyons, the complex has something to surprise a tourist.  Having visited this wonderful place, you will see a picturesque gorge of a fast-running mountain river, a waterfall, the virgin nature of boxwood, tectonic faults of the earth and <span>karst caves.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="psaho river canyons" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/1398660.jpg" width="600"></div>  By the way, our ancestors once huddled in such caves.

    <h2>  Psaho River Canyons: Wet Canyon </h2><p>  Wet canyon Psaho is quite long and wide.  Its width can reach ten meters.  Rocky cliffs, awe inspiring tourists, overgrown with boxwood.  If you move down the river, you can see very beautiful karst channels, bathtubs, as well as small waterfalls.  Also, grottoes of fantastic beauty will amaze tourists.  The banks of the canyon are made up of huge layers of limestone, which always impress the guests of this place.  And the dense and lush vegetation of the subtropical forest complements an unprecedented picture. </p><h2>  Wet Canyon Pass </h2><p>  The canyons of the Psaho River are nature untouched by a human hand, therefore moving along them is not always easy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="psaho river canyon how to get" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/1398647.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For example, in a wet canyon, the height difference between its beginning and end is quite noticeable.  Walking through the canyon means overcoming dozens of stone ledges.  Some of them will need to jump, slide out on a special rope (sometimes straight into the water).  Yes, a lot of extreme sensations can give a tourist the Wet Canyon of the Psaho River.  Excursions here are very popular.  Some especially extreme tourists hike through the canyon right on the river, breaking through the rubble of logs, climbing on sharp stones.  If you are a supporter of a calm, but at the same time active recreation, just walk above the canyon along the river bank.  Of course, you will not see such beauties as inside a ledge, but you will still be satisfied. </p><h2>  Coastal walk along the Wet Canyon </h2><p>  Psaho River Canyon, the photo of which adorns this article, offers tourists a relaxing walk along the coast.  You can take a walk along the right high bank of Psaho in a real ancient boxwood forest.  The branches and trunks of trees are overgrown with moss, making the impression that the walk does not take place in Russia, but in some alien forest.  It looks incredibly beautiful! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="psaho adler river canyon" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/1398644.jpg" width="495"></div>  The rays of the sun do not break through the thick canopy from the crowns of fabulous boxwood.  In the dusk to step on the soft carpet of the forest, admiring the stumps, fallen trees - what could be more romantic ?!  So, walking and exploring the local beauty, you can get to the Kamensky stream - this is after about two kilometers.  This is the left tributary of the psaho.  The path here is divided into two: if you go straight, you will go out into the clearing with chairs and tables made of stone and a small waterfall with emerald water.  Turning to the right, you will leave on the path leading to the boxwood thicket.  After half an hour, go to the picturesque meadow with grazing cows.  Turn left - and now your eyes are the famous tectonic faults.  This is the famous canyon of the Psajo River.  Adler is a city that can offer you many excursions and entertainments, but you must visit this place!

It is located above the Psaho channel, a half hour walk from it.  And yet this is an extremely exciting, even bewitching place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="psaho river canyons get on your own" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/1398643.jpg" width="600"></div>  Being here, you never cease to be surprised at what Mother Nature can create.  The walls of the canyon are so steep that without special equipment it is better not to try to climb them.  In the narrowest place of the canyon, they almost close, leaving just a narrow strip of light above their heads.  Lush Colchis ivy, curling all over the wall, dilutes the mute stone.  By the way, the canyons of the Psakho River have long been chosen by athletes and mountaineering enthusiasts, people with equipment are often found here, traces of the hitch are noticeable.  The dry canyon has now become the object of Sochi Park, so tourists pay money before climbing freely on sheer stone walls.

    <h2>  Psaho River Canyons: easy to get on your own! </h2><p>  Psaho is the left tributary of the Kudepsta River.  Its total length is approximately 11 kilometers, and canyons stretch for 1.5 km.  It will be easy and convenient to come to local attractions with your own car.  You must go along the highway leading from the airport to Krasnaya Polyana. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="psaho river canyon photo" class="if" height="434" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/1398641.jpg" width="600"></div>  When you see a turn on the road to the village of Galitsino, turn left.  The path leads to the Ashkhtyr cave.  Turn according to the sign and drive another ten kilometers.  You will pass the village of Cossack Brod, Galitsino.  When two kilometers remain before the village of Lesnoy, you will see the sign "Psakho Canyon".  Turn left and walk another three kilometers.  There will be a ford across the Psaho River.  A little further along the left edge of the road is a picnic area with cafes and restaurants.  Right here you will see the entrance to the canyon of the Psaho River and the point of sale of tickets to Sochi Park.

    <h2>  Is it realistic to get to the canyon without having personal transport? </h2><p>  Many tourists are magnetically drawn to the canyon of the Psaho River.  How to get to this fabulous place without having a personal car? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="psaho river canyon excursions" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/1398640.jpg" width="600"></div>  To do this is not so difficult.  In Adler, take bus number 131. Get off at Kamenka-2 bus stop.  From this point, go down to the Psaho River.  First, your path will go along a convenient asphalt road, then along a less convenient dirt road.  The entire journey will take approximately 30 minutes.  A guide for you will serve as a holiday village, by which you will definitely pass.  Stay close to the high-voltage line too - you will see a transition to the other side of the river, a cafe zone and the entrance to the canyon itself.  Continue on the river.  Look carefully ahead.  As soon as you see a difficult place, go to the other side.
