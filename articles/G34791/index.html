In the early years of his work, there were few specialists in the clinic.  Today, about twelve physicians carry out their professional activities in the institution.  Clinic patients are provided with a wide selection of medical services.  This is not only consultations of specialists, but also various studies and analyzes, including genetic ones.  Organization services are in great demand among the population of the city of Petrozavodsk.  Therefore, the institution works seven days a week.  On weekdays, the clinic is open from nine in the morning until 21:00 in the evening.  On weekends, the institution is open from 11:00 to 19:00.  The gynecological clinic "Aphrodite" is located in Petrozavodsk at the address: Rovio street, 3. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="61.7639061" data-lng="34.38499639999998" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/3/2/9/329.png"></div><p>  The head of the organization is Grigoryev P.A. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Services and their cost </h2><p>  The clinic offers a large selection of various studies, as well as the opportunity to consult with high-class specialists. </p><p>  Prices for the services of this institution are very diverse.  For example, receiving a specialist in pathologies of the female reproductive system will cost patients 500 rubles.  The price of a blood test for the presence of parasites (giardia) is 300 r.  Early pregnancy screening costs 1200 rubles.  A genetic study on the risk of breast tumor formation will cost 2900 rubles.  Tests for establishing kinship cost from 12,000 to 20,000 p.  As for consultations of specialists in diseases of the female sphere, in ‚ÄúAphrodite‚Äù, the clinic of Petrozavodsk, you can make an appointment in advance by telephone at a time convenient for both the patient and the doctor. </p><div class="photo" data-original="test2.academweb.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gynecological examination room" class="if uuid-2239710" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59230/2239710.jpg"></div><p>  Despite the fact that patients in this institution are provided with a huge selection of medical services, their range is constantly replenished.  New types of medical care are described in the following sections of the article. </p><h2>  Pharmacological abortion service </h2><p>  As you know, abortion is always a stress for the body of any woman.  However, unlike abortion through surgery, taking medications that promote fetal rejection is considered a safer option.  At the Aphrodite Clinic in Petrozavodsk, patients who decide to have an abortion are encouraged to use it with drugs. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="yandex.uz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Street on which the institution is located" class="if uuid-2237987" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59230/2237987.jpg"></div><p>  Taking such medications does not imply anesthesia, as in the case of surgery.  In addition, with pharmacological abortion, damage to the uterus by various instruments does not occur, the risk of infection and incomplete extraction of the fetus is minimized.  The drugs that are used in this institution are modern, they do not upset the hormonal balance in the body.  Clinic staff do not advocate abortion.  They argue that before deciding on an abortion, every woman should think carefully about this step.  However, if the patient nevertheless needs it, she is given the opportunity to terminate the pregnancy in the safest way.  The cost of medical abortion in the clinic varies from 4,500 to 10,000 rubles.  The price includes laboratory tests, consultations and examinations of the doctor, taking medications and ultrasounds. </p><h2>  Psychologist's help </h2><p>  Recently, the Aphrodite Clinic in Petrozavodsk has launched a specialist consultation service regarding personal issues and problems.  The psychologist assists patients before medical abortion.  The specialist also advises clients with psychosomatic problems, pregnant women and their relatives, as well as young mothers.  Couples who have been diagnosed with problems with conception, disorders of sexual functions are turning to a psychologist.  The specialist works with cancer patients and their family members.  A person who suffers from difficulties in his personal life, problems with his relatives, work colleagues can also turn to a psychologist.  The price for the services of this specialist varies from 700 to 1400 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.avito.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Clinic building and its porch" class="if uuid-2237997" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59230/2237997.jpg"></div><h2>  Customer opinions about the institution </h2><p>  About the organization "Aphrodite" (clinic in Petrozavodsk) there are many positive reviews.
