This is one of the best hotels in this resort.  Nevertheless, he does not always justify his high status.  The five-star hotel was awarded, most likely, for the number of services provided, but not for the quality.  Therefore, if you expect a luxurious atmosphere in the rooms and delicacies for breakfast, then this hotel is not suitable for you.  Nevertheless, if you do not pay attention to small flaws, but want to enjoy a clean and warm sea, as well as friendly service, then safely book a tour. </p><p>  It is worth noting that for active youth in the Hotel Golden Bay Beach <span>(Cyprus, Larnaca) there is</span> not so much entertainment.  In addition, it is located quite far from the center of Larnaca.  This option is most often chosen by families with children, since it is for young tourists that a lot of opportunities are provided here.  Also, this is a great option for people who want to relax from the bustle of the city and admire the beautiful sea views, and just lovers of a calm and measured pastime. </p>
