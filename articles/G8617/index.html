Here you can see how amazingly tall skyscrapers tread on dilapidated concrete boxes with their huge ‚Äúpaws‚Äù.  In Manila, a lot of people live - the population density is literally going wild.  But there are many attractions in the Philippine capital. </p>

    <h2>  Fortress Intramuros </h2><p>  It is recommended to start sightseeing in Manila with Intramuros.  The name translates from Spanish "inside the walls."  This is a fortress that appeared in the second half of the XVI century in order to protect the Spanish colonists from Chinese pirates.  The complex grew for two centuries, but was badly damaged during the Second World War.  But here the charm of antiquity has remained.  Inside the fortress there are many different buildings: houses, museums, hotels, restaurants and so on.  On one side, Fort Santiago adjoins Intramuros. </p><h2>  Bahai Qina Historical Museum </h2><p>  It is located in Intramuros and is intended mainly to talk about the relationship between the Chinese and Filipino minorities, to provide tourists with information about the life of the local people, their culture and way of life.  Here is one huge collection, which is divided into several topics.  Expositions talk about the first contacts between Chinese settlers and Filipinos, about life during the period of the Spanish colonial regime.  There are also many drawings, photos, samples of furniture, ceramics, art objects and rare sea shells. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Jose Risal Park </h2><p>  A gloomy place, if you know its history.  Once this territory was completely cleared of vegetation in order to protect the southern approach to Intramuros.  In the 1900s, executions of objectionable citizens were carried out here.  How many people took their lives - only God knows.  Among the unfortunate was Jose Risal (or Risal) - the national hero of the Philippines, an outstanding poet and writer.  Therefore, when a park appeared with a botanical pavilion, a museum, monuments and a mausoleum with the remains of a hero, he was given the name Risal. </p><h2>  Malakanang Palace </h2><p>  Visiting the sights of Manila, it is recommended not to lose sight of this charming mansion built in 1750 especially for Don Luis Roch - the Spanish aristocrat.  The palace looks quite luxurious.  It is made in the Spanish style, which is reflected both in the interior and exterior of the building.  And the interior is still a certain event in the life of the state.  For example, the Main Staircase is hung with portraits of conquistadors.  There are also several halls: Heroes, Receptions and Ceremonial. </p>

    <h2>  Aristocratic Mansion Casa Manila </h2><p>  Casa Manila today is a museum.  But initially the building was built for an aristocratic family.  The following can be said about this attraction of Manila: the house is perfectly preserved, although it was built in the 19th century.  Inside and out, if you look closely, you can see many interesting details.  For example, carved balconies, inscriptions, reliefs.  And the interior of the building is completely preserved, beginning with the decor and ending with the design style. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Manila Cathedral </h2><p>  The Basilica of the <span>Immaculate Conception</span> is the current Catholic temple and the residence of the Filipino archbishop.

    <h2>  Tahanang Filipino, or Coconut Palace </h2><p>  It was built on the initiative of the wife of a politician in the Philippines specifically for the Pope in 1981.  Then the construction of such a building cost the treasury $ 10 million.  But the Pope found this house ‚Äúindecent‚Äù, and refused to stop there.  Why Coconut?  Sources about this attraction of Manila claim that it was erected from a palm tree and coconut shell.  The palace is located in the cultural center of Malate. </p><h2>  Philippines Cultural Center </h2><p>  This place is a large concert and exhibition hall, which was created specifically to preserve, develop and popularize national art.  There are several libraries, theater stages and galleries, there is even a museum. </p>

    <h2>  Binondo Historic District </h2><p>  Manila (Philippines) has on its territory a Chinese historical quarter, in which you can penetrate the atmosphere by 100%.  Chinese lanterns, bright signs and street vendors selling exotic fruits form a unique flavor here.  Binondo has Buddhist temples and the Catholic Church, business centers and financial institutions.  In general, life is in full swing, as in the rest of Manila. </p><h2>  City Observatory </h2><p>  The old Manila Observatory was built in 1865 by the Jesuits to predict typhoons.  It is located on the campus of Quezon City University.  The branch was once equipped at 5,000 feet above sea level, but it was interrupted by World War II.  All tools were destroyed during the Battle of Manila. </p><h2>  Manila reviews </h2><p>  The city of Manila (Philippines) surprises tourists with its unusualness.  These are not just contrasts.  Here, guests of the Philippine capital have the opportunity to encounter interesting moments.  For example, on one of the sites a girl described how warmly local people relate to Russia.  They do not just know that there is such a country.  They know where she is, who is her supreme commander, even ask questions about the collapse of the USSR. </p><p>  In general, if you have the opportunity to visit Manila, do not give up such a chance.  However, it is worth saying that many tourists were not enthusiastic about the sights.  Manila Bay and the beauty of nature gave much more pleasant impressions. </p>
