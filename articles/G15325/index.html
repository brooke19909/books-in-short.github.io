The Patom crater, or ‚ÄúMountain Eagle's Nest‚Äù, was discovered in the middle of the 20th century.  Geologist Vadim Kolpakov then did not even imagine that much public attention would be concentrated around his discovery.  The mystery of the Patom crater is that there are several versions of its formation, none of which have found more or less convincing evidence. </p>

    <h2>  The history of the discovery of the Siberian crater: how it was </h2><p>  The history of the discovery of an unusual geological formation in the Siberian taiga is very unusual.  The Patom crater, whose photo is not so often, but can still be seen in the media, was initially accepted by Vadim Kolpakov and the group of geologists making up the geological map of the region as a normal mirage. </p>

    <p>  Everything happened in the summer, the weather was very hot.  The huge-sized object, resembling a pyramid, was later classified by scientists as a mine waste heap, but no signs of mining near it were found.  It was then, in 1949, that Vadim Kolpakov realized that the Patom crater was something unusual.  He put forward several hypotheses regarding the reasons for its formation: the emergence of a new volcano, a trace of a fallen meteorite, or radioactive reactions proceeding in the depths. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  First hypothesis: meteorite fall </h2><p>  The first expedition set off to explore the Patomsky crater, the coordinates of which were recorded by Kolpakov, was collected only after almost 15 years - in 1963.  It was then that the size of this atypical geological object was established, and materials were collected that could shed light on its origin.  However, even this did not help to determine with certainty why such a large crater formed in the midst of the greening hills overgrown with conifers. </p>

    <p>  Signs in favor of a meteorite fall were such as the shape of the crater and the angle of its slopes.  At the same time, no signs of meteorite rocks were found at the bottom of the giant funnel.  Even the completed two-hundred-meter pit did not help researchers find any evidence that speaks of a space wake. </p><h2>  Volcano or ... </h2><p>  The second, at first, convincing version of why the Pathom crater appeared in the taiga is volcanic activity.  However, taking into account the structure of the <span>tectonic plate,</span> as well as the lack of seismic activity in this area in the last few centuries, scientists were forced to abandon this hypothesis.  In addition, the newly-born volcano (the shape of the crater most suited this definition) could not immediately cease to exist, but would continue to eject characteristic rocks and gases from its bowels, as usually happens during their nucleation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  The echo of the Tunguska meteorite? </h2><p>  The next version of the origin of the crater was put forward several decades later by A.M. Portnov.  Gathering another expedition to explore the Patom crater (2013), the scientist tried to find the ‚ÄúTunguska track‚Äù.  The fact is that this formation was very similar to another object located on a straight line between the Patom crater and the place where the Tunguska meteorite supposedly fell.  However, this version very quickly failed, as larch trees growing on the slopes of an unusual geological formation grew there much earlier than a meteorite fell on <span>the Tunguska River</span> (by about 130-150 years).  Based on these facts, scientists rejected the version of the connection of the meteorite and such a geological formation as the Patom crater.  2014 also did not open anything new, except, perhaps, the ‚Äúradioactive trace‚Äù. </p><h2>  <span>Nuclear reaction</span> or something else? </h2><p>  Despite the stable <span>background radiation</span> in the region of an inexplicably arising geological formation, there is a version that the <span>decay of radioactive</span> substances could initiate its appearance.  The saw cuts from trees made during the next expedition allowed scientists to find out that the Patomsky crater has a certain connection with them.  Annual layers of larches growing in close proximity to it contained isotopes.  Judging by the exact annual increments in which <span>radioactive substances</span> were localized <span>,</span> experts established an approximate date for the surge in such activity: approximately 1845.  All this prompted geologists and other specialists to think about the possible involvement in this matter of flying objects from other planets that used uranium as fuel. </p>

    <h2>  Alien trail </h2><p>  According to some scientists, the Patom crater in the Irkutsk region could have arisen as a result of a collision of a cylindrical object with the Earth.  Why precisely cylindrical?  Firstly, the depth of the crater indicates a fairly deep penetration of the body into the rocks, and this is typical for such forms of falling objects.  Secondly, no stones and fragments were found around the crater, which, when cylindrical objects fall, almost always appear in large quantities.  The hypothesis is based on the fact that the cylinder, after penetrating to a depth of about 300 meters, came across a gas pocket, as a result of which the rocks crushed by it were squeezed to the surface.  To date, this version is considered one of the most plausible, and the lack of evidence of the fall of a space object is explained by the fact that in the 18th century (the established date for the emergence of the Patom crater) this area was not populated. </p>

    <h2>  Yakut legends about the Patom crater </h2><p>  Be that as it may, the Patom crater has long been known throughout the district.  The locals who call it the ‚ÄúMountain Eagle's Nest‚Äù have many legends and traditions associated with this place.  They say that near it people have an inexplicable feeling of fear, sadness or doom.  Everyone who once settled next to him soon died: they committed suicide or were torn to pieces by bears.  Of course, for taiga such cases may be common, but only in winter or early spring.  However, inexplicable events happen in the vicinity of the Patom Crater: bears attack in the summer, which is not typical for them. </p><p>  Members of geological expeditions heading to this place also witnessed unexplained events.  So, in 2004, on the approach to the crater, unexpectedly for all, the Irkutsk geologist Evgeny Vorobyov died.  As it turned out later, he had a heart attack, although before the researcher did not complain about his heart.  Of course, this event can be attributed to ordinary fatigue due to a long transition through the taiga, but other members of the expedition also felt very uncomfortable. </p><p>  Despite the fact that a huge amount of facts, materials and other information was collected that could shed light on the origin of the Patom crater, the story with it is just beginning.  It is possible that over the years, geologists, anthropologists and scientists from other areas will be able to find out how this miracle appeared in the middle of the deep taiga. </p>
