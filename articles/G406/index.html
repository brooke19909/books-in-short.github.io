This article will discuss how to make a Little Red Riding Hood costume for adults and children with their own hands.  Let's get started! </p><h2>  What is the Little Red Riding Hood costume made of? </h2><p>  The main details of clothing for a suit: </p><ul><li>  scarlet skirt; </li><li>  snow-white blouse; </li><li>  black corset; </li><li>  white apron; </li><li>  red cap or cape with a hood; </li><li>  basket. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Red Riding Hood costume" class="if uuid-2544015" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62827/2544015.jpg"></div><h2>  Sewing hats </h2><p>  The main item in the Little Red Riding Hood costume for the girl is the bonnet.  Before starting work, it is necessary to prepare the following materials: </p><ul><li>  red silk fabric (50 by 50 cm); </li><li>  white lace (width no more than two centimeters) and silk ribbon; </li><li>  threads (red); </li><li>  a piece of thin foam. </li></ul><p>  Description (how to make a <span>pattern of a red cap</span> for a costume, occipital part): </p><ol><li>  A rectangle is drawn on a sheet of white paper, where the length is 25 cm and the width is 16 cm. </li><li>  The corners of the geometric shape are denoted by the letters (A, B, C, D). </li><li>  From points A and D (in the inner part of the rectangle), measure 1.5 cm and are denoted by the letters D and D1. </li><li>  The sides AB, BV and VG are divided in half, the resulting points indicate E, E1, E2. </li><li>  Angles B and C are also divided in half by a dashed line, the length of which does not exceed one centimeter.  New points denote O and O1. </li><li>  They begin to connect the dots with each other in a smooth line (D, E, O, E1, O1, E2, D1, D). </li><li>  The finished pattern is applied to a piece of fabric, outlined with chalk and carefully cut. </li><li>  For the form, foam rubber is sewn to the occipital part, the crown part should be less than three centimeters. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY Little Red Riding Hood costume" class="if uuid-2544065" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62827/2544065.jpg"></div><p>  Side part: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  A rectangle is again drawn on a piece of paper, where it is 50 centimeters long and 10 cm wide. </li><li>  The finished pattern is applied to the fabric, outlined with chalk and carefully cut. </li></ol><p>  Visor: </p><ol><li>  Draw a triangle of the same size as on the side of the cap.  Corners are denoted by the letters Zh, Z. I, K. </li><li>  The sides are divided in half (LC, ZH and ZI), the resulting points indicate L, L1, L2. </li><li>  From points L1 and L2, a dashed line ten centimeters long is drawn inside the rectangle.  The resulting points indicate M1 and M2. </li><li>  Between themselves, a smooth line connects the points K, M1, L, M2, I. </li><li>  The finished drawing is transferred to the fabric and carefully cut.  It will take two such details. </li></ol><p>  We sew all the details: </p><ol><li>  Two parts of the visor are stitched together so that the seams are hidden in the inner part. </li><li>  The occipital and lateral parts are sutured when connecting parts in the crown region; several folds are made (depth not more than one centimeter). </li><li>  A visor is sewn to the side of the cap. </li><li>  The rounded part of the visor is decorated with white lace. </li><li>  A silk ribbon is sewn to the bottom of the bonnet, while free ends are left from the side portions. </li></ol><h2>  Cape with a hood </h2><p>  A cap in a Little Red Riding Hood costume for a girl (it‚Äôs easy to make it with your own hands) can be replaced with a wrap that will complement the look in an original way.  An important nuance: the fabric for sewing should be in the same color scheme with the skirt. </p><div class="photo" data-original="brightappleblossom.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY Little Red Riding Hood costume for a girl" class="if uuid-2544054" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62827/2544054.jpg"></div><p>  Step-by-step instruction: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  First you need to decide on the length (at least to the waist). </li><li>  A circle is cut out of the prepared fabric, where the diameter of the outer circumference is equal to the length of the cape, and the inner circumference is several centimeters more than the circumference of the neck. </li><li>  The finished circle of fabric is folded in half and cut, but on the one hand and along the entire length (from bottom to neck). </li><li>  For convenience, you can circle the hood from the jacket or windcheater, since the hood for the cape should be free, you need to make a reserve. </li><li>  You should get two identical parts of the hood.  Then they are applied to each other with their faces inward and stitched together. </li><li>  Measure the bottom edge of the hood with a centimeter and cut the corners of the neckline on the cape so that the edges of the two parts of the product coincide. </li><li>  The front sides of each other are connected over sections of the neck of the cape and the lower part of the hood (they must match in length) and sew. </li><li>  Next, the edges of the cloak and hood are treated, for this they are slightly bent and stitched. </li><li>  To prevent the cloak from sliding off the shoulders, stitches are sewn on both sides of the neckline.  You can also fix it with a beautiful brooch or sew on a button. </li></ol><p>  The cap for the Little Red Riding Hood costume is ready. </p><h2>  Skirt </h2><p>  For the Little Red Riding Hood costume, the ideal option is a sun skirt, which is very easy to sew on your own: </p><ol><li>  First of all, you should measure the waist circumference and determine the length. </li><li>  Two circles are drawn on the prepared piece of fabric (inner for the waist and outer). </li><li>  Leave allowances of a couple of centimeters for the seam. </li><li>  After the circles are cut out, bend the fabric underneath and stitch the hem. </li><li>  The fabric in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe belt is bent for a couple of centimeters, the elastic is stitched and inserted. </li></ol><p>  To make the skirt luxuriant, a petticoat is sewn from snow-white tulle, it should look a little out from under the main product. </p><div class="photo" data-original="awesterlyfold.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Red Riding Hood costume" class="if uuid-2544022" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62827/2544022.jpg"></div><h2>  Apron </h2><p>  To sew an apron and complement the Little Red Riding Hood costume (made with your own hands) is very easy.  A semi-oval is cut from the selected white fabric.  The edges of the product are hemmed and hemmed, and the ties are attached at the top.  Original apron will look if sheathed with lace. </p><h2>  Which blouse to choose? </h2><p>  For a Little Red Riding Hood costume, a white blouse with both a short sleeve and a long one is suitable.  If the choice fell on a long sleeve, it should be wide and with assembly in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe wrist.  When choosing blouses with short sleeves are ideally combined with the image of a sleeve in the form of flashlights. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY Little Red Riding Hood costume" class="if uuid-2544046" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62827/2544046.jpg"></div><p>  We sew a blouse with our own hands: </p><ol><li>  On the piece of paper they draw a pattern of a bodice (you can simply circle a T-shirt that fits in size). </li><li>  A paper pattern is applied to a white fabric and is circled around the edges with a simple pencil, do not forget about allowances for seams. </li><li>  A zipper lock is sewn on the back. </li><li>  Details of the front and back are stitched together on the sides and around the shoulders. </li><li>  We pass to tailoring of sleeves.  Two details in the form of wings of the required height are cut out of the fabric.  No more than two centimeters recede from the edge and a thin elastic is sewn to the wrong side.  The upper part of the sleeve is sewn into the armhole of the blouse. </li></ol><h2>  Corset </h2><p>  The main feature in the Little Red Riding Hood costume for the girl (you can do this detail with your own hands too) is that every detail of the wardrobe is important and the corset is no exception.  For its manufacture, you will need a pattern of a wide belt, for a form inside put a dense cardboard.  A black satin is best.  Thin stitches are sewn along the edges of the product, which are made of the same material as the corset itself. </p><h2>  Vest </h2><p>  You can <span>take a</span> blouse <span>pattern as a</span> basis.  From black fabric should be two parts: front and back.  Further: </p><ol><li>  The front part is folded in half and a strip is cut out, this is necessary so that there is a gap between the sides, and the lacing looks more spectacular. </li><li>  On the front parts you need to make a deep cut. </li><li>  Next, the side and shoulder seams of two parts are stitched. </li><li>  They process all the edges, for this they bend and carefully stitch them. </li><li>  Small lace holes are made in front of the edges. </li></ol><h2>  Red Riding Hood costume for adults </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.halloweencostumes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Red Riding Hood costume for adults" class="if uuid-2544061" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62827/2544061.jpg"></div><p>  To create an image, some details can be selected from your own wardrobe: </p><ol><li>  When choosing a skirt, the main condition is that it should not be straight. </li><li>  Lace cuffs will help to give an effect to a regular blouse; they are suitable for both short and long sleeves.  To do this, a triangle is cut out of white fabric, lace is sewn with layers for splendor.  Such cuffs should be fastened around the wrists with a button. </li><li>  The cap can be replaced with a beret, it will look very original. </li><li>  Another important detail is the lace apron.  Both white and black are suitable, because these colors are in perfect harmony with the red skirt.  Sewing it is not difficult.  A semicircle is cut out of the fabric and the edges are treated, then a wide satin ribbon is sewn to the upper part. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.bolshoyvopros.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pattern of a red cap for a suit" class="if uuid-2545111" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62827/2545111.jpg"></div><p>  Details of the costume can be decorated with flowers, beads if desired.  When making a Little Red Riding Hood costume with your own hands, do not be afraid to experiment. </p>
