The rules for processing such loans are described in the article. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  The provision of loans with collateral in the form of motor transport is called car loans.  In a standard loan, collateral will be a new or used car purchased by the borrower.  It remains only to choose a profitable harm against the security of TCP.  Reviews show that this method allows you to issue even a large amount.  At the same time, the borrower can dispose of his transport. </p>

    <p>  There are 2 types of loans secured by cars: </p><ol><li>  A pledge of documents, and the car is taken from the borrower and remains in a special parking lot at the bank to pay the debt. </li><li>  Pledge of TCP, and the car is encumbered.  In this case, the owner cannot, for example, sell the transport without the permission of the creditor, but you can use it. </li></ol><p>  According to reviews, a loan secured by a TCP of the second type is the most profitable.  On the Russian market, 4-5 offers of developed banks are available that can arrange such loans.  Many programs operate from car dealers and pawnshops, but the conditions are different from those offered by the bank.  The difference usually lies in terms and rates. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Pros and cons </h2><p>  According to customer reviews, a loan secured by TCP has the following advantages: </p><ol><li>  Fast application processing speed. </li><li>  Getting a large amount. </li><li>  Reduced rates when compared with consumer loans. </li></ol>

    <p>  Sometimes it is necessary to pay for the work of an appraiser, but often lenders manage this independently.  According to reviews, applications are considered within 1 business day. </p><h2>  Vehicle Requirements </h2><p>  It is important to comply with the requirements for cars, otherwise the application will not be approved.  Many lenders offer loans for cars, trucks, and special equipment.  For example, the Orient Express only accepts B-category cars.  Since most customers provide cars as collateral, the requirements for this transport should be considered: </p><ol><li>  Age - from 19 years for foreign and 7 years - for Russian. </li><li>  Property of an individual or individual entrepreneur. </li><li>  There are coupons for passing inspection. </li><li>  It is not a burden, a pledge. </li></ol><p>  Estimated value is determined based on the current market price of such models.  The maximum amount is up to 70%. </p><h2>  Registration for legal entities </h2><p>  How to get a loan secured by TCP?  Reviews confirm that this is not difficult.  It is enough to choose an acceptable program and apply.  With a positive decision, a loan agreement is drawn up.  Legal entities, as well as individuals, can choose the above programs.  But loans are provided at Sberbank and other financial organizations. </p>

    <p>  The requirements for collateral for legal entities are the same, the difference is that the TS must be on the balance sheet of the organization.  Transport assessment is paid by the client.  Rates will be less, but slightly - from 11.9%. </p><h2>  Refusal cases </h2><p>  Often, banks refuse to grant loans.  They need liquid collateral, that is, those that have market demand.  Failure may occur in the following cases: </p><ol><li>  Machine malfunction.  Transport repair will be more expensive than the sale of funds.  Bank age requirements differ. </li><li>  The arrest of a car.  If the transport is arrested, then such security will not be accepted.  A car will not be happy if it is bought on credit, but not yet redeemed. </li><li>  The borrower is not the owner of the machine.  Foreign cars, which are in the management by proxy, also can not be accepted as collateral. </li></ol><p>  It is important to take into account many nuances before applying for a loan secured by a car.  A transaction will be beneficial only if an offer is selected on acceptable terms. </p><h2>  Nuances </h2><p>  The difficulties that may arise with such lending relate to the low appraised value of the vehicle.  If the car costs 1.2 million rubles, then 500-600 thousand rubles will be provided.  But the advantage of the loan is that the machine can be used.  Often, such loans are the only solution when money is urgently needed, and banks refuse to receive it. </p>

    <p>  During the process of obtaining a loan usually there are no special difficulties, as lenders also have limitations in their activities.  And getting a loan at a pawnshop or from a private person can cause problems.  Restoring TCP to the owner will not be a problem, so there is a risk for banks. </p><p>  Thus, there are several proposals for these types of loans.  Each client can consider several programs, and then choose the most suitable one. </p>
