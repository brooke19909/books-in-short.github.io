    <p>  Holidays in the Turkish city of Side is very popular for several years.  This is facilitated by beautiful local nature, well-groomed beaches, bright sun and a huge amount of entertainment for every taste.  It is also pleasant that <span>Side hotels</span> offer their services at reasonable prices, while their level is either close to ideal or is such.  It is worth noting that there are several dozen first-class hotels in the city, each of which deserves special attention.  Today I will introduce you to the verano phoenix family resort, which, on the one hand, is famous for its excellent service, and on the other hand, many tourists have not the most pleasant memories associated with visiting it.  But first things first. </p><p>  Verano phoenix family 4 is located on the seafront, 3 km from Side and 75 km from Antalya.  Some time ago the hotel had a completely different name: "Club Verano".  The hotel was founded in 1988, and the first restoration took place in 2006, thanks to which the hotel has slightly changed its external and internal appearance.  On the territory of 30,000 m2 there are 120 standard rooms, 28 single rooms, 142 rooms for a family vacation, as well as various services designed to make your vacation pleasant and varied.  Speaking generally about the rooms, they are quite cozy and comfortable.  Equipped with bath, shower, TV, <span>air conditioning, minibar,</span> safe, telephone, and some have Internet access.  What pleases is the presence of a balcony and terrace, which offers a beautiful view of the hotel and the beach. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The verano phoenix family resort service is well developed: 2 restaurants, 3 bars, several shops where you can buy anything, daily, pools, including children‚Äôs, <span>water slides,</span> hairdresser, sauna, beauty salon, billiards, table tennis, mini club and much more.  If we talk about children's vacations at the hotel, then it will certainly be interesting and memorable.  It should be noted that for the entertainment of children there is a children's playground and a water slide, and restaurants, in turn, offer balanced baby food. </p><p>  Sports activities deserve special attention: those who wish can play <span>beach volleyball,</span> tennis, chess or go diving and show their abilities in windsurfing. </p><p>  Own beach can not please tourists, in addition, just 100 meters from the hotel there is a sea.  The sandy beach of verano phoenix family resort is equipped with everything you might need during your vacation: sun loungers, umbrellas, mattresses, changing rooms, small fast food outlets, etc. </p><p>  It would seem that such a high level, which the hotel managers declare, cannot but rejoice.  True, there is one small ‚Äúbut‚Äù: verano phoenix family resort reviews of those who have already managed to relax in this place.  To be honest, not all of them are impressive.  For example, one of the former guests of this hotel said that there is no level of service.  The rooms are dirty, for the entire time of rest they were cleaned a couple of times.  There are insects flying around the hotel, which, in theory, should not be there.  The food is terrible and not varied.  Instead of natural juice, some kind of liquid is served (most likely UPI), it was rare to count on warm food.  It was boring, since the declared entertainment programs were practically not carried out. </p><p>  Another review of verano phoenix family resort, which caught my eye, is very similar in some respects to the previous one, so I will list only some points: the meat was most often served in boiled form (and I really wanted to roast it), the lack of a bar (it was just starting to be built ), monotonous children's programs, household appliances in the rooms for the most part did not work. </p><p>  There are a lot of such negative reviews.  However, after reading the positive reviews (and they are also available), you begin to doubt a little that this is not real: the hotel itself or the reviews of those who rested in it.  Just while some are terrified of the verano phoenix family resort, others say "thank you" for a fun and varied vacation.  Well, it is up to you to decide whether you are ready to spend your holidays at this hotel. </p>
