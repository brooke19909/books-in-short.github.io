And this is not surprising.  Since it is located almost in the center of Nha Trang resort, and not in the park or in the vicinity, it can be attributed to the city.  But proximity to the sea suggests that people come here not so much on business or on a business trip, but on vacation.  Why?  Now let's figure it out. </p><h2>  Tours in Nha Trang </h2><p>  This name is familiar to all lovers of sea holidays.  After all, this city is the king of Vietnamese beaches.  Three of them are considered the best in the country.  In addition, the bay in which this resort is located is literally dotted with small islands, which, in addition to the exceptional beauty of the landscape, is also of practical importance - the waves on the shore are not so large, so the average and even beginner swimmer can feel safe. </p>

    <p>  In addition, excellent weather reigns here all year round, although typhoons sometimes come over.  But there is no pronounced rainy season.  Therefore, tours are often organized in Nha Trang - beach, sightseeing, wellness, diving.  Often, the Golden Dragon Hotel 2 * becomes the base for travelers who have chosen a package vacation with an operator.  Pegast ("Pegas Touristik") and other companies, as a rule, offer accommodation in this hotel for a week, ten nights or fourteen days. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Nha Trang Hotels </h2><p>  As in any resort, there are chic five-star palaces, for example, the famous "Winperl Resort" or a hotel located in the former villa of the last emperor Bao Dai.  Three- and four-star hotels, as a rule, have a large territory, good infrastructure and excellent breakfasts, but they are not very cheap.  Therefore, the most popular and popular in the resort are mini-hotels, such as Golden Dragon Hotel 2 * (Vietnam, Nha Trang).  They can provide customers with almost the same amenities as treshki, but at a lower price.  They are located in quiet places and are aimed not at wealthy tourists, but at local residents. </p><h2>  How to get there and what is nearby? </h2><p>  To come to Nha Trang, you first need to get to Ho Chi Minh City.  From Russia to this city flights of many airlines fly, both direct and with transfers.  From there you can get on local planes to Kamran Airport, and a transfer will deliver you to the hotel.  Another option is to use the services of intercity buses, and they will take you to Nha Trang not only from Ho Chi Minh City, but also from Hanoi.  The railway connection is well developed here.  Not only ordinary trains, but also express trains run from Ho Chi Minh City to Nha Trang and back. </p>

    <p>  This hotel is located in the southern part of Nha Trang, in a comfortable and picturesque area, built up with fairly budget hotels.  There are very clean and relatively deserted beaches.  Tue Tinh Lane, on which the Golden Dragon Hotel 2 * stands, is very quiet and calm, and walking from the hotel to the sea is just a few minutes.  Tourists consider this location to be very successful.  Opposite the lane is the so-called Gorky Park with rides and pools.  The center is about seven minutes walk. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The hotel is a five-story building with an elevator.  Near it is a pond where the turtle lives.  Near the hotel you can find a cheap and good massage parlor, as well as an excellent coffee shop, open from half past six in the morning.  Literally through two streets there is a night market, which is open daily. </p><h2>  The settlement of tourists </h2><p>  This hotel is small, there are only twenty rooms where guests live.  Rooms at Golden Dragon Hotel 2 * are divided into three categories.  The cheapest have an area of ‚Äã‚Äã18 square meters.  Standard and improved larger.  Accordingly, their sizes are 22 and thirty meters.  But their equipment is practically no different.  Cheap rooms without balconies, so linen is difficult to dry there. </p>

    <p>  The standard apartments have shared balconies for several rooms, while the superior ones have their own.  Everywhere there is a television with cable channels (including two Russian), bathrooms with hot water, showers and bathtubs, and wireless Internet is available.  Good toiletries, including even toothbrushes.  There is a safe and two fans.  Minibars are paid.  Bed sheets and towels are changed constantly, without any reminders.  The cleaning is excellent.  At first give one towel, but if you ask for more, report.  If you do not have flip flops on the beach, they will be issued to you.  From the windows you can see the mountains, and from the upper floors you can also enjoy the sea. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Service and infrastructure </h2><p>  The Golden Dragon Hotel 2 * has a reception, you can park a car.  If you are not arriving in an organized group, the hotel staff will be happy to bring you from the airport and deliver you back.  At the reception you can book tours or tickets.  Here you will be taken to the laundry and do it very high quality.  Motorbike rental works, and without any collateral.

    <p>  Placed in a hotel quickly, in ten to fifteen minutes.  At late check-out, you can check in your luggage.  There are free computers in the lobby.  The staff practically does not speak Russian, but it is easy to communicate with him.  All issues are resolved very quickly.  If there are a lot of people, and Wi-Fi is weak, put additional routers.  Whether the lamp burns out, whether the sewage system becomes clogged, they will do everything in half an hour.  In addition, the hotel staff will answer you all questions that are not even related to hotel service - for example, where is it located and how cheaper is it to make purchases.  At night, the gates close, so that outsiders will not enter the territory. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The hotel Golden Dragon Hotel 2 * (Nha Trang) has its own restaurant.  The chefs will not only prepare Vietnamese dishes for you, but also serve the delicacies of any Asian country.  But eating here is expensive, so tourists mostly go to neighboring cafes - it‚Äôs good not to count them in this area.  Travelers who visited the hotel say that they tried everything from street hot dogs to quite expensive restaurants, and were satisfied.  After all, in Vietnam you can eat something that you will never be offered anywhere else - a crocodile, ostrich, snakes, as well as oysters, outlandish fish and much more. </p>

    <p>  For those who are going to stay at Golden Dragon Hotel 2 *, reviews by experienced travelers recommend trying typical Vietnamese food seasoned with spices and lemongrass, fish namik mam and fish soup in dozens of varied options.  In addition, in the hotel kitchen you can cook yourself - you will be given dishes and everything you need. </p><h2>  Sea vacation </h2><p>  We can say that this hotel is on the second line.  The exit from it to the public beach is very clean and well maintained.  The location bonus is that on the nearest coast there are almost the cheapest sunbeds in Nha Trang - 35 thousand dong each, while a little further - already at 100. The sea is deep, the entrance is not very gentle, but not steep, there are waves, but you can relax here even with children.  The sand is multi-colored, consisting of microscopic fragments of shells, as elsewhere in Nha Trang.  Despite the fact that the beach is public, even the most demanding tourist will find a lot of entertainment, including water.  It is worth noting that the most gorgeous beaches of these places are located outside the city - thirty to sixty kilometers from the center of Nha Trang. </p><p>  On the territory of the Golden Dragon Hotel 2 * hotel itself (Vietnam) there is a freshwater pool.  It is located on the fourth floor of the hotel.  But you won‚Äôt be able to sunbathe there, because the pool is located on the shady side.  Near it there are sun loungers, benches and tables.  The pool is open until late, and so young people spend romantic evenings with a bottle of wine there.  In addition, there is a jacuzzi and various ‚Äúsmart‚Äù appliances.  The pool was built by a French company using the latest technology.  You can go to the beach with towels from your room. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Taxi rides in Nha Trang are very cheap.  If you know how to ride a motorbike, then the excursions will turn out even more budget.  Hotel guests highly recommend local mineral springs such as One Hundred Eggs, Young Bay and Tha Ba.  A must-see for holidaymakers in this Vietnamese resort is Wingerle Island, where <span>the world's longest cable car</span> leads <span>.</span>  But it‚Äôs better to go there yourself, and not to buy a specially designed tour from a tour operator.  Children especially like it, because the island has the largest amusement park in Vietnam. </p>

    <p>  In the city itself, it is advised to visit the Longshon Pagoda with a Buddha statue, a 13th-century tower and the Nha Trang Catholic Cathedral.  And of course, do not forget about traveling by boat or speedboats to the islands.  If you are lucky enough to embark on such a trip in the morning, you can see how local fishermen sail to their boats in large tarred baskets of ‚Äúthun chai‚Äù.  The islands themselves are a paradise for divers.  There are many species of tropical fish swimming among corals. </p><h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  The guests of Golden Dragon Hotel 2 * (Nha Trang) are transporting sea and river pearls, cheap silver and sapphires, high-quality clothes and shoes (including European brands, but made in Vietnam at lower prices), and silk.  From the products you should buy excellent local tea and coffee beans.  There are plenty of shops and shops with all these goods in Nha Trang.  There are also large European-style supermarkets.  To buy cheaper souvenirs, you need to specifically go to the Cho Dam or My Moi market.  There you can find, among other things, at good prices crocodile and snake skin products, famous pearls, fruits. </p><h2>  Golden Dragon Hotel 2 * (Vietnam): reviews </h2><p>  Tourists leave very good feedback about this hotel, despite its low star rating.  It is clean, comfortable, the rooms are pretty decent and large, the beds are comfortable, after them the back does not hurt, the staff is polite and helpful.  Young people liked that not only the sea was nearby, but also the night club held by immigrants from Russia, and even the European quarter was within easy reach. </p>

    <p>  When choosing from the most economical options - this is one of the best hotels in its category.  At the entrance there is no crowd of people, quiet and calm.  Travelers are advised to choose more expensive rooms with private balconies.  Vacationers believe that the hotel deserves three stars, and for two it is simply magnificent.  Therefore, most guests recommend it to other tourists. </p>
