The country is actively building townhouses, budget houses for relocation from dilapidated housing, as well as cozy and convenient residential complexes that combine many functions at the same time.  The modern <span>residential complex (LCD)</span> includes not only spacious new apartments, but also the entire social infrastructure, allowing residents to stay almost no further than their yard to visit the gym or to give laundry to the laundry.  It is such functionality that provides them with incredible popularity, in most cases apartments are sold out at the construction stage.  This happened with the Yantarny residential complex, but so far it has been of interest to Muscovites, and in the case of an advertisement for the sale of an apartment in this house, it does not go unnoticed for more than five days.  In our article we will tell you about the house itself, apartments, their layout and give some photos of the complex. </p>

    <h2>  Description of the residential complex </h2><p>  LCD "Amber" in Moscow is located in a very picturesque area, it appeals to a lot of citizens, despite the fact that it is located at a considerable distance from the center.  The house belongs to the Losinoostrovsky district and is located opposite the beautiful Babushkinsky park.  Residents in reviews always mention how clean the air is here and what an incredibly beautiful view opens from the windows of apartments on the upper floors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  LCD "Amber" is a single house on sixteen floors, built of brick.  It is located on Amber Drive at number nine, because of this, this complex is popularly called the "House on Amber Drive". </p><p>  The house has one hundred and twenty-one apartments with a total living area of ‚Äã‚Äãalmost six thousand square meters.  In addition to residential premises, there are sixty non-residential premises in the Yantarny residential complex.  They are located mainly on the ground floor, and now most of the infrastructure is located here, such as gyms, cafes, laundries and the like. </p><p>  LCD "Amber" was commissioned in 2009, but so far the interest in apartments in this house has not died away.  It can be said that realtors even hunt for apartments on sale, despite their considerable cost. </p>

    <h2>  Nearest metro stations </h2><p>  The whole life of Muscovites is closely connected with the subway, because in most cases it depends on it whether the father of the family has time to work, and the young mother takes the child to kindergarten.  Therefore, when buying an apartment, potential buyers are always interested in the proximity of the metro, especially if the house is located far from the center of Moscow. </p><p>  LCD "Amber" (the photo we gave in the article) has even several metro stations nearby.  For example, the nearest station "Babushkinskaya" is only a thousand meters from the house.  And to the metro stations "Medvedkovo" and "Sviblovo" you need to go about two and a half thousand meters.  The farthest away is the <span>Botanical Garden metro station,</span> three thousand seven hundred meters from the residential complex. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Description of the area </h2><p>  The area in which this <span>residential complex</span> is located is often called the "bedroom".  After all, it is surprisingly calm and quiet here, in addition, it is removed from the city center.  Perhaps for someone this is a significant minus, but it is this fact that provides a good ecology of the Losinoostrovsky district. </p><p>  The <span>Babushkinsky park,</span> successfully located right opposite the LCD, and the Elk Island reserve, which gave the name to the whole district, are responsible for clean air.  Many residents of "Amber" note that there is always where to walk with young children, without fear that they will run out onto the road or breathe exhaust fumes from cars passing by. </p><p>  Almost everyone living in this house claims that there are a lot of children's entertainment facilities, cafes and old trees in the streets that the builders and architects managed to preserve during the development of this territory.  Wherever you go, a feeling of home comfort and tranquility will be created everywhere.  And this is very appreciated by busy and busy Muscovites. </p>

    <h2>  Infrastructure of the residential complex and the district </h2><p>  First of all, the residents are pleased that the local area is fenced and has security.  This minimizes the possibility of unauthorized people entering the house.  The area around the Yantarny residential complex is fully equipped, both adults and children will find classes here.  For example, the latter are happy to frolic in the playground, equipped with bright and safe facilities.  In addition, the architects of the residential complex provided for a small cozy recreation area for children, surrounded on all sides by greenery.  For adherents of an active lifestyle, a sports corner has been arranged, in which there are all the shells necessary to keep yourself in shape. </p><p>  Residents have seats in a multi-tiered underground car park, which is very convenient for them.  But guests can leave their cars in a small specialized area near the house. </p><p>  The district itself has a very developed infrastructure, which increases its attractiveness in the real estate market.  The owners of apartments in the Yantarny residential complex will not experience a shortage of children's educational institutions, clinics, shopping centers and catering establishments.  For many Muscovites, life in Amber is a dream that has come true. </p>

    <h2>  Apartments (LCD "Amber"): short description </h2><p>  The developer tried to make it so that everyone could choose a suitable apartment for themselves in a residential complex.  They represent a wide variety of options - from one-room to the penthouse.  The smallest area starts with fifty square meters, but the penthouse boasts an area of ‚Äã‚Äãtwo hundred and sixty squares. </p><p>  All apartments were delivered with connected water supply, sewer and electricity.  Double-glazed windows are installed in all window openings, and loggias and balconies are glazed.  Each apartment has a storage room, which many residents have turned into a full dressing room. </p>

    <h2>  Layout of apartments </h2><p>  In the Yantarny residential complex, apartment layouts are standard.  Before putting the house into operation, all interior partitions were built, so any further redevelopment was possible only with the permission of special authorities.  However, now in the secondary market there are multi-apartment buildings with a complete redevelopment.  Naturally, their value only increases over time. </p><p>  Each apartment has a separate bathroom.  Depending on the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe room, it can be a completely separate section or one divided by a partition. </p><h2>  Market value of apartments </h2><p>  If you are interested in the Yantarny residential complex, the developer of the LLD Guild can orient you by the cost per square meter in this house.  However, the developer now no longer has free apartments, so you need to look for it on the secondary housing market. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the initial cost of a four-room apartment was within thirty million rubles.  On the secondary, it can already cost about fifty million rubles. </p><p>  The average price of real estate in this residential complex is forty-five to fifty million rubles.  If you have a similar amount, then you can count on you to be lucky and you will become a tenant of this wonderful house. </p>

    <h2>  LCD "Amber": reviews </h2><p>  In our country, it is not customary to leave reviews about houses and residential complexes, so it is quite difficult to find them.  However, we managed to find a few comments that allow us to form an opinion about all the pros and cons of life in Amber.  So, the advantages most residents include: </p><ul><li>  convenient layout of apartments; </li><li>  developed infrastructure of the residential complex and the district; </li><li>  an abundance of greenery; </li><li>  good ecology; </li><li>  the ability to easily reach all social infrastructure facilities even without a personal car; </li><li>  <span>multi-level parking</span> ; </li><li>  modern passenger and freight elevators. </li></ul><p>  But the disadvantages of the residential complex also exist: </p><ul><li>  abundance near other houses and complexes (about ten); </li><li>  growing rents; </li><li>  autonomous sewage system, which periodically brings residents a lot of problems; </li><li>  significant remoteness from the center; </li><li>  difficult accessibility. </li></ul><p>  In general, the residential complex is ideal for a young and active family with a child and their own car. </p>
