How much traffic is left on the modem from MegaFon</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  I wonder if any of the pioneers of the World Wide Web suggested what the Internet would become in the 21st century?  Today, with its help, millions of people communicate, have fun, study and earn a living.  Also, no one could imagine that access to the network would be possible not only from home, but from anywhere in the world.  The latter was made possible thanks to the development of cellular communications. </p><p>  MegaFon was one of the first companies to offer its customers Internet services at 4G speeds.  Much has been done for this, but the main thing is special branded devices: modems, phones and tablets.  All this has led to the fact that more and more subscribers want to know how much traffic is left.  MegaFon has thought over its services to the smallest detail here and provides several options for how this can be done. </p>

    <h2>  Method 1. For modem users </h2><p>  When purchasing a modem in the office, the first customers were perplexed, since the kit included only a SIM card and the device itself, similar to a USB flash drive.  Everything is thought out in such a way that no special knowledge is required during installation.  The computer will start and install the necessary application the first time the modem is connected to it. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is with its help that you can find out how much traffic is left.  MegaFon understands that it is much more convenient for subscribers to do this without disconnecting the modem from the computer.  In this application, just go to the "Statistics" section and you can see the number of MBs spent per day, month, or even year.  And knowing which option is connected, you can easily evaluate the available traffic balance.  But this method is convenient only for those who use the MegaFon modem.  How much traffic is left on other devices, so check does not work.  Other options have been developed for them. </p>

    <h2>  Method 2: USSD request </h2><p>  The most accessible and familiar of all the proposed options for users of mobile devices is the USSD request.  Just enter the desired combination and the display will show information about how much traffic is left.  MegaFon will provide current data not only on the number of megabytes remaining, but also on the date of reconnecting the service. </p><p>  It is also very convenient that the same USSD request is used for all Internet services: * 167 #.  If the subscriber has the corresponding option enabled, the message will read as follows: "Until the speed limit there is XXXXM MB until XX.XX.XXX," where XX.XX.XXXX is the date when the service is reconnected and the countdown will start again.  If none of the services is connected, the subscriber will receive the following message: "You have not connected an option with a speed limit." </p><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

      <br>
      <p></p>
    <h2>  Method 3. SMS sending </h2><p>  True, despite the simplicity of the USSD request, many still prefer SMS messages to them.  In this regard, the company also provided such an opportunity to check the rest of the traffic before the speed limit.  True, for each option it will already have its own SMS request number.  But the text will be exactly the same.  This word is "remainder" or "ostatok".  Information about the rooms for each Internet service can be found in the table. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  <em>Option name</em> </td><td>  <em>SMS request number</em> </td></tr><tr><td>  Pocket Internet Mini </td><td>  000767 </td></tr><tr><td>  Internet S </td><td>  05009121 </td></tr><tr><td>  Internet M </td><td>  05009122 </td></tr><tr><td>  Internet L </td><td>  000988 </td></tr><tr><td>  Internet XL </td><td>  05009124 </td></tr></tbody></table><p>  When sending such a request, if the option is enabled, a message will be returned with the amount of remaining traffic until the speed limit is reached.  And if not, then the subscriber will also receive an SMS, but it will say that there is no connection to this service. </p><p>  Since it is not very convenient to find out how much traffic is left at MegaFon using SMS messages due to different requests, this service is far from the most popular.  Although, on the other hand, if the client constantly uses the same Internet tariff option, you can save the desired number in the phone book.  And when needed, just send an SMS to him. </p><h2>  Method 4. Service Guide </h2><p>  Of course, having such a convenient service as a Service Guide, you can always clarify the rest of your traffic with it.  To do this, just go to the Personal Assistant website and on the main page in the section "Current discounts and service packages" you can find all the necessary information.  As a result, the subscriber will not only be able to clarify how to learn how much traffic is left at MegaFon, but also to find out the validity period of the package and how much was spent on the current day. </p>

    <p>  In addition, in case of doubt, the client can always order detailed details in the Service Guide or connect any other tariff option.  Moreover, unlike any other method, these services will be provided completely free of charge.  But most importantly, access to your personal account is provided from any mobile device, as well as through the voice menu 0505. </p><h2>  Method 5. Contacting a company employee </h2><p>  But no matter what options the company provides to its customers on MegaFon, how much traffic remains, there will always be those who find it easier and more convenient to check this information with the office or contact center staff.  However, in order to find out, the client must provide their <span>passport data.</span>  It will be enough to dictate them by telephone, and in the office it will already be necessary to present the document itself. </p><p>  It is worth noting that any employee of the company, of course, will be pleased to provide data on the remaining traffic, and will also help you choose the right Internet option.  However, the customer may have to wait in line at the office or with a phone call. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Caring for their customers, the company‚Äôs employees suggested not one, but as many as 5 ways to find out how much traffic remained before the speed limit was reached at MegaFon.  In addition, if the subscriber needs to extend the validity of his option, he can use the additional service ‚ÄúProlong speed‚Äù or ‚ÄúTurbo-button‚Äù.  And parents can turn on a special "Children's Internet", and their child will only visit the "right" sites.  They did not forget about travelers in MegaFon.  The option "Internet in Russia" is provided for them. </p><p>  Today it is already obvious to everyone that life without a global network is simply impossible.  Every day, thousands of people start their day by checking email and visiting their pages on social networks.  So, it is important for them to have round-the-clock access to the Internet at high speeds.  MegaFon understands this very well, and therefore provides its customers only high-quality services. </p>
