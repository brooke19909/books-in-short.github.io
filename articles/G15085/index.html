Today he is occupied by Queen Elizabeth II.  And in what city was Buckingham Palace built?  This is known to many - in London.  Buckingham Palace is opposite Green Park and Mall Street and is considered one of the most famous attractions.  Its distinguishing feature is a gilded <span>monument to Queen</span> Victoria, located in front of the building. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="51.501364" data-lng="-0.1418899999999894" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/2/9/7/1/2971.png"></div><h2>  The history of the palace </h2><p>  The first mention of the famous palace on the whole planet appeared in 1703.  While just on this site was located the country house of the Duke of Buckingham - John Sheffield.  He was in those days at a sufficient distance from London.  After taking up a new position, Sheffield decided to build a compact palace for his family.  It was originally called Buckingham House.  In the future, his appearance has repeatedly changed. </p><p>  In 1762, the palace was acquired by King George III.  He decided to make him his private residence.  The building has been rebuilt and expanded.  Its facade was somewhat simplified, and for his valuable collection of books, the king ordered to build a library.  In addition to this, he transferred a huge number of works of art from other palaces to this place.  He also acquired excellent paintings by Italian artists. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1825, the famous architect John Nash began to rebuild the building for the monarch George IV.  He arranged a large courtyard opposite him.  This led to the fact that he immediately began to be considered a rich suburban palace, perfectly fitting into the surrounding parks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.housebeautiful.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="buckingham palace is located" class="if uuid-2452058" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41738/2452058.jpg"></div><h2>  The majestic symbol of the kingdom </h2><p>  In 1837, Buckingham Palace was officially declared the main residence of the British monarchs.  At that time, Queen Victoria took over the throne.  She instructed to build another extension and move the main entrance, the Marble Arch, to where it is now (near the Oratory Corner in Hyde Park).  In addition, in front of the residence, a large circular area was arranged, and in the center of it was a monument to Queen Victoria herself.  During her reign, Buckingham Palace in the UK also became a symbol of the kingdom. </p><p>  In 1846, the architect Edward Blor attached a building to the building, which connected it to the courtyard from the side of the street.  This gave the royal residence a completely new look.  Some researchers, however, consider it a slightly ridiculous structure.  Once again, the palace was modified in 1913.  After this, its main facade was considered to be eastern.  It was slightly modified by architect Aston Webb.  To some, this new facade will seem somewhat gloomy and boring, but it is precisely it that is best known to the residents of London and guests of the capital. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.royalcollection.org.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="buckingham palace uk" class="if uuid-2452043" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41738/2452043.jpg"></div><h2>  Features of the Royal Residence </h2><p>  This palace is one of the largest and most impressive sites in London.  Inside, there are more than 700 rooms, impressive with its rich interior and decoration.  Among the wide variety of rare values ‚Äã‚Äãfound in the palace, there are paintings by Rubens and Rembrandt, antique furniture, as well as French porcelain.  It is noteworthy that this palace looks like a separate state.  After all, it has its own personal cinema, hospital and police, as well as a huge pool and a chic ballroom. </p><p>  The lower floor of the Royal Buckingham Palace is decorated with columns of the Doric order of classical architecture.  But the top floor is decorated in the style of the Corinthian order.  On the main facade of the building from two sides there are several artistic figures. </p><p>  Ceremonial halls are specially designed for official ceremonies and receptions.  They are located on one axis, that is, sequentially adjacent to each other.  Central is considered to be a green living room.  It was in it that the delegations gathered before making an appointment with the monarch. </p><p>  The throne room continues the green living room.  Through it, visitors go to the Art Gallery.  It is the most spacious building in Buckingham Palace.  In 1914, this gallery was thoroughly redone.  Changes affected the roof and lighting system. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.royalcollection.org.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="secrets of buckingham palace" class="if uuid-2452054" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41738/2452054.jpg"></div><h2>  Palace Gardens </h2><p>  Quite unexpectedly, from a wide room with glass doors from floor to ceiling, guests pass into a delightful garden.  It resembles paradise.  There is a lake with islands, waterfalls, flowering plants, neat lawns and even pink flamingos.  Its territory is 17 hectares.  This is the largest private garden in London.  Only the sound of helicopters, which systematically fly around the residence, distracts from solitude.  Three times a year in the garden they organize a solemn tea party with the queen.  The event is attended by about 10 thousand guests.  For the sake of ordinary people, Queen Elizabeth II canceled the dress code.  The only thing that is forbidden is to bare shoulders and wear black clothes.  Guests are offered tea, small sandwiches with red caviar, chocolate cakes and biscuits. </p><h2>  Palace Guard </h2><p>  The residence is guarded by the Court Division.  Every day at half past eleven the guard changes.  But this is only from April to August.  In other months, it is held every other day.  This is practically the most famous ceremony in London.  It attracts the attention of a large number of tourists.  Guardsmen, dressed in impeccable traditional uniforms, march strictly leg to foot.  Changing each other at the post, they always attract a large number of people who want to see this ritual. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.visitlondon.com" data-author=": Derry Moore, "><img itemprop="image" alt="royal buckingham palace" class="if uuid-2452063" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41738/2452063.jpg"></div><h2>  Free access to the residence </h2><p>  Only in August and September did the queen leave Buckingham Palace.  At this time, it is available for free visits.  But not all rooms have access, but only in 19 of them.  Others are considered the personal space of the royal family.  By the way, if Elizabeth II is present in the palace, then a distinctive flag must be placed above the main facade.  The first time the palace opened its doors to guests and tourists in 1993.  Since then, every year a huge number of people come on excursions.  But the reason for its discovery for tourists was a fire that occurred in 1992 in Windsor Castle.  It was decided to raise money for its restoration. </p><h2>  Rooms available for tourists </h2><p>  Many travelers have logical questions: is it possible to visit the palace and see its luxury from the inside?  What halls and rooms in it are available for visiting, and which are not?  Guests have free access to the ceremonial dining room of Buckingham Palace.  Its long table, made of mahogany, seats around 600 people at one time.  In the middle of the dining room is a very large portrait of King George IV.  The height of this canvas is about three meters.  On both sides are portraits of George III and Queen Charlotte.  They are written by A. Ramsey.  Also there are other portraits.  The last for visitors to Buckingham Palace was available White lounge.  White-golden shades of its interior resemble gold coins. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.willpearson.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where is Buckingham Palace" class="if uuid-2452067" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41738/2452067.jpg"></div><h2>  Interesting facts about Buckingham Palace </h2><p>  What else attracts thousands of tourists to this place of the English capital?  Many believe that, as in many other significant places, there are secrets at Buckingham Palace.  Here are some interesting facts. </p><p>  For example, you can hear stories that on Christmas Eve at the chambers of the royal Buckingham Palace, a ghost in the clothes of a monk moves, and even hung with chains.  No one knows where he came from.  But there is a rumor that he exists there from the very foundation of the palace and most of the courtiers saw him with their own eyes.  And there are also those who are absolutely convinced that this palace is not able to leave the spirit of George III.  From time to time, he appears near the windows, since while still alive, the monarch was expecting couriers from Hanover.  It was at that time that he died. </p><p>  Buckingham Palace is another interesting secret: one of the dressers can be pushed to the side.  A secret door is hidden behind it, which the queen sometimes uses to go out to guests.  Many other secrets for tourists are not yet available. </p><p>  When the Second World War was on, Buckingham Palace was a very attractive target for shelling, because <span>George VI</span> and Elizabeth did not agree to leave their residence.  Bombs hit the building nine times.  One of them destroyed the Clock Tower. </p><p>  The balcony of Buckingham Palace is the most famous.  He became famous when Queen Victoria came to him on the day of the celebration of the opening of the 1851 World Exhibition.  And George VI introduced the custom of appearing with the whole family on the balcony during the parade. </p><div class="photo" data-original="therandomlad.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="buckingham palace interesting facts" class="if uuid-2452071" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41738/2452071.jpg"></div><h2>  Who lives in the residence? </h2><p>  With the exception of members of the royal family, a further 800 staff members live in Buckingham Palace (UK).  They maintain order and maintain cleanliness in the rooms.  There is even a person in the palace as a watchmaker.  He is obliged to monitor more than 350 hours every day.  They must go at the same time. </p><p>  It is known that Queen Elizabeth II is not indifferent to Corgi dogs all her life.  They are allowed to move everywhere, even go into any room.  The monarch‚Äôs pets are watched by special staff. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.foodandwine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="In which city is Buckingham Palace" class="if uuid-2452072" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41738/2452072.jpg"></div><h2>  Travel Information </h2><p>  Many tourists come to the palace just to be photographed against its background.  This can be done year round.  In this case, most likely, there will be an opportunity to visit the gallery and stables, as well as look at the changing of the guard.  You can get to the residence by metro.  All subway lines have stations in the area where Buckingham Palace is located, literally five minutes walk from it. </p><p>  Most tourists have a lasting impression of what they see.  Firstly, the perfectly designed changing of the guard and the chic chambers of the Royal Buckingham Palace have not left a single guest indifferent.  For this reason alone, it must be unconditionally added to the list of places that you must visit.  Indeed, at least once in your life you can visit here to enjoy the beauty of this palace. </p>
