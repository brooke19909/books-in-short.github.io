Description, comparison, what to consider when choosing</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When choosing a modern TV, it is recommended to pay attention to technical specifications.  There are many TVs on the market, you can get lost when choosing the right model.  Manufacturers go to the tricks, for the same price lower-quality models are sold.  With all the declared capabilities, it is recommended to inspect the picture in stores, because the subjective opinion of buyers is ambiguous.  Sometimes the same screen is perceived differently by visitors. </p><h2>  Main technical features of flat TV </h2><p>  The characteristics of TVs are often indicated by a limited list, consultants highlight only profitable points in terms of sales.  The manufacturer makes refinement of the appearance without changing the previous capabilities of the internal hardware.  And sellers expose TV as a technically improved version.  However, by browsing the Internet, you can easily identify the catch. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="TV specifications" class="if" height="417" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41986/1459304.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  We highlight the main characteristics of TVs that are important for the buyer: </p><ul><li>  Screen: brightness, resolution, diagonal, shape. </li><li>  Sound: volume, number of speakers, sound enhancement software features. </li><li>  Ease of use of the menu, remote control, compatibility with gadgets. </li><li>  Additional features: Internet connection via cable or Wi-Fi, built-in decoders. </li><li>  Profitability, ways to <span>adjust the brightness:</span> automatically or manually. </li><li>  Thickness, weight, appearance of the purchased device. </li></ul><h2>  Choice Issues </h2><p>  With all of the listed features of the TV, incomplete information is provided to purchase the device.  If the buyer chose LG TV, the price may be much lower when examining the next model.  The maximum feature set for the average cost is rarely found. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The characteristics of TVs are skillfully varied by manufacturers, forcing buyers to take half-devices without Wi-Fi, but with an updated version of the remote control or a curved screen with a low-power processor.  Additional functions are useful, but sacrificing basic parameters for them is not practical. </p><h2>  Professional approach </h2><p>  Technical characteristics of TVs are often presented in a favorable light for the buyer.  Many people confuse the screen resolution of 1920 p and 720 p, which is almost impossible to distinguish externally in the store. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tv lg Price" class="if" height="414" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41986/1460446.jpg" width="600"></div>

If the room does not have sunlight, there is no need to purchase a super-bright LED screen.  In daylight, even powerful emitters cannot cope. </p><p>  In the electronics market, LG TV is offered, the price of which is lower than that of competitors with similar characteristics.  It is equipped with a screen built on <span>quantum dots.</span>  The image is transmitted in realistic colors, the picture does not fade in sunlight. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Extra options </h2><p>  Experienced users pay attention to the number of interfaces.  Type of connection with peripheral devices: USB, COM port, VGA, HDMI-connectors.  Image quality is affected by the integrated graphics processor, which you can select from the test tables on the Internet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd tv specifications" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41986/1459482.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  USB connections are divided by reading speed: version 2.0 or 3.0.  The latest models have a convenient SMART control menu, some top TVs carry out voice and gesture commands from the owner.  To eliminate distortion of dynamic pictures, developers provide the TV with a special mode.  This becomes relevant when connecting to the console or watching sports channels. </p><h2>  Convenient integration in new TVs </h2><p>  Manufacturers complete models with functions: </p><ul><li>  3D effect provides watching movies at home in surround format.  New televisions no longer require the use of special glasses; </li><li>  Smart TV is an integrated environment for receiving a signal from the Internet.  The software expands the <span>list of channels,</span> allowing you to use almost any television resource around the world.  No need to pull a separate cable provider, which significantly reduces the cost of monthly maintenance.  You will need Internet LAN or Wi-Fi, and it is already in every house. </li><li>  4K is four times the resolution of FullHD, which allows you to view video from professional cameras. </li></ul><h2>  Power and type of emitter </h2><p>  Plasma screens have lower brightness values ‚Äã‚Äãthan LCD and LED TVs.  Prices and specifications previously prevailed in the first type of TV, but over time, new technologies took up.  However, plasma still transmits more saturated colors through the use of a discharge directly at the glow point. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="TVs prices and specifications" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41986/1459321.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  LED TVs are equipped with emitters, providing a luminous flux of up to 500 cd / m * 2.  Pixel backlighting requires a powerful lamp behind the screen, located at the bottom center in a single copy or double row arrangement.  The latest TV models are equipped with bright diodes, eliminating the effect of color loss when changing the viewing angle. </p><h2>  Model Comparison </h2><p>  The light source for LCD models is a powerful lamp, hence the small viewing angle and brightness.  <span>The characteristics of LED TVs are</span> enhanced through the use of bright diodes.  Plasma screens are expensive, but have high contrast.  Color saturation is obtained by image reproduction technology: the glow is formed not by a lamp, but by a discharge at each point. </p><p>  The characteristics of LED TVs are close to plasma.  The latest models have low weight, a large screen size.  Curved screen options are designed to provide the viewer with a picture without spatial distortion.  The advantages of LED are: a thin layer of pixels, high brightness, low weight electronics. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="TV screen specifications" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41986/1459302.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  These moviegoers choose plasma TVs, the characteristics of which are high-quality image, saturation and minimal pixel response time.  But for good dynamics and review, the owners pay the disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  gradual screen fading, life expectancy of 30,000 hours, which is an average of about 9 years of daily movie watching; </li><li>  a large mass of the device; </li><li>  increased energy consumption. </li></ul><p>  The plasma panel has advantages when watching a movie in a dark room, black tones are more expressive than LCD TVs. </p><h2>  Pixel Response and Resolution </h2><p>  Competitive models are able to reproduce small details of the picture and maintain the contours of dynamic images.  These features are plasma and LED TVs.  Characteristics, description are indicated in the passport of the device.  It is recommended that you familiarize yourself with the documentation prior to your purchase. </p><p>  Users noted a pattern: similar screen settings at different manufacturers do not guarantee that the picture will play the same.  This feature is noticeable when two TVs are set side by side and turned on at full brightness.  This is due to manufacturing technology and subjective perception of the human visual organ. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="characteristics of ice tvs" class="if" height="378" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41986/1459478.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The response time affects the image of moving objects, very small details are clearly distinguishable in <span>4K resolution.</span>  This characteristic of TV screens appeared on Asian models.  But manufacturers promise to introduce such screens on all future TVs. </p><p>  A common standard for digital broadcasting in Russia is DVB-T2.  For satellite TV - DVB-S2, but decoders are often used to receive the latest format signal.  Broadcasting news programs and many television shows is carried out with a resolution of 720 by 576 points. </p><p>  Buying expensive and multi-functional high-resolution models just for watching evening shows is comparable to acquiring an all-terrain jeep for city driving.  If it comes to prestige, then this makes some sense.  From the point of view of the average person, the rational cost savings become the basis for choosing TVs. </p><h2>  Viewing angle and contrast </h2><p>  Budget LCD screens have significant drawbacks.  If the viewing point is incorrectly selected, the geometric size of the images is distorted and the color of the image changes.  This largely depends on the technology of converting a digital signal into a visible glow: plasma, LED indication, LCD panel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="TVs specifications description" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41986/1460463.jpg" width="600"></div>

          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

    <p>  The contrast parameter is important.  None of the technologies presented can provide a completely black pixel.  Nearby luminous dots give the idle link a gray tint.  This characteristic is indicated by the ratio between black and white.  The larger the gap, the more natural the transmission. </p><h2>  How can I save? </h2><p>  When choosing expensive multifunctional equipment, it is recommended to take into account the features of television broadcasting standards.  It‚Äôs not advisable to buy the 4K resolution function if the TV is designed to watch TV shows in HDTV format.  Buyers often overpay for managing Smart TV, but do not use the Internet. </p><p>  A similar situation is with the 3D function.  According to the results of a partial survey, mature buyers watched videos of this format several times after purchase.  An expensive option is interesting for young people and children.  TV control is carried out by the following options: </p><ul><li>  manual from the buttons on the front of the device; </li><li>  using a remote control - the most practical method of switching channels; </li><li>  voice - the novelty increases the cost of the TV; </li><li>  with gestures is a rare option that also affects the price of a TV. </li></ul><p>  You should not save on image quality, because a new TV is purchased in order to improve the transmission of realistic objects.  A natural picture is obtained using the new UHD technology - quantum dots that transmit natural colors with high contrast. </p>
