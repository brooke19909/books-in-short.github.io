Alexander the Great and Darius: the Battle of Gaugamela</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The battle of Gaugamela took place in 331 BC.  e.  These were the last military operations between the armies of King of Persia Darius III and Alexander of Macedon.  The battle took place with the significant superiority of the Persians.  There were several hundred thousand people, and they fought against several tens of thousands of soldiers of the Greco-Macedonian army.  At the very beginning of the confrontation, Parmenion - the commander of the left flank of the Macedonian army - suffered very significant losses.  Alexander, however, commanded the right flank and made a deceitful and completely unforeseen maneuver.  This confused the Persian king, and he left the battlefield.  As a result, the army of Macedon won.  What really happened?  And how was the battle that was not forgotten today? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Battle of the Gaugamels" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/582225.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Alexander the Great </h2><p>  The celebrated commander lived in 356-323 years BC.  The conquests of <span>Alexander of Macedon</span> became one of the greatest events in the history of the existence of all mankind.  Epics and legends are composed about them, films were made and scientific dissertations were written.  Alexander was the ruler of Macedonia and the founder of the world <span>Hellenistic state.</span>  Macedonian was the son of King Philip II and the daughter of the Molossian monarch of the Olympics.  The child was brought up in an aristocratic spirit: he was taught mathematics, writing, playing the lyre.  His teacher was Aristotle himself.  Alexander possessed reasonableness and a fighting character in his youth.  Also, the future ruler could boast of incredible physical strength, and it was he who managed to tame Bucephalus - a horse who did not succumb to anyone's training. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Here are some famous dates on history that glorified the Macedonian king: </p><ul><li>  beginning of August 338 BC  e.  - the army of the 16-year-old ruler defeated the Greek army; </li><li>  spring 335 BC  e.  - a campaign that brought Alexander victory over the mountain Thracians, Illyrians and tribals; </li><li>  winter 334-333 years BC  e.  Macedonian managed to conquer Pamphylia and Lycia. </li></ul><p>  But this is not the whole list of victories of the <span>great commander.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the conquest of Alexander the Great" class="if" height="311" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/582226.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Victory </h2><p>  All the conquests of Alexander the Great are unlikely to be described in a few sentences, but some of them are still worth mentioning.  After in 335 BC.  e.  Alexander proclaimed himself king, he subjugated to his will those who dared to rebel against him: these were troops in the northern part of Macedonia.  He also stabbed the Illyrians and pushed them to the Danube. </p><p>  Then the Macedonian crushed the rebellion of the armed Greeks.  He defeated Thebes and did not spare the mighty Athens.  Soon after this, together with his huge army, the king defeated the Persian army and thereby established his will throughout Asia Minor.  And the historical dates indicate that Alexander repeatedly fought with Darius III and defeated him.  So, for the first time this happened in 333 BC.  e.  Then, having crossed the Taurus, a battle was fought at Issus between the troops of the two great commanders.  But Macedonian won, forcing the Persian king to flee to Babylon. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The defeated ruler offered Alexander some peaceful conditions.  But he did not accept them.  He decided to conquer the countries located on the east coast of the Mediterranean Sea.  In turn, Macedon subordinated Illyria to his power, then Palestine, and then Egypt.  In the country of the pyramids, he built Alexandria.  And then there was the aforementioned battle of Gaugamela. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dates by history" class="if" height="217" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/582228.jpg" width="350"></div>

    <h2>  Reasons for the battle </h2><p>  As the reader already knows, these events took place in 331 BC.  e.  A couple of years before, Darius III was first defeated by his opponent.  Then the Persian wanted peace and offered Macedonian 10 thousand talents as a ransom for his captured family.  In addition, the Persian king Darius was ready to give his daughter Satire for Alexander.  A dowry was supposed to be in her possession from the Hellespont to the Euphrates.  Also, Darius III was ready for alliance and peace with his enemy. </p><p>  What the Persian proposed was incredibly important for Alexander, so he discussed all this with his allies.  One of Macedon‚Äôs close associates, Parmenion, said that he would accept all the conditions if he were in Alexander‚Äôs place.  But it was not in the style of the commander to follow the lead of anyone else.  Therefore, he replied that he would also agree to the proposal if he had the opportunity to be in the place of Parmenion.  But since he is Alexander the Great, and not someone else, he will not go for any truce. </p><p>  A corresponding letter was sent to Darius, which stated that no one had the right to command the great commander.  And the daughter of the Persian will become the wife of Macedon only if the latter himself so desires, because the whole family of the enemy is in his power.  Alexander wrote that if Darius wants peace, then let him come to his master as his subject.  After such a message, Darius III began to prepare for a real war. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Persian king Darius" class="if" height="419" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/582229.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Enemy armies </h2><p>  The battles of Alexander the Great were always bloody and brought many losses to the opponents.  After all, the Macedonian army was numerous.  In preparation for the battle of Gaugamela, she totaled 40 thousand foot soldiers and seven thousand horsemen.  But the Persians were superior in numbers.  However, this did not upset Macedon, since most of the king's army consisted of well-trained soldiers with experience.  The army of Darius III totaled 250 thousand people, among whom were 30 thousand mercenaries from Greece and 12 thousand heavily armed Bactrians on horseback. </p><h2>  How did the Euphrates cross </h2><p>  The battle of Gaugamela began with the fact that, passing Syria, the Macedonian army approached the Euphrates.  The Persian army was supposed to defend the crossing.  But the Persians disappeared as soon as they saw the main forces of their opponents.  Therefore, Alexander was able to easily overcome the Euphrates and continue the campaign to the east.  Darius did not interfere with the Great.  He, along with his army, expected enemies on the plain, which was perfect for deploying an army and defeating the Macedonians.  The small village of Gavgamela was located next to this plain. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="battle of Alexander the Great" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/582227.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Tiger and improved army of Darius </h2><p>  In September, Alexander the Great approached <span>the Tigris River</span> (the battle of Gaugamela, one of his many feats, was just around the corner).  The prisoners, who had already been captured, said that Darius would prevent the Macedonians from crossing this reservoir.  But after the Great began to cross the river, no one was on the opposite bank.  The Persians prepared for the attack in a different way. </p><p>  Meanwhile, the troops of Darius III improved and improved their weapons.  So, they attached a sharpened point to the hubs and drawbars of the chariots.  It was assumed that such units should inflict huge losses on the enemy army.  Infantry weapons have also become more powerful. </p><h2>  The battle has begun </h2><p>  The right flank of Macedon went right, obliquely in relation to the main front line.  Darius ordered his left flank to go around the right flank of the enemy.  The cavalry rushed to fulfill this.  Alexander ordered the Greek cavalry to strike, but his soldiers failed.  And yet, Darius‚Äôs plans did not materialize. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alexander the Great Battle of Gaugamela" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/582230.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Victory of Alexander </h2><p>  The battle of Gaugamela was hot.  Ultimately, Darius III fled along with the army from the battlefield, like a catty cat.  Despite his small army, Macedon was able to win thanks to his intelligence and prudence.  This battle put an end to the Persian kingdom, and its ruler was killed by his close allies.  Alexander the Great, after such a significant battle, won many more victories and expanded his possessions with more than one power. </p>
