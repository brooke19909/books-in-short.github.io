The knitting process is simple and does not require special skills: even a novice craftswoman can easily cope with this task.  All you need is a few skeins of yarn, matching knitting needles and a little patience. </p><h2>  Features of knitting from mohair </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mohair yarn" class="if uuid-2237913" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2237913.jpg"></div><p>  Mohair is made from the wool of a special breed of goats, it has a long silky pile, pleasant to the touch.  Due to the special structure of the hairs, the yarn does not roll and does not wrinkle when worn, for a long time retains its volume and beautiful appearance.  The products are very warm, and thanks to the fluffy structure, the thread consumption is very small. </p><p>  For knitting a mohair hat with two lapels, approximately 150 grams of yarn and knitting needles No. 3,5-4 will be required.  If you need to get a warmer and voluminous product, you can knit in two or three threads, and also take knitting needles for several more numbers.  To emphasize the beautiful fluffy texture, knitting should be free, and the loops are loose. </p><h2>  Calculation of hinges for caps </h2><p>  In order for the mohair hat to fit in size, you need to take measurements correctly and calculate the number of loops.  Each craftswoman gets a different knitting density, so it is best to make your own calculation: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Take a centimeter tape and use it to measure the circumference of the head above the eyebrows, and then subtract 2-3 cm from the resulting number. This is necessary so that the cap sits tight enough and does not fall, because the product will stretch slightly. </li><li>  Then, put 25 loops on the knitting needles and tie a 10 cm high sample using the selected pattern.  The cap made of mohair, knitted with an elastic band 2 x 2, looks beautiful, but you can choose any other pattern to your taste. </li><li>  Measure how many loops holds 1 cm of knitting, then multiply this figure by the volume of the head, and the result is the required number of loops for the cap. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.livemaster.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to tie a mohair hat" class="if uuid-2237917" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2237917.jpg"></div><h2>  How to tie a mohair hat </h2><p>  For example, if the head volume is 53 cm, and the density of knitting is 2 loops per 1 cm, the calculation will be as follows: </p><ul><li>  (53-3) x 2 = 100 </li></ul><p>  Getting started: </p><ul><li>  To make a seamless hat from mohair, you need circular knitting needles.  We collect 100 loops, remove the first loop, as usual, without knitting, and then we knit one row with a 2 x 2 elastic band: 2 facial ones, and then 2 wrong ones. </li><li>  We connect the first and last loops together, after which we continue to knit in a circle according to the figure: we knit the front loops with the front ones, the wrong ones with the wrong ones. </li><li>  We knit a fabric 40 cm long, and then proceed to the reduction so that the bottom of the cap turns out beautiful. </li><li>  We connect together 2 front ones to get one loop, and then we do the same with the wrong ones.  Thus, a 1 x 1 gum is obtained. </li><li>  We knit 1 row, after which we stretch the thread into all the loops, tightly tighten and fasten from the wrong side. </li></ul><p>  To get a more voluminous product, you can, as already mentioned, knit in 3-4 or even 5-6 threads, then the hat will be even warmer and suitable even for the most severe frosts.  In this case, the density of the canvas will be higher, and the number of loops per 1 cm will decrease. </p><h2>  Final processing of the product </h2><p>  The finished hat must be properly processed, otherwise it will look messy.  It is impossible to exert pressure on products made of mohair, knitted with an elastic band, otherwise the canvas will turn out flat and will lose all its beauty.  Therefore, heat treatment with an iron is strongly not recommended.  Lightly sprinkle the cap on all sides with water, for this it is convenient to use a regular spray bottle.  Then put the product on a small jar or vase and wait for it to dry completely.  As a result, the loops will align, and the long pile will fluff beautifully.  You can additionally comb the product with a soft clothes brush. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.livemaster.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mohair hat with elastic 2 x 2" class="if uuid-2238186" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/2238186.jpg"></div><p>  Beautifully knitted mohair hat is ready!  Fold the edge in two additions and you can put on a new thing.  If desired, you can wear it with one lapel, so it also turns out very stylish. </p>
