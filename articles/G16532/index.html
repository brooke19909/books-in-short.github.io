Snow-capped mountain peaks unfold behind its roof, which seem to separate the city from the main part of the country.  Thanks to them, the climate is especially mild, the minimum rainfall and warm and pleasant weather all year round.  However, in fact, the sights of Granada are scattered throughout the city, and they stretch from the foot of these same snowy peaks to the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.  Well, consider them, going on a virtual tour of the ancient streets of this mysterious area. </p><h2>  General information about the city </h2><p>  <span>The sights of Granada</span> are famous all over the world because this city is one of the oldest in all of Spain.  It is located in Andalusia, in the very South of the country, and what is most interesting is in some distance from the Mediterranean Sea.  To get to the nearest beaches (which are already in other settlements), you will have to spend an hour on the road.  In this regard, there are very few typical tourists, and you can roam the streets in complete freedom. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of granada" class="if" height="364" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/469890.jpg" width="600"></div>

In the 13th century, Christians conquered these lands from representatives of Islam.  The remaining eastern settlements in the region began to build a Muslim paradise here, which was called Granada.  Spain, whose sights are already very bright, in this region has surpassed itself.  Red brick was used specifically to create a special atmosphere in the palace.  From it all the camps, arches and portals were erected, through which you can pass during the tour.  Popular with tourists is the Lion's Courtyard, located behind the palace.  There are twelve lions carved from marble, which are collected in a single composition in the form of a grand fountain.  Not far from this work of art are gardens that really look like paradise. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="granada spain sights" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/469889.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sacromonte Abbey </h2><p>  According to legend, the <span>abbey</span> was the founding place of this city <span>,</span> however, in those days, a completely different building was located at this place.  It is believed that it was here that the holy martyr Cecilio, who at one time was the founder of local culture, language and customs, died from the swords of the Romans.  Later, a magnificent abbey was erected in his honor, which absorbed the spirits of various eras.  It features features of antiquity, and the rigor of Romanism, and intricate patterns in the Gothic style. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The village of Sacromonte and its huge caves </h2><p>  Since ancient years, gypsy settlements occupied a significant part of the city of Granada.  The sights, photos of which can be seen below, are completely the merit of this nomadic people, who also assimilated very densely with ethnic Spaniards in Andalusia.  In the 15th century, they lived in local caves, which today have turned into bars, pubs and restaurants.  But most importantly, it was in this region that the famous Spanish flamenco dance was born.  There were performances at which people gathered from all over the world.  Today, nothing has changed, because visiting one of these amazing caves, you get the opportunity to enjoy a stunning spectacle and even participate in it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Granada Attractions Photos" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/469888.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  City center.  Novas Street </h2><p>  To go to Spain and not to taste the famous tapas is a sin for every tourist.  In every city, this appetizer, which is served with various drinks, is prepared in its own way, and Granada is no exception.  Reviews of tourists who have tasted the local national delicacy can tell a lot.  The local chefs cook the tobas as you like: in the form of small sandwiches and a full second course.  But in all cases, this is incredible yummy, which is unrealistic to forget.  On one of the central streets of the city - Novas - there are restaurants where you can order this dish.  It is easy to find out such places: as a rule, these are open-air cafes where locals gather who discuss football, drink red Spanish wine and enjoy the evening. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="granada reviews" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/469887.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Generalife Gardens </h2><p>  Many sights of Granada were erected by the Arabs at a time when their power in this territory was unlimited.  Today, all tourists can enjoy these beauties, a special place among which is occupied by green gardens.  Here you can find any variety of tropical trees - both fruit and decorative.  Most importantly, on a sultry Andalusian day in this place you can feel real freshness and coolness, as well as breathe in the scents of summer and nature.  In the evening, the gardens are highlighted and the local setting becomes fabulous. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Listing all the sights of Granada in one fact-finding article is simply unrealistic.  Each building that is located in the city is unique and has its own history.  So walk the streets, look for your special places and save them as photos. </p>
