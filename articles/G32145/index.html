It concerns lunch boxes, which you can ask to prepare at the reception if you go on an excursion early and do not have time to have breakfast.  So, according to the guests, they put very little food in them.  Therefore, experienced travelers recommend starting in the evening to grab rolls from the restaurant, sausages, cheese and other products that can complement breakfast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="viking star spa 5 turkey" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/950541.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment Impressions </h2><p>  Since most people buy tours to Turkey in order to have a great time on the beach, the issue of the distance of the hotel from the coast is very important.  As for the Viking Star and SPA Hotel 5 * we are considering, it is not on the first line.  The hotel also does not have its own beach, however, there are rented sunbeds in two urban areas - pebble and sand.  Shuttles go from the hotel all day on a schedule.  The nearest beach is about 10 minutes on foot.  But if you do not want to go in the heat, then use the transfer.  As for the number of sunbeds, then, according to vacationers, they were not enough for everyone.  However, you can always rent a deck chair for a fee.  It costs only two dollars.  As for drinks and snacks, you canâ€™t bring any of this to the city beaches.  Everything can be bought here at the bars. </p><p>  Many guests of the Viking Star SPA are happy to recall the animation team.  According to them, the guys here know their job very well.  Apparently, they really love their job.  After all, despite the fact that the animators are not annoyingly asking anyone to take part in sports and entertainment events, they still constantly manage to gather a lot of people.  Moreover, according to tourists, this applies not only to those who entertain adult guests, but also to those who deal with children.  Family travelers claim that their children enjoyed visiting the kids club and mini-disco.  Sometimes, along with the animators, they even liked spending time more than on the beach or in the pool. </p><p>  As for other entertainments, Viking Star SPA 5 * (Turkey, Kemer) has a small outdoor pool with a section for children.  Nearby there is a sun terrace and a drink bar.  In addition, the hotel has a spa, which is very much praised by many guests who visited it.  The hotel also has a gym. </p><h2>  Employee Impressions </h2><p>  In their reviews, many Viking Star SPA guests speak well of the hotel staff.  So, according to them, the staff here are very welcoming, friendly and helpful towards the guests.  Not everyone knows the Russian language, but if necessary, you can always find an employee who speaks your language.  As for the contingent, it mainly consists of Germans and other residents of Western Europe.  Perhaps this explains the fact that all employees here do not speak Russian here yet. </p>
