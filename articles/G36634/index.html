These are objects that a person used in everyday life, and then throws it out as unnecessary.  It includes used cardboard packaging, plastic and glass bottles, egg cells, old tires and parts from various failed mechanisms.  Everything that is not a pity to throw out, in skillful hands can turn into an original item, which can become an interior decoration or a gift for a dear person. </p><h2>  The art of creating beauty from rubbish </h2><p>  Ecological catastrophe is brewing in the world due to the fact that the amount of garbage emitted has sharply increased.  Huge dumps not only spoil the appearance of the suburbs, but also create a threatening environmental situation.  Artists from all over the world create their creations in the fashionable trash-art technique (‚Äútrash‚Äù in translation from English - ‚Äúgarbage‚Äù).  This is an opportunity for caring and passionate people around the world to reuse waste material.  This current is gaining momentum every year. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="junk material is" class="if" height="448" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/1463757.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Original decorations for the street </h2><p>  In the design of a summer house or a personal plot, you can use junk material on a grand scale.  These are old tires, from which you can make <span>multi-tiered flower beds,</span> and bright sculptures.  They are also used for the manufacture of outdoor furniture, which is not afraid of the vagaries of the weather.  Old buckets and broken dishes can serve as material for street lamps and flower pots. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The ubiquitous plastic bottles are an indispensable material for the design of beds and flower beds.  With their help, you can not only decorate the site and outline the boundaries of planting, but even use them as a device for irrigation, when it is not possible to often visit the suburban area.  And glass bottles are not only the basis for crafts, but also cheap building material from which craftsmen build arbors and other buildings. </p>

    <h2>  Designer Interior Decorations </h2><p>  Can be widely used in the manufacture of "draft" crafts scrap material.  This provides an opportunity to give scope for imagination.  For example, glass bottles of interesting shapes, which are now on sale so much, can gain a second life if they are used to make such an object as a vase on the farm.  From waste material you can make lamps, flowerpots for indoor flowers, panels and paintings. </p>

Its fragments can be glued onto a cardboard base and then painted with paints or glued napkins using the decoupage technique.

    <h2>  New life of read newspapers </h2><p>  Yesterday's newspapers read at dinner can be the basis for crafts.  The papier-m√¢ch√© manufacturing technique has been known for a long time, but thanks to modern new ideas, it has expanded.  Modern craftswomen combine it with other types of needlework, for example, with decoupage, and amazing things are obtained.  And how many people are keen on weaving newspaper tubes!  Craftsmen make original baskets, and a cache-pot, and boxes for trifles.  And some even manage to make wicker furniture and vases. </p><h2>  Crafts with children </h2><p>  Throw material is a great foundation for children's creativity.  Kids are happy to come up with new possibilities for using seemingly <span>unnecessary items.</span>  Children's imagination allows you to turn several plastic cups into characters of your favorite fairy tale. </p>

    <p>  You can make a house or a store out of unnecessary cardboard by cutting windows and doors.  A small box can be used to make a dollhouse.  Inside it can be glued with the remains of wallpaper, curtains can be cut from scraps of fabric.  Furniture is also made from everything at hand.  Making handicrafts from waste material is a fascinating activity that helps adults return to childhood, and children will learn how to create new things with their own hands. </p><h2>  New Year decoration </h2><p>  New Year - a holiday that everyone is waiting for, young and old.  Prepare for this day in advance, decorating a Christmas tree and an apartment, making gifts.  And on the eve of this holiday, as never before, junk material will come in handy.  Old catalogs and magazines can be used in the manufacture of garlands and flashlights.  From blown bulbs, original Christmas toys are obtained, which no one else has.  Plastic cups can become the basis for toys if they are painted with bright colors and add shine. </p>
