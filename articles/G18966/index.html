  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Emotional states: typology and characterization</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Emotional states are a <span>mental phenomenon</span> that occurs in a person as a result of a reaction to an object or situation.  They are not static and have different strengths of expression.  Such conditions determine a <span>person‚Äôs behavior</span> and depend on data of his character and psychotype. </p><p>  <strong>The main emotional states: characteristic</strong> </p><p>  Emotions are characterized by three parameters: </p><ol><li>  Valence.  This is the so-called tone of emotions: they can be negative and positive.  An interesting fact is that they emit much more negative emotions than positive ones. </li><li>  Intensity.  Here the strength of emotional experience is evaluated.  External physiological manifestations have the greater severity, the stronger the emotion.  This parameter is closely related to the <span>autonomic nervous system</span> and central <span>nervous system</span> . </li><li>  <span>Stenichnost.</span>  <span>This</span> parameter affects the activity of human behavior.  It is represented by two options: stenic and <span>asthenic.</span>  <span>Asthenic</span> emotions contribute to the paralysis of actions: a person is lethargic and apathetic.  Stenic, on the contrary, prompts action. </li></ol><p>  <strong>Kinds</strong> </p><p>  The emotional state of a person is divided into 5 categories, which are identified by the strength, quality and duration of manifestation: </p><ol><li>  Mood.  One of the most prolonged emotional states.  It affects human activity and can occur both gradually and suddenly.  Moods are positive, negative, temporary and stable. </li><li>  Affective emotional states.  This is a group of short-term emotions that suddenly encompass a person and are characterized by a vivid manifestation in behavior.  Despite the short duration, the influence of affects on the psyche is very large and has a destructive nature, reducing its ability to organize and adequately assess reality.  This condition can only be controlled by individuals with a developed will. </li><li>  Stressful emotional states.  They arise when a person gets into an <span>extreme situation</span> from a subjective point of view.  Severe stress can be accompanied by affect if a lot of emotional damage has been suffered.  On the one hand, stress is a negative phenomenon that adversely affects the nervous system, and on the other hand, it mobilizes a person, which sometimes allows him to save his life. </li><li>  Frustration.  It is characterized by a feeling of difficulties and obstacles, leading a person into a depressed state.  In behavior, there is bitterness, sometimes aggressiveness, as well as a negative reaction to events that occur, regardless of their nature. </li><li>  Emotional states of passion.  This category of emotions is caused by a person‚Äôs reaction to material and spiritual needs: for example, a strong desire for something causes in him a desire for an object that is difficult to overcome.  In behavior, activity is observed, the person feels a rise in strength and most often becomes more impulsive and proactive. </li></ol><p>  <em>Together with this classification, there is a more detailed one that divides all emotions into 2 categories.</em> </p><p>  Psychologists distinguish 7 basic emotions: </p><ul><li>  joy; </li><li>  anger; </li><li>  contempt; </li><li>  surprise; </li><li>  fear; </li><li>  disgust; </li><li>  sadness. </li></ul><p>  The essence of the basic emotions is that they are experienced by all people who had a harmonious development without pathologies from the nervous system.  They are equally manifested (albeit in varying degrees and quantities) among representatives of different cultures and social environments. </p><p>  This is due to the presence of certain brain structures that are responsible for a particular emotion.  Thus, a certain set of probable emotional experiences is inherent in a person initially. </p><p>  On the other hand, there is another category of emotions - variative.  These are those experiences that are caused by the specifics of the environment, education, culture.  Their difference from the basic ones is that they manifest themselves differently in human behavior. </p>
