Neoline X-COP 9500 premium combined devices are especially popular. Reviews about this DVR are good, due to the perfect combination of the functions of a recorder and a detector.  Russian users unanimously say that we have a decent car gadget that works perfectly in Russia. </p><p>  It is noteworthy, but when the manufacturer of budget radars Neoline (the average cost of models is up to 10 000 rubles) announced the creation of a hybrid device, experts were skeptical about this news.  However, tests showed: under this brand, high-quality detectors and DVRs are created in one device, worthy of the attention of the most capricious buyer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="neoline x cop 9500 reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/669147.jpg" width="587"></div>

    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  According to the manufacturers themselves, they planned to release a modern Neoline hybrid detector for a long time.  And this is no coincidence, because the brand‚Äôs products have established themselves as reliable and stable in operation.  The developers decided not only to combine the casing of two devices that would work on their own.  They decided that a single software platform, control system and interface would be the main difference between the Neoline X-COP 9500 device. Reviews of it often indicate the high quality and implementation of modern technologies that meet user requirements. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What makes Neoline happy? </h2><p>  Immediately, we note that Neoline created the first high-quality hybrid radar detector and DVR for the most demanding customers.  Its distinctive features include the following. </p><ol><li>  Availability of GLONASS + GPS systems.  Two navigation systems provide the most accurate geolocation of the car, which is important when determining the coordinates of police radars. </li><li>  Excellent video quality.  It is provided by the presence of 6 lenses, which serves as a guarantee of the highest power among devices of this type. </li><li>  Informational content.  All information important to the user is displayed on a single display. </li><li>  Touch control.  The radar can be controlled easily and simply by means of a large touch screen, without being distracted by pressing buttons while driving. </li><li>  Ergonomic design.  The device is designed so that its mount is convenient, while it can be positioned in the cabin with maximum convenience. </li><li>  Motion control system.  It allows you to monitor the condition of the car in terms of <span>road markings.</span>  If suddenly your car goes out of the lane, you will hear an <span>audible</span> alarm, and additional information will be displayed. </li><li>  Detection of all police radars.  This is achieved by the presence of three modules at once - GLONASS, GPS, as well as a radio module. </li><li>  The special X-COP mode is able to work automatically, that is, the detectors are determined depending on the speed of the car.  So, at a speed of up to 40 km / h, the detected radars will be indicated on the display, at a speed of 41 to 70 km / h the City mode will be activated, and at a speed above 71 km / h, the ‚ÄúTrack‚Äù mode will work. </li></ol><h2>  Appearance </h2>

For example, you can immediately notice the curved body, which allows you to most comfortably position the device inside the cabin.  In addition, it is very simple to manage it, since there are a minimum number of buttons, and all the necessary information will be provided to the driver immediately on the display.  External qualities - this is the first thing that users of the Neoline X-COP 9500 pay attention to. Reviews of those who have already used such a recorder are only positive, which is also explained by the convenience of fastening - on a suction cup or special tape. </p><h2>  What's inside? </h2><p>  Of course, many buyers pay attention to the external design of automotive equipment, but do not forget about the technical characteristics.  This model in this regard is simply amazing.  Firstly, it is equipped with excellent optics, characterized by high light sensitivity.  This is ensured thanks to the powerful Ambarella A7 processor with the special Aptina 0330 optical system of six glass lenses. </p><p>  Secondly, the Neoline X-COP 9500 recorder records video in high quality and resolution with a clear picture, even in difficult weather conditions.  Thanks to the excellent focus retention, the device successfully copes with shooting, even if the glass is dirty.  At the same time, everything that happens immediately and in adjacent bands is fixed. </p><h2>  The motion sensor - is! </h2>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Naturally, like any other high-quality recorder, this one is equipped with <span>a motion sensor</span> and a G-sensor.  This allows the device not only to automatically record, protect it from overwriting, but also to monitor even in the parking lot.  Recording is turned on automatically for any movement that will be detected by the sensor.  They have Neoline X-COP 9500 recorders reviews and not very good, which is caused by too high sensitivity of the shock sensor.  That is, if you leave its value as it is set by default, then almost every record will be saved.  However, this problem is easy to fix - you just need to change the sensitivity of the sensor in the settings. </p><h2>  Recorder or detector? </h2><p>  In general, hybrid models most often cause negative reviews.  It is believed that they can hardly cope with the functions of a device.  But the Neoline X-COP 9500 radar in this regard shows excellent characteristics. </p><ol><li>  He confidently copes with any police radars - both manual and mobile, including Strelka. </li><li>  The stability of the hybrid is ensured by the presence of a GPS module. </li><li>  The device‚Äôs database contains many police radars, which can be updated if necessary. </li></ol><p>  Another <span>positive quality</span> of the Neoline X-COP 9500 recorder is that firmware is always available online, and it allows you to improve the device, making it work better and more reliable. </p><h2>  Management Features </h2>

For example, it is respected that the system is equipped with an intelligent alert mode, in which sensitivity depends on the speed of the machine. </p><p>  The car DVR of this brand is distinguished by a laconic appearance, in which there is no place for extra buttons.  Thanks to this, it is easy and simple to operate the device - through a large <span>touch screen</span> with large and conveniently located icons.  When the car moves on the screen, information is collected from two devices at once, so the driver will have a complete picture of what is happening.  Information is collected on the screen about: </p><ul><li>  detection mode; </li><li>  current time and speed; </li><li>  satellite; </li><li>  video status. </li></ul><p>  In addition, information on the distance to the radar and the signal level, the maximum allowed speed and average vehicle speed will be displayed on the screen.  A special + GPS button allows you to add a police radar to the device‚Äôs memory with just one click. </p><p>  Users note that the screen is bright, so everything is clearly visible on it even in strong light.  At the same time, you can always set the screen auto-off mode - it will go out at a certain specified time, which is especially convenient when driving at night. </p>

    <h2>  Video Features </h2><p>  Car DVR Neoline, according to customer reviews, shows the average recording quality.  If during daylight hours you can determine the number on the record at a distance of 10 meters, then at night the maximum figure is 7 meters.  The viewing angle is about 100 degrees, which is more than even expensive models.  The maximum recording resolution is 1920 √ó 1080, while shooting is 30 frames per second, which is standard for most modern devices. </p><h2>  Weight and Mount </h2><p>  The Neoline X-COP 9500 video recorder cannot be called small and compact, but in fact it is almost invisible on the glass.  Due to the unusual appearance - a rectangle, to which two working modules are mounted vertically and horizontally, you have to think about the location of the device in the car.  In any case, this is an economical solution, considering how much space the radar and registrar will occupy separately. </p><p>  Many buyers note that at first the design of the device seems uncomfortable and incomprehensible due to the lack of buttons.  But management was simple thanks to the presence of a three-inch display of sufficient brightness.  And in the process of using the registrar, there were no problems with its work.  It is also noted that the build quality could be better, because when you click on the case, the device creaked. </p><p>  Convenient in terms of mounting Neoline X-COP 9500. The instruction says that you can mount the radar in two ways - on a suction cup or sticker.  Most buyers choose the first method as more reliable and easy to install.  At the same time, both mounting options make it possible to turn the device in the desired direction or remove it at night. </p><h2>  Functionality </h2>

    <p>  The Neoline DVR can be configured as conveniently as possible for each user.  Settings include adjusting the brightness and sensitivity of the sensor during movement and parking, <span>screen calibration</span> and time synchronization by GPS-module.  Not without standard features in the form of a change in resolution, display fading, or sound recording.  The recorder also has a battery, but it has a small capacity, so it is rarely used.

Its average price is almost 20,000 rubles, but for such a considerable amount of money you will get a complete device that combines the functions of a DVR and a radar.  It is no coincidence that this car gadget is recognized as one of the best hybrids in equipment of this type in general.  The interface of both devices is the same, while all the information is concentrated on it, which will allow the driver to be aware of the traffic situation.  The registrar also performs radar functions remarkably, detecting all stationary and mobile police radars. </p><p>  Thus, motorists who will not spare money on the purchase of high-quality equipment will definitely like the Neoline X-COP 9500. Its price is high, but it justifies itself with excellent quality and stable operation.  In addition, such a device will last much longer and better than cheap analogues. </p><h2>  Customer reviews </h2>

    <p>  If you analyze the opinions of buyers of the gadget of this brand, you can deduce the following positive points. </p><ol><li>  A simple and intuitive display with a convenient interface, which even an inexperienced driver will understand.

True, this does not affect the quality of the recording, which is very important.  Secondly, there is no USB port - in order to transfer information from the device to the PC, you have to get a memory card.  Thirdly, the high price.  However, given the quality and reliability of this registrar, the cost does not seem so great. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Thus, if you need a stable and multi-functional automotive equipment, then Neoline brand products will definitely appeal to you.
