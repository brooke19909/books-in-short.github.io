    <p>  Not all Aleksandrov hotels can offer their guests high-speed wireless Internet and a free, constantly guarded parking zone.  It is also worth noting that all rooms have modern plasma TVs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As for the interior, in this case almost all the rooms are decorated in a classic style.  Incidentally, the hotel rooms have carpeted floors, and guests will have a desk.  For those who do not like to walk with a wet head after taking a bath, the hotel offers a hairdryer, which is located in the toilet. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Visitors to this hotel complex note a high level of service and an acceptable pricing policy.  The guests of the establishment like the buffet breakfast, which is served daily at the caf√©, which is part of the project. </p><p>  Also, guests note the presence near the hotel of a large number of excellent restaurants where you can eat well and have a great time.  However, there is one drawback - the prices there are higher than in a hotel cafe. </p>

    <p>  The visitors also consider the location of the hotel an advantage, because in this case the institution is located just 2 kilometers from Sovetskaya Square, which is central in the city.  By the way, if you plan to get to Moscow, then the most ideal option would be to go to the railway station, which is located just a 5-minute drive from Iris. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Meanwhile, we continue to discuss the best hotels in Aleksandrov! </p><h2>  Moles </h2><p>  The next hotel we are discussing is located in a rural area, not far from Moscow and Sergiev Posad.  Guests of this institution have the opportunity to stay in one of several cottages, where there is everything necessary for a comfortable pastime. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that recently, some Alexandrov hotels cannot offer their guests a visit to the SPA center or massage room.  At the same time, this hotel has both such facilities in its structure, so here you can not only have a great time, but also relax. </p>

    <p>  Each guest of Alexandrov's Rodinki Hotel can rent an elegant suite with large <span>French windows</span> and an air conditioning system.  Among the amenities you should definitely highlight the presence of one or two bedrooms (depending on the room category), a living room with a plasma TV and fireplace, a refrigerator, a balcony, a private bathroom and a coffee machine. </p><h2>  Hotel reviews </h2><p>  The comments of Runet users who stayed at this hotel complex testify to the excellent quality of the rooms and the high qualification of the working staff.  By the way, quite often customers mention in their reviews a local restaurant where everyone can try European dishes at the lowest prices. </p>

    <p>  The cottages, which are available for rent, have a secluded atmosphere, which many consider luxury in the modern world.  It should be noted that Rodinki Boutique Hotel is famous for its location, because it is located only 8 km from the railway station of Strunino.  At the same time, it will take almost 100 kilometers to go to Sheremetyevo Airport. </p><h2>  "Alexandrov" </h2><p>  Who would have thought that an institution having the status of a congress hotel named after Alexandrov would appear in such a small city.  The hotel is only 38 km from the city of Pereslavl-Zalessky and offers its guests high-speed wireless Internet, a bar, a private parking zone, a restaurant, as well as other infrastructure and amenities. </p><p>  Each room that you can rent in an institution such as the Aleksandrov Hotel (we will discuss the reviews a bit later) has its own bathroom, and the presence of a modern TV should definitely be highlighted among the amenities.  At the same time, a hotel client can use a hairdryer and toiletries. </p><h2>  Guest reviews </h2><p>  Hotel "Alexandrov" in Aleksandrov receives almost always positive comments, which refer to the excellent quality of the rooms.  Visitors to the hotel consider it to be one of the best, as experienced specialists work there, always ready to help the guest.  Prices are quite affordable. </p>
