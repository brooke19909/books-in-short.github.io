To facilitate the work of housewives, manufacturers are trying periodically to improve the familiar to everyone device - an iron.  Brown is a German company, which is distinguished by its attentive attitude to ergonomics and reliability of household appliances.  Consider the irons of this company Texstyle 7 models. </p><h2>  Precious iron sole - the trump card </h2><p>  Iron manufacturers decided to pay attention to such a problem of all irons as abrasion and scratches on the sole.  Sapphire is known to be close to diamond in strength.  It was this quality that the inventors decided to use.  They covered the sole of the iron with sapphire spraying.  Now you need to try very hard to leave damage on such a surface.  You can even brush Brown Iron with metal brushes.  Sapphire for many years will keep the sole in perfect condition. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iron brown" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39070/1179516.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Power model - 2,400 watts.  This makes it easy to iron the most naughty fabrics.  The narrow nose of the iron is equipped with steam holes.  It is very convenient for ironing shirts where there are buttons and in other hard-to-reach places. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The power of steam boost is - 170 g / min.  The Texstyle 7 Brown Iron has a 400 ml <span>water</span> tank.  Steaming can be carried out in a vertical position.  There is no need to remove a thing from a hanger to refresh it and smooth it.  For curtains, this function is considered indispensable. </p><p>  The special sapphire coating not only does not scratch, but also provides ease of sliding on the surface of the laundry.  Auto power off is not available on all Texstyle 7 models. This parameter can only be found on the TS 765 A and TS 785 STP models.  To call a steam boost on the iron body there is a special button - "Extra Steam".  It should be pressed in places where the usual functions of the iron are clearly not enough. </p><h2>  Appearance and Ergonomics </h2><p>  The appearance of the device is quite modern and fashionable.  The company paid sufficient attention to ergonomics.  The handle is made of plastic with rubberized inserts.  With prolonged ironing, this is an important fact.  The Texstyle 7 Brown Iron has a 2.5 meter cord.  This is quite enough, especially if the <span>ironing board</span> itself <span>is</span> equipped with sockets.  Colors - gray, blue, white or black. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iron brown texstyle 7" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39070/1179519.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  Iron "Brown" reviews from the hostesses are mostly positive, and they relate to the ironing process itself.  Owners of the device easily cope with shirts and inaccessible places on clothes.  All this thanks to the narrow nose of the iron and the holes on it for steaming. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Vertical steaming is not satisfactory to buyers.  The Brown Iron Texstyle 7 does an excellent job. </p><p>  Like the happy owners of the device, and the sliding ability of the sole.  Time is now spent on the process many times less. </p><p>  The design of the household appliance is designed in such a way that when it falls, the iron will not break and will not lose its function.  This fact is seen in the reviews of housewives.  Of course, you should not check the strength of the device in this way.  Much depends on the height of the damage, and on the floor covering.  But users are talking specifically about falling from an ironing board. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iron brown reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39070/1179522.jpg" width="564"></div>

    <p>  In the kit for the iron you can find a special nozzle for ironing delicate fabrics.  Mistresses note that when you use it, you can safely iron thin and white blouses and are not afraid that yellow spots will appear on the surface.  This nozzle is indispensable for ironing suits and trousers.  You can forget about special materials and gauze, through which the older generation of housewives are used to stroking.  The nozzle is fixed firmly and does not come off during the ironing process. </p><p>  Ergonomics thought out to the smallest detail.  The buttons are comfortable and pressed effortlessly.  The wheel for choosing the temperature and fabrics also rotates easily.  The cord does not twist. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  The Brown Iron is not so perfect.  Testimonials on forms and sites are evidence of this.  The main reason why many housewives did not like the device is its instability.  This problem can be easily solved with a special stand on the ironing board.  In this case, the iron will be stored in a horizontal position.  This is not always convenient, but this is the only way out of the situation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iron brown texstyle" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39070/1179528.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  The cord on some Texstyle 7 iron models is not very durable.  Its length also does not suit all housewives. </p><p>  The water injection hole is narrow, but this drawback plagues almost all irons.  A measuring cup with a spout is not included in many models.  I have to use watering cans and bottles. </p><p>  Scale does not form on the iron for a certain time.  Then the appliance begins to leak and stain clothes.  Only the use of special water for ironing will correct the situation. </p><p>  The weight of the device, especially with a full tank for steaming, is impressive and does not suit all women. </p><p>  The average iron price in Russia is 6-7 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Iron Brown: instruction </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the iron is a fairly simple device, everyone knows how to use this device.  Nevertheless, it is strongly recommended that you read the instructions before use.  It comes with an iron.  Steam water is also suitable for tap water.  But if it is stiff, then you need to dilute it with a store liquid or filtered in a ratio of 50 to 50. </p><p>  Before filling the tank with water, you need to set the position of the steam regulator to the value - "0".  The container is labeled with the maximum allowable amount of liquid.  Do not pour water in excess of this icon. </p><p>  After that, it will be possible to turn on the iron in the power grid.  Before you start ironing you need to wait until the light stops blinking.  Keep the device upright. </p><p>  Ironing temperature should correspond to the information on the clothing label. </p><p>  The amount of steam produced is adjustable from 0 to 6. It is enough to select the desired mode on the iron body.  The manufacturer recommends using the maximum value of the steam regulator for the processing of linen and cotton items.  For all other tissues, use this regimen with caution. </p><p>  There are rules for turning on steam at full power.  So, the position of the regulator at maximum power can be kept only 30 seconds. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iron brown sapphire" class="if" height="380" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39070/1179530.jpg" width="380"></div>

    <h2>  Safety and Precautions </h2><p>  Iron Brown Texstyle 7 can automatically turn off after 8 minutes in a position - vertical to the surface.  When ironing and stopping on a cloth in a horizontal position, the device turns off after 30 seconds of inactivity.  For all safety measures created by manufacturers, the Brown Iron should not be left unattended.  Faulty sockets and extension cords must not be used.  Before pouring water into the tank, make sure that the Brown iron is unplugged.  A special mark on the maximum water level warns against transfusion of liquid in the iron.  In no case should you turn off the iron, pulling the cord, instead of the plug.  When ironing, you need to be careful and make sure that the wire does not fall under the sole of the iron.  Children under 12 years old should not be trusted with ironing with this appliance.  In the event of a breakdown, such as damage to the cord or water leakage from openings not intended for steaming, immediately contact a service center for troubleshooting.  A broken or damaged iron must never be plugged in. </p><h2>  Care and Cleaning </h2><p>  The sole surface can only be cleaned with a piece of woolen cloth.  Do not use abrasives, acetones, alcohols and hard, iron sponges and brushes for this purpose.  The case itself can be washed with a damp cloth or a rag dipped in soapy water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iron brown instruction" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39070/1179532.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Iron "Brown" Texstyle 7 can hardly be attributed to the budget version of the devices.  Many attributed the price of this device to the minuses, but its strength and reliability are worth the money that manufacturers offer for it.  Deficiencies are not so significant and many can be easily smoothed out with the help of additional devices. </p>
