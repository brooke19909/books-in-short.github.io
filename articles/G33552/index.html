  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Review of mobile phone Nokia 2690</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The hero of this article was Nokia 2690. The Finnish brand was previously the most popular.  In his line there are many different models.  Some of them have become a true legend.  But today I would like to talk about a budget mobile phone in which the manufacturer implemented interesting functions at that time.  We are talking about the possibility of working with external drives, a standard ("mini-jack") audio jack.  Young people, of course, cannot be surprised by this, but earlier such options were decisive when choosing a mobile phone.  So let's look at the characteristics of this model. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The Nokia 2690 review by tradition we will begin with the description of appearance.  According to most users, a copy with a white case looks more elegant.  Due to the fact that it uses a black keyboard, such a combination of colors gives effect. </p><p>  The design of the phone is quite typical for that time.  The case with rounded edges does not look rough, even though its thickness is prohibitive by today's standards - almost 14 mm.  The height and width of the phone is 107.3 √ó 45.2 mm.  Due to its special shape without sharp corners, the device is very comfortable to use.  He does not slip out of his hands.  Also, low weight affects only convenience - only 82 g. </p><p>  If the front panel of the device is glossy, then the back side is matte.  On the surface of the lid there is a small pattern.  At the top is a large camera lens, underneath is the company logo. </p><p>  The assembly of the device is of high quality.  There are no gaps between the parts.  The battery cover does not bend, does not play anything. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.gsmarena.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mobile phone Nokia 2690" class="if uuid-2245881" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2245881.jpg"></div><h2>  A few words about the screen </h2><p>  Nokia 2690 is equipped with a color display.  It is framed by a rather thick black frame.  Screen size - 1.8 inches.  It is based on the TFT matrix.  The maximum resolution of the reproduced picture is 128 √ó 160 px.  Talking about image quality is, of course, unnecessary.  In the sun it will be difficult to see anything, even setting the highest brightness.  Under such conditions, only contrasting text will remain readable.  But in the room there will be no problems.  All information will be displayed legibly.  Describing the characteristics of the screen, it is also worth saying that the possibilities of the color palette are limited to 262 thousand shades. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mobilemodels.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nokia 2690 Menu" class="if uuid-2245886" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2245886.jpg"></div><h2>  Keyboard </h2><p>  Given that the Nokia 2690 is controlled via a push-button keyboard, it is also necessary to describe it.  It is divided into two blocks.  The first is directly below the screen.  It consists of four standard buttons and a joystick for five positions.  With the help of the latter, you can scroll through the menu, as well as get quick access to some applications (set in the settings), and when pressed in the center, a confirmation function is performed.  The reset and call receiving keys are displayed at a certain distance from the soft buttons.  This greatly facilitates the use and minimizes the risk of accidental pressing. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="technave.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nokia 2690 phone screen" class="if uuid-2245882" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2245882.jpg"></div><p>  Under the control panel is a digital unit.  It consists of fairly large keys.  They are made of plastic.  Due to the smooth surface, it is not always convenient to use them, for example, for girls with long nails.  Each key has a designation.  They are clearly visible and equipped with a backlight, so dialing a number or message text will not be a problem even in the dark. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The Nokia 2690 has a camera in its arsenal.  Unfortunately, its resolution is very small - only 0.3 megapixels.  The only thing it comes in handy for is snapshots on MMS.  The ‚Äúwindow‚Äù with which the optical lens is protected is on a par with the body.  During use, it is constantly contaminated and scratched, which gives owners inconvenience. </p><p>  In order to activate the camera, you will need to go to the menu (item ‚ÄúMultimedia‚Äù).  Also for convenience, you can put it on quick access.  Viewfinder orientation is vertical.  Three commands are displayed on the screen in this mode: ‚ÄúBack‚Äù (return to the menu), ‚ÄúFunctions‚Äù (go to settings) and ‚ÄúShooting‚Äù.  It also displays data on the size, mode and zoom control.  Use the latter does not make sense, since the image is very blurry. </p><h2>  Menu </h2><p>  The Nokia 2690 runs on Series 40. Firmware, it is worth noting, most users like it.  The system works smartly, applications open in a split second.  On the main screen, the service line, the purpose of the soft keys and the time with the current date are displayed.  Menu icons are displayed as a list or grid.  The size of the latter is 3 √ó 3. The phone has nine themes.  The appearance of the main screen can be changed.  For this, three options are offered at the discretion of the user. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.snapdeal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nokia 2690 Battery" class="if uuid-2245883" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2245883.jpg"></div><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The most significant advantage of the Nokia 2690 is the battery.  In the apparatus, the manufacturer installed a lithium-ion chemical battery.  Battery Type - BL-4C.  Capacity - 860 mAh.  The phone in standby mode can work for about 15 days.  If you use it intensively (as far as functions allow), then you will have to charge the battery no earlier than three days later.  You can restore the battery resource in 2.5 hours. </p>
