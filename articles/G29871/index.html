In addition, extreme triangles that were formed as a result of drawing diagonals in squares are cut off. </li><li>  On the drawn sides of the whole geometric figure, make bends so that the triangles are superimposed on each other, partially covering the square. </li><li>  It is necessary to glue the triangles together, lubricating the lower figure, and put the upper one on top. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the easiest bookmark corner" class="if uuid-2958474" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2958474.jpg"></div><p>  The result is a square, part of which diagonally forms a triangle. </p><h2>  Original heart-shaped corner bookmark </h2><p>  The origami bookmark-corner technique for a book is used quite often, since the product is beautiful, neat and functional.
