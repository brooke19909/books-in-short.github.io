Traveler reviews indicate the wide popularity that this area has recently acquired in terms of tourist vacations. </p><h2>  Background of Agia Pelagia </h2><p>  The island of Crete, the largest of the Greek islands, is located in the Mediterranean Sea and is washed by the waters of three seas: from the north - Cretan, from the south - Libyan, and from the west - Ionian.  A few millennia ago on the island there was the oldest, according to scientists, civilization in Europe - Minoan, which is confirmed by numerous archaeological excavations and historical and cultural monuments.  Ancient tombs of this civilization were found in the vicinity of the town of Agia Pelagia (Crete).  Reviews of scientists speak about the uniqueness of these findings.  It is believed that at this place was the oldest city called Apollonia, or in another Elephant, built in the ninth century BC and subsequently destroyed by an earthquake. </p><h2>  Agia Pelagia - a popular resort </h2><p>  Only a small fishing village a few decades ago was on the island of Crete Agia Pelagia.  Reviews of tourists, admired by wonderful quiet bays, magnificent beaches and the unique beauty of the local nature, show that it has turned into a popular resort with excellent leisure infrastructure.  Now it is connected by a new convenient road with the capital Heraklion and other large settlements of the island.  The town is formed by several small villages, the white houses of which are comfortably located on mountainous slopes, descending in a semicircle to the sea - these are Greece, Crete, Agia Pelagia.  Reviews from tourists about this place are just wonderful. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crete agia pelagia reviews" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43102/1402153.jpg" width="600"></div>

This is an active temple, in which church services are still held.  During the Middle Ages, one of the first monasteries of the island of Crete, Savvatianon, was located here, and the chapel of St. Pelagius was built nearby.  According to legend, a miraculous icon of the Holy Pelagia was found in it in ancient times.  You can enter this tiny building only by bending down, and indoors it is impossible to straighten up to the full height.  However, numerous pilgrims came here, hoping for a cure for serious illnesses.  They tried to transfer the icon to the monastery church, but somehow it was again in the chapel. </p><h2>  Climate of Agia Pelagia </h2><p>  In a quiet bay at a distance of two tens of kilometers from the capital, Heraklion is comfortably located on the island of Crete (Greece) Agia Pelagia.  Reviews of tourists characterize the local climate as moderate subtropical with hot, dry summers and humid, warm winters.  The swimming period lasts from April to October.

    <p>  On the hill of Kefalos, where Knossos was subsequently built, the first settlement appeared in the 7th millennium BC, for many millennia it turned into a grand and powerful palace city, consisting of one and a half thousand rooms.  The palace has an almost square shape, but it does not have an ordered layout of the premises.  They form a unique mess around the courtyard.  Despite such asymmetry of the rooms, lighting, sewage, and also water supply and ventilation systems are well thought out.  All utilities are placed in such a unique way that repair work can be done at any point.  In the ceiling, light wells are arranged in a special way, thanks to which magnificent lighting was created.  Water was supplied using two stone gutters from reservoirs, one of which was filled from a natural reservoir, and the second during rains. </p><p>  The wealth and luxury of the palace are spoken by magnificent frescoes adorning its walls.  Most of them are kept in museums in Heraklion.  The frescoes depict flowers, plants and animals, elegant dancing people.  There are no military plots or images of leaders.  There are also no religious paintings. </p><p>  The constant excavations of Knossos began only at the beginning of the 20th century.  Thanks to the English archaeologist, the world learned about the oldest civilization and its great monument. </p><h2>  Fodele Village </h2><p>  Next to Agia Pelagia in the orange and lemon orchards lies the village of Fodele, famous for the fact that the famous El Greco lived and worked in it.  Now an artist‚Äôs museum is open here with reproductions of his paintings and a bust made by a famous sculptor is installed.  Nearby is the Panagia Church with unique 14th-century frescoes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crete greece agia pelagia reviews" class="if" height="455" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43102/1402154.jpg" width="600"></div>
