    <h2>  Bayside Katsaras 4 *: negative reviews </h2><p>  In order not to spoil the rest, it is important to be prepared for any surprises and negative moments.  Unfortunately, they are inherent in the Bayside Hotel Katsaras 4 *.  The reviews contain the following information: </p><ul><li>  photos of the hotel and its rooms, presented on the official website and other resources, are significantly embellished and do not correspond to reality; </li><li>  cockroaches crawl into the bathroom through the ventilation pipes; </li><li>  only cold water flows from the tap in the washbasin; </li><li>  in most rooms there is no hairdryer (despite the fact that its availability has been declared); </li><li>  a very narrow shower cabin, and therefore during bathing you will constantly come in contact with an unpleasant slippery curtain; </li><li>  expensive and tasteless dinners in a restaurant (it is better to eat in neighboring establishments); </li><li>  the hotel has practically no animation, and therefore in the evenings everyone leaves for the city; </li><li>  on a public beach, paid sunbeds and umbrellas; </li><li>  uncomfortable entry into the sea with sharp pebbles; </li><li>  Considering that the hotel is located near the airport, you will always be disturbed by the noise of planes taking off and landing; </li><li>  the hotel does not justify the 4 stars assigned to it (it is rather a good "troika"); </li><li>  it is impossible to relax on the beach due to intrusive sellers and guides; </li><li>  on the way to the sea you will have to cross the roadway; </li><li>  the beds are very hard and creaky; </li><li>  for the entire time of rest, the breakfast menu has never changed; </li><li>  old bedding with scuffs and stains, which apparently do not wash; </li><li>  very few sunbeds by the pool (they are not enough for all guests); </li><li>  the hotel does not provide beach towels, so you need to bring them with you or buy on the spot; </li><li>  the staff does not understand a word in Russian, and therefore, before the trip you need to master English at least to a small extent; </li><li>  strong audibility between numbers; </li><li>  a double bed is one and a half shifted, which are constantly moving apart due to the wheels on the legs; </li><li>  the food in the restaurant is too greasy; </li><li>  there is no possibility of rest on an all-inclusive basis. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Choosing a Bayside Katsaras 4 * hotel for a sea holiday, you should be prepared not only for positive, but also negative moments.  Perhaps it‚Äôs worth starting with the last paragraph.  The hotel has a very small territory, as well as an outdated room fund.  Also, those who are used to spending time brightly and cheerfully will not like it here.  The fact is that there is practically no entertainment here, and therefore European retirees mainly enjoy their holidays here.  As for nutrition, you should not spend money on anything except breakfast.  You can take a closer look at Greek cuisine at the many taverns and restaurants located nearby.  Also, do not forget about the proximity of two airports (civilian and military), which create a lot of noise. </p><p>  The main advantage of this institution is its warm atmosphere.  It seems that you are not coming to a hotel, but to a warm and comfortable house, where you are very welcome.  And this is not surprising, because Bayside Katsaras 4 * is a family business.  The hosts not only work, but also live here, and therefore they carefully monitor that the guests do not need anything.  And the employees will not only help you solve organizational issues, but they will also make up the company while walking or having a cup of coffee (unless, of course, you speak English well enough). </p><p>  Given the low rates for accommodation, Bayside Katsaras 4 * can be considered an ideal place for active travelers who do not like to spend a lot of time in the room and on the hotel territory.  Due to its convenient location and good transport interchange, this place is an ideal starting point for exploring the island (you can travel by bus, but it is better to rent a car).  If you like to spend days on the beach and do not tolerate the hustle and bustle, this institution will also appeal to you. </p>
