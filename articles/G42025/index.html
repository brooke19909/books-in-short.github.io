You can go to him once on an excursion, but it is often not recommended.  The color of the water itself is not too pleasant, it is dirty turquoise, and the head may hurt from the smell. </p><p>  The treatment itself takes place in a health resort building.  It offers luxurious baths of heated mud, in which you want a sweet nap, hydrogen sulfide baths, a huge selection of medical procedures and the services of qualified doctors.  A separate topic is nutrition.  The menu here is well thought out, even for those who are shown diet food.  A varied and tasty meal awaits guests every day.  The Sergievsky sanatorium of the Samara region is a real salvation for diseases of the skin or nervous system, muscles and bones.  They successfully undergo rehabilitation after operations. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The pride of the resort is its own mineral water.  It is used for dining and medicinal purposes, for baths and inhalations.  In its composition, it is very rich in mineral salts and trace elements, but at the same time it is low-mineralized.  A large set of nutrients and their low concentration make it possible to use water daily, like an ordinary dining room. </p><h2>  Brief conclusions and reviews </h2><p>  If you want to have a good rest, breathe fresh air and strengthen your health, then the sanatoriums of the Samara region work for you.  Reviews of vacationers emphasize the high level of medical services, good food and comfortable rooms.  The only negative is entertainment, especially for those who come with children.  Many note that outside the procedures, vacationers are left to their own devices, and undeveloped infrastructure does not have the opportunity to find an interesting lesson.  On the other hand, these institutions are created for treatment, and there is always the opportunity to take a walk in the fresh air, disconnect from the worldly fuss and read books.  Take board games with you to make the evenings more fun. </p>
