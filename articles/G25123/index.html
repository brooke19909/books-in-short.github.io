Similar events took place in Western Europe.  This was a general trend of the feudal Middle Ages.  Gradually, Russia was divided into several de facto independent principalities with common traditions, culture and the Rurik dynasty.  The most important year for the country was 1132, when Mstislav the Great died.  It is this date that historians consider the beginning of the final political fragmentation.  In this state, Russia existed until the middle of the XIII century, when it survived the invasion of the Mongol-Tatar troops. </p><h2>  Kiev land </h2><p>  For many years, the principalities of ancient Russia divided, united, and the ruling branches of the Rurikovich dynasty changed, etc. Nevertheless, despite the complexity of these events, several key destinies that played the most important role in the life of the country can be distinguished.  Even after the actual collapse de jure, the Kiev prince was considered the eldest. </p>

    <p>  Control over the ‚Äúmother of Russian cities‚Äù tried to establish a variety of specific rulers.  Therefore, if the specific principalities of ancient Rus had their hereditary dynasties, then Kiev most often passed from hand to hand.  After the death of Mstislav Vladimirovich in 1132, the city briefly became the property of the Chernigov Rurikovich.  This did not suit other representatives of the dynasty.  Due to the ensuing wars, Kiev first ceased to control the Pereyaslavl, Turov and Vladimir-Volyn principalities, and then (in 1169) it was completely plundered by the army of Andrei Bogolyubsky and finally lost its political significance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Chernihiv </h2><p>  <span>The specific principalities of</span> ancient Russia on Chernigov land belonged to the descendants of Svyatoslav Yaroslavovich.  They have long been in conflict with Kiev.  The Chernigov dynasty for several decades was divided into two branches: Olgovichi and Davydovichi.  With each generation, more and more specific principalities arose, breaking away from Chernigov (Novgorod-Severskoye, Bryansk, Kursk, etc.). </p>

    <p>  The most striking ruler of this region, historians consider Svyatoslav Olgovich.  He was an ally of <span>Yuri Dolgoruky.</span>  It was with their allied feast in Moscow in 1147 that the history of the capital of Russia, confirmed by chronicles, begins.  When the principalities of ancient Rus united in the struggle against the Mongols who appeared in the east, the specific rulers of the Chernigov land came out with the rest of the Rurikovich and were defeated on <span>the Kalka River.</span>  The invasion of the steppes did not affect the whole principality, but only its eastern part.  Nevertheless, it recognized itself as a vassal of the Golden Horde (after the painful death of Mikhail Vsevolodovich).  In the XIV century, Chernihiv, along with many neighboring cities, was annexed to Lithuania. </p><h2>  Polotsk region </h2><p>  In Polotsk Izyaslavichi ruled (descendants of Izyaslav Vladimirovich).  This branch of the Rurikovich stood out before the others.  In addition, Polotsk was the first to start an armed struggle for independence from Kiev.  The earliest such war occurred at the beginning of the XI century. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Like other principalities of ancient Russia during the period of fragmentation, Polotsk eventually split into several small destinies (Vitebsk, Minsk, Drutsky, etc.).  Part of these cities as a result of wars and dynastic marriages passed to the Smolensk Rurikovich.  But the most dangerous opponents of Polotsk, without a doubt, were the Lithuanians.  At first, these Baltic tribes staged predatory raids on Russian lands.  Then they proceeded to conquest.  In 1307, Polotsk finally became part of the gaining power of the Lithuanian state. </p><h2>  Volhynia </h2><p>  In Volyn (south-west of modern Ukraine) two major political centers emerged - Vladimir-Volynsky and Galich.  Having become independent from Kiev, these principalities began to compete with each other for leadership in the region.  At the end of the XII century, Roman Mstislavovich united two cities.  His principality was named Galitsky-Volynsky.  The influence of the monarch was so great that he sheltered the Byzantine emperor Alexei III, expelled by the crusaders from Constantinople. </p>

    <p>  Roman's son Daniel overshadowed his father's success with his fame.  He successfully fought against the Poles, Hungarians and Mongols, periodically entering into alliances with one of the neighbors.  In 1254, Daniel even took the title of King of Russia from the pope, hoping for the help of Western Europe in the fight against the steppes.  After his death, the Galician-Volyn principality fell into decay.  At first it was divided into several destinies, and then it was captured by Poland.  The fragmentation of Ancient Russia, whose principalities were constantly at war with each other, prevented it from fighting against external threats. </p><h2>  Smolensk region </h2><p>  The Smolensk principality was located in the geographical center of Russia.  It became independent under the son of Mstislav the Great Rostislav.  At the end of the XII century, the princedoms of Ancient Rus again began a fierce struggle for Kiev.  The main contenders for power in the ancient capital were Smolensk and Chernihiv rulers. </p>

    <p>  The heights of power descendants of Rostislav reached under Mstislav Romanovich.  In 1214-1223 years.  he ruled not only Smolensk, but also Kiev.  It was this prince who initiated the first anti-Mongol coalition that was defeated at Kalka.  Subsequently, Smolensk was less affected than the others by the invasion.  Nevertheless, his rulers paid tribute to the Golden Horde.  Gradually, the principality was caught between Lithuania and Moscow, which were gaining influence.  Independence in such conditions could not be long.  As a result of this, in 1404, the Lithuanian prince Vitovt naturally added Smolensk to his possessions. </p><h2>  Outpost on the Oka </h2><p>  The Ryazan principality occupied land on the Middle Oka.  It stood out from the possessions of the Chernigov rulers.  In the 1160s, Moore broke away from Ryazan.  The Mongol invasion hit this edge painfully.  Residents, princes, principalities of ancient Rus did not understand the threat posed by the eastern conquerors.  In 1237, Ryazan was the first Russian city to be destroyed by the steppes.  Subsequently, the principality fought against Moscow, which was gaining strength.  For example, Ryazan ruler Oleg Ivanovich for a long time was an opponent of Dmitry Donskoy.  Gradually Ryazan was losing ground.  She was annexed to Moscow in 1521. </p><h2>  Novgorod Republic </h2><p>  The historical characteristic of the principalities of Ancient Russia cannot be complete without mentioning the Novgorod Republic.  This state lived according to its particular political and social structure.  An aristocratic republic was established here with a strong influence of the popular council.  The princes were elected military leaders (they were invited from other Russian lands). </p>

    <p>  A similar political system developed in Pskov, which was called the "younger brother of Novgorod."  These two cities were centers of international trade.  Compared with other Russian political centers, they had the most contacts with Western Europe.  After the Baltic military <span>monastic orders</span> seized the Baltic states, serious friction began between the knights and Novgorod.  This struggle reached its climax in the 1240s.  It was then that the Swedes and Germans were successively defeated by Prince Alexander Nevsky.  When the historical journey from Ancient Russia to the Grand <span>Duchy of Moscow was</span> almost completed <span>, the</span> republic was left face to face with Ivan III.  He conquered Novgorod in 1478. </p><h2>  North-Eastern Russia </h2><p>  The first political centers of North-Eastern Russia in the XI-XII centuries.  were Rostov, Suzdal and Vladimir.  The descendants of Monomakh and his youngest son, Yuri Dolgoruky, ruled here.  The successors of his father, Andrei Bogolyubsky and Vsevolod the Big Nest, strengthened the authority of the Principality of Vladimir, making it the largest and strongest in fragmented Russia. </p>

    <p>  With the children of Vsevolod the Big Nest, a major <span>internecine war began.</span>  The first unitary principalities began to appear.  However, the real disasters came to North-Eastern Russia along with the Mongols.  Nomads ravaged this land, burned many of its cities.  During the Horde rule, the khans recognized the <span>princes of Vladimir</span> as elders throughout Russia.  Edit there were put those who received a special label. </p><p>  Two new opponents stood out in the fight for Vladimir: Tver and Moscow.  The peak of their confrontation came at the beginning of the XIV century.  In this rivalry, Moscow was the winner.  Gradually, her princes united North-Eastern Russia, overthrew the Mongol-Tatar yoke and ultimately created a single Russian state (Ivan the Terrible became its first king in 1547). </p>
