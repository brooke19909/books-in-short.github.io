  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Moscow, 1993: the shooting of the White House</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The economic and political crisis that began in the 80s of the 20th century in the USSR intensified significantly in the 90s and led to a series of global and radical changes in the territorial-political structure of one sixth of the land, then called the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and its collapse . </p><p>  It was a period of intense political struggle and confusion.  Supporters of maintaining a strong central authority came into confrontation with supporters of decentralization and sovereignty of the republics. </p><p>  On November 6, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, who was then elected to the post of President of the RSFSR, by his decree terminated the activities of the Communist Party in the republic. </p><p>  On December 25, 1991, the last President of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, appeared on central television.  He announced the resignation of office.  In 19-38 Moscow time, the USSR flag was lowered from the Kremlin, and after almost 70 years of existence, the Soviet Union forever disappeared from the political map of the world.  A new era has begun. </p><div class="photo" data-original="russian7.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="shooting of the white house 1993" class="if uuid-2300556" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41738/2300556.jpg"></div><h2>  The crisis of dual power </h2><p>  The confusion and chaos always accompanying changes in the political system did not pass over the formation of the Russian Federation.  Simultaneously with maintaining broad powers, the <span>Supreme Council of the RSFSR</span> and the Congress of People's Deputies established the post of President.  Dual power arose in the state.  The country demanded quick changes, but the President, before the adoption of the new edition of the main law, was severely limited in power.  According to the old, still Soviet Constitution, most of the powers were in the hands of the highest legislative body - the Supreme Council. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Parties to the conflict </h2><p>  On one side of the confrontation was Boris Yeltsin.  He was supported by the Cabinet of Ministers, headed by Viktor Chernomyrdin, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, a small part of the deputies, as well as law enforcement agencies. </p><p>  On the other side was the bulk of the deputies and members of the Supreme Council, headed by Ruslan Khasbulatov and Alexander Rutsky, who served as vice president.  Most of their supporters included Communist deputies and members of nationalist parties. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nekropole.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="white house shooting year" class="if uuid-2300559" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41738/2300559.jpg"></div><h2>  Causes </h2><p>  The President and his associates advocated the swift adoption of the new fundamental law and the strengthening of the influence of the President.  Most were advocates of "shock therapy."  They wanted a speedy implementation of economic reforms and a complete change in all structures of power.  Their opponents advocated that all power be retained at the Congress of People's Deputies, as well as against hasty reforms.  An additional reason was the unwillingness of the Congress to ratify the agreements signed in Belovezhskaya Pushcha.  And supporters of the Council believed that the president‚Äôs team was simply trying to blame their failures in reforming the economy.  After lengthy and fruitless negotiations, the conflict came to a standstill. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Open confrontation </h2><p>  On March 20, 1993, Yeltsin on central television spoke about the signing of Decree No. 1400, On Phased Constitutional Reform in the Russian Federation.  It provided for management during the transition period.  This decree also provided for the termination of the powers of the Supreme Council and the holding of a referendum on a number of issues.  The President argued that all attempts to establish cooperation with the Supreme Council failed, and to overcome the protracted crisis, he was forced to take certain measures.  But later it turned out that Yeltsin never put his signature on the decree. </p><p>  On March 26, the ninth extraordinary Congress of People's Deputies is meeting. </p><p>  On March 28, the Congress is considering a proposal for the impeachment of the President and the resignation of the head of the Council Khasbulatov.  Both proposals did not get the required number of votes.  In particular, 617 deputies voted for Yeltsin‚Äôs impeachment, and at least 689 votes were needed.  A draft resolution on the holding of early elections was also rejected. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.aif.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="shooting of the white house" class="if uuid-2300552" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41738/2300552.jpg"></div><h2>  Referendum and constitutional reform </h2><p>  On April 25, 1993, a referendum was held.  There were four questions in the ballots.  The first two are about trust in the President and his policies.  The last two are about the need for early elections of the President and deputies.  The first two respondents answered positively, but the latter did not get the right number of votes.  The draft new version of the Constitution of the Russian Federation was published in the Izvestia newspaper on April 30. </p><h2>  Aggravation of opposition </h2><p>  On September 1, President Boris Yeltsin issued a decree on the temporary dismissal of A.V. Rutsky.  The Vice President constantly criticized the decisions made by the President.  Rutsky was accused of corruption, but the charges did not find any confirmation.  In addition, the decision did not comply with the norms of the current law. </p><p>  On September 21, at 19-55, the Presidium of the Supreme Council received the text of Decree No. 1400.  And at 20-00, Yeltsin addressed the people and announced that the Congress of People's Deputies and the Supreme Council were losing their powers due to their inaction and sabotage of <span>constitutional reform.</span>  Introduced bodies of interim control.  Have appointed <span>elections to the State Duma of the</span> Russian Federation. </p><p>  In response to the actions of the President, the Supreme Council issued a decree on the immediate removal of Yeltsin and the transfer of his functions to Vice-President A.V. Rutskoi.  This was followed by an appeal to the citizens of the Russian Federation, the peoples of the commonwealth, deputies of all levels, military personnel and members of the security forces, who were urged to stop the attempt of a ‚Äúcoup d'etat‚Äù.  The organization of the headquarters of the House of Soviets security was also launched. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.aif.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="shooting of a white house from tanks" class="if uuid-2300567" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41738/2300567.jpg"></div><h2>  Siege </h2><p>  At around 20-45, a spontaneous rally was going under the White House, and the construction of barricades began. </p><p>  September 22 at 00-25 Rutskoi announced the assumption of office of the President of the Russian Federation.  In the morning near the White House there were about 1,500 people, by the end of the day there were several thousand.  They began to form volunteer units.  Dual power arose in the country.  Heads of administrations and security forces mostly supported Boris Yeltsin.  Representative authorities - Khasbulatov and Rutsky.  The latter issued decrees, and Yeltsin, by his decrees, recognized all his decrees invalid. </p><p>  On September 23, the government decided to disconnect the building of the House of Soviets from heating, electricity and telecommunications.  Guards of the Supreme Council were given machine guns, pistols and ammunition for them. </p><p>  Late in the evening of the same day, a group of armed supporters of the Armed Forces attacked the headquarters of the combined armed forces of the CIS.  Two people died.  Supporters of the president used the attack as an excuse to increase pressure on those holding a blockade near the Supreme Council building. </p><p>  At 22-00 an extraordinary emergency Congress of People's Deputies opened. </p><p>  On September 24, the Congress recognized President B. Yeltsin as illegitimate and approved all staff appointments undertaken by Alexander Rutsky. </p><p>  September 27.  The access control near the White House has been tightened, tension is growing. </p><p>  Deputy Prime Minister S. Shahrai said that deputies have actually become hostages of armed extremist groups forming in the building. </p><p>  September 28th.  At night, the police department of Moscow blocked the entire territory adjacent to the House of Soviets.  All approaches were blocked with barbed wire and sprinklers.  Passage of people and vehicles is completely stopped.  During the day at the cordon ring numerous rallies and riots of supporters of the Armed Forces. </p><p>  September 29th.  The cordon was extended to the Garden Ring itself.  Residential buildings and social facilities fell into the cordon.  By order of the head of the armed forces, journalists were no longer allowed into the building.  Colonel General Makashov from the balcony of the House of Soviets warned that in case of violation of the perimeter of the fence, fire would be opened without warning. </p><p>  In the evening, the demand of the government of the Russian Federation was announced, in which Alexander Rutsky and Ruslan Khasbulatov were invited to remove from the building and disarm all their supporters by October 4, under the guarantee of personal security and amnesty. </p><p>  September 30th.  At night, it was reported that the Supreme Council allegedly plans to carry out armed attacks on strategic targets.  Armored vehicles were sent to the House of Soviets.  In response, Rutskaya ordered Major General Frolov, commander of the 39th Motorized Rifle Division, to nominate two regiments to Moscow. </p><p>  In the morning, demonstrators began to arrive in small groups.  Despite their completely peaceful behavior, the police and riot police continued to brutally disperse the protesters, which further aggravated the situation. </p><p>  October 1st.  At night in the St. Danilov Monastery, with the assistance of Patriarch Alexy, negotiations were held.  The president‚Äôs side was represented by: <span>Yuri Luzhkov,</span> Oleg Filatov and Oleg Soskovets.  Ramadan Abdulatipov and Benjamin Sokolov arrived from the Council.  As a result of negotiations, Protocol No. 1 was signed, according to which the defenders handed over part of the weapons available in the building in exchange for electricity, heating and working telephones.  Immediately after signing the Protocol, heating was connected in the White House, an electrician appeared, and hot food began to be prepared in the dining room.  About 200 journalists were allowed into the building.  One could enter and leave the besieged building relatively freely. </p><p>  2 October.  The Military Council, led by <span>Ruslan Khasbulatov,</span> denounced Protocol No. 1.  The negotiations were called "nonsense" and "screen."  An important role in this was played by the personal ambitions of Khasbulatov, who was afraid to lose power in the Supreme Council.  He insisted that he should personally negotiate directly with President Yeltsin. </p><p>  After the denunciation, the building was again cut off from power supply, and access control was strengthened. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gazeta.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow 1993 the shooting of the white house" class="if uuid-2300568" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41738/2300568.jpg"></div><h2>  Attempt to capture Ostankino </h2><p>  October 3rd. </p><p>  14-00.  On October Square, a rally of many thousands is being held.  Despite attempts, riot police failed to oust the Protestants from the square.  Having broken through the cordon, the crowd advanced towards the Crimean bridge and further.

This they succeed only partially.  Makashov warns that if fire is opened, protesters will respond from an existing grenade launcher.  During the negotiations, one of the general‚Äôs guards is injured by a firearm.  While the wounded man was taken to the ambulance, at the same time there were explosions at the demolished doors and inside the building, presumably from an unknown explosive device.  A special forces soldier dies.  After that, indiscriminate fire was fired at the crowd.  At dusk, no one could figure out who to shoot at.  They killed Protestants, journalists, just sympathizers, trying to pull out the wounded.  But the worst thing started later.  In a panic, the crowd tried to hide in the Oak Grove, but there the security forces surrounded them with a dense ring and began to shoot point-blank from armored vehicles.

It included the use of armored vehicles and even tanks.  The assault was scheduled for 7-00 in the morning. </p><p>  Due to the mess and inconsistency of all actions, conflicts are taking place between the Taman division that arrived in Moscow, armed people from the Afghanistan Veterans Union and the Dzerzhinsky division. </p><p>  In total, 10 tanks, 20 armored vehicles and approximately 1,700 personnel were involved in the execution of the White House in Moscow (1993).

Despite the danger, crowds of curious begin to gather around.  Among the onlookers were even women and children.

From high-rise buildings adjacent to the House of Soviets, unknown snipers open fire.  They shoot at civilians.  Two journalists and a woman passing by perish. </p><p>  Vympel and Alpha special forces are ordered to storm.

Later, special forces will be tacitly punished for this arbitrariness. </p><p>  16-00.

The data on the number of deaths also vary.  According to the Prosecutor General, during the execution of the White House in October 1993, 148 people died.  Other sources call numbers from 500 to 1,500 people.  Even more people could become victims of executions in the first hours after the end of the assault.  Witnesses claim to have watched the beatings and executions of detained Protestants.  According to deputy Baronenko, only at the Krasnaya Presnya stadium, about 300 people were shot without trial.  The driver, who was taking out the corpses after the shooting of the White House (you have the opportunity to see photos of those bloody events in the article), claimed that he had to make two walks.  The bodies were taken to the forest near Moscow, where they were buried in common graves without identification. </p><p> As a result of the armed confrontation, the Supreme Council ceased to exist as a state body.  President Yeltsin approved and strengthened his power.  Undoubtedly, the shooting of the White House (you already know the year) can be interpreted as an attempt at a coup.  It is hard to judge who was right and who was to blame.  Reason time. </p><p>  Thus ended the bloodiest page in the new history of Russia, which finally destroyed the remnants of Soviet power and turned the Russian Federation into a sovereign state with a presidential-parliamentary form of government. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  Every year, in many cities of the Russian Federation, many communist organizations, including the Communist Party, organize rallies in memory of the victims of that bloody day in the history of our country.  In particular, in the capital on October 4, citizens gather on Krasnopresenskaya Street, where a monument to the victims of the royal executioners was erected.  A rally is held here, after which all its participants are on their way to the White House.  They are holding portraits of victims of "Yeltsinism" and flowers. </p><p>  After 15 years from the day the White House was shot in 1993, a traditional rally was held on Krasnopresenskaya Street.  Its resolution was two points: </p><ul><li>  declare October 4 as the Day of Sorrow; </li><li>  to erect a monument to the victims of the tragedy. </li></ul><p>  But, unfortunately, the rally participants and the entire Russian people did not wait for a response from the authorities. </p><p>  20 years after the tragedy (in 2013), the State Duma decided to create a Commission of the Communist Party faction to verify the circumstances preceding the events of October 4, 1993.  Alexander Dmitrievich Kulikov was appointed Chairman.  On July 5, 2013, the first meeting of the created commission was held. </p><p>  Nevertheless, Russian citizens are confident that those who died as a result of the shooting of the White House in 1993 deserve more attention.  The memory of them must be immortalized ... </p>
