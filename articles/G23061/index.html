    <h2>  Top 5 little-known attractions </h2><p>  If time permits, we offer a list of several more objects: </p><ol><li>  The Statue of Liberty.  We are sure that you least expected to see this statue here, but this is so, and it can indeed be found in the Arus public library.  Of course, in size it is very different from the original and reaches a height of about two meters.  She also has a color that, by the way, is black.  And the inscription is engraved on the book, which in Latin means "freedom of the soul." </li><li>  Temple of Augustus.  If you once dreamed of traveling back a couple of thousand years and finding yourself in the era of the great Roman Empire, then this place will easily help you do this.  The four oldest columns are all that remain of the Temple of Augustus.  But they are rightfully considered the same age as this city. </li><li>  The Baro de Cuadras Palace will surprise you with its mixture of styles and richness.  And the main feature of this building is its many-sided architecture.  It exquisitely combines Gothic style and modernism.  The industrialist Manuel de Cuadras worked on this palace, and most recently it was open for tourists. </li><li>  If you consider yourself a sweet tooth, then be sure to visit the Museum of Chocolate.  A variety of chocolate figures will delight you.  In addition, here you can study the process of its preparation.  You can try yourself to cook some goodies at the ongoing master class. </li><li>  Ravalsky cat fits perfectly into the architecture of the main street.  It is believed that if you want to return to Barcelona again, you should definitely touch it with your hand.  This sculpture is made by Colombian <span>Fernando Botero</span> and weighs about two tons. </li></ol>
