    <h2>  Briefly about the lake </h2><p>  Lake Linevo (Kurgan region) is quite large.  In length, it occupies 530 m, and the opposite banks are 320 m distant from each other. The depth can reach more than 10 m, however, the water is very clear, good visibility is preserved in places where the bottom is 2.5-3 away from the surface of the reservoir m </p><p>  The bottom of the lake is covered with large sandstone, sometimes pebbles are found.  On the coastline there are places that are subject to siltation.  Geographically, the reservoir belongs to the Tobol River Basin. </p><p>  Lake Linevo (Kurgan region, Shumikhinsky district) is fresh, drainless, but over time it gradually becomes brackish.  It got its name thanks to the once large number of lineages of the cyprinid family living in it.  Currently, this species is rare. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lake linevo Kurgan region how to get there" class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1150560.jpg" width="500"></div>

The weight of some individuals reaches 1.2-1.3 kg, the average is 500-700 g. The populations in these waters of minnow are also numerous. </p><p>  In winter, Lake Linevo (Kurgan Region), reviews and photo reports of fishermen confirm this information, does not lose its popularity.  During this period, fishing is carried out from the ice away from the coast.  And in the summer they fish mainly from boats, since the coastline is almost completely covered by reeds.  On the surface of the water you can see water lilies and other equally beautiful plants. </p><h2>  Nature </h2><p>  Currently, Lake Linevo (Kurgan region) is located outside the modern river floodplain.  The coastal terraces on the slope of the southern coast of the reservoir are rich in black alder forests with rare and endangered plant species.  In 2001, the government of the Kurgan region decided to attribute this biocenosis to specially protected natural monuments.  It prohibits any human activity that is not associated with sanitary and recreational activities, the care and protection of the forest from fires and pests.  Agricultural land is adjacent to the lake from the west and north. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake Linevo Kurgan Region Shumikhinsky District" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1150567.jpg" width="600"></div>

Various rodents are found, for example, field and <span>forest mice,</span> rats, as well as wolves, foxes and raccoon dogs.

Basically, these are fishermen, hunters and employees of research institutes.  The latter are studying the area.  In the autumn, a large number of hunters gather on the shore of the reservoir, ready to live in tents from a few days to several weeks in anticipation of the approach of northern birds migrating for the winter to the southern regions. </p><h2>  Linevo lake (Kurgan region) - how to get there? </h2><p>  You can get to the lake by car from the city of Kurgan through the city of Shumikha, s.

On the way there are hard sandy areas that are occasionally replaced by swampy or washed out spring water stretches. </p><p>  In fine weather, the road is passable.  Difficulties with travel occur mainly during heavy rains and after melting snow, as in some places the road is almost completely washed out, and then it is quite difficult to drive without an SUV. </p><p>  There is a turn to the lake from the Shadrinsk-Shumikha highway opposite the village of Nazarovo (if you go from the direction of Shadrinsk, you will not reach it slightly). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lake linevo kurgan region reviews" class="if" height="482" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1150565.jpg" width="488"></div>

    <p>  Lake Linevo (Kurgan region) owes its popularity to the picturesque nature and easy access to travel.  However, this is not all of its advantages, it is also worth paying attention to the large number of fish living in the pond.  Thanks to this, every year not only local fishermen come here, but also fishing enthusiasts from neighboring areas.  In addition, the species diversity of mammals living in coastal forests is of great importance to scientists and researchers. </p>
