For example, a smartphone perfectly copes not only with calls (their reception and completion), but also with the ability to surf the Internet, listen to music, watch videos or read books.  For the same tasks, a tablet is suitable.  The screen is one of the most important parts of electronics, especially if it is a touch screen and serves not only to display files, but also to control it.  Let's get acquainted with the characteristics of displays and the technologies by which they are created.  We will pay special attention to what an IPS screen is, what kind of technology it is, and what are its advantages. </p>

    <h2>  How the LCD screen works </h2><p>  First of all, we will understand how the <span>liquid crystal display,</span> which is equipped with modern technology, is arranged.  Firstly, it is an active matrix.  It consists of microfilm transistors.  Thanks to them, an image is formed.  Secondly, it is a layer of liquid crystals.  They are equipped with light filters and create R-, G-, B-subpixels.  Thirdly, it is a screen backlight system that allows you to make the image visible.  It can be fluorescent or LED. </p><h2>  Features of IPS technology </h2><p>  Strictly speaking, the IPS matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãa type of TFT technology by which LCD screens are created.  TFT is often taken to mean monitors manufactured by the TN-TFT method.  Based on this, we can compare them.  To get acquainted with the subtleties of the choice of electronics, we will understand what IPS screen technology is, what this concept means.  The main thing that distinguishes these displays from the TN-TFT is the location of the liquid crystal pixels.  In the second case, they are arranged in a spiral, are at an angle of ninety degrees horizontally between the two plates.  In the first (which we are most interested in) the matrix consists of thin-film transistors.  Moreover, the crystals are located along the plane of the screen parallel to each other.  Without voltage they do not turn.  At TFT, each transistor controls one point on the screen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  The difference between IPS and TN-TFT </h2><p>  Let us consider in more detail the <span>type of</span> IPS <span>screen</span> , what it is.  Monitors created using this technology have a lot of advantages.  First of all, this is an excellent color rendition.  The whole range of shades is bright, realistic.  Due to the wide viewing angle, the image does not fade, no matter where you look at it.  The monitors have a higher, sharper contrast due to the fact that the black color is transmitted simply perfectly.  We can note the following disadvantages that the IPS screen type has.  What is, first of all, a large energy consumption, a significant drawback.  In addition, devices equipped with such screens are expensive, since their production is very expensive.  Accordingly, TN-TFTs have diametrically opposite characteristics.  They have a smaller viewing angle, when you change the point of view, the image is distorted.  It is not very convenient to use them in the sun.  The picture is getting dark, glare interfere.  However, such displays have a quick response, consume less energy and are affordable.  Therefore, such monitors are installed in budget electronics models.  Thus, we can conclude in which cases the IPS screen is suitable, that this is a great thing for movie, photo and video lovers.  However, due to their less responsiveness, they are not recommended to fans of dynamic computer games. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Developments by leading companies </h2><p>  The IPS technology itself was created by the Japanese company Hitachi in conjunction with NEC.  New in it was the arrangement of liquid crystal crystals: not in a spiral (as in TN-TFT), but in parallel to each other and along the screen.  As a result, such a monitor transmits colors brighter and more saturated.  The image is visible even in the open sun.  The viewing angle of the IPS-matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãone hundred seventy-eight degrees.  You can watch the screen from any point: bottom, top, right, left.  The picture remains clear.  Apple is launching the popular IPS tablets with the IPS Retina matrix.  One inch uses an increased pixel density.  As a result, the image on the display comes out without grain, the colors are transmitted smoothly.  According to the developers, the human eye does not notice microparticles if the pixels are more than 300 ppi.  Now devices with IPS displays are becoming more affordable, they are beginning to be supplied with low-cost electronics models.  New varieties of matrices are created.  For example, MVA / PVA.  They have a fast response, wide viewing angle and excellent color reproduction. </p>

    <h2>  Devices with multi-touch screen </h2><p>  Recently, electronic devices with touch control have gained great popularity.  And these are not only smartphones.  Produce laptops, tablets, which have an IPS touch screen, used to manage files, images.  Such devices are indispensable for working with video, photographs.  Depending on the <span>diagonal of the display</span> , compact and full-format devices are found.  <span>The</span> multi-touch <span>touch screen</span> is capable of recognizing ten touches at the same time, that is, with such a monitor you can work with two hands at once.  Small mobile devices, such as smartphones or tablets with a diagonal of seven inches, recognize five touches.  This is quite enough if your smartphone has a small IPS screen.  That it is very convenient, appreciated by many buyers of compact devices. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="IPS touch screen" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5349/421815.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  Focusing on the choice of high-quality electronics for video editing, photo processing, you need to purchase laptops with a monitor that perfectly reproduces colors and has high clarity and contrast.  These characteristics are fully consistent with the technology described above.  Due to the wide viewing angle, the colors do not fade and do not lose brightness, no matter where you look at the screen.  Accordingly, buyers of mobile electronics review their acquisitions only positive, noting all the above advantages.  We can conclude that in electronic devices, an IPS screen is very beneficial, that this is the best choice for surfing the Internet, millions of mobile computer users were able to verify. </p>
