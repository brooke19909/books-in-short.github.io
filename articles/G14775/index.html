However, travelers, as a rule, choose the brilliant Madrid, Barcelona with its masterpieces created by the ingenious Gaudi, and resorts located on the Mediterranean coast of this country for recreation and excursions.  As for the northern regions, the relatively cold climate frightens away guests who associate Spain with the sun and luxurious beaches.  It is not surprising that even those who quite often visit the Iberian Peninsula, they are practically unknown.  To such "terra incognita" applies Asturias.  Spain is an ancient country, and Asturias is its <span>historical pride.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Where is some geographic information located? </h2><p>  Asturias (Spain) is a province and autonomous entity on the coast of the Bay of Biscay, which borders Castile-Leon in the south, Galicia in the west, and Cantabria in the east. </p><p>  Its administrative center is Oviedo.  Together with the cities of Aviles and Gijon, it forms a kind of triangle, inside which the bulk of the inhabitants of the region of Asturias (Spain) are concentrated.  Reviews of tourists indicate that it is in these settlements that the best hotels and entertainment venues in the northern part of the Iberian Peninsula are located. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Many short and shallow rivers flow through the principality from south to north, towards the Bay of Biscay.  Their energy is used to generate electricity at numerous hydropower plants. </p><h2>  Oviedo </h2><p>  As already mentioned, this city in Spain is the center of Asturias, with 220,000 inhabitants.  It is the economic, cultural and administrative capital of the principality. </p><p>  The city has a long and eventful history that began more than 1300 years ago.  On the tourist map of Spain, Oviedo is marked as a preserve of pre-Roman architecture in the open.  Among the most noteworthy old buildings can be noted: </p><ul><li>  Church of San Tirso; </li><li>  the Cathedral of San Salvador, in which the kings of Asturias are buried and three of the most important relics of Iberian Christianity are stored; </li><li>  14 pre-Roman churches built on Mount Naranco, which are included in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. </li></ul><p>  In addition, tourists will be interested in visiting the Archaeological Museum of Asturias (address: Calle San Vicente, 5, 33003, Oviedo), which is located in the former monastery of San Vicente. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="asturias spain photo" class="if" height="286" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1763156.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Thousands of pilgrims pass through Oviedo every year.  They follow the path of the pilgrims who, since the early Middle Ages, visited the Christian shrines of northern Spain every year.  Travelers who have previously received the blessing of the Catholic Church move along the route, the final destination of which is the city of Santiago de Compostela.  Interest in such pilgrimages revived thanks to the writer Paulo Coelho, who described the adventures of pilgrims in his books.  In each monastery, they are issued a certificate of attendance.  In many families, they become relics passed down from generation to generation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Gijon </h2><p>  This city in Spain, in Asturias, also deserves the attention of tourists.  In terms of population (277 559 people), it even surpasses Oviedo.  There is a port in Gijon, through which most of the goods entering the region pass.  The city appeared in the early Middle Ages on the site of a small fishing village that existed as far back as the 5th century BC.  e.  Its heyday was associated with the development of navigation and maritime trade. </p><p>  Although Asturias is not one of the popular tourist regions of Spain, during the relatively short beach season many people come to Gijon to relax for little money.  It offers comfortable beaches where you can soak up the sand brought from the Sahara desert.  To attract tourists in the summer in Gijon, various holidays are organized.  Among them is the San Juan festival, during which bonfires are lit on the beach.  Incendiary music is played there all night, and the inhabitants and guests of Gijon indulge in unrestrained fun. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Asturias spain reviews" class="if" height="407" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1763179.jpg" width="600"></div>

It was founded in 1085, under King Alfonso Six, at the site of a settlement known since the Roman period.  Although many monuments of medieval architecture have been preserved in Aviles, from the mid-20th century it was impossible to lure tourists there.  The reason was the terrible environmental situation caused by the rapid pace of industrialization.  Aviles was not even awarded the title of the dirtiest city in Europe. </p><p>  Only in the mid-1990s did the Aviles authorities begin to attempt to create normal conditions for the life of citizens.  For this purpose, some industrial enterprises were closed, while the rest of the modernized systems that ensure their safety for the environment.  However, the turning point that changed the history of the city was 2006, when during the festival organized by the Prince of Asturias, the great architect Oscar Niemeyer presented the city with a project of the Cultural Center. </p><p>  After 5 years in Aviles, a structure appeared that could become one of the main attractions of any European capital. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãin spain center of asturias" class="if" height="466" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1763201.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  With the influx of tourists who want to see a new architectural masterpiece, the city's economy has received a new development vector, especially since there are many other attractions that are of great interest to lovers of history and ancient architecture.  These include: </p><ul><li>  the palace of Llano Ponte; </li><li>  Temple of San Nicholas de Bari; </li><li>  the palace of the Marquis Ferrera, built in the 17th century in the Baroque style; </li><li>  Valdekarsan's house; </li><li>  Ferrera park, etc. </li></ul><h2>  sights </h2><p>  What can be interesting for tourists in Asturias?  Spain, whose sights are known all over the world, in the Middle Ages became the arena of the struggle of Christian and Muslim civilizations that penetrated the Iberian Peninsula from the northern regions of Africa.  It was in Asturias that a battle took place that had a huge impact on the further history of the European continent. </p><p>  In 718, the brave military commander Pelayo with a small army suddenly managed to attack the Arabs and defeat them at the Battle of Kovadongi.  This victory marked the beginning of the expulsion of the invaders from the continent.  Today, every child in these parts knows that the place where the Reconquista began is Asturias (Spain).  Attractions in Kovadonga, such as the Holy Cave where Pelayo‚Äôs army was hiding, and the neo-Romanesque pink Mary temple of the Virgin Mary attract thousands of pilgrims every year.  They will be interesting to tourists.  Places located in small towns and away from major cities in Asturias also include: </p><ul><li>  Pindal Cave <span>(a UNESCO World Heritage</span> Site) with 31 paleolithic cave paintings of animals, among which there are absolutely unique silhouettes of already extinct mammals; </li><li>  the incredibly beautiful beach "Playa de Silencio", whose name translates as "Coast of silence"; </li><li>  13th century tower and city walls in the town of Llanes; </li><li>  Mirador Fitu observation deck in the shape of a bowl, from which on a clear day you can watch the birds of prey flying in the Peaks of Europe national park; </li><li>  examples of traditional rural Asturian architecture, etc. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Nature reserves </h2><p>  Asturias (Spain), whose photo is striking in the wild beauty of magnificent mountain and coastal landscapes, is considered one of the most environmentally friendly regions of this sunny country.  There are several national parks.  For example, Somiedo is a famous biosphere reserve, which has been under the auspices of UNESCO since 2000. </p><p>  The park unites 5 valleys located among high mountains.  The most beautiful of them is Lake Valley. </p><p>  In addition to Somiedo, in Asturias are located: </p><ol><li>  Peaks of Europe National Park, where people come to do paragliding and canyoning. </li><li>  Munielos, chosen by fans of juotourism. </li><li>  38,000 Hectares of Redes Nature Park, where you can go trekking. </li><li>  The marine protected area of ‚Äã‚ÄãEl Cachucho, where many inhabitants of the depths of the Bay of Biscay are found. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Kitchen </h2><p>  Peculiar gastronomic traditions are another reason to visit this country.  The main authentic delicacies of these places are various cheeses with a delicate taste (about 100 varieties are known in all!), Fabada, which is a bean dish with black pudding, as well as sweet rice pudding.  Cinnamon, raisins and saffron are added to the last.  Dessert dishes also include special casadielles pancakes, which are filled with a mixture of various finely chopped dried fruits mixed with grated almonds, hazelnuts or chestnuts.  Biscuits with cherries are also popular, considered one of the main treats, which are hosted by the owners of Gijon on holidays of their household. </p><p>  In addition, Asturias (Spain) is famous for environmentally friendly products that are delivered to supermarkets not only throughout the country, but also in neighboring states.  This is especially true for Asturian cheeses, which are produced by mixing cow's, sheep's and goat's milk.  As for drinks, the residents of this region prefer magnificent cider to wine, which is prepared according to a special recipe and poured into glasses, holding a bottle over their heads. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  Asturias are not as hot as in other regions of Spain.  This circumstance is the reason for the relative economic backwardness of the region in comparison with other provinces of the country.  After all, the basis of the welfare of the kingdom is beach tourism, the level of development of which Asturias (Spain) cannot boast.  The climate there is oceanic and humid.  Summer is usually warm, with frequent rainfall, and in winter the province is quite cold.  This is especially true in mountainous areas, where snow often lies from early autumn to mid-April, and sometimes longer.  As for the lowlands, in the winter there is wet and frequent rains. </p><p>  The maximum air temperature recorded in Asturias in the summer is +36 degrees, and the minimum - 10 degrees below zero. </p>

    <h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  The vast majority of tourists traveling to the Iberian Peninsula want to combine interesting excursions with relaxation.  That is why many are interested in whether there are beaches in the province of Asturias (Spain). </p><p>  Unlike the Mediterranean coast of the country, resort areas on the shores of the Bay of Biscay are primarily chosen by surfers.  They consider Asturias one of the best places in Europe to practice this sport. </p><p>  In addition, the beaches of this province are a great place for photo shoots, since the coastline on the coast of the Bay of Biscay is extremely rugged and picturesque.  Views of the beaches of Poo, Andrin, La Franca and the Llanes area can be seen in some scenes of the film Shelter, and the shooting of You Are Alone by director Jos√© Luis Garci took place in the resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãCuevas del Mar. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Asturias Spain climate" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1761828.jpg" width="573"></div>

    <h2>  Pong (Asturias, Spain): photos and basic information </h2><p>  Until recently, the name of this settlement was not known to anyone.  However, a few years ago, the Ponga city council decided to save him from extinction and announced that every couple who wanted to move there would receive an amount of 3,000 euros.  The same amount will be paid to them after the birth of each child. </p><p>  Currently, only about 700 people live in the town, despite the fact that its area is only 205, 98 square meters.  km  About 5 years ago, it became clear that even those few residents of Ponga who did not move to the southern regions of Spain are already in retirement age, and soon he will disappear from the face of the earth.  Meanwhile, this settlement, founded in the Bronze Age, is considered one of the oldest among those permanently inhabited in the territory of the Spanish Kingdom. </p><p>  What does Pong chew (Asturias, Spain)?  The basis of the economy of the town is agriculture.  75.6% of the inhabitants are engaged in livestock breeding and the production of natural food.  Another 17% work in the provision of services.  Thus, those who want to move to this godforsaken corner of Asturias must either have a source of passive income outside Spain, or be prepared to become farmers. </p>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Due to the rugged terrain, Asturias (Spain) has always been an inaccessible area.  At the moment, the main artery that connects this region with the center of the country remains the <span>Roman road</span> Via de la Plata (the modern name is the A-66 motorway).  She passes through the Cordillera passes.  As for rail transport, you can get to Asturias by trains, passing through the cities of Leon and Santander.  In addition, Asturias can be accessed through the port of Gijon.  It is one of the main maritime harbors of the Bay of Biscay, and ships stopping there regularly make flights from Northern Europe to the UK and Ireland. </p><p>  If the purpose of your trip from Russia to the Iberian Peninsula is precisely Pong (Asturias, Spain), those who have already been there will be the best ones to tell you how to get here.  As a rule, they advise you to use air transport.  Asturias International Airport is located in Santiago del Monte.  From there, on the N-634 motorway, you can reach your destination in 1 hour 50 minutes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pong Asturias Spain how to get" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1761825.jpg" width="561"></div>

    <h2>  Pong (Asturias, Spain): how to move there to live </h2><p>  Emigrating to the Kingdom of Spain is a difficult task.  You can legally enter the country in the following cases: </p><ul><li>  to marry a citizen of Spain or another state with a Spanish residence permit; </li><li>  to study at a university with the design of a student residence; </li><li>  get refugee status </li><li>  travel to Spain for family reunion; </li><li>  open your own business in the country; </li><li>  Receive an invitation from a Spanish employer </li><li>  buy property. </li></ul><p>  In addition, many are trying to settle in Spain illegally, having entered there on a tourist visa.  I must say that this option rarely works, and very often the "emigrant" is not only expelled from Spain, but also loses the opportunity to visit any Schengen zone states in the future. </p><h2>  Festivals in Pong </h2><p>  As in other Catholic countries, almost all cities in Spain regularly host various religious processions and holidays.  However, in each village they have their own flavor.  Ponga (Asturias, Spain) is no exception.  Moreover, it is there that you can celebrate Christmas and New Year in an unusual way.  On January 1, the El Girria Festival begins in the town.  According to an ancient legend, on this day an ancient spirit descends from the mountains and occupies the body of a single young man.  The latter begins to run through the streets and burst into houses, trying to kiss young women and girls who will meet on his way.  He is accompanied by a crowd of onlookers who want to stare, what resistance will be exerted by the arrogant mountain spirit by local beauties. </p><p> Now you know where Asturias (Spain) is located.  Reviews of tourists about this region of the Iberian Peninsula can be heard extremely rarely.  However, those who have already traveled to these parts unanimously say that they did not regret the money and time spent.  After all, a trip to Asturias allows you to get acquainted with the unknown Spain, with its original culture, which has Celtic roots, original cuisine and traditions. </p>
