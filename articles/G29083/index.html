There are schemes for beginners, but there are complex and multi-stage crafts that can only be created by experienced and knowledgeable craftsmen.  In our article, we will tell beginners <span>how to make a boat</span> out of paper, what is needed for this, how to bend to make the product smooth, with clear lines.  We also advise both children and adults what paper to work to take, what else is useful in the process. </p><p>  How to make a boat out of paper in stages, you will learn further from the text of the article, we will also tell you what composition you can create from an already folded origami.  Engaging in this type of art will help the child to develop attentiveness, motor skills of hands and fingers, memory and accuracy in work.  When decorating a boat, a child shows creative inclinations, imagination and develops logical thinking.  All this is useful in future studies at school.  The simplest folding of paper occurs even in the youngest preschool age, and children will be able to make such a boat on the verbal instructions of the educator already in the older group of the kindergarten. </p><p>  Of course, you need not only to remember how to make a boat out of paper, but also to be able to neatly fold the sheet, clearly combining the edges of the folded parts, carefully smoothing the folds with your fingers so that the finished work is beautiful. </p><h2>  Paper selection </h2><p>  Before you make a boat out of paper, you need to choose a material that is convenient for folding.  Plain colored paper during folding forms white scuffs at the folds, so it is better to use office paper - white or color.  Special kits for origami paper are also available.  Some sheets are double-sided or with prints. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Of course, you can learn to fold by using the newspaper or, even better, glossy publications.  The sheets are strong there, and then the child can launch a finished boat to swim in the water.  Glossy paper is saturated with water for longer, so it will play for a long time. </p><h2>  Beginning of work </h2><p>  How to make a boat out of paper with your own hands, read on.  The photographs show how you need to rotate and bend the sheet, so that later you get an even and clear boat. </p><p>  We take a thick sheet of A-4 (a boat made of double-sided paper will look beautiful) and bend it in half in length, carefully fold the finger smoothly.  Then we turn the material with a fold towards us and, taking our hands by one and the other corner, we connect them in the center.  You should get two triangles, as in the photo below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thespruce.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="paper folding steps" class="if uuid-2304921" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2304921.jpg"></div><p>  Having well smoothed out the places of bends, we turn the workpiece with the even part towards us.  Then you need to unscrew the remaining rectangles from bottom to top.  To do this, first bend the front side of the crafts.  After careful smoothing, we continue to work on the back side. </p><h2>  Next stage of work </h2><p>  Next, how to make a boat out of paper is clearly visible in the photo.  Turning to the back side, bend another rectangle up.  Then they take two sharp edges with their hands and fold the figure in half.  It should make a square. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="jumpstarttimes.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a boat out of paper" class="if uuid-2304923" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2304923.jpg"></div><p>  Turn it with the opening side toward you and fold the top paper in half.  Stronger finger pressure on the material is required here.  You can use the ruler, since paper folded several times is harder to smooth, and the fold should be clear.  Then the part is turned over, and an action similar to the previous one is performed. </p><h2>  Continuation of work </h2><p>  When working with double-sided paper, the front and back sides of the sheet stand out well.  When both parts are bent upwards, a triangle forms, which is taken in hand and stretched in opposite directions by its lateral parts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thespruce.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The final stage" class="if uuid-2304951" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2304951.jpg"></div><p>  When the sides are stretched, the upper and lower parts are combined together.  It turns out a square. </p><h2>  Finishing touches </h2><p>  When a small square is made of folded paper, you need to turn the craft with the expanding part up and pull the sharp corners of the square in opposite directions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="jumpstarttimes.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="end of cooking" class="if uuid-2304952" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2304952.jpg"></div><p>  Opening, the paper forms a figurine of a boat.  It is better to immediately put it on its side and carefully iron the bottom of the vessel.  When all the folds are well smoothed and all the stages of work are done, the finished product is perfectly on the table.  It can be launched to swim in a bowl, bath or in a brook. </p><h2>  Crafts using a paper boat </h2><p>  How to make a boat out of paper, you already understood.  Now let's look at what such crafts can be created.  The easiest option for preschool children is painting it with paints or markers.  You can draw an anchor, portholes, draw in the captain‚Äôs window on the top superstructure.  You can also make an application.  Children often create such crafts for dads on the feast of February 23. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="paper sailboat" class="if uuid-2304972" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2304972.jpg"></div><p>  If the child is older, you can offer him to make sails and signal flags.  To do this, you need colored paper or an analogue with a print, a rope and plastic sticks of the required length.  You can attach them to the boat on PVA glue.  It will be effective to put a weather vane at the top of the mast. </p><p>  The article gives step-by-step instructions for making a paper boat folding.  After reading the material, everyone will be able to quickly and without problems perform such a craft.  Good luck </p>
