The Order was a recognition that its role during the Great Patriotic War, as well as during the founding of the armed forces and the strengthening of defense was significant.  Exactly one year after the Zhukov Order was approved, a design was specially developed, which now occupies a place of honor at the award.  A graphic image of the marshal was specially ordered from a Moscow artist.

    <h2>  Who received the award? </h2><p>  It was quite difficult to get the Order of Zhukov.  For what they give a reward, it was clearly spelled out in satut.  He could get: </p><p>  - Commander of the front or the army; </p><p>  - Deputy Commander; </p><p>  - chief of staff or other operational departments; </p><p>  - the chief who commanded a division or brigade; </p><p>  - fleet commander; </p><p>  - deputy chief of the fleet; </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - The people who were responsible for the escalade or naval base; </p><p>  - foremen; </p><p>  - those who occupy a place in the senior officers; </p><p>  - senior officers, but only those who were in the position of division commander or brigade; </p><p>  - distinguished themselves during the military operation; </p><p>  - people whose merits were in the development or the conduct of serious military operations to protect the country. </p><h2>  Appearance of the Order </h2><p>  The order of Marshal Zhukov was made of silver.  It was based on a cross with oval joints.  Also, relief beams departed in all directions.  In the center was a medallion.  It is here, on a blue background, the image of the marshal is placed.  Above his head was the inscription "George Zhukov."  At the bottom of the medallion were painted laurel and oak branches. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Order of Marshal Zhukov" class="if" height="261" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32383/728210.jpg" width="211"></div>

    <p>  On all four sides of the order are shields covered with red enamel.  A ruby ‚Äã‚Äãshield with gilding is a symbol of the Holy Virgin, which plays a significant enough role for Russia.  This arrangement of shields is also no coincidence.  Their place on the award is a symbol of the fact that from all sides our country will be protected from attacks by enemy nations.  The branches that are at the bottom of the image of the marshal symbolize the courage and dignity of the one who received the award. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Features of the Zhukov medal </h2><p>  Together with the order, the <span>Zhukov medal</span> was established <span>.</span>  The medal does not have a specific number.

    <h2>  Order Cavalry Officer </h2><p>  One of the first who received the Zhukov Order was the cavalryman G. Vasilenko. He participated in the hostilities since 1941.  Initially, the district in which Vasilenko was located on the North-Western Front.  This front was opposing, therefore, as a result of military operations, he was seriously injured as a commander.  Six months later, Vasilenko returned to the front again.  At this time, their entire brigade was reorganized, so Gavriil Tarasovich is in the Caucasus as part of the tenth guard corps.  In August, the 42nd Vasilenko brigade goes on the offensive.  During the attack, they managed to get the Terek station, neutralize about ten tanks of the German army, and also take a couple of hundred prisoners of war.  Thanks to their advance, the Naursky district was practically liberated from enemies.  During this period, Vasilenko was already a lieutenant colonel of the army, but it was then that he received his second serious injury.  He only succeeds in returning to the front after a year. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Order of Zhukov.

    <p>  In 1943 he was appointed commander of one of the guard divisions.  His unit was able to prove itself quite well.  They made a great contribution to the confrontation in the Kuban.  However, his service did not always succeed.  In 1944, he was removed from office for an unsuccessful offensive.  A year later, he was again able to regain his commanding rank.  For all his great military merits, Gabriel Tarasovich received the order of George Zhukov. </p><h2>  Award-winning fighter pilot </h2><p>  Not only the commanders of the brigade received the award at that time.  In 1995, when the president handed the award, the number of those who received the Zhukov Order also included Major General Aviation Zakharov Georgy Nefedovich.  He was an excellent fighter pilot.  Zakharov even before the <span>start of World War II</span> had several successful sorties.  At the <span>beginning of the war</span> , he already had a high rank, but he continued to make combat flights.  He was also one of the first to engage in combat with German aircraft.  For the period of 1945, the fighter pilot had about 150 successful sorties.  Zakharov received the order precisely for these services to the motherland. </p><p>  Received the Order of Zhukov, not only individuals.  Several military units also received awards. </p>
