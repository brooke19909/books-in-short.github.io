Multifunctional oven Delimano 3D</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Among Russian home cooking lovers, portable devices are gaining popularity that have the functionality to prepare dishes that seem to be completely different in terms of recipe and nature of ingredients, which, from the point of view of traditional culinary views, may require completely different cooking conditions.  It is clear that, for example, you can‚Äôt cook a cake in a pan, and you can‚Äôt cook the soup on a baking sheet.  However, devices that can combine completely dissimilar cooking conditions exist and are gaining mass distribution.  These include a Delimano oven.  What are the features of this unit? </p><h2>  Device Overview </h2><p>  The 3D oven Delimano, popular among Russian home cooking lovers, is positioned as a ‚Äúrevolutionary" device.  One of the possible reasons for this is that the device makes it possible to cook on it, namely, stew, fry, bake or grill without oil.  But if desired, the corresponding product, of course, can be added to dishes in the process of their preparation.  According to many culinary experts, the lack of oil in the dish contributes to the fact that it becomes more useful and healthy. </p>

    <p>  In some sources, the Delimano 3D-oven is positioned as a complete replacement for several kitchen appliances at once - a microwave, deep fryer, grill, barbecue, and also a toaster.  According to some users of the device, cooking with it is very fast, and therefore the oven can be especially useful for people who do not have much free time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Terminology features </h2><p>  The device in question is sometimes called a ‚Äúmulti-oven‚Äù (probably, by analogy with a multicooker), a mini-oven (perhaps due to its modest size), or a miracle oven (apparently this is due to a number of technological innovations introduced into the device by the manufacturer, or especially positive user experiences regarding the use of the product). </p><p>  The device is also often positioned as a ‚Äúmultifunctional‚Äù furnace.  With what it can be connected?  Probably with the presence on the market of traditional devices that belong to the ‚Äúmultifunctional ovens‚Äù class.  Despite the fact that the considered one is unique to a certain extent, for some functions it may well be combined into a general category with a number of similar solutions - including more highly specialized ones, such as, for example, microwave ovens.  But by many criteria, the device, of course, is a unique instance for the Russian market. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Let's consider the main characteristics of the 3D furnace produced under the Delimano brand.  The device operates in the range of operating temperatures of 50-230 degrees.  This interval is enough to cook a variety of dishes: baking, meat, fish, vegetable culinary products.  The power of the device is decent - 1400 W, it works from a 220-240 V. </p><p>  The control of the furnace is electronic, according to user reviews - convenient, intuitive.  There is a timer.  The case of the device is plastic, it has multilayer protection (more on this option later).  The dimensions of the furnace are generally comparable with other devices of this type - 43 x 34 x 27 cm. It might seem that if you create a certain 3D model on the basis of the corresponding device values, the furnace will look like a rectangle.  But this is not so - the main working space of the device - in the form of an almost perfect circle.  We look at the photo. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The oven weighs 7.68 kg - a very standard indicator for many devices for a similar purpose. </p><h2>  Oven Features </h2><p>  Apart from the possibility of cooking without oil, what other notable options are the Delimano 3D oven characterized by?  First of all, in the cooking process, there is no need to mix them.  The device has a special rotating mechanism that replaces the corresponding procedure.  Also, as we noted above, the oven can function in a variety of modes - frying, baking, stewing.  The device has a number of other useful functions: defrosting, steaming dishes, working in grill mode.  The device is equipped with a high-tech filter, due to which the smell of the prepared dishes is felt in a very small area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe kitchen.  It can be noted that the oven is very easy to care for: its bowl is perfectly washed in the dishwasher.  And this despite the fact that the volume of the corresponding element is 10 liters. </p><h2>  Oven features: reviews </h2><p>  To what extent do the declared capabilities of the furnace correspond to the actual results of operation of the device?  Users believe that the Delimano 3D-furnace as a whole in practice completely solves the tasks that are provided by its functionality.  There are no problems, according to home cooking enthusiasts, in order to bake a delicious pie with the device, fry potatoes or cook a vegetable delicacy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Oil, as the culinary experts note, can really be omitted - if the recipe for cooking does not require it.  It happens that, for example, it must be present in the structure of many types of dough - otherwise the product will not work.  According to the results of their practical use, cooking functions in the grill mode, according to the chefs, also fully correspond to the declared ones.  The quality of the dishes is excellent, the cooking time generally corresponds to the required recipe. </p><h2>  Technological advantages of the device </h2><p>  What technological advantages are characterized by the Delimano 3D miracle oven?  Among them - functioning when using a fan, which provides a flow in the necessary parts of the device of hot air, while conventional stoves belonging to this category of goods are equipped with <span>halogen lamps.</span>  Such a mechanism helps to improve the quality of dishes prepared using this oven due to their uniform roasting. </p><h2>  Unique features of the furnace: consumer opinions </h2><p>  Let us consider in more detail the specifics of the most remarkable functions that characterize the Delimano 3D miracle oven in terms of consumer opinions.  We noted above that the main fundamental difference between the device and analogues is the presence of a fan, which provides an influx of hot air in the desired intensity.  This option gives uniform frying. </p>

    <p>  What do the cooks themselves say about this unique function that the Delimano 3D oven has?  User reviews regarding this nuance + are extremely positive.  Of course, we are talking about the practical results of its use, consisting in the excellent quality of the resulting baking.  Some oven users suggest that the technological innovation in question contributes fully to the preparation of dishes that meet the criteria for a healthy diet. </p><p>  Another feature of the furnace that we noted is the presence of a rotisserie that rotates 360 degrees and works automatically.  In principle, this option can be considered in the same context as the previous one, namely, with the operation of a fan that creates streams of hot air during cooking.  Exactly so - in the ‚Äútandem‚Äù, users of the furnace evaluate the operation of the technological solutions in question. </p><p>  What do they say about the third innovation of the device - multilayer housing protection, cooks who tested the Delimano 3D oven?  Reviews regarding this option are also extremely positive.  The fact is that such a technical solution provides reliable protection for the user from the temperature effects of the device during cooking. </p><h2>  Accessories </h2><p>  In the design of the oven, as we noted above, there are 2 patented elements: an automatic skewer that can rotate 360 ‚Äã‚Äãdegrees and provide deep baking of dishes from all sides, as well as multilayer housing protection technology, due to which the heat loss of the device is significantly reduced, and the safety of its use - rises.  But these are far from all the notable design options of the device. </p><p>  The furnace is conveniently controlled using special digital elements.  Among its notable features is the presence of a timer.  If necessary, for the 3D furnace from the Delimano brand, additional accessories can be purchased. </p>

    <p>  Positive feedback from users of the device concerns the fact that it is easy to care for.  But here everything is quite logical: since it is not necessary to use oil in the cooking process, the degree of contamination of the form in which the dishes are located will in any case be lower than in traditional kitchen devices of the corresponding type.  The multi-layer protection of the case, which we mentioned above, also contributes to increased comfort of caring for the furnace: it does not heat up very much, so after cooking is completed, you can immediately erase food traces from its surface. </p><h2>  Convenience of construction </h2><p>  The multi-functional Delimano 3D oven is also praised for its convenient design, which allows you to easily place the necessary accessories in it, which we examined above - a baking tray, barbecue, steaming basket, or grill for use in grill mode.  In this sense, the comfort of operation of the device can be traced in a variety of aspects - not only, for example, in terms of electronic control, but also regarding its design features. </p>
