    <p>  Nebug is located near the famous city of Tuapse.  The distance between settlements is only about 15 km.  The village received its name in honor of the river of the same name.  The private residential sector stretches in this area in the direction from the beach to the mountains.  This area is notable for its natural beauties.  On the outskirts of Nebug begins a <span>pine forest, the</span> trees of which, according to some sources, are at least a hundred years old.  Today it is a developed resort center due to the large number of entertainment facilities.  During the day, you can meet a huge number of tourists on the streets, but a relatively small number of them live in the village during the holidays.  Most of them come for day trips from neighboring cities.  The village of Nebug is a magical place to relax, not without reason even its name is unusual - literally translated from the Adyghe language it means "wide eyes." </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Climatic features </h2>

    <p>  The gentle sea and a lot of sun ... That is what attracts the Krasnodar Territory.  Nebug, like many coastal villages, has both pebble and sandy bulk beaches.  In the immediate vicinity of the village there are many sanatoriums and rest houses, some of which also boast their own access to the sea.  These beaches are usually better landscaped than urban.  If you wish, vacationers who do not live in a sanatorium or hotel can get on them, but you will have to pay for the entrance.  Free access to the well-maintained main beach of the village, there are also "wild" places for swimming.  Those who wish to swim in a secluded place should be extremely careful.  There are no lifeguards on the ‚Äúwild‚Äù beaches, and in case of trouble there will be nobody to help you. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sanatoriums and pensions </h2>
