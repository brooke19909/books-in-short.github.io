  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Varieties and cost of the coin "20 cents" 1983</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The cost of twenty-kopeck coins put up at virtual numismatic auctions depends on their condition.  For example, a well-preserved coin can enrich its holder by more than 600 rubles. </p><h2>  "20 kopecks" in 1983 at virtual auctions </h2><p>  In 2016, the value of the twenty-kopeck coins of 1983, classified as ‚Äúpractically not circulating‚Äù and ‚Äúnot circulating‚Äù, put up for auction at Wolmar Standart, ranged from one to one hundred rubles. </p><p>  A coin of similar denomination, classified as ‚Äúnot in circulation‚Äù, was sold at Anumis auction for 6 rubles. </p><h2>  The main varieties of "20 cents" 1983 </h2><div class="photo" data-original="moneta-russia.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="20 kopecks 1983 varieties" class="if uuid-2749769" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44143/2749769.jpg"></div><p>  The most common <span>types of coins,</span> most often found at auctions, experts include the following. </p><ul><li>  Coin "20 kopecks" in 1983 in good or very good condition according to the Sheldon system.  The price at a virtual auction, as a rule, does not exceed 35 rubles. </li><li>  Well preserved (in accordance with the Sheldon safety qualification), a twenty-copeck coin of 1983.  For it you can get about 100 rubles. </li><li>  A coin in denomination of 20 kopecks in 1983, which in the Sheldon system corresponds to the definition of "excellently preserved."  For her, a rare collector will not regret 200 rubles. </li></ul><p>  The cost of the last two lots was influenced by the fact that stamps for ‚Äú3 kopecks‚Äù of 1979 and 1981 were used to mint these coins. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="en.numista.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="20 kopecks 1983 USSR" class="if uuid-2749771" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44143/2749771.jpg"></div><p>  Thus, the design of the obverse of the two indicated coins (‚Äú20 kopecks‚Äù in 1983 in excellent and excellent condition according to the Sheldon system) differs significantly from the design of the other twenty-kopeck coins.  Due to the non-standard location of the coat of arms and the presence of the image of the Gulf of Guinea. </p><h2>  Sheldon classification </h2><p>  Classification of coins is necessary to determine their collection value.  The final price of a lot depends on its degree of preservation, circulation and other features, due to which the coin receives the status of "rare". </p><p>  Coins, which were practically never circulated and are preserved in the best way, are designated by the abbreviation UNC.  The value of such lots is primarily due to the absence (or small amount) of damage.  There is one more important factor: the number of people who saw the coin and held it in their hands is minimized. </p><p>  If you look at such a coin with your armed eye, you can only detect miserable damage that occurred during the manufacturing process: </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.canvaslms.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="20 kopecks 1983" class="if uuid-2749772" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44143/2749772.jpg"></div><ul><li>  when coins hit each other during ejection into the machine‚Äôs automatic drive; </li><li>  when the newly minted trifle was passed through a high-speed automatic calculating machine; </li><li>  when the coins were scattered over the bags, and then transported to the mint's warehouse and unloaded there. </li></ul><p>  Coins that did not come into circulation at all due to mechanical defects made during manufacture are designated by the abbreviation AU.  Defects that increase the price of such lots include the so-called technical flaws (manufacturing defects) - ‚Äúnon-punched‚Äù, stamp offset, and so on. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On lots belonging to this category, only minor scuffs in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe most prominent relief parts may be present. </p><p>  Coins that meet such definitions as ‚Äúexceptionally well preserved‚Äù, ‚Äúvery well preserved‚Äù, ‚Äúwell preserved‚Äù, ‚Äúvery satisfactory preserved‚Äù and ‚Äúsatisfactorily preserved‚Äù are also collector-quality carriers.  At auctions they are conventionally designated by the corresponding abbreviation - XF, VF, F, VG, G. </p><h2>  Twenty-Column Coin Characteristics </h2><p>  The obverse of the standard coin ‚Äú20 kopecks‚Äù in 1983 does not stand out against the background of the rest of the samples of the Soviet small change.  Here, as in other Soviet bargaining chips, there is an image of the coat of arms of the Soviet Union. </p><div class="photo" data-original="markyourcoin.weebly.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="20 kopecks 1983" class="if uuid-2749768" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44143/2749768.jpg"></div><p>  The globe hovers over the abbreviation of the USSR.  Against the background of the image of the Earth, illuminated by the rays of the rising sun, a sickle and a hammer are clearly visible.  All details are framed by wheat ears, twined with ribbons (only 15 turns - according to the number of union republics).  Where the upper ends of the ears approach, a five-pointed star is visible. </p><p>  On the reverse the denomination is indicated - ‚Äú20‚Äù at the top of the coin, immediately below the denomination is the word ‚Äúcents‚Äù.  At the bottom of the reverse, the year the coin was issued is knocked out.  An open wreath of wheat ears is shown along the edging edge.  At the base, spikelets are decorated with shells and oak foliage. </p><p>  The USSR coin ‚Äú20 kopecks‚Äù of 1983 has a ribbed edge with vertical notches. </p><p>  The weight of the coin is 3.4 grams, and its diameter is 21.8 millimeters.  The width of the edge is one and a half millimeters.  All twenty cents coins put into circulation in 1983 were minted from cupronickel - an alloy of copper, nickel and a small amount of manganese. </p>
