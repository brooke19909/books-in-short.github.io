    <h2>  History </h2><p>  In 1969, this part of the Polesie of Belarus was declared a reserve.  A national park on this land appeared in 1996, by order of the President of Belarus.  It was created on the basis of the reserve that existed since 1969. </p><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe national park in the process of reorganization has been significantly increased.  The national park is a key ornithological territory. </p><h2>  The purpose of the formation of the park </h2><p>  For the first time, the Polish academician V. Schafer was thinking about creating a reserve on this territory.  In the thirties of the XX century, he proposed to use for these purposes one of the largest in Europe Olmansky massif, which is located between the rivers Stvigi and Goryn.  Around the same time, the swamp specialist S. Kulczinski (Poland) investigated the swamps located in the western part of Polesie.  He published the results of his work in his monograph, which was called Peatlands of Polesie. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pripyat National Park Belarus" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/767620.jpg" width="600"></div>

In 1958, Academician N.V. Smolsky, who was then the director of the Central Botanical Garden of the Academy of Sciences of Belarus, instructed the swamp expert L.P. Smolyak to document the need to create such a reserve.  This work was completed in 1961. </p><p>  In June 1969, the Pripyat State Reserve was organized on an area of ‚Äã‚Äã615 km <sup>2</sup> .  In 1994, he was transferred to the Commission under the President of Belarus.  A year later (1995) a forest hunting enterprise ‚ÄúLyaskovichi‚Äù was established here. </p><p>  A year later (1996), the reserve was reorganized into the Pripyat National Park.  The purpose of education is to preserve the unique landscape of Polesie and study its changes after drainage of the land.  In 1998, the Museum of Nature began to operate on the territory. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pripyat National Park photo" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/767621.jpg" width="580"></div>

    <h2>  Pripyat National Park - regime of protection and nature management </h2><p>  Most of the park is a conservation area.  Its area is more than 30 thousand hectares, which is about 35% of the entire territory.  Any business activity is prohibited here.  A little more than 11% is allocated to economic and recreational areas.  The main part of the park‚Äôs land belongs to the zone of regulated nature management - about 48 thousand hectares (54% of the territory).  Such a zoning structure, in which a protected zone occupies more than 30 thousand hectares and only 11% is allocated to zones in which active economic or recreational activities are carried out, is quite rational. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Rivers </h2><p>  Pripyat National Park has the main waterway - the <span>Pripyat River.</span>  <span>This is</span> the largest and largest <span>tributary of the Dnieper.</span>  In floods, the <span>floodplain of the river is</span> flooded and expanded to 30 km. </p><p>  In the upper reaches of the Pripyat, it has numerous channels, then it is winding, forms old people, meanders, bays, there are many sandy and viscous islands.  The river is characterized by a long spring flood, a short summer low water, which is disturbed by rain floods and the annual rise in water level in autumn.  The lowest water level is observed in September ‚Äì October.  Pripyat freezes almost the entire length at the same time at the very beginning of December, the river opens in March.  The water temperature in summer does not fall below + 21 ¬∞, the maximum temperature in July is + 28 ¬∞ C. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="GPU Pripyat National Park" class="if" height="308" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/767622.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <p>  The Pripyat National Park, the photo of which you see in our article, is limited by the tributaries of Pripyat: from the north-west - by the river Stvigoy, from the east - by the river Ubortyu.  In this regard, according to scientists, the national park is a closed hydrological area, and therefore it practically does not experience the influence of land reclamation in neighboring territories.  This is very important for the reference section of the park. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Small rivers and lakes </h2><p>  A unique network of small rivers - Pig Breeder, Old Ubort, Utvokha, Krushinnaya, Moat - and amelioration system with a length of about 280 kilometers.  There are more than 300 floodplain lakes.  In rivers flowing through the park, almost all types of fish are found.  In the middle of summer, catfish, tench, perch, and rudd bite better than others.  In shallow forests and flood meadows spawning pike, bream, roach, sabrefish, ide. </p><h2>  Vegetation </h2><p>  More recently, less than a century ago, these lands were a boggy area.  At the end of the XIX century, land reclamation was carried out.  Channels have been created.  Their length reached more than 300 kilometers.  As a result of land reclamation, dense forests appeared on significant areas of drained bogs.  Currently, the canals have virtually lost their useful effect, and the previously drained territory is again swamped. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pripyat National Park goal of education" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/767623.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <p>  Today, forest swamps occupy a third of the territory and, according to all scientific indicators, are recognized as the standard of swamps of the Belarusian Polesie. </p><p>  The park has long and rather warm summers, mild and snowy winters, nutritious soils, a lot of rainfall and moisture contribute to the growth of shrubbery, woody and herbaceous plants.  Protected and rare species of plants grow here: black arnica, water chestnut, salvia floating, sea mollusk, yellow rhododendron, curly lily and others. </p><h2>  The woods </h2><p>  Pripyat National Park is famous for its main wealth - forests.  They cover more than 85% of the protected area.  On the sandy islands and ridges, on the upper bogs, pine dominates, which occupies 52% of the area.  Black alder and birch forests dominate the transitional and lowland soils of the marshes. </p><p>  The pearl of the forests of the Pripyat Park are floodplain and upland oak forests, but hornbeam forests - broad-leaved forests consisting of mighty lindens, oaks, ash, hornbeam and maple - are striking in their grandeur. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pripyat National Park reviews" class="if" height="266" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/767624.jpg" width="450"></div>

Since 1987, the bison and red deer have been living in the park.  The number of bison exceeds 90 individuals.  The number of red deer is growing very quickly, and today it exceeds 300 individuals. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pripyat National Park conservation and environmental management regime" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/767625.jpg" width="450"></div>

American mink, muskrat imported from other regions are also found here.  They took root well and today take their place in the park. </p><p>  Numerous colonies of coastal and near-water bird species are especially valuable for scientific research: small and large white herons, red and gray herons, various species of waders, swans, ducks, herons and many others.  Birds of prey also inhabit the park: osprey, white-tailed eagle owl, beetle, black kite, golden eagle and many others. </p><h2>  Rest in the Pripyatsky park </h2><p>  Today, a tourist department has been created at the GPU Pripyatsky National Park, by contacting which you can visit interesting excursion routes to the high bog, Tsar Oak and Tsar Pine.
