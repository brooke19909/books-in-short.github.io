Total income may include: </p><ul><li>  Any form of <span>salary</span> , bonuses, fees and other payments that are issued for the performance of a certain work, including on the basis of labor contracts, in organizations, peasant farms and individual entrepreneurs. </li><li>  Cash allowance. </li><li>  Income from work in <span>religious organizations,</span> including income from priests. </li><li>  Taxable funds from entrepreneurial activity. </li><li>  Lawyer fees. </li><li>  Scholarships paid to students of vocational schools, secondary specialized and higher educational institutions, as well as scholarships paid by organizations. </li><li>  <span>Allowances for children.</span> </li><li>  Amounts of alimony received. </li><li>  <span>Unemployment benefits.</span> </li><li>  Disability benefits. </li><li>  Social and old-age pensions. </li><li>  Payments made at the expense of organizations are of a one-time nature (for the purchase of permits to sanatoriums, rest homes, children's health-improving institutions, as well as for food, maintenance of children in childcare facilities, for the purchase of <span>travel tickets</span> , etc.). </li><li>  Income from the rental or sale of real estate, garages, cars, agricultural products, securities and other property.  The exception is the money earned by citizens from the sale of housing owned by them, and aimed at the reconstruction, construction or purchase of housing. </li><li>  Interest on deposits, dividends on shares and other securities, as well as interest on deposits in banking institutions. </li><li>  Revenues under civil contracts (copyright, contract). </li><li>  Benefits and other types of assistance from the <span>regional budget.</span>  The exception is the allowance for citizens for the reconstruction of dilapidated premises, the construction or acquisition of new housing. </li><li>  Cash received in the form of gifts, inheritance. </li></ul><p>  Total family income is calculated taking into account deductions of taxes withheld from salaries, as well as taking into account deduction of alimony.  The total income of the family is calculated on the basis of all the higher points that take place in this family, with the exception of funds from the sale of residential property, if they are aimed at the acquisition, reconstruction or construction of new housing. </p><p>  The value of total income is needed to receive subsidies, benefits for housing, social housing, as well as to obtain a loan from a bank.  Given that the bulk of the total income of most Russian citizens is salary, most Russian banks require a certificate of employment.  It is believed that the monthly income of a family of two should be at least 30,000 rubles, excluding funds spent on dependents.  In pursuit of profit, some banks bypass this rule and give loans to families with a combined income of less than 30,000, without even considering the question of what kind of funds the dependents will be supported, if any. </p>

    <p>  Before considering an application for a loan, the bank will try to determine whether the client with his total income will be able to repay the loan.  When developing a mortgage program, the fact that a one-time payment cannot be more than 35% of total income is taken into account.  From here you can calculate, taking into account the monthly cash income of the family, how much and over how many years the client can pay.  The total family income may vary, depending on life circumstances, however, in order to fix the corresponding changes, it is necessary to provide the necessary information and documents to social protection bodies or banking institutions. </p>
