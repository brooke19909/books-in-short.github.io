It appeared on the basis of one of the financial institutions included in the ramified system of Promstroybank with a 75-year history.  For a long time, the company has already formed corporate traditions that provided it with exceptional authority in the financial services market. </p><p>  In 2012, the company conducted a full-scale rebranding, which resulted in the bank getting a new name, by which it is known to everyone today, as well as a significant increase in its capital by attracting additional issues and shares. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The official opening of the renewed Sauber Bank office in St. Petersburg took place at the end of 2012.  Currently, it is located at Bolshoy Prospekt Petrogradskaya side, house 25/2. </p><p>  At the next stage of development, its own division was opened in Moscow, soon other regions began to appear in the geography of this financial institution.  The systematic growth of capital made it possible to provide clients with fundamentally new opportunities in the field of lending, the client base has grown significantly, and the risk has been minimized due to the diversification of the loan portfolio. </p><p>  The Bank provides services for individuals and legal entities.  Separate conditions are provided for corporate clients.  In particular, they can count on an individual approach when lending, rendering services in the field of settlement and cash services in foreign and domestic currencies, when renting safes, issuing credit plastic cards, remote services, currency control, making payments using a customs card. </p><p>  Private individuals are provided with the services of placing their free cash funds on deposits, they can also rent safe deposit boxes, receive car loans and cash loans, carry out currency exchange operations and bank money transfers. </p><h2>  Loans </h2><div class="photo" data-original="exsustrust.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Services at Sauber Bank" class="if uuid-2955619" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2955619.jpg"></div><p>  In the customer reviews of Sauber Bank, private individuals note that, most often, they turn to a financial institution for services in the field of lending.  For example, you can get a loan for a new or used car. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  When purchasing a used car, you will need to make an initial deposit of up to 80 percent of the cost of the car (while there are options when a deposit is not required at all), the loan is issued according to two documents, including a passport and a driver‚Äôs license.  A preliminary decision is made within one hour.  After that, the client has thirty days to find a car that meets his requirements.  It is important that the company ensures the safe execution of the transaction. </p><p>  The borrower is subject to certain requirements.  He must be a citizen of the Russian Federation from the age of 21 at the time of conclusion of the loan agreement.  Moreover, at the time the agreement expires, he must be no more than 65 years old (for women - no more than 60).  He must carry out his labor activity in the regions where the branches and branches of the bank are represented.  It is required to provide information on official employment, which can be confirmed by the presence of the corresponding entry in the work book or by the concluded labor contract. </p><p>  Continuous work experience at the last place of work should be at least three months, if a loan is issued in the amount of more than 1.2 million rubles, then at least six months. </p><p>  When drawing up this agreement, it is necessary to provide a completed credit questionnaire, a passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation and a valid driver's license. </p><p>  According to customer reviews of Sauber Bank on car loans, the design of loans for new cars is popular.  In this case, you can count on up to one and a half million rubles at an interest rate of 12.5 percent per annum.  The loan term will be from one to six years. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  A cash loan is issued for a period of up to three years within a quarter of an hour after applying.  The validity of this decision is one month, and you can first learn about the result within an hour after the submission of all necessary documents.  Early repayment of additional fees and commissions is possible.  The only fundamental condition is that the borrower must live in St. Petersburg or the Leningrad Region.  He can count on the amount from thirty to 299 thousand rubles. </p><p>  If you take a loan secured by a car, then the maximum amount increases to one and a half million rubles, and the loan term grows to five years. </p><h2>  Deposits </h2><div class="photo" data-original="israelistartupsnyc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Banking services" class="if uuid-2955620" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2955620.jpg"></div><p>  According to customer reviews of Sauber Bank, many people prefer to open deposits here, since they are attracted by rather high interest rates. </p><p>  The company offers six types of deposits that should satisfy any customer needs.  On the Sauber-Fortune deposit, the user is offered convenient and favorable storage conditions and growth of accumulations.  It is noteworthy that the conditions of the deposit provide for its early termination at the request of the client. </p><p>  The minimum deposit amount is one hundred thousand rubles, the base rate is 7.55 percent per annum, with early termination it is reduced to 5%.  There is no capitalization of interest and additional contributions.  Interest is paid monthly; auto-prolongation is provided. </p><p>  When making a Sauber-Fortuna Long deposit for a period of more than three years, the base rate increases to 7.65 percent per annum.  In case of early termination, it will amount to 5.7%. </p><p>  If the two previous deposits were opened only in rubles, then Sauber - Currency Growth is intended for foreign currency.  The minimum amount is one thousand dollars or euros.  The base rate for a period of more than three years will be 0.2% per annum if you keep money in dollars.  And if in euros, then the rate will be 0.01%. </p><p>  The Sauber-Infinity deposit is opened from the amount of one hundred thousand rubles at a rate of 7.85 percent per annum.  Interest is paid monthly to the card account on a certain date, which corresponds to the date of conclusion of the agreement with the financial institution.  When servicing this deposit, a <span>Visa Infinite</span> card is issued for the client <span>.</span> </p><p>  The Sauber - VIP Classic deposit involves a maximum income with the ability to spend money, as well as early terminate the contract with minimal loss.  You can open it with a minimum amount of five million rubles at seven and a half percent per annum.  Moreover, upon termination of the contract after more than six months, the rate is reduced to six percent per annum, and if earlier, then to 3%. </p><p>  Finally, there is a Sauber-Partner contribution.  It is intended for customers with deposits closed from November 1 to December 28, 2018.  In this case, users can count on special favorable conditions.  With a minimum deposit amount of one hundred thousand rubles, they are given a rate of 7.8% per annum when making a deposit for three years.  If the contract is terminated ahead of schedule, then the rate is reduced to 7.4%. </p><h2>  Currency exchange </h2><div class="photo" data-original="led-displays.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sauber Bank in Moscow" class="if uuid-2955607" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2955607.jpg"></div><p>  Currency exchange at Sauber Bank, according to customer reviews, is also very popular.  This opportunity is provided by seven branches of the company located in different parts of St. Petersburg: </p><ul><li>  At the head office at the address: Bolshoy Prospect, Petrograd Side, 25/2 (area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe metro station "Chkalovskaya"). </li><li>  On Marata street 56-58 / 29 (metro station "Ligovsky Prospekt"). </li><li>  Komendantsky passage, 16, building 1 (metro station "Komendantsky Prospekt"). </li><li>  Ligovsky Prospect, 57-59 (metro station "Ploshchad Vosstaniya"). </li><li>  On the street Bela Kuna, 8 (metro station "International"). </li><li>  Moskovsky Prospekt 167a (Park Pobedy metro station). </li><li>  35 Prospect Prospect (Komendantsky Prospekt metro station). </li></ul><p>  In reviews of exchanges at Sauber Bank, many talk about the benefits, and also why it is here that people prefer to make foreign exchange transactions.  There are several reasons for this. </p><p>  Currency can be changed without commission, and a single rate does not depend on the amount of the operation.  A service is provided for exchanging large-value banknotes into smaller ones, which is especially important before going on vacation abroad.  Seven currency exchange offices are located in different parts of the city, which allows you to choose the most convenient, which will be closest to your place of work or residence.  Currency exchange is made daily.  There is also a pre-booking service for such transactions.  True, it is provided only in three offices: on Bolshoy Prospect of the Petrograd Side, on Marata Street with an amount of from fifty thousand currency units and on Ligovsky Prospect with an amount of from ten thousand currency units. </p><p>  In their reviews of currency exchanges at Sauber Bank, customers acknowledge that these advantages distinguish this financial institution from most companies operating in the same industry. </p><h2>  Cell rental </h2><p>  Many customers use the safe deposit box rental service.  This is a proven, reliable and versatile way to preserve any values. </p><p>  Users are provided with a wide choice of cell sizes, various rental periods, the possibility of online booking this service immediately on the site, as well as safe rent by several tenants. </p><p>  For individuals and legal entities, when concluding a contract for a year, a discount of twenty percent is given, and when renting a cell for a period of six months, upon presentation of a bonus card of the Sauber Club loyalty program, it is possible to get a 30 percent discount. </p><p>  The minimum rental period is one week.  The rental price is from 15 rubles per day. </p><h2>  other services </h2><div class="photo" data-original="fin.1777.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sauber Bank in St. Petersburg" class="if uuid-2955606" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2955606.jpg"></div><p>  If you talk about other services that this financial institution provides, then customers can count on the issue of bank cards.  This is necessary for a comfortable and modern method of payment, which allows you to conveniently pay for services and goods without having cash.  The company is a member of the largest international systems MasterCard and VISA.  According to reviews of cards at Sauber Bank, customers note a wide range of plastic carriers, which includes various options - from classic to preferred. </p><p>  Clients of this financial institution can make transfers and payments.  To send a transfer, it is necessary to provide the beneficiary's bank details, present a document proving your identity, as well as fill out an application in which to indicate the amount of transfer and the amount of the commission. </p><p>  Upon receipt of the transfer, you will need to open an account for its transfer, check with the sender detailed information on the date of transfer and the amount, contact the bank‚Äôs offices with an identity document. </p><p>  The commission for the transfer without opening an account in rubles will amount to two percent of the amount (at least one hundred rubles).  When making a transfer in foreign currency, the commission will amount to one percent of the amount, but at the same time not less than fifty currency units. </p><p>  It is worth noting that for regular customers there is a Sauber Club program.  This is a bonus loyalty program, which involves a reward system for regular users of banking services.  Participation allows you to accumulate bonus points on a special card, which can be issued at any branch of the bank. </p><p>  The card allows you to write off accumulated bonuses to pay for mobile communications, as well as receive discounts of up to thirty percent for renting an individual bank safe. </p><p>  An attractive additional opportunity, which many note in reviews of Sauber Bank in St. Petersburg, is a twenty percent discount on the products of the Kaudal wine house, which has offices in Moscow and St. Petersburg.  You also have the right to attend seven free tastings. </p><h2>  Customer Impressions </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.yp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews about Sauber Bank" class="if uuid-2955610" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2955610.jpg"></div><p>  You can find a lot of positive reviews about Sauber Bank in St. Petersburg.  Customers are often satisfied with the level of service provided, the list of services that this financial institution can offer them.  Even though it has relatively few branches throughout the Northern capital, many users already give it preference, choosing which bank they plan to serve in the near foreseeable future. </p><p>  Those who have already used the services of this credit institution, note that in the offices of a financial institution you can always find friendly and quality service.  In the reviews of Sauber Bank JSC, users say that, even arriving a few minutes before the office is closed, the client will be accepted.  Workers do not attach much importance to the fact that their working day is almost over.  They fall into the position of people who, for example, are late for the plane.  Show professionalism and efficiency, carrying out operations as quickly as possible.  As a result, everything succeeds, the plans are formed as it should. </p><p>  In reviews of Sauber Bank, customers note the exceptional honesty and decency of the employees of this organization.  Repeatedly, users had to forget valuable items, bags and briefcases with large amounts in the office.  Everything always returned safe and sound at the initiative of the workers themselves. </p><h2>  Negative </h2><p>  At the same time, there are a lot of negative reviews about Sauber Bank in Moscow and St. Petersburg - cities in which this financial organization has representative offices. </p><p>  For example, users complain about the rudeness and impoliteness of security guards who are called upon to ensure security and take care of customers who come to them for help.  Together, one has to face diametrically opposite situations.  Often, for the execution of banking operations, people have to queue up for people standing on the street.  At the same time, when trying to get inside to wait in comfortable conditions, even pregnant and cold, guards in a rude form push them out into the street, not trying to enter the position of a specific person, to help him if he finds himself in a difficult situation. </p><p>  When trying to exchange currency, negative reviews of Sauber Bank customers also occur regularly.  We have to face outright rudeness and disrespect, which employees of a financial institution show to visitors.  For example, they can refuse to change individual banknotes without explanation, and respond to clarifying questions inappropriately, snarl, declare that, if they want, they can easily not accept half.  If at the same time they hear about some other large bank, then right at the clients they begin to pour mud on it, forgetting about the elementary rules of corporate decency.  As a result, the client concludes that the employees are rude, and after visiting the office and communicating with them, there is a persistent unpleasant feeling, no desire to come back to this bank for sure appears. </p><p>  Claims that the financial institution is not customer-oriented can also be found in reviews of legal entities about Sauber Bank.  In this case, problems arise again if you want to exchange currency.  Impressive lines constantly appear, most cash desks simply do not work, while employees work slowly, deliberately leisurely.  Despite the fact that there is very little time left until the end of the working day, some employees (not all) demonstrate by their appearance that many customers will not have time to get the desired service.  As a result, people, having stood in line for about an hour, leave without anything because they did not manage to carry out the required operations. </p><p>  In reviews of Sauber Bank, one can often find statements that the financial institution has frankly poor service and the product itself that it provides.       .           , ,       ,     . </p><p>         . ,          .     ,    .       ,              . </p><p>                .  ,     ,         , ,    ,     .   ,      .          . </p><h2>   </h2><p>           .   ,         ,        ,          . </p><h2>   </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.yell.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="    " class="if uuid-2955611" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2955611.jpg"></div><p> Most of the employee reviews about Sauber Bank are negative.  Regularly have to deal with a large turnover of staff, ranging from ordinary managers, ending with leaders at various levels.  On average, new employees withstand from several months to six months.  After this period, only a few remain, and the recruitment of new specialists begins. </p><p>  In the reviews of Sauber Bank employees in Moscow, many complain about the ‚Äúblack‚Äù salary that they have to receive in envelopes, while at the interview everyone assures that their company fully complies with the Russian labor legislation, but in reality this is not entirely true.  Officially, it is possible to receive no more than 20 thousand rubles, the rest - in the form of a bonus. </p>
