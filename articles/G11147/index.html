There are many old castles saturated with the atmosphere of the Middle Ages.  Their majesty and historical spirit attract tourists from all over the world.  A list of the most popular Bavarian castles, their description and photos in the article below. </p><h2>  Hohenschwangau </h2><div class="photo" data-original="trelibrisoprailcielo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hohenschwangau Castle" class="if uuid-3218870" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106334/3218870.jpg"></div><p>  Opens a list of castles in Bavaria - Hohenschwangau.  The history of its name, which means "high swan land", dates back to the reign of King Ludwig.  Since childhood, the ruler loved swans, so the castle‚Äôs internal design is full of various images of these birds: both the fountain and the tiny candlestick took the form of a swan. </p><p>  The stories and legends of German heroes, which were told to young Ludwig, permeated everything in this castle.  One of the most valuable premises in it is the room of the swan knight, whose picturesque ceilings are a real work of art.  In the medieval building you can see the piano, which was played by Wagner himself, as well as Russian icons donated by Emperor Alexander I. </p><p>  You can visit the castle only as part of an excursion, which, it is worth noting, is not conducted in Russian.  You can use the audio guide service.  The duration of the sightseeing tour of the castle is 35 minutes.  Taking pictures and making videos is prohibited.  Ticket price - 1000 rubles, children under 18 years old admission is free. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Linderhof </h2><p>  Linderhof Castle in Bavaria is the residence of King Ludwig II.  The magnificent palace is one of the best buildings of the German ruler.  There is a version that this is the only architectural object, the construction of which was completed during the lifetime of the monarch.  The construction is relatively young - it was erected at the end of the 19th century. </p><div class="photo" data-original="imgnooz.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Linderhof Castle" class="if uuid-3218891" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106334/3218891.jpg"></div><p>  The architectural solution took into account elements of the Baroque style.  Luxury and wealth literally permeated the inner halls of this castle.  Linderhof rooms and corridors are decorated with magnificent china, antique tapestries of the finest work, huge mirrors and statues. </p><p>  The construction is located in the middle of a beautiful park with a pond and a fountain.  The royal lands can be seen while walking.  A ticket with full access to the castle and nearby territories costs a little more than 600 rubles.  Students and senior citizens can enjoy picturesque views at a discount of one hundred rubles. </p><h2>  Neuschwanstein </h2><p>  Photos of the castle can be seen on the logo of the Walt Disney studio.  The companies presented even wanted to buy the building and transfer it to the territory of its entertainment in the United States. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hiveminer.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Neuschwanstein Castle" class="if uuid-3218894" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106334/3218894.jpg"></div><p>  Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria was not built as a defensive structure and not for royal events.  The building is a realized romantic fantasy of King Ludwig II, erected in 1869.  All rooms of the castle have an interior saturated with legends about valiant knights and other German folklore. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The monarch spent a record amount equal to six million gold marks on a chivalrous project.  After the death of the king, the construction began to be used as an excursion object in order to recoup the construction. </p><p>  A ticket with a full tour costs almost a thousand rubles, for children under 18 admission is free.  Tourists are given an audio guide in the required language.  Taking photos in Neuschwanstein is prohibited. </p><p>  It is also absolutely free to visit the picturesque surroundings of the castle.  A walk near Neuschwanstein provides steep rocky paths, a bridge with stunning views of the castle, as well as lakes Alpsee and Schwansee, which some call the cleanest in Germany. </p><h2>  Herrenkimsee </h2><p>  Herrenkimsee is a castle built as a suburban residence of King Ludwig II.  The original "Bavarian Versailles" is a symbolic ode to the French monarch Louis XIV, built in the likeness of the beloved building of a foreign colleague.  The similarity can be seen in the architectural component, layout and in the interior of the halls and corridors.  In some elements, the German monarch surpassed the first person of France at that time.  For example, the Herrenkimsee Mirror Hall is significantly larger than in the Versailles building. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bavaria.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Herrenkimsee Castle" class="if uuid-3218897" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106334/3218897.jpg"></div><p>  Also in the German palace there were elevators, heating and running water with hot water.  On the territory of the residence there is a museum dedicated to Ludwig II. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  You can get to the island on which Herrenkimsee is located on a steamboat that departs every half hour from the pier of Prien am Chiemsee.  In summer, a horse-drawn cart can be reached from the tourist pier.  The journey takes approximately 15 minutes. </p><p>  The cost of a ticket for a full tour, which takes into account visits to the palace, museum and monastery, is less than seven hundred rubles.  Visitors under the age of 18 can see all the beauty for free. </p><h2>  Trausnits </h2><p>  The famous architectural landmark of Bavaria is the castle of Trausnitz.  It is located near the city of Loundshut.  The construction was erected in 1204 by order of the Duke of Otto I, representing the Wittelsbach dynasty.  The building had a defensive purpose for the conquered territories. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.palba.cz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Trausnitz Castle" class="if uuid-3218900" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106334/3218900.jpg"></div><p>  Trausnits has a monumental structure of the fort, the design of which is made in the Gothic style.  Watchtowers and buildings for local residents, protected by powerful walls, quickly attracted residents, and over time, a whole city formed around the building. </p><p>  A special contribution was made to the prosperity of the castle by the Duke Wilhelm V the Pious.  He ruled here in the years 1545-1579.  Thanks to the monarch, a beautiful landscape park with exotic plants, stunning fountains and sculptures was built near the fortress.  The interior of Trausnitsa is luxurious halls, furnished with antique furniture, picturesque paintings, porcelain elements of kitchen utensils and collection weapons.  It is worth noting that every tourist should see the legendary spiral staircase, decorated with images of Italian comedy heroes. </p><p>  A ticket for an excursion costs 300 rubles. </p><h2>  Altenburg </h2><div class="photo" data-original="en.bamberg.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Altenburg Castle" class="if uuid-3218902" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106334/3218902.jpg"></div><p>  The castles of Bavaria are complemented by Altenburg.  The end of its construction dates back to 1109.  The construction was used by residents of the nearest settlements as temporary shelter in case of an enemy attack.  In 1553, Altenburg was burned, but the surviving parts of the castle continued to be used as a prison. </p><p>  It is worth noting that in one of the premises of the fortress there lived a real brown bear.  Currently, the memory of him is kept by a scarecrow. </p><p>  Unfortunately, little remains of the medieval castle in Altenburg, but the spirit of history and the temporary dust from it have not gone away. </p><h2>  Falkenstein </h2><p>  The name of the Bavarian castle Falkenstein translates as "Falcon Stone".  This is the highest mountain building in Germany, the entrance to which is absolutely free, but you still have to pay about 250 rubles for a car to enter the territory. </p><p>  Fallenstein was built in the middle of the 13th century, but after 400 years it was almost completely destroyed.  The legendary king Ludwig II planned to restore the castle on this picturesque site.  Workers began work, but the monarch died unexpectedly, and the construction site was frozen. </p><div class="photo" data-original="airfreshener.club" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Falkenstein Castle" class="if uuid-3218903" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106334/3218903.jpg"></div><p>  The construction was practically not preserved.  From the remaining elements of the building you can see pieces of walls, the foundation and part of the first floor.  The only thing that attracts tourists is a wooden observation deck, arranged next to the ruins. </p><h2>  Hohenfreiberg </h2><p>  The ruins of the Bavarian castle still look extremely impressive.  This fortress is one of the few that can boast a rich military past.  Partial preservation of the medieval defensive structure attracts curious tourists from all over the world. </p><p>  The construction of Hohenfreiberg began in 1418 by a certain local baron.  Having started the case, he did not finish it.  The project passed from hand to hand, which contributed to its gradual expansion and transformation into a full-fledged castle.  The fortress was regularly in demand until during the Thirty Years War it was destroyed.  Despite the deplorable ending of Hohenfreiberg, some remains can still be seen.  For example, the gate and the outer courtyard have been preserved, and these elements were built by the very first founder.  The system of double walls has survived, you can see the remains of the bastions and loopholes.  The church tower suffered the smallest changes, although nothing remained inside it. </p><p>  Entrance to the observation deck is free for everyone. </p><h2>  Nymphenburg </h2><p>  The Bavarian castle of Nymphenburg is a palace complex, full of luxury and craftsmanship.  It was founded in 1664 and is considered one of the most beautiful architectural ensembles in Europe.  On the territory there are many man-made lakes, a chapel, a hunting palace.  Regular completion continued for a long time, so determining the exact date of completion is almost impossible. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hiveminer.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="nymphenburg palace" class="if uuid-3218907" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106334/3218907.jpg"></div><p>  In front of the entrance to Nymphenburg there is a semicircular square, the sides of which are decorated with arches with the entrance to the park.  Here is a beautiful pond with a fountain, as well as statues of ancient gods. </p><p>  One of the main elements of the architectural ensemble is a canal that runs through the entire park.  A huge number of swans live here. </p><p>  The cost of a pass ticket is approximately 750 rubles. </p><h2>  Hohe Schless </h2><p>  One of the most surviving castles is Hohe Schless.  It was built in the thirteenth century.  They tried to capture him many times, but the walls of the fortress withstood the attacks of enemies.  Today, museums are open here, and some of the paintings of the Bavarian National Gallery are also kept. </p><p>  The building was built in the shape of the letter "p", and additional structures, such as a church, a prison tower and other residential and utility structures, are attached to it from different sides.  Everything is stylized as late Gothic: the windows are decorated with arches, the corners are covered by towers with a spire. </p><p>  The walls of the castle and the central tower are painted with frescoes having a five-hundred-year life span.  Murals can be seen in our time.  Many architectural elements of the interior are simply incredibly preserved.  The design of the ceilings, the carving, and the wood panels have survived.  Surprisingly, the Knights' Hall looks as if yesterday there were medieval warriors and courtiers here. </p><p>  Particularly impressive is the exposition of Gothic painting, presented in one of the halls.  Also there you can see a sculpture of the same time. </p><p>  A tour of the Bavarian castle will cost a tourist 450 rubles. </p><h2>  Harburg </h2><p>  Completes the list of popular Bavarian castles - Harburg, considered one of the most preserved.  The appearance of the fortress and its internal situation are practically unchanged.  Surprisingly, this is one of the most ancient fortresses - the first documented mention dates back to the tenth century. </p><p>  The construction was erected strictly according to military rules, because it had an important strategic importance, which consisted in protecting the imperial road.  It‚Äôs just impossible to go into the courtyard - you need to overcome several protective structures. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.agoda.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Harburg Castle" class="if uuid-3218909" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106334/3218909.jpg"></div><p>  Castle Harburg wanted to buy Michael Jackson.  He tried several times to buy a building, but always received a refusal. </p><p>  You can find out what attracted the ‚Äúking of pop music‚Äù, as well as feel the spirit of the Middle Ages by buying a ticket worth 300 rubles. </p>
