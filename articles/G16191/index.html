    <h2>  Positioning </h2><p>  Initially referred to premium solutions <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> S5 SM-G900F.  This is truly a flagship device.  Its characteristics and parameters are relevant to this day.  Although now there is a more advanced smartphone (we are talking about the flagship of 2015 - Samsung S6) from this Korean manufacturer, but in terms of hardware and software parameters, the difference between them is not so significant.  Therefore, this gadget can still be attributed to the premium segment.  At the same time, its value over the past time has significantly decreased.  This nuance makes his purchase even more justified.  Moreover, he will serve you for more than one year and will become a loyal assistant in solving various problems, regardless of their level of complexity. </p><h2>  And what do we get in the box when buying? </h2><p>  Although it is the flagship device of the S5, but its equipment is very modest.  It includes, in addition to the battery and smartphone, the following: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Interface cord. </li><li>  Quick start guide (it also contains a warranty card). </li><li>  Charger. </li></ul>

    <p>  You will have to buy a case, a protective film and a memory card separately for an additional fee.  The same statement applies to the speaker system.  It‚Äôs good if you have good headphones.  If they are not, then we buy immediately.  Moreover, in order to get good sound they must have proper quality. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  A lot of similarities have the S4 and S5 models SM-G900F.  Most of the front panel in the S5 is occupied by a 5.1-inch display, which is protected by shock-resistant Gorilla Eye glass.  This device uses its third generation.  Under the screen is a typical control panel, which consists of 2 touch buttons (located at the edges of the device) and one mechanical (located in the center of the panel).  A fingerprint sensor is integrated into the same mechanical button.  This innovation is one of the most important differences between the S4 and S5.  Above the display are: the front camera, distance, light and gesture sensors, an LED event indicator and a speaker.  On the left is the power button, and on the right - volume control.  On the bottom of the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù phone there is a hole in the conversational microphone and micro-USB format.  Above are: a port for connecting a stereo headset, an <span>infrared port, a</span> microphone for making a loud conversation.  On the back cover of the gadget, the main camera, double backlight and a loud speaker are habitually located.  It should also be noted that the degree of protection for this device is IP67.  This allows it to be immersed under water to a depth of 0.5 meters and protects against the possible penetration of dust inside. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Semiconductor base </h2><p>  Samsung SM-G900F is built on the basis of one of the best computing platforms for mobile devices - Snapdragon 801, which was developed by Qualcomm, the leading manufacturer of workstation chips.  This processor consists of 4 modified cores based on the architecture of "Krait 400".  All of them are manufactured according to the 28-nm process technology and can be accelerated in peak mode to 2.5 GHz.  Now, a year after the start of sales of this gadget, in the middle segment there are still no devices whose performance level would correspond to the computing capabilities of this chip.  Snapdragon 801 will cope with almost any task today without any problems.  The only thing he will definitely have problems with is the new 64-bit applications.  All its main registers can process only 32 bits per cycle.  Hence the possible problems with the new software.  But while there are not so many such applications, and the transition process itself is not so fast. </p>

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> S5 SM-G900F boasts one of the best displays in its niche.  Its diagonal is impressive, even by today's standards, 5.1 inches.  It was made according to the technology typical of this manufacturer - SuperAMOLED.  Its resolution is 1920x1080.  The image on it is displayed in the format of ‚ÄúFull HR‚Äù.  The screen is protected, as already noted, with the third-generation special shock-resistant glass "Gorilla Eye".  The image quality on this screen is not satisfactory.  Individual pixels on it without special devices with the ordinary eye are almost impossible to distinguish. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Graphics Accelerator </h2><p>  The developers did not forget to equip the SM-G900F graphics accelerator.  Galaxy devices are not always equipped with this component.  This device has Adreno 330 installed.  This video card even now belongs to the top.  If we add to this a relatively small display resolution in 1920x1080, then generally there are no problems with the processing of graphic information.  This is quite enough to solve the most demanding tasks to date.  The only problem may be the processing of new programs that are optimized for running 64-bit applications.  They were already developed for the new hardware and will definitely not work on this graphic accelerator.  While there is very little such software, and the process itself, as already mentioned, is going quite slowly. </p>

    <h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  The brightest moments of your life will not be difficult to save on a digital medium using the main camera in the SM-G900F.  It is based on a 16 megapixel sensor.  There are many modes of operation at the program level.  All this allows to receive rather high-quality pictures in almost any situations.  There is also an autofocus system and, of course, dual backlighting based on LEDs.  With the recording of videos in this camera, too, everything is fine.  It can record video in 2160 r format with a refresh rate of 30 images per second.  There is also the possibility of recording in 1080 r format, but in this case the number of images will increase by 2 times and will be 60 frames per second.  The sensor at the front camera is more modest - 2 megapixels.  This will be enough to make video calls.  But the "selfies" obtained with its help will be of average quality. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  The capacity of the integrated drive is identical for all Samsung SM-G900F - 16Gb devices.  At the same time, part of it is occupied by preinstalled software, and about 11.5 GB is allocated for the needs of the user.  When used wisely, this should be enough for comfortable work on this device and there will be no shortage of free space.  If you find that there is not enough 16Gb built into the Samsung Galaxy SM-G900F, then you can increase the amount of memory using an external flash card.  The necessary slot is in this device and the maximum capacity of the external drive in this case can reach 128 GB.  The RAM in this gadget is 2 GB.  Of these, about half (that is, 1 GB) is used immediately by system processes.  The rest of the RAM is allocated to the user to run his applications. </p><h2>  The battery of the gadget and its autonomy </h2><p>  The undeniable advantage of the Samsung SM - G900 F is its autonomy.  The device is equipped with a removable 2800 mAh battery.  We add to this a screen with a diagonal of 5.1 inches and a resolution of 1920 √ó 1080, as well as a productive, but no less energy-efficient processor, and get 2-3 days of battery life at an average load level.  If you watch a video in the format of ‚ÄúFull HR‚Äù or play a demanding toy, then the specified value will be reduced to 12 hours.  You can, of course, use this device to a minimum, and in this case you can count on 4 days of battery life.  But at the same time, the smartphone will turn into a regular ‚Äúdialer‚Äù and can only make calls and send and receive short text messages. </p>

    <h2>  Data exchange </h2><p>  A complete list of interfaces necessary for comfortable operation boasts the S5 SM-G900F.  Everything is here. </p><ul><li>  The presence of two built-in Wi-Fi transmitters at once allows you to count on 300 Mbit / s if you have the appropriate router.  Built-in support for the latest version of "Wi-Fi" - "ac".  The developers also did not forget about its rather old modification - ‚Äúa‚Äù, which is still found on various types of devices.  As a result, when downloading large amounts of information to this smartphone using this wireless interface, there should definitely not be a problem. </li><li>  This smartphone can function in almost all modern mobile networks.  There is support for GSM (in them the speed is limited to 500 kb / s), HSDPA (in such 3G networks, the speed can theoretically reach 42 Mb / s.) And LTE (in this case, the speed will be higher and can reach 150 Mb / s.) . </li><li>  There is also a bluetooth gadget.  This transmitter allows you to output an audio signal to a <span>wireless speaker</span> system <span>.</span>  Also, using it, you can exchange small photos or videos with similar smartphones.  In some cases, also using the ‚ÄúBluetooth‚Äù synchronization with a PC is possible. </li><li>  Using the infrared port installed in this smartphone and special software, you can easily turn it into a remote control for the music center, DVD player or TV. </li><li>  This gadget supports two navigation systems at once: the domestic GLONASS and international GPS.  With their help, this ‚Äúsmart‚Äù phone can easily turn into a full-fledged navigator. </li><li>  Another important wireless interface is NFC.  Its presence allows you to transfer and receive large amounts of information from similar devices in minutes. </li><li>  There are only two wired methods for transmitting information in this device: a 3.5-mm audio jack and microUSB. </li></ul><h2>  Software </h2><p>  Initially, the Samsung Galaxy SM-G900F operates under the control of an operating system such as Android 4.4.  Since March of this year, an update is already available to version 5.0.  Therefore, the first time you connect to the Global Web, you can update the system software.  A shell typical of this line of devices, TouchWiz UI, is installed on top of the operating system.  It is with the help of the last software component that the user can optimize the interface of this gadget to his needs in a matter of minutes.  Otherwise, a set of preinstalled software is standard: social clients, a set of mini-applications from Google and a familiar set of programs built directly into the operating system itself. </p>

    <h2>  The price of a smart phone today </h2><p>  The price of the Samsung S5 SM-G900F starts <span>at</span> $ <span>400</span> for a black-case version.  The rest of its modifications - in white, gold and blue cases - cost about the same at the current moment: from 430 dollars.  For comparison, you can bring last year's flagship from Sony - Xperia Z3.  With fairly similar technical parameters, it will cost much more - at $ 460.  Accordingly, the starting price of $ 400 makes the purchase of this unit really justified.  In this case, you get a really high-quality and functional device. </p><h2>  Smartphone owners </h2><p>  Be that as it may, the main minus in the opinion of the majority of Galaxy S5 SM-G900F owners is the 16Gb internal drive, of which the user can only rely on 11.5 GB.  This issue is easily and simply solved by installing an external flash card.  She, of course, is not included in the package of delivery, and she will have to be bought separately.  For the rest, this gadget boasts an impressive list of advantages: </p><ul><li>  Protected against moisture and dust. </li><li>  Great and flawless main camera. </li><li>  Very productive hardware platform. </li><li>  A good degree of autonomy of the device. </li><li>  An impressive set of supported interfaces. </li></ul>
