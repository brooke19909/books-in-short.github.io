  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Theories of emotions. general characteristics</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Theories of emotions are formed throughout the <span>history of the development of psychology</span> and physiology.  It is difficult to answer the question of which one is classical, since all are correct.  Therefore, a more complete statement will be that they complement each other.  Consider in detail the main provisions of each of them. </p><p>  <em><strong>Wilhelm Wundt's theory of emotions</strong></em> examines their structure in more detail.  The scientist was able to identify such manifestations as pleasure or displeasure, comfort or excitement.  In addition, in this area a lot of attention was paid to voltage or discharge.  In general, the psychologist emphasized that the main causes of their appearance are physiological. </p><p>  <em><strong>The James ‚Äì Lange theory</strong></em> is a vasomotor model.  She explains why this <span>mental process</span> occurs <span>.</span>  The leading role is given to the somatovegetative component.  Therefore, any emotion is sensations that appear in the process of changes in external movements, as well as involuntary (secretory, vascular and cardiac) activities.  Therefore, peripheral changes are the cause. </p><p>  These early theories of emotions were criticized by physiologists in the mid-19th century through a series of experiments.  So, C. Sherrington cut the <span>spinal cord</span> in the cervical region, as well as the <span>vagus nerves.</span>  As a result, it was shown that the animal reacted to the emotional impact as before.  Therefore, separation from the central NS visceral has no effect. </p><p>  W. Kennon, an American psychophysiologist and physiologist, showed that at the time of the appearance of <span>emotional arousal</span> , the adrenaline hormone is released simultaneously.  It is he who can provide mobilization of the whole organism for active action.  At this moment, the heartbeat begins to intensify, the pupils expand and digestion is disturbed, sugar rises. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Subsequently, biological theories of emotions appeared. </p><p>  One of the most popular is the <em><strong>concept of P. Anokhin</strong></em> .  In its framework, the appearance of negative and positive emotions is explained by the fact that there is a mismatch or coincidence of the expected result and the real state of things. </p><p>  Within the framework of biological theories is the <em><strong>concept of activation of emotions</strong></em> .  It is based on the importance of the role of the internal structure of the brain.  The sensory stimulus comes from the periphery to the center where it is evaluated.  The fact is that the thalamus contains samples and sensory assessments of any behavior.  The existing ‚Äúresponse‚Äù is transmitted to the sales authority, from which a message will be transmitted on how to behave: to be happy or sad, to be surprised or angry, and so on. </p><p>  Psychological theories of emotions are presented as follows. </p><p>  The author of the <em><strong>need-information concept</strong></em> is P. Simonov.  According to her, emotion is the reflection by the brain of an animal or person of some actual need (in addition, its quality and size are important factors) and the likelihood of how much it will be satisfied.  This will be assessed on the basis of genetic, or previously acquired individual experience. </p><p>  IN <strong></strong>  <em><strong>S. Schechter‚Äôs concepts are</strong></em> based on two components that evoke the experience of emotions.  On the one hand, physiological arousal appears, on the other hand, the situation begins to be cognitively comprehended.  For this, the emerging excitation is interpreted.  This theory was based on a series of experiments in which respondents were injected with an <span>exciting drug.</span>  Next, behavioral changes were observed. </p><p>  It can be noted that modern theories of emotions explain their appearance by psychophysiological reasons. </p>
