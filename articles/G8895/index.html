It is here that travelers come who want to relax, enjoy the beauty of nature and plunge headlong into the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãvivid entertainment. </p><p>  Majorca is perhaps one of the most popular <span>islands in Spain.</span>  Moreover, the mild climate gives tourists the opportunity to spend the winter enjoying the warmth and sun.  Of course, hundreds of hotels and large hotel complexes work on the island, so there is always something to choose from for a traveler.  Quite good estimates tourists give the hotel Illot Suites Spa 4 *. </p><p>  Of course, when planning a vacation and choosing a stopping place, you need to pay attention to even the smallest details.  Where to look for a hotel and how far will you have to go to the beach?  Is it possible for a potential guest to count on comfort and quality service?  What does leisure time for vacationers look like and what impressions do people who have already managed to visit the hotel have? </p><h2>  Hotel Location Information </h2>

    <p>  Perhaps, it is always worth starting a hotel study from its location, because for some tourists, an important point is the proximity to the city center and the availability of entertainment venues within walking distance, while other people tend to relax in silence.  Where is the Illot Suites Spa 4 * hotel located?  Cala Rathada, one of the most prestigious areas of Mallorca - this is where many compatriots prefer to settle for a few days. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This is a tourist area, so cafes and shops, as well as some other entertainment venues, are within walking distance.  On the other hand, the place is quite calm - the sounds of a disco are unlikely to wake you up at night.  The distance to the beach is also small - no more than 350 meters.  But the international airport, as well as the capital of the island, the city of Palma de Mallorca, is located about 80 km.  By the way, tours already, as a rule, include a transfer from the airport, and the trip itself is unlikely to take much time. </p><h2>  Hotel Illot Suites Spa 4 * (Mallorca): description of the territory </h2>

The room fund of the Illot Suies Spa 4 hotel is represented by 102 rooms - all these are luxury rooms that delight tourists with cleanliness, space, modern technology and a pleasant, elegant design.  By the way, each room has either its own small porch (on the ground floor) or a balcony, where, sitting on wicker chairs, you can enjoy the garden and watch hotel life. </p><p>  It is difficult to imagine a comfortable tourist stay without some amenities, including household appliances.  Guests can use a TV (there are the most popular satellite channels), as well as a telephone and air conditioning, without which life during the summer heat will hardly seem sweet.  Different drinks can be delivered to the room upon request, but this service is paid separately.  By the way, room service is available around the clock. </p><p>  The bathroom is small, but everything you need is there, including a constant supply of water, a shower, toilet and mirror.  Of course, you will be provided with clean towels (change them every day).  In their reviews, tourists say that they maintain cleanliness here - they clean and carefully clean the rooms. </p><h2>  Can I eat at the hotel? </h2>
