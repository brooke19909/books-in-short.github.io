Schemes resemble a set of <span>geometric shapes</span> and lines.  Although from afar you can see a seamless pattern: landscape, portrait, flowers.  And only approaching the picture, you are surprised at the technique of execution.  It seems that the mysterious interweaving of threads is not subject to the ordinary person.  However, even a schoolboy can master isoniaz.  Having understood the fundamental foundations of this needlework, over time you can create real masterpieces. </p><h2>  What is sinking? </h2><p>  This needlework appeared in the 17th century in England.  Masters used this pattern as a decoration for houses.  Carnations were driven into the boards, the threads were wound in a certain sequence, and an unusual element was created.  Subsequently, clove boards were replaced with cardboard, velvet paper with holes.  And some craftswomen transferred it to a cloth. </p><p>  From geometrical figures and lines magnificent pictures are made by isonia.  Schemes of simple plots can be found in needlework books.  Here is a little information on creating complex pictures. </p><p>  The fact is that there are not so many professionals in this direction; each of them keeps their achievements secret.  In most cases, the sinking technique, or nitography, is used in labor lessons to develop <span>fine motor skills</span> with older preschoolers and first graders.  They create small cards, crafts on disks, and simple pictures with one plot with children. </p><p>  For this type of creativity, get thin threads.  The more colors, the brighter the work.  You will also need a pencil, compass, ruler, awl, needles of different thicknesses, polystyrene and cardboard. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Pictures by isonia: schemes of the main elements </h2><p>  Let's start with the circle.  Draw a circle, divide it into even segments.  By embroidering chords in a certain sequence, you get a filled or incomplete circle.  To remember what distance between segments and what sequence of embroidery this or that pattern gives, make card templates.  They will come in handy when creating your own circuits. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="paintings sinking scheme" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/812310.jpg" width="448"></div>

    <p>  Consider 3 ways to embroider a circle.  On the template, you can draw a circle with a compass.  In the finished picture, use prepared samples so that there are no unnecessary punctures.  Mark on the circle 19 points, number them.  Put the template on the foam, pierce the dots.  The drawing and puncture are done from the wrong side.  Next, insert the thread, make a large knot, drive the needle from the wrong side to the first point.  According to this principle, all works in the technique of sinking go.  Schemes for beginners: </p><ul><li>  Embroider each chord so that a large circle forms on the face, there will be small stitches from the inside.  That is, from the first point, enter the third.  On the wrong side, insert the needle into the second point and go into the fourth.  From the wrong side, from the third point, enter the fifth, etc. </li></ul><h2>  Embroider a circle </h2><p>  We continue to consider the main elements of nitography, from which all the pictures in the technique of isothony are obtained.  Schemes of filled circles: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  ‚ÄúExtend‚Äù the chord, starting work from the first and fifth points.  Also on both sides, walk sequentially around the entire circumference.  That is, from the fifth point on the wrong side, insert the needle into the second and go to the sixth.  In this embodiment, the inner circle becomes smaller. </li><li>  To get a more complete circle, make chords large.  For example, from the first point, enter the ninth.  On the wrong side, insert the needle into the tenth point and withdraw into the second.  Then insert the needle into the third point and withdraw at the eleventh.  That is, short stitches are formed on the wrong side. </li></ul><p>  These are simple circles, if you ‚Äúlay‚Äù layers on top of each other with different threads, you will get a multilayer circle.  That is, embroider the third method, then the second and then the first pattern.  You can experiment with other geometric shapes.  If the dots are close to each other, then take a thin needle and <span>silk threads</span> to get exquisite pictures of sinking. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="to stain patterns" class="if" height="496" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/812317.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Schemes of triangles and arcs </h2><p>  The pattern depends on the length of the triangles.  The number of points must be the same.  For example, the distance between the points can be through a centimeter on all sides or on one side the same number of points alternates after five millimeters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Number the sides of the triangle.  Start embroidering by pulling the needle from the end of one edge and entering a point from the corner of the other side.  For example, from the first point of edge A on the front side, go to the second point of edge B. From the wrong side B, make a small stitch to the third point.  On the front side, enter the fourth, etc. </p><p>  From the triangles we get interesting pictures.  Izon with schemes of complex circles consisting of triangles allows you to get beautiful abstract balls.  Only in this case, number all three sides of the figure.  Examine the pattern for embroidering the balls carefully.  In one embodiment, the triangles are fully embroidered, while in another they form petals.  Arcs are numbered twice, starting from the second point.  Combine figures, get unusual plots. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="to erase the patterns of paintings with numbers" class="if" height="364" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/812323.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Rooster sinking </h2><p>  For embroidery, simple coloring patterns are suitable.  Print a picture, divide each element into dots, number, embroider.  To make it easier to choose a pattern, scroll through needlework patterns (meaning to sift).  Schemes of paintings with the numbers of beginners will confuse.  Therefore, sew one piece at a time. </p><p>  For example, you embroider a scallop in a rooster, divided into three parts.  Create them as triangles from a complex circle.  Next, go to the beak.  Now pay attention to the eye.  First, embroider the head in a circle, and create an eye on top of this type.  The remaining parts are embroidered in the same way as a circle or oval. </p><p>  When filling out the figures, pay attention to the middle, which creates a direction due to the ‚Äúthickness‚Äù of the weaves.  Therefore, you embroider a crest, tail from the top, but create wings and a trunk from the bottom.  Embroider the paws with a ‚Äútriangle‚Äù, and finish the shin by connecting both parts.  In this technique for cards, take bright multi-colored threads, and for a picture - several shades of the same color scheme. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="isonia painting with patterns" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/812333.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Flowers </h2><p>  For postcards and bookmarks is also used isonia.  Schemes of paintings (flowers, animals, landscapes, architecture) on the Internet you will not find.  Wizard creates complex plots on their own.  Beginners should train on "children's" plots, then to portray them in other proportions. </p><p>  For example, a single rose is suitable for postcards, and combining a bouquet, we get a mini-picture.  First, embroider the rose strictly according to the pattern, and then experiment with the dimensions of the parts and the technique. </p><p>  Petals, spikes, sepals are embroidered according to the type of corners, leaves like ovals, stems and some lines are made with a simple ‚Äúback with a needle‚Äù stitch.  Some masters first draw a background with the color scheme of plants, then the pattern complements the background.  Others work with technology, embroidering thin lines tightly together. </p><p>  To make sunflowers, embroider the middle with a ‚Äúlattice‚Äù, petals and leaves with arches.  In this case, divide the sheet into four corners to emphasize its width.  Using several shades of the same color, you can reflect the shady and sunny areas of the flower. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="stain patterns flowers" class="if" height="421" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/812335.jpg" width="288"></div>

    <h2>  Animal world </h2><p>  The classic of any needlework is monochrome.  It is no exception and <span>sinking.</span>  <span>Pattern schemes</span> can be borrowed from cross-stitch.  <span>Take the black</span> cardboard, on the wrong side draw a swan floating on the water.  Draw the waves.  Now divide the bird into parts.  You can immediately draw shapes of different sizes to fill the bird completely.  Then on a black background you get a white swan.  The finer the patterns are embroidered, the more accurately the embroidery is obtained. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="work in the technique of sifting schemes for beginners" class="if" height="371" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/812315.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Here's a little tip if you haven‚Äôt found the schemes, and the finished picture is not clear.  Print the plot on a color printer, pick up the threads.  Glue the picture from the inside, embroider from the background.  If finances allow, make a finished print on canvas. </p><p>  In many animals, most of the details are filled with regular stitches.  For example, a cow‚Äôs ears, tail, legs, udder are made with strokes.  The torso, head, eyes, nose, face - are embroidered according to the type of circumference.  At the same time, you make eyes and nose on top of the embroidered muzzle.  Embroider horns like arcs. </p><h2>  Varieties of work </h2><p>  Nowadays, masters present different ways of sinking.  Professionals describe the schemes of paintings in books.  Pictures not only embroider on cardboard, but also return to old traditions.  A beautiful fabric is pulled onto the board, a pattern is attached, and decorative nails are driven into the points.  The paper is removed, and threads are wound around the carnations.  In this case, the paintings from different sides create a new image. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern art" class="if" height="257" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/812322.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Even if you connect two circles on four pillars using the isonity technique, you will get an unusual ‚Äúhourglass‚Äù.  Use shiny, <span>metallic threads</span> in this variation <span>.</span>  The interweaving of geometric shapes is used to create flowers and ganuteli.  Only wire is used instead of nails and warp. </p><p>  When creating complex pictures on cardboard, place the dots next to each other.  Needles take beaded.  It will take a long time to embroider, but the plot will be realistic.  And many more professionals create their own patterns.  First, draw a sketch on paper, put dots, draw lines, numbering them.  Then embroider the resulting template and look at the result. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sieve patterns for beginner paintings" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/812324.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Brief conclusions </h2><p>  If embroidery on the canvas seems complicated, then master the isonia (patterns for beginners).  You will not find pictures with a complex drawing describing the manufacturing technology.  But as soon as you master the embroidery of the basic elements, you will be able to work the masters and even ordinary photos into pieces.  Try your hand at new needlework and delight others with your work. </p>
