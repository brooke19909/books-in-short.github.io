He is busy at 60%.  It was decided to clean the hard drive from games, as a result of which the load indicator fell to 35%.  What happens in this case?  Are files deleted?  Purely nominal - yes.  But here there are two types of deletion: with the possibility of quick recovery and with the absence thereof.  What is the difference between them?

    <p>  Under the possibility of quick recovery, it is understood that the file, document or folder will be moved to the trash.  A place is reserved for them (that is, nothing will be recorded in their place), and returning them back is a matter of a few clicks.  If the file does not fit into the trash or it has been emptied, then they become deleted files of the second type.  They are on the computer, but at any time any other programs can be written in their place.  And then the deleted files will cease to exist at all.  To receive documents of the second type, special programs are used.  But it should be borne in mind that their restoration is not a quick matter. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About the mobile operating system </h2><p>  How to recover deleted files on android?  A tool program created for this case will be able to help if the documents were not erased by something else.  But first of all, experts can advise you to buy an SD card, which will make backup copies of everything important for you.  As a similar tool, you can stop at the Tenorshare Android Data Recovery tool (or search for a similar application for functionality and convenience). </p><h2>  What to do? </h2>

To do this, the application must be run as administrator on your PC.  Then connect the media to the computer.

Highlight the desired media and press the Start button to start scanning.  Select what interests you and click on Recover.  Is it possible to preempt this?  Yes, use the Dumpster program for this.  It works according to the example of the basket, that is, it allows you to quickly recover deleted files from your android phone.  Let's look at a few applications that can perform the actions we need.

There will be no problems with this, since the program has the Russian language.  It will be able to return deleted files, however, only those that were originally formatted in fat.  But almost all mobile devices work on this system, so no problems should arise.  The application provides a filter, depending on the type of file.  Even more - here you can search for specific documents (if you remember their names).  But in order for the program to work and perform its functions, superuser rights must be available on the mobile device.

    <p>  An important condition for success is the prompt <span>recovery of lost data</span> using the utility.  Given that mobile devices do not have a large amount of memory, it may not be possible to get files back completely or even partially if measures were taken after a considerable time.  The program works directly on the phone or tablet.  You can also download it from the available app stores.  At startup, before recovering deleted files from the phone (android), you must give a positive response to the request for granting superuser rights. <strong></strong></p><h2>  GT Recovery for Android </h2>

It also works directly on the mobile device itself.  For its operation, it is necessary to obtain superuser rights.  Feedback on this program allows you to formulate a positive opinion about it.  Speaking about how to recover deleted files on Android, an important fact should be noted.  People believe that the scanning and data retrieval tools in this application are excellent.  Therefore, it can find what others have failed.

    <h2>  7-Data Android Recovery </h2><p>  This is another program that is fully Russified and allows you to recover previously deleted files.  True, it works with a computer via a USB cable.  Initially, it will be necessary to scan the data storage area to determine what can be restored.  But claims are being made to this program, saying that she does not want to save it in Russian-language directories. </p><p>  Also, individuals had problems trying to save information immediately on a mobile device.  It is solved by transferring data to a computer, and already from it - to a phone or tablet.  Well, now you know how to recover deleted files on Android and what software tools can help in this matter.  Of course, you can search for something else on your own, but those applications that were mentioned in the article perform their functions well. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

In conclusion, I would like to once again recommend not ignoring the proposal to install a program that will play the role of a basket.  A feature of the software offered for mobile operating systems is that they allow you to quickly restore the necessary documents at the first need.  But if files disappear from these "baskets", this is forever.
