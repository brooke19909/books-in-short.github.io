    <h2>  Maravel Land Beach Hotel (Crete) - reviews, shortcomings </h2><p>  Unfortunately, despite the many positive reviews in the hotel, there are some disadvantages.  Here are some negative points that guests mention: </p><ul><li>  when checking in the rooms do not take into account the special wishes of the guests, which were indicated at the time of booking; </li><li>  maids rarely change towels and bed linen, strictly adhering to the schedule established in the hotel (and even good tips do not save the situation); </li><li>  not all balconies have a rope stretched to dry clothes; </li><li>  there is no pan or side in the shower, and therefore water spills over the entire bathroom; </li><li>  to bring soap and shampoo to your bathroom, you have to leave notes for the maids; </li><li>  in restaurants and bars, very expensive alcohol (in a nearby supermarket drinks are 2 times cheaper); </li><li>  paid sunbeds and umbrellas on the beach; </li><li>  slippery slabs are located at the entrance to the sea, which can be hit hard in case of a fall; </li><li>  unfortunately, wireless Internet catches well only near the reception (in some parts of the garden you can use the network of a neighboring hotel); </li><li>  the staff carefully listens to the guests' requests, but quickly forgets about them; </li><li>  To use the air conditioning and in-room safe, an additional charge is required; </li><li>  food is pretty monotonous. </li></ul><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  Travelers who are accustomed to five- and four-star services, at first are afraid to go to the Maravel Land Beach Hotel 3 *.  Nevertheless, a pleasant surprise awaits them.  At the entrance, guests are greeted by polite employees who quickly and without any delay carry out the registration procedure.  The traditional Cretan design of the apartment creates a cozy homely atmosphere, which is simply ideal for families.  Furniture and plumbing in satisfactory condition. </p><p>  Of course, the hotel has a lot of shortcomings.  This is poorly functioning wireless Internet, and monotonous food, and a rare replacement of bed linen, and employee oversights.  Nevertheless, their open smile and friendly attitude towards guests fully compensate for all the flaws.  The only thing that is really lacking is entertainment.  Evening animation shows are held exclusively on Thursdays.  All the rest of the time, guests have to entertain themselves. </p>
