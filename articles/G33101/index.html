In Greece you can spend unforgettable time with the whole family, alone or with friends.  Enjoy Greek cuisine and hospitality, broaden your horizons on countless excursions, engage in active leisure activities or take a walk on a snow-white yacht along the Greek islands.  Well, and, of course, people from all over the world come here for beach vacations.  You can bask in the southern sun and enjoy sunbathing on one of the largest Greek islands - Crete.  One of the most wonderful and diverse beaches of Greece is the beaches of Heraklion (the main prefecture of Crete).  Details are provided below. </p><h2>  Crete, Heraklion Prefecture </h2><p>  The large island of Crete is one of the most popular holiday destinations in Greece.  This is due to the fact that tourism infrastructure is well developed here.  There are two international airports, modern convenient motorways.  It offers beautiful hotels of all categories and price levels, luxury villas and affordable hotels, snow-white yachts and all kinds of water activities.  And, of course, the best beaches.  All this, together with the rich history, myths of ancient Greece and a huge number of architectural artifacts annually attracts thousands of tourists to Crete.  And if the beach season here lasts from June to September, then the tourist season is all year round.  The indigenous people call themselves not Greeks, but Cretans, which underlines the certain isolation of their native island and its identity. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The city of Heraklion is the capital of the island of Crete and at the same time the main city of one of the four prefectures of Crete.  A city with a very ancient history, however, everything is in Greece.  Over its long life, Heraklion repeatedly collapsed almost to the ground and was reborn again.  The last barbaric destruction occurred during World War II during aerial bombardment.  After this tragedy, the city was rebuilt, but, unfortunately, it lost part of its original charm.  The city became the capital of Crete in 1971.  The population of Heraklion is about 140 thousand people.  The number of holidaymakers in the season is many times higher than this figure.  Speaking about the beauty and sights of this place, it is necessary to say separately about its famous beaches.  The beaches of Heraklion have a total length of about 40 kilometers, are very popular.  They are considered one of the best in Greece and the cleanest in the world. </p><h2>  Beach Features </h2><p>  The beautiful beaches of Heraklion have repeatedly been awarded the European Union's highest Blue Flag award for impeccable environmental performance.  The distinctive features of the beaches include: </p><ul><li>  purity of water and sand, general grooming and comfort; </li><li>  maximum preservation of the primordial nature; </li><li>  high level of service and leisure infrastructure; </li><li>  a huge variety of shapes and sizes: sandy and pebble, large and small, sheltered in bays and open, surrounded by coniferous forests and palm groves; </li><li>  free entrance to municipal beaches (the fee is taken only for beach equipment, but quite high). </li></ul>

The beaches near Heraklion are located in the northern part of the island, the southern beaches are approximately 100 kilometers from the capital.  The northern coast is washed by the Aegean Sea, the southern coast by the Mediterranean.  In this article, you can also see photos of the beaches of Heraklion. </p><h2>  Popular beaches on the north coast </h2><p>  On the northern coast of Crete Heraklion Prefecture, beaches are the most popular among tourists and almost always crowded.  In total, there are more than 10 famous beaches.  Northern beaches are mostly sandy, with a long shallow strip.

In the north are beaches: Paleokastro, Amoudara, Kokkini Hani, Gouves, Hersonissos, Agia Pelagia, Ligaria. </p>

    <p>  <em>Amudara</em> - this is five kilometers of gorgeous fine sea sand, a comfortable flat bottom, a gentle entry into the water.  Feature: at some distance from the coast there is an underwater rock ridge that protects the beach from high waves, acting as a natural breakwater.  The beach service provides vacationers with everything necessary (umbrellas, sunbeds, deck chairs).  The rescue service is working.  Nearby is a developed network of <span>restaurants, bars</span> and hotels. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  <em>Paleokastro</em> is good because it is easy to reach, as the main island motorway passes nearby.  This beach is small pebble, with a rather steep descent into the water.  The beach is small in size, very cozy, there are restaurants and small hotels nearby.  Many tourists like to spend time here. </p><p>  <em>Gouves</em> is a modern fashionable beach in Heraklion (Greece) with a highly developed entertainment infrastructure.  Very suitable for those who are accustomed to comfort and convenience.  Near the beach there is a beautiful promenade with many cafes and restaurants.  The entrance to the sea is convenient, but in windy weather there are high waves.  Very crowded and fun place. </p><h2>  Popular beaches on the south coast </h2><p>  The south coast is on the opposite side of the island from Heraklion.  Here the infrastructure is less developed, less crowded.  But the authorities deliberately hinder the development of the tourism business in this area, trying to preserve the natural integrity of these places, their originality.  This area is characterized by high rocky shores with fancy bays and pebble beaches.  The most famous ‚Äúwild‚Äù beaches are also here. </p>

    <p>  <em>Matala</em> is a very beautiful beach, sheltered from the strong winds by cliffs.  Sandy <span>shore, gentle</span> entry into the water.  This place is also famous for its special healing microclimate.  Matala is always crowded, largely due to the beautiful high cliff that borders the beach on one side.  Ancient legends and modern stories are connected with this rock.  On its slope there are many caves located on natural stone tiers.  It is believed that they were cut down by people in ancient times for living.  Later, caves were used for burial.  In the 60s of the twentieth century, these stone rooms were chosen by hippies.  Now the caves are empty, but open every day for everyone to visit. </p><p>  <em>Makriyalos</em> is a well-equipped beach for relaxing with a convenient entry into the sea.  From here you can take a small trip to the islands of Chrysi and Koufonisi by boat. </p><h2>  Heraklion White Sand Beaches </h2><p>  The beautiful beaches here are so diverse that everyone will find a place to their liking.  For example, the color of sand on beaches can be golden, pink, yellow, gray, even black.  Of particular admiration is the beauty of white beach sand.  It was on the white beaches of Crete that advertised famous chocolate. </p><p>  <em>Kedrodasos</em> - a beach with white sand surrounded by a healing cedar forest and juniper.  White sand gives a special azure color to sea water, this effect invariably causes delight.  This place is quite popular thanks to the sea air, filled with the smell of pine needles, which together creates a unique cocktail. </p><p>  <em>Kolokita</em> is a small beach with absolutely white sand and many lush trees, in the shade of which you can hide in the intense heat.  This beach can be reached only on foot, leaving the car at a sufficient distance from the sea, at the nearest monastery. </p><p>  <em>Platanias</em> is the largest beach in Crete, with white sand spreading over four kilometers. </p><h2>  Red beach, pink island </h2><p>  <em>Red Beach</em> or Kokkini Ammos is a very picturesque place that attracts many tourists.  Its feature is the red color of sand, which gives the beach a fabulous, fantastic look.  This resting place is protected from all sides by cliffs from the wind.  Nearby is the most popular <span>nudist beach</span> in Crete <span>.</span> </p>

    <p>  In Crete, they say that if you did not see Elafonisi, then you did not see anything.  <em>Elafonisi</em> is a beach on a small island where you can wade.  Incredible beauty is amazing here, and magical landscapes open up.  Transparent turquoise water, sand pink from small shells, the sea is calm, gentle, shallow and warm.  This paradise is very popular among visitors to the island.  Therefore, it is always crowded here. </p><h2>  "Wild" beaches </h2><p>  The beaches of Heraklion, untouched by civilization, are located mainly on the south coast.  These pristine corners of nature are sometimes difficult to access, they do not have the usual service and crowds of vacationers.  But they are definitely worthy of getting to them and seeing with their own eyes.  The already mentioned <span>island of Chrysi is</span> perhaps the only crowded corner, because of its accessibility.  There are no hotels and restaurants, but endemic and cedar forests are growing.  The island itself is part of the Natura 2000 environmental program. </p><p>  <em>Tripiti</em> is a small pebble beach with crystal clear water, located 70 kilometers from Heraklion.  The beach is located in a narrow gorge, where guests will find the only tavern with national cuisine.  Very picturesque place. </p><p>  <em>Agiofarango</em> is a beach formed in the gorge of the same name overlooking the sea.  This is a very beautiful bay, closed on all sides by rocks.  Quiet and very clean place.  You can get there either by boat or on foot, passing through the gorge. </p><p>  <em>Wati</em> is one of the most remote beaches in Heraklion.  It is a small piece of land, into which a narrow sea bay deeply cuts.  Getting to Vati is difficult both by land and by water.  But, if you overcome these difficulties, you can spend unforgettable time in complete solitude and fusion with nature. </p><h2>  The most popular beaches among tourists </h2><p>  All the beaches of Crete, Heraklion, including, are good in their own way and have their own unique features.  This article has already mentioned many of them.  Among the popular and very beautiful corners of nature there are several more. </p>

If you are planning to spend your vacation in Greece, you can first see photos of the beaches of Heraklion and Crete, which will be located closest to the place of residence on vacation.  But, in fact, which beach is next to the hotel does not really matter.  Crete, although large, is still an island, and by Russian standards, the distances here are small. </p>

    <p>  Tourists note that in one day you can easily visit several beaches, both on the North coast and on the South.  It often happens that on one side there is inclement weather, clouds and wind, and on the other - the sun shines brightly and the azure water gently splashes.  Also, all tourists who visited Crete, note the exceptional purity of the water and beaches of Crete.  Some say that Cretan waters are the cleanest in Greece.  And also, almost all the guests of Crete note the special leisurely atmosphere of the bliss reigning here.  No one is in a hurry, no one is nervous or annoyed.  Tourists note that in Crete you can safely walk at any time of the day, everywhere you meet friendliness and cordiality. </p><p>  If you add here the picturesque natural landscapes that open literally everywhere, the ‚Äúhighlight‚Äù of the local architecture, the special hospitality of the Cretans, you will get the wonderful island of Crete.  An island covered in ancient legends and myths.  According to tourists, when they first arrived in Crete, at first a lot is not clear, some local features of the service are even a little annoying.  The longer you stay on the island, the more and more you begin to accept it.  Then comes love, and I don‚Äôt want to leave anymore.  Crete is a place where you always want to return. </p>
