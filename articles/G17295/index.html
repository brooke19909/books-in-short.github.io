    <h2>  Features of the case and design </h2><p>  Customers who primarily focus on the design of mobile devices praised the SGH-i900.  Samsung has rightfully become a rival to the iPhone.  Outwardly, the device looked great.  Experts noticed that Korean manufacturers continued the minimalist tradition set by Apple. </p><p>  The case of the new model is made of two materials: plastic and metal.  The latter is used to design the front panel.  Staying in more detail on it, it is worth noting that the screen does not have a protective coating, its surface is quite easily soiled.
