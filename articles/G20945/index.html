Our capital has about a thousand churches and chapels.  However, not only ancient temples adorn the city and the region, new ones are also being erected.  Most recently, in 2007, a cathedral was consecrated in honor of St. George the Victorious in Odintsovo, <span>Moscow Region.</span>  The temple was built on the 50th anniversary of the city on the initiative of A.G. Gladyshev  - Heads of the city of Odintsovo. </p><h2>  Church of St. George in Odintsovo </h2><p>  The new cathedral was erected in the Russian style.  It has two upper floors and a semi-basement space, a bell tower with a set of bells with a total weight of 18.5 tons.  Now Odintsovo covers the ringing of bells. </p>

    <p>  During the construction and decoration of the Church of St. George the Victorious in Odintsovo, ancient styles were used in combination with new technologies.  The first floor (semi-basement) is made in the ancient Byzantine style of white stone.  The iconostasis of the second floor is executed in the style of the Moscow <span>icon painter Dionysius,</span> who lived in the 15th century, the successor of the traditions of Andrei Rublev.  The iconostasis of the upper floor is made in the later Baroque and Empire style, masters from Palekh worked on its parts.  Stained-glass windows of the upper floor with images of saints are made using new technologies from real alloys. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Patron saints of the temple </h2><p>  The Church of St. George the Victorious in Odintsovo has many holy patrons.  The lower floor is dedicated to the Prophet and Baptist John the Baptist.  And it is no coincidence, because the font is here and the Sacrament of Baptism takes place. </p><p>  The middle floor has a throne in honor of the icon of the Virgin "Iverskaya", which will be discussed below, as well as chapels in honor of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker and St. Rev. Sergius of Radonezh. </p><p>  On the upper floor there is a throne in honor of the holy great martyr George the Victorious, aisles in honor of the holy Rev. Alexander Svirsky and the holy martyr Tatiana. </p><h2>  Iveron Icon of the Blessed Virgin Mary </h2><p>  The history of the <span>Iveron Icon of the Mother of God</span> begins in the 9th century.  At this time, in Byzantium, Emperor Theophilus ruled, who fell into the heresy of iconoclasm.  Throughout the country, his swordsmen seized icons from the inhabitants for burning.  In the house of one pious woman, the soldiers hit the Virgin‚Äôs icon with a sword, but real blood flowed from the cheek of the Most Holy Theotokos.  The warriors were frightened and left the house, and the woman decided to save the icon by releasing it into the sea.  And a miracle also happened here, the icon did not lie on the water, but remained in an upright position. </p><p>  The woman‚Äôs son subsequently went to the monastery on Mount Athos, where he spoke about the miracle that happened with the icon.  This story is preserved in the monastery.  And now, 170 years after the miracle revealed, the icon appeared on the shore of the Iversky Monastery on Mount Athos.  She sailed in a pillar of fire, also in an upright position. </p><p>  Only after fervent prayer did one of the monks, who had a revelation in a dream, be able to take the icon.  In revelation, the Virgin ordered him to follow the icon on the water, which he completed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  And another miracle happened after gaining the shrine.  The icon placed in the temple several times appeared on the gates of the monastery.  The brethren returned her to the temple, until the Queen of Heaven herself in a vision said about her will to be the keeper of the monastery.  Therefore, the Iveron Icon is called the goalkeeper. </p><p>  She repeatedly saved the monastery, many miracles and healings came from this shrine.  The icon is simply hung with many gifts brought in gratitude for the prayers that were heard both from ordinary people and from royal families.  There are offerings of Russian tsars. </p><p>  There is a legend according to which, before the end of the world, the icon will leave Mount Athos.  Therefore, the shrine itself since its acquisition has not left the monastery.  But many lists from her were sent by monks to all parts of the world. </p><p>  The Church of St. George the Victorious in Odintsovo has a throne consecrated in honor of the Iveron Icon of the Mother of God. </p>

    <h2>  St. George the Victorious </h2><p>  It is impossible not to say about the saint, in whose honor the Church of St. George the Victorious was built in Odintsovo.  Patron of warriors and farmers, the great martyr George - one of the favorite saints in Russia.  Memorial Day has always been especially honored by the Russian people.  St. George's Day is a confirmation of this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of St. George in Odintsovo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/36765/1899760.jpg" width="371"></div>

    <p>  According to the code of laws of the Russian state of the 15th century, peasants had the right to transfer from one feudal lord to another a week before and a week after the day of celebrating the memory of St. George the Victorious.  It is amazing how in Russia state laws were united with faith. </p>
