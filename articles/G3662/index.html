Also, there are no documentary sources that would clearly indicate what responsibilities were assigned to them.  It is only known that these are advisers close to the prince, who assisted in resolving issues of national importance. </p><p>  The Boyar Duma is a permanent council under the prince, solving the highest zemstvo issues.  His activity was of a legislative nature.  The composition, in addition to the boyars, included warriors, and sometimes also representatives of the higher clergy. </p><p>  The Boyar Duma solved the main issues of <span>governance, foreign</span> policy, legislation and the court.  At the same time, they were discussed together with the prince (king).  Competence, rights and obligations have not been determined.  As a rule, several people attended the council, but if the most important issues were discussed, the meeting was held in an expanded format.  The Duma participated in resolving issues of a religious and legislative nature, an internal state system, and foreign policy. </p><p>  The leadership of the assembly was carried out by the prince (tsar), he also approved the decisions taken.  And in case of his absence, these functions were provided to them by an authorized boyar.  When solving a common issue, the princes of several lands could hold joint meetings.  The Boyar Duma was closely connected with the prince until it consisted for the most part of warriors who moved with him from place to place.  Then, after strengthening the zemstvo element, it gained greater independence. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Until the 15th century, the Boyar Duma met as necessary.  Subsequently, it became a permanent deliberative body, which included the Duma clerks, the boyars, the deceased, the Duma nobles.  The former were in charge of paperwork and drafted decisions.  They were entrusted with embassy, ‚Äã‚Äãlocal and discharge affairs.  The clever clerk was the lowest rank on the council. </p><p>  The court rank "okolnichy" existed in the Russian state from the 13th to the 18th century.  Initially, their functions included the device of travel of the prince, participation in negotiations with ambassadors.  Okolichny was the second duma rank after the boyar.  Persons holding this position were appointed regimental governors, heads of orders, they took part in the organization of court ceremonies. </p><p>  The intelligent nobleman was the third senior official.  They controlled orders, were appointed governors, performed military and court duties, and participated in meetings of the Duma.  Their number was small, as a rule, they belonged to generous surnames. </p><p>  At the beginning of the 17th century (1606), Prince Vasily Shuisky, nicknamed the boyar, was ‚Äúshouted out‚Äù at the <span>Zemsky Cathedral</span> for reign.  In order to secure the support of the Duma, or at least somehow weaken its hostile attitude toward itself, the new tsar decided to meet the claims of the aristocracy and incur a number of obligations.  In this regard, he took the oath in the form of a ‚Äúcross-kissing record‚Äù, in which he promised that he would not: judge without the Duma, impose disgraces without good reason, take property from the families of the executed.  Thus, the king‚Äôs power was limited.  Nevertheless, the obligations in practice were often not fulfilled.  At the same time, some historians regard the oath of Vasily Shuisky as the first step towards creating a rule of law. </p><p>  The boyar king had few supporters, often changed his allies and views.  He justified his rights to the throne by the antiquity of a kind.  However, the people did not trust him.  He enjoyed neither authority nor love, since his word could not be trusted.  This was precisely the reason for his overthrow, which occurred on July 17, 1610. </p><p>  The Boyar Duma lasted until the reign of <span>Peter I,</span> in particular until 1711, when the Senate was formed. </p>
