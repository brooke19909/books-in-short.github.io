Reviews about this place contain the following negative comments: </p><ul><li>  the rooms in the main building are very old, and therefore require repair and furniture replacement; </li><li>  to get to the beach, you need to cross the roadway (it‚Äôs good that it is not very busy, and also pleases the presence of an underground passage); </li><li>  despite the fact that many rooms have sea views, in fact, you can consider only a small strip of water; </li><li>  strong audibility between numbers; </li><li>  hotel staff do not speak Russian and do not understand it (before the trip you need to learn a few phrases in English or take a phrase book with you); </li><li>  very shallow pools (depth is only 120 cm); </li><li>  for beach towels, a deposit of 10 euros is required; </li><li>  animation, including for children, only in English, French and Greek; </li><li>  paid sunbeds and umbrellas on the beach;  rocky entry into the water; </li><li>  the main restaurant does not serve coffee and tea (you have to go to the bar for hot drinks). </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Cosmopolitan Hotel 4 * is a quiet and peaceful hotel for Europeans.  Given that there are few tourists from the CIS countries here, without knowledge of foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äãyou will not be able to join a large company.  Nevertheless, for many, it is this factor that is decisive in choosing this institution.  It has everything you need for a good rest.  And the proximity to infrastructure and tourist facilities will allow you to organize interesting leisure.  Thus, if you are an active traveler, you simply do not pay attention to the outdated number of rooms.  If you are sensitive to shortcomings, you should not save on accommodation (stay in more expensive renovated apartments). </p>
