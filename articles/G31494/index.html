They appreciated rather reasonable prices for permits, friendliness of locals who were not spoiled by tourists, magnificent beaches and luxury hotels.  All this, of course, is in other Asian countries, but Vietnam, according to tourists, attracts and captivates with some innocence and naivety.  It is as if you are getting to know a child who is trustingly ready to tell you about all his treasures and share them. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lucky Star 2 Hotel" class="if" height="255" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1721925.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Holidays in Vietnam: a few reasons for this country </h2><p>  So, if you are embarrassed by a trip to Asia or you do not consider yourself a category of people who are easily ready to experiment with their own vacation, then read our article and perhaps you will start planning a trip to Vietnam in the near future. </p><p>  First of all, the country attracts with a low cost of tours.  Rest for two people for a period of ten days will cost the Russians about fifty to sixty thousand rubles.  This price includes a transfer from the airport, which is quite tiring for tourists. </p><p>  Hotels in Vietnam provide a very high level of service even with a small number of stars.  For example, Lucky <span>Star Beach Hotel 2 *</span> reviews of our compatriots always cause extremely positive, despite the fact that he is only a "twosome."  This is a distinctive feature of Vietnam - small hotel complexes with two or three stars are ready to surround their guests with vigilant attention and fully satisfy all their requirements.  That is why in the country you can relax quite cheaply and safely. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>The beaches of Vietnam</span> can not be described - they are simply incomparable!  Almost all travelers who have at least once rested in this Asian country know this.  The main beaches of Vietnam are clean and stretch for many kilometers.  Almost all of them are state owned and are well equipped.  Absolutely anyone will like a beach holiday here, because in many resorts of the country there is a gentle entrance to the water, and the sandy bottom is ideal for kids. </p><p>  It is known that many tourists are afraid to eat in Asia in street cafes.  And, we assure you, they do it in vain.  You just need to know exactly in what places it will be safe to eat.  Typically, those establishments that are located near hotels work well.  Lucky Star 2 * Hotel, for example, has an excellent cozy cafe opposite the entrance, where you can taste both national and European dishes.  Of course, the prices in such cafes are slightly higher than in more distant places, but still the establishments near the hotels are the safest in Vietnam. </p><p>  The excursion program in the country is quite diverse.  Tourists can provide trips to historical places, as well as a number of recreational excursions that will please extreme people. </p><h2>  The best resorts in Vietnam </h2><p>  Where are the best beaches and hotels?  This question primarily concerns tourists, so we are in a hurry to answer it.  There are a lot of resorts in Vietnam, the direction of your trip will directly depend on the time of year and financial opportunities.  But most often, Russians go to the following heavenly corners of the country: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Danang. </li><li>  Nha Trang. </li><li>  Dalat. </li><li>  Phan Thiet and Mui Ne. </li></ul><p>  In recent years, almost in all of the above resorts you can find signs and menus in Russian, and the receptionists have already learned to understand a little broken English by Russian tourists.  Most often, our compatriots opt for Nha Trang.  Why, let's try to find out. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lucky Star Beach Hotel 2" class="if" height="258" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1721926.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Nha Trang: the best resort of Vietnam </h2><p>  Nha Trang is considered the tourist capital of the country, Russians love to relax here and praise this amazing place in every way.  Of course, this resort can please the inhabitants of our country yearned for sea and sun.  Three <span>beaches of Nha Trang</span> are considered one of the best in the country, and the bay is successfully covered by islands and is ideal for diving.  Moreover, it is in this resort that the best diving schools are located on the entire coast. </p><p>  In addition to beach activities, Nha Trang is ready to please holidaymakers with an entire island, which houses the huge entertainment center Winperl.  You can get here by cable car, stretching directly from the port.  Many tourists consider it a bright attraction of the resort. </p><p>  If you decide to go on vacation to Nha Trang, then choose the hotel.  Best for a family with kids, Lucky Star Hotel 2 * (Nha Trang) is suitable.  Reviews of tourists about this hotel complex allow you to confidently recommend it to other travelers.  So that you can make your own opinion about this hotel, try to talk about it in more detail. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lucky Star Hotel 2 Nha Trang" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1721969.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Hotel location and some nuances of booking </h2><p>  Lucky Star 2 * Hotel is located in a very convenient location.  It is only thirty-five kilometers from Kamran International Airport; for Vietnam, this is a fairly short distance. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the Lucky Star 2 * Hotel is located at a distance of one hundred eighty meters from one of the best beaches in the resort.  It is this fact that often becomes decisive when choosing this hotel complex by our compatriots.  And other advantages of the hotel open to them a little later, and become a real surprise. </p><p>  If you travel to Vietnam on your own, and not as part of a group, you should know that the hotel can be booked online or already upon arrival at the place.  In this case, you can get to the desired place by bus or taxi.  You only need to tell the driver the name of the hotel complex and its address - Lucky Star Hotel 2 *, Nha Trang 96B / 1/8.  This will be enough to get you where you need to. </p><p>  If you will book a hotel via the Internet, then be extremely careful and do not confuse it with other similar ones.  For example, there is Lucky Star Beach Hotel 2 *, South Goa.  It is an independent hotel complex, which has nothing to do with the hotel we are describing.  But inexperienced tourists quite often get confused in the nuances of booking and focus only on the name. </p><h2>  Lucky Star Hotel 2 *, <span>Nha Trang (Vietnam):</span> hotel description </h2><p>  The hotel belongs to the category of small hotel complexes, but this is precisely its advantage, which is highly appreciated by all guests.  At the initial inspection of Lucky Star 2 * Hotel, vacationers are confused by the fact that the sea is across the street from the hotel.  But in the future, this trifle ceases to matter, because guests receive a fairly high level of service, which not every hotel with a large number of stars can provide. </p><p>  The hotel itself is a multi-storey building, which has virtually no own territory.  It is extremely limited and does not differ in green spaces.  But next to the hotel there is an excellent park with pools and entertainment, so most of the guests of Lucky Star Beach Hotel 2 * go to rest in this particular park.  Some tourists prefer to spend almost all their time at sea, so they don‚Äôt even notice the absence of their own territory near the hotel. </p><p>  A big plus of the Lucky Star Hotel 2 * (Nha Trang) is its proximity to the city center and bus stops.  Leaving the hotel, you can easily reach almost anywhere in the resort, which is very convenient for those who are traveling for the first time in the country.  Although it is impossible not to clarify that many who lived in Lucky Star Hotel 2 * (Vietnam), the reviews left quite negative about the construction under the windows of the room.  But this fact worried only that part of the guests who were not lucky enough to get a room with a view of the courtyard or the sea. </p><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  For a two-star hotel, Lucky Star Beach Hotel 2 * copes quite well with its duties.  Of course, he cannot please the vacationers with a large number of restaurants and bars, but the quality of the services provided can completely cover this disadvantage. </p><p>  From all that our compatriots usually expect, Lucky Star Hotel 2 * (Vietnam) can offer guests one restaurant, reception, elevator and a large parking lot.  For spoiled tourists this will not be enough, but those Russians who pay special attention when planning their holidays on the ratio of "price-quality", the hotel seems to be just a great option for living. </p><h2>  Hotel Accommodation Features </h2><p>  Lucky Star Hotel 2 * (Nha Trang) settles guests after two in the afternoon.  In some cases, when the number is free, administrators can make concessions to you and settle you much earlier than the deadline.  Please note that pets are not allowed in the room rules.  If this fact is concealed, the guest will have to pay a fine and vacate the occupied room. </p><p>  Check-out is carried out before twelve o'clock in the afternoon, by this time the hotel guests must pay all bills and remove their belongings from the room.  Please note that tourists can only pay in cash.  No one will accept bank cards at Lucky Star Beach Hotel 2 *.  Therefore, when checking into the room, have a small amount of cash on hand. </p><p>  Many of our compatriots who rested at Lucky Star Hotel 2 * always leave positive feedback on the work of the reception.  Hotel guests note that the administrators are always friendly, ready to answer any question and even understand a little Russian.  Moreover, this is quite a rarity among the Vietnamese, they are usually extremely difficult given the Russian language. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lucky Star Hotel 2 Vietnam reviews" class="if" height="232" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1721965.jpg" width="457"></div></h2><h2>  Service in the hotel complex </h2><p>  We already mentioned that the hotel staff at any time of the day or night in the highest class serves guests staying at the Lucky Star Hotel 2 *, Nha Trang.  Reviews of tourists about their pastime in the hotel allow us to conclude that the hotel is able in the near future to get at least one star more. </p><p>  In the rooms of the hotel complex you can always use free Wi-Fi and order dishes from the restaurant at any time.  If you need to exchange currency or rent a car for several days, you can always do this without leaving the hotel.  You can also just buy excursions in Nha Trang - a small bureau operates in the hotel complex, the staff of which, taking into account all the voiced wishes, will select several trips that can diversify your vacation. </p><p>  Dirty clothes can be sent to the laundry, but this service is paid separately at the hotel rate.  The maids will return you clean and ironed clothes (of course, for extra money).  Some tourists who travel to Asian countries prefer to take their basic things to the left luggage room.  At Lucky Star Beach Hotel 2 *, it is present, for a small fee your things will be stored securely throughout the entire stay in the room. </p><p>  Quite often, Russians vacationing at the hotel used the services of a ticket office.  Here you can buy tickets for a train, plane or for any concert.  All this can be done without even leaving the cozy reception. </p><h2>  Fun for kids </h2><p>  Unfortunately, children at the hotel will be bored.  There is no games room for them, and babysitting services are not even provided.  For children under twelve years of age, sharing a room in the same bed with parents will be free.  An extra bed is for children under sixteen.  Its cost and necessity is negotiated at the stage of booking a room. </p><p>  Despite the lack of playgrounds, families with children often stay at this hotel.  In addition to the beautiful green area, there is a water park nearby, where you can spend the whole day.  You can get to him in just fifteen minutes. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lucky Star Hotel 2 Nha Trang reviews" class="if" height="455" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1721964.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Hotel Rooms </h2><p>  The hotel consists of thirty-four rooms, each of which is in good condition, which is another significant argument in favor of choosing the Lucky Star Hotel 2 *.  Photos of tourists posted on the Internet confirm the fact that the hotel rooms have new furniture, appliances and plumbing.  In general, they create a rather favorable impression. </p><p>  The rooms are divided into four categories: </p><ul><li>  double standard, where on the territory of twenty-five square meters can accommodate two people; </li><li>  Superior double room has two beds and can accommodate two people; </li><li>  deluxe room has a sea view; </li><li>  the family room is the largest and can accommodate four people in two rooms. </li></ul><p>  Each room is well equipped, it has everything you need: </p><ul><li>  air conditioning; </li><li>  mini bar; </li><li>  bath accessories; </li><li>  bathrobes and slippers; </li><li>  bath set; </li><li>  plasma with satellite connection; </li><li>  safe. </li></ul><p>  Agree that for a hotel with two stars this is a rather extensive list.  And all this is new and works properly.  Rooms are cleaned daily, but according to Russian vacationers "in an Asian manner" - a bit superficially. </p><p>  In some cases, tourists were annoyed by wet towels and the obsessive smell of damp, but even the hotel guests themselves attributed this trouble to rainy weather outside.  Indeed, in <span>the rainy season in Vietnam it</span> can be very damp for several days in a row.  Hotel guests also note that maids can skip one day and do the cleaning, so at the reception you must indicate if you need a maid in your room today. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lucky Star Beach Hotel 2 reviews" class="if" height="178" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1721927.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Hotel beach </h2><p>  Lucky Star Beach Hotel 2 * does not have its own beach.  Hotel guests will need to go to the municipal beach, where a certain fee is set for sunbeds and umbrellas.  At the entrance to the beach, ticket offices are usually set up or special people are standing who keep records of free sunbeds. </p><p>  At the reception, vacationers can get beach towels and even a thermos, where it is convenient to make tea to take it with you.  Many tourists consider the best beach, which is located near the hotel Lucky Star Hotel 2 * (Vietnam).  Reviews about him leave quite often, mostly they are positive.  The sea within the beach is clean, and the sand is cleaned daily, so vacationers do not even see the garbage that is brought in by the waves. </p><p>  Some tourists in their comments clarify that the sea near the hotel is extremely turbulent.  But this fact is most likely due to the fact that from December to February frequent storms come to Nha Trang.  In another season, the sea is extremely calm and offers swimming. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lucky Star Hotel 2 Nha Trang reviews" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1721968.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Dining at the hotel complex </h2><p>  Some difficulties cause food issues at the hotel.  Indeed, quite often, room reservation is carried out according to the "no meal" system, in which case tourists are forced to eat outside the Lucky Star Beach Hotel 2 *.  Therefore, it is most convenient to book a room with breakfast, then you do not have to go in search of a suitable cafe from the very early morning. </p><p>  Breakfast at the hotel is buffet style, but tourists note that the choice of dishes is not too extensive.  Of course, you will not stay hungry, but you won‚Äôt get any pickles either.  For lunch and dinner, many hotel guests go to nearby cafes.  Our compatriots very much praise the institution, located literally around the corner of the hotel.  Delicious dishes are served there, and the serving size surprises even those who like to eat a lot. </p><p>  Keep in mind that all cafes within walking distance of Lucky Star Beach Hotel 2 * are open from seven in the morning until one in the morning, which allows tourists to eat during their entire stay in these establishments. </p><h2>  Hotel Lucky Star Hotel 2 *, Nha Trang: reviews </h2><p>  Collecting and summarizing all the hotel reviews is quite simple.  However, there are a lot of them on the Internet and most of them are identical.  This once again confirms the fact that the hotel complex is quite good and has no significant drawbacks. </p><p>  Basically, all travelers praise the equipment of the rooms and the good repair in them.  Surprisingly, in Lucky Star Beach Hotel 2 * there is no such problem as a loud air conditioning.  Experienced travelers quite often encounter this shortcoming even in five-star hotels, and here you can sleep peacefully all night and nothing will disturb your precious dream. </p><p>  The hotel staff deserves a special category of comments.  Tourists always speak of them with warmth and gratitude.  Indeed, with any problem you can come to the reception and in the shortest possible time it will be solved.  Quite often, maids and administrators do a lot of things that in other hotels will require additional payment.  This causes great sympathy among tourists who next time come back to this hotel. </p><p>  Of course, the construction site spoils the good impression of the hotel complex, and according to the latest reviews there are even two of them now.  But those who prefer to get up early and go to the beach, do not even feel her presence.  Of course, if you are sleepyhead and love not to open your eyes before dinner, this hotel is clearly not suitable for you. </p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In general, we can say that Lucky Star Beach Hotel 2 * is an excellent hotel complex, which can claim even a higher level of stardom. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here you will be provided with a good room, excellent service and will help you choose the most interesting and popular excursions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For two stars (and even more so in Asia) this hotel is surprisingly good and tidy, moreover, it is safe and calm. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And the combination of such factors is the key to a good rest.</font></font></p><p> But if you prefer to walk around the vast territory of the hotel, swim in the pool early in the morning, and live in a separate bungalow with sea views and private access to the beach, then you need to look for some more luxurious hotel.  Otherwise, Lucky Star Beach Hotel 2 * will disappoint you. </p><p>  Vietnam is a great place for any type of vacation.  You can come here as a family, alone or as part of a noisy company.  You can be sure that you will remember the days spent in this Asian country with warmth and love.  It‚Äôs simply impossible not to love Vietnam. </p>
