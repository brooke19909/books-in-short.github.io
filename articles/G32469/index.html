  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Breeding chickens: tasty, profitable, healthy!</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In our very difficult and full of various synthetic substitutes and GMOs, more and more people are trying to keep a private household.  Someone grows fruits and vegetables in the country, and someone breeds various <span>farm animals.</span>  After all, it is much nicer to pamper yourself and your family with home-made products than to buy the same products, but with a lot of additives and substitutes that are very harmful to people's health, and especially for a children's developing organism.  If you also want to change your life and eat only natural products, do not deny yourself such pleasure, start your own farm and live in harmony with nature. </p><p>  The main thing for yourself is to decide what exactly you want to do and what type of farm animals will be best bred at your place.  As in any other business, and in this, the most important thing is to find out as much information as possible that interests you.  Let's try to do it now.  If you choose between different types of pets, then very much in demand among farmers is <span>breeding chickens.</span>  Their content is convenient in that it does not require large investments and time-consuming.  Poultry for keeping is selected depending on what products they want to have.  After all, there is a meat, egg, meat and egg and decorative breed of chickens. </p><p>  You can also distinguish them by the type of laid eggs: with pink-brown and white shells.  It would not be superfluous to add that most farms give their preference to meat-egg breeds of chickens, since two types of product can be obtained from them: both eggs and meat.  They are also very hardy, calm and less picky about the conditions of detention.  Such chickens are slightly inferior to egg breeds in the number of laid eggs.  Although, on the other hand, their eggs are much larger, and basically have a mass of 60 to 64 g, therefore, breeding chicken laying hens is not always justified! </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Whatever breed you decide to grow, you need to know that with good feeding of chickens they can grow from 1.3 to 1.8 kg in just two months.  An adult chicken can have a mass of 3.3 to 4 kg, and a rooster up to 4.5 kg.  Such a mass of young animals will help a novice poultry breeder make some money for further development.  Indeed, without certain investments it is almost impossible to develop your own poultry farm and everyone knows about it! </p><p>  In order to make chicken breeding profitable, poultry houses are built from adobe or wood, but most importantly not from brick and stone, since such walls will accumulate moisture both in winter and in spring.  Additionally, the walls of the house can be insulated with various heaters, but indoors they must be whitewashed with lime.  To prepare such a solution, 100 grams of common table salt are taken per kilogram of slaked lime and stirred in 5 liters of water.  The floor can be made both from concrete, and from clay and wood, it is subsequently insulated with straw or sawdust.  As you can see, breeding chickens is not so troublesome as it might seem at first glance. </p><p>  Undoubtedly, an important aspect in the construction of the house is its location in relation to the sun.  Indeed, under the influence of sunlight, chickens produce the necessary and beneficial vitamin D for them, which is why it is desirable to have windows facing the sunny side in the building.  If there are no windows in the house, then it must be lit with electric lamps - without this, raising chickens is impossible.  And from autumn to spring, even poultry houses with windows still need to be lit with lamps, thereby increasing the length of the day to 12, and sometimes up to 14 hours a day.  Such measures, together with excellent nutrition, lead to the fact that chickens carry much more eggs.  It is also necessary to provide chickens with walking, for this purpose special walking yards with perches are built where the bird could rest. </p><p>  As for the feed, breeding chickens does not require special expenses.  The main food for them is grain, and they also enjoy eating green feeds, which are very rich in vitamins.  In any case, if you are interested in <span>breeding chickens,</span> then you can always find a lot of useful information on thematic forums.  There you will learn about those feeds that are most favorable to different breeds of chickens! </p>
