In fact, HB4 is a marking of the base used in a particular type of lamp.  Here we can add that with this type of base can be not only xenon, but also a halogen or LED lamp. </p><h2>  Lamp device </h2><p>  Naturally, the main purpose of the HB4 xenon lamp is the automotive industry.  However, their popularity is not limited to this at all.  In addition, due to some of its features, HB4 and HB3 gained great popularity in the creation of low beam headlights. </p><p>  As for the basis of the xenon lamp, it consists of a group of single-thread versions.  This suggests that in the overall construction of the cap is supposed to be only one filament.  To date, there are two-filament lamps.  Car headlights, as everyone knows, can give out not only dipped, but also high beams.  However, HB4 xenon lamps are used only for the dipped.  To equip the far, instances of HB3 are suitable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bombayharbor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="xenon lamp dimensions" class="if uuid-3110396" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/50398/3110396.jpg"></div><h2>  The principle of operation of xenon lamps </h2><p>  The basis of xenon lamps HB4 is a special gas.  Inside the product design there is a special module, when triggered, the gas ignites.  As for the main technical characteristics of such a gas discharge device, it is the color temperature.  After all, each indicator has its own specific color.  Suppose, with increasing temperature, a blue tint will manifest itself more, and brightness, on the contrary, will decrease.  As the temperature decreases, the HB4 xenon lamp will shine brighter, but at the same time yellow. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="alexnld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="yellow light spectrum" class="if uuid-3110403" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/50398/3110403.jpg"></div><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages of discharge lamps </h2><p>  There are several significant advantages that xenon lamps have over halogen ones.  Firstly, the heating of the optics lenses is minimal.  This means that the headlamp glass will not warm up so much that, in turn, it will facilitate washing, as dirt and debris will not stick too much. </p><p>  Secondly, xenon gives significant aesthetics to the car, so it is often used as a tuning.  Another important advantage is significantly lower energy consumption - at least 40%.  In this case, the glow will be brighter, which means that visibility will be better, which, of course, is a plus.  Xenon itself emits light with a warmer lighting spectrum, which will improve visibility in the dark, as well as during bad weather. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.protuninglab.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="xenon lamp lighting" class="if uuid-3110401" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/50398/3110401.jpg"></div><p>  However, they, like any other equipment, have their drawbacks. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  The first drawback is the cost.  The price of HB4 xenon lamps varies depending on the manufacturer, but it is still higher than that of halogen ones.  The price starts from about 250 rubles per lamp and can go up to 3000-4000 thousand rubles for a set of xenon devices. </li><li>  When a halogen light source fails, only it can be replaced.  With xenon this will not work due to the fact that during operation during heating the color of the light changes.  If you replace only one of them, the difference may be too noticeable.  Therefore, you have to change both sources. </li><li>  Installation of xenon lamps requires additional installation of a gas ignition unit, unlike halogen lamps. </li><li>  During power-up, you may notice that the response does not occur immediately.  When you turn on the main beam, dipped beam or fog lamps for the first time, if discharge lamps are also installed in them, you need to take into account the time required to ignite the gas. </li><li>  Often there is a problem with blinding other drivers while driving.  There are two reasons for this.  Either improper installation of lenses or poor-quality xenon, which happens quite often. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="alexnld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="4300k xenon lamps" class="if uuid-3110392" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/50398/3110392.jpg"></div><h2>  Xenon lamps 4300k and 5000k </h2><p>  It is worth paying attention to the common HB4 5000k xenon lamps.  It should be noted right away that a factor of 5000k is the color temperature.  The power of such a lamp from the manufacturer Sho-me is 35 watts.  Type of connector for installing KET.  As for the price, you will have to pay about 300 rubles for the HB4 5000k xenon lamp.  The warranty period of one headlight is 3000 hours.  It can also be noted here that this version of the xenon lamp is a good budget solution when replacing conventional optics with xenon. </p><p>  HB4 4300 xenon lamps are available from Contrast Favorite, for example.  As for the technical characteristics of this lamp, they are the same as the previous counterpart.  The difference is only in the coefficient of color temperature, which can be seen from its marking.  However, discharge lamps from this manufacturer are considered to be of higher quality, and therefore their cost will be higher, despite the lower temperature. </p>
