    <p>  Acids are one of the main classes of compounds of chemical elements.  The substance got its name for taste.  Another broad class are weak and strong bases.  The latter are distinguished by complete dissociation in water. </p><p>  Depending on the state of aggregation, the acid may be a crystalline or gaseous body, as well as a liquid.  In accordance with the degree of solubility, the compounds are divided into insoluble and soluble.  There are other classifications. </p><p>  In natural waxes and fats, monobasic acids (saturated) are most often found.  These compounds are divided into volatile and non-volatile. </p><p>  There are several definitions of the term acid.  For example, according to the theory of Liebig (a German chemist), these substances are compounds containing hydrogen, which can be replaced by a metal to form a salt. </p><p>  All compounds have different chemical properties.  Substances can interact with <span>basic oxides,</span> bases, and destroy metals.  Many compounds harm the body.  So, strong acids, getting on the surface of the skin or inside the body, cause serious chemical burns.  In this regard, safety precautions should be observed when working with connections. </p><p>  Strong acids that come into contact with skin or clothing are washed off with a large volume of running water or neutralized with ammonia <span>(ammonia solution).</span>  If compounds get on a metal, wooden or other surface, lime, soda or chalk is used as a neutralizing substance. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Strong acids should be stored in tightly sealed containers, out of the reach of children.  On the package must be present a tag with the name of the connection. </p><p>  Strong acids are used in everyday life.  For household needs, these substances are usually used in the form of aqueous solutions. </p><p>  Hydrochloric <span>acid, for example,</span> is capable of dissolving metals (including zinc, iron, tin).  However, this compound does not interact with copper, silver and gold.  This acid with water can be mixed in any proportions.  Most often, the compound is used for cleaning faience and enamel products, sinks, toilets and other items from limescale.  In some cases, hydrochloric acid is used to remove rusty or ink stains from the fabric (while preparing a weak solution).  The compound damages <span>artificial rayon,</span> cotton, and linen. </p><p>  Sulfur is a stronger acid.  The concentrated compound is able to carbonize wood, wool, cotton, sugar.  Getting on the skin, sulfuric acid causes deep chemical damage.  Preparation of the solution is carried out according to a certain rule.  Sulfuric acid is poured into the container with water carefully along the vessel wall, in a thin stream.  Due to its ability to absorb water in large quantities, the compound is used to eliminate moisture between the window frames in winter.  The glass is filled with a solution of 1/5.  Sulfuric acid is also used in the manufacture of battery acid. </p><p>  <span>Acetic acid is</span> often used in everyday life <span>.</span>  Typically, the compound is used in the form of an eighty percent essence or nine percent concentrated solution.  In diluted form, the acid does not affect the skin, tissues, metals.  Vinegar is used as a seasoning.  Also, the substance is used to eliminate fruit stains, soften water. </p><p>  It looks like acetic formic acid.  However, the latter is poisonous and causes deep chemical burns to the skin. </p><p>  <span>Citric acid</span> is quite common <span>.</span>  This crystalline white compound is soluble in both water and ethanol.  It is used to eliminate a variety of stains, including berries, wine, ink, rust, paints. </p>
