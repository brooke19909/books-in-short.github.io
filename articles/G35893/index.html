Many tend to move here from more remote corners of the country.  But not everyone can afford to buy housing in Moscow.  Or prefer to live in some remoteness from the metropolis.  For such an ideal option LCD "European" in Yegoryevsk. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Yard area" class="if uuid-3174821" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/3174821.jpg"></div><h2>  A bit about the city </h2><p>  At a distance of 89 kilometers from the Moscow Ring Road, 101 kilometers from the center of Moscow is the city of Yegoryevsk.  Its population is just over 70 thousand people, which creates a feeling of spaciousness and gives comfort to lovers of a quiet life.  Living here, you can quickly get to Moscow by train, bus or your own car.  Just a little over two hours drive.  Those who wish will find a job in the city itself, in which a sufficient number of industrial enterprises, agricultural production. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.35393699465991" data-lng="39.05157141219479" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/6/2/9/1/16291.png"></div><h2>  Location of the residential complex </h2><p>  LCD "European" in Yegoryevsk is located almost in the center of the city, in the 5th micro-district on Karl Marx Street.  Construction was carried out on the site of demolished dilapidated houses.  Such an arrangement provides excellent transport accessibility for residents of the Evropeisky residential complex in Yegoryevsk, from where they can reach the city center or any part of it in a short time.  Significant transport routes stretched around the complex: Sofya Perovskaya Street, Ryazanskaya Street. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Courtyard view" class="if uuid-3174823" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/3174823.jpg"></div><h2>  Description of the complex </h2><p>  In total, the developer planned to build ten 14-storey houses in the Evropeisky residential complex in Yegoryevsk.  At the moment, the promises are fulfilled, all houses are put into operation.  The residential buildings are brick, with a wall thickness of more than 50 cm, which provides comfortable heat in the apartments.  In addition, the use of gas silicate blocks when laying walls, their multilayer structure allows the structure to "breathe", creating a favorable microclimate.  The architectural design of the buildings is new, different from earlier buildings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="House in LCD" class="if uuid-3174824" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/3174824.jpg"></div><p>  ‚ÄúEvropeisky‚Äù RC in Yegoryevsk is equipped with its own gas boiler room, which allows residents not to experience inconvenience from interruptions in heat supply.  In addition, the equipment is provided for doorways with intercoms, the Internet and telephone communications.  Silent elevators will deliver residents to the apartments. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Apartments of the complex </h2><p>  The apartments in the Evropeisky residential complex in Yegoryevsk are designed according to their optimal size.  The developer offers a large selection of residential premises: from studio apartments to three-room apartments.  The average cost of one square meter of housing is approximately 57,000 rubles. </p><p>  All apartments are equipped with radiators, electrical and plumbing.  Windows and doors are installed.  The complex offers accommodation with or without finishing.  The latter option is well suited for those who plan their own repairs and want to save on buying an apartment and dismantling the design of the developer. </p><h2>  Internal infrastructure </h2><p>  The developer of ZhK Evropeisky in Yegoryevsk - YIT - being an innovator in construction and covering a significant territory of not only Russia with its activities, offers its projects as the most comfortable for living.  This also applies to the territory of the "European" residential complex.  Children's playgrounds and sports grounds, parking lots for residents and guests of the complex, specially equipped places for recreation, equipped with tables and benches, are far from the entire list of landscaping facilities for the courtyard. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Front door" class="if uuid-3174825" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/3174825.jpg"></div><p>  Little residents of the complex will be able to attend their own kindergarten, designed for 110 places.  Their parents will get everything they need in the store and will be able to relax in the planned cafe.  In addition, some of the premises on the ground floors of the houses are non-residential; additional objects of social infrastructure will be able to accommodate them. </p><h2>  External infrastructure </h2><p>  As in any city in the Moscow region, in Yegoryevsk there is no shortage of social infrastructure facilities.  Residents do not experience inconvenience from the lack of schools, kindergartens, shops, restaurants and cafes.  Many of them are located in close proximity, within walking distance from the Evropeisky residential complex in Yegoryevsk.  YIT VDSK took care of its future residents.  While the complex is under construction, apartment owners in already rented houses will be able to take advantage of the nearest educational and trade institutions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD construction" class="if uuid-3174826" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/3174826.jpg"></div><p>  Public transport links can be reached in around 5 minutes.  To get to the train to Moscow, it will take a little more time, 15-20 minutes. </p><h2>  The advantages of the complex </h2><p>  Remoteness from the metropolis plays one of the main roles in choosing the place of residence of the city of Yegoryevsk.  Compared to a metropolis rolled into concrete and asphalt, life in the described residential complex will take place in the best environmental conditions.  But with all the benefits of urban life. </p><p>  In addition, for those whose budgets are very limited, the price policy of the developer will help solve housing problems.  And it, in comparison with the capital, is several times smaller.  Saving will also allow the policy of the developer, offering apartments without repair.  And those who wish will be able to order a fully finished finish. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kvmeter.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Construction progress" class="if uuid-3174882" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52853/3174882.jpg"></div><h2>  Residents reviews </h2><p>  LCD "European" in Yegoryevsk has collected numerous reviews on the Web.  The houses have already been built, put into operation, the inhabitants settled and mastered.  Therefore, you can already find information about the new complex. </p><p>  Of course, as in any undertaking, and even more so in the construction of such large-scale facilities, many people are satisfied and dissatisfied with any conditions.  As for this residential complex itself, when studying the existing opinions, we can conclude about their almost equal number. </p><p>  The positive ones are based on the successful location of the residential complex - almost in the center of the city of Yegoryevsk.  The presence of various objects of social infrastructure that can be used without moving a considerable distance from the place of residence.  The opportunity to arrange children in nearby kindergartens and schools, and subsequently the smallest to transfer to their own built pre-school institution. </p><p>  Also pleases residents and the opportunity to purchase comfortable housing in sufficient proximity to the capital.  This fact is especially appreciated by those who are often forced to travel to Moscow at work.  The roads leading to Yegoryevsk are not as busy as other highways at the entrance and exit of the metropolis.  Therefore, travel time is not delayed by traffic jams. </p><p>  Pleases the owners of housing in the complex and the proposal of the developer of apartments without finishing.  Just like any newly constructed multi-storey building shrinks after some time, houses in the Evropeisky residential complex are no exception.  Therefore, with decoration, and even more so of high quality and expensive, it is better to wait a couple of years before the final shrinkage of the house.  So that you don‚Äôt have to redo everything.  This allows you to significantly save those who are planning a design repair. </p><p>  Negative reviews are also not a small number.  Previously, they were associated with a slight delay in the builder's fulfillment of his obligations for the delivery of houses.  But in general, all these shortcomings have already been eliminated.  Residents received the long-awaited keys to the apartments.  After the houses were populated, problems with the functioning of engineering systems were identified, which were also quickly eliminated. </p>
