  <section class="page js-page"><h1>OSAGO without inspection. Myth or reality?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In July 2012, Russian motorists received the good news.  The State Duma allowed to insure cars under compulsory motor third-party liability insurance with inspection tickets that are valid for less than six months.  In addition, the new law provides for the possibility of obtaining a short-term CTP insurance policy without technical inspection for a period of 20 days.  In the near future, a new bill will be submitted to the State Duma for consideration, providing for a permanent insurance policy without a technical inspection. </p><p>  The key point of the new bill is the return to <span>drivers of the right to</span> insure the car before undergoing a technical inspection.  The reason is that today, maintenance operators with the right to conduct inspection do not cope with the flow of people wishing to inspect the car.  Often, vehicle owners at their own risk and risk operating the car without insurance. </p><p>  To date, amendments to the law allow you to purchase a CTP insurance policy without inspection, but at the same time it is worth observing some conditions.  Previously, drivers could get a policy only to go to the place where registration will be made.  Now the policy can be purchased in order to get to the venue of the first or repeated maintenance. </p><p>  The innovation was approved by car owners, as previously many of them had to resort to the services of a tow truck, so as not to violate the existing Rules of the road.  If necessary, today you can purchase a CTP insurance policy without technical inspection for a period of 20 days and get to the maintenance point without violating the rules.  In other cases, to get insurance, you still have to go through a checkup. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Some drivers are of the opinion that insurance is only needed for beginners and daredevils, and do not consider it necessary to insure their ‚Äúiron horse‚Äù under compulsory motor liability insurance.  In fact, riding without compulsory motor liability insurance is fraught with serious consequences.  The legislation of Russia provides for <span>compulsory insurance of</span> any vehicle.  In the absence of a policy, drivers risk a fine of 100 to 800 rubles.  In addition, the traffic police, having identified such an offense, have the right to even prohibit the operation of the car and remove <span>registration numbers.</span> </p><p>  In order to understand how OSAGO is calculated, you need to contact any insurance company that interests you.  Some car owners believe that the price of the policy is determined by the insurer itself, in fact, this is not so.  The cost of insurance consists of coefficients and tariffs established by the state.  Insurance companies have no right to underestimate or inflate the cost of the policy.  The law prohibits any discounts, promotions, gifts when buying insurance.  The price of the policy depends on the brand of the car, its age, frequency of use, driver experience.  The region where the <span>vehicle is</span> registered <span>,</span> engine power, the number of drivers that will be included in the policy also matters. </p><p>  CTP is calculated based on the <span>basic tariffs that</span> are set by the government.  The specialist multiplies the base rate by <span>OSAGO coefficients,</span> which can reduce the cost of insurance, or, conversely, make it more expensive.  The longer the driver‚Äôs experience and age, the lower the coefficient will be, respectively, insurance will be cheaper. </p><p>  The insurance period also affects the cost, it is most advantageous to purchase a policy for 10 months or more, then a significant amount will be saved. </p><p>  The state encourages those drivers who drive carefully and do not get into an accident.  For trouble-free driving, motorists are entitled to a premium of 5% for each year without an accident.  The maximum possible discount is 50%.  When an insured event occurs, the coefficient increases by 50%.  Therefore, each driver must be very careful while driving: it is not only safe, but also profitable. </p>
