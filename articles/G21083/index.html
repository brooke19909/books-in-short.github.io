    <p><strong> </strong>  Hotel Xeno Sonas Alpina 4 left a double impression on tourists visiting it at different times.  One thing that unites these reviews is democratic prices. </p><h2><strong> </strong>  Transfer </h2><p><strong> </strong>  If you start by arriving at the hotel from the airport of Alanya, the vast majority of customers complained about the transfer being too long.  It takes almost 3.5 hours to drive.  If the trip takes place with young children, then it gives a very tangible discomfort.  Nevertheless, all the hotel guests were happy to note that the air conditioner was working properly and there were water bottles in the minibar of the bus, so it was not even hot when moving. </p><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  The hotel is located in a village with a sufficient number of shops with fruits, sweets and essentials.  Nearby is a market open on Tuesdays and Saturdays, where fresh fruit can be bought at affordable prices. </p><p>  The territory of the hotel complex Xeno Sonas does not differ in large open spaces, but it is very well-groomed, and a large number of plants and flowers daily delights the guests.  Tourists noted the skill of the staff to use every centimeter of space so that all guests were pleasant and comfortable. </p><p>  Those who traveled to Alanya spoke of the city as a pretty, landscaped place, where shops and cafes meet at every turn.  A typical resort town, developed just enough to make tourists happy.  But financial investments obviously will not hurt him. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Now about the most important thing for which they come to Turkey - about the sea and the beach.  All vacationers liked the size of the beach area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel compared to neighboring hotels.  On the local beach, tourists found everything they needed: deck chairs, umbrellas, mattresses.  There were also nice green "islands" with palm trees and bushes.  By the way, not a single guest complained about the lack of free sunbeds. </p><p>  But the entrance to the sea was not particularly pleased, especially for children and elderly guests.  Despite the fact that the beach is sandy (with a strip of small pebbles), at a depth of about one meter there are boulders and a stone slab.  Waves at sea created difficulties, as well as an increased level of danger of injury when entering and leaving the water.  But in general, tourists found the sea clean and warm. </p><p>  Some did not like the bar food on the beach, in particular, hard pizza, but you can go to the restaurant for five minutes and you are there. </p><h2><strong> </strong>  Entertainment </h2><p>  A lot of positive reviews were left about the pool - there were enough sunbeds for everyone, the water was not cold, there was no smell of bleach. </p><p>  Guests who came with children were pleased with the quality of the services of the animation team, especially dancing and a varied musical selection.  The hotel traditionally hosts creative contests for toddlers, in which each child is given the opportunity to speak and demonstrate his talent.  Of course, all this is carried out on a voluntary basis and no one pulls children onto the stage. </p><p>  Many tourists really liked the guides at the hotel, they were thanked for fascinating excursions and interesting stories about the <span>history of Turkey.</span> </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  There were complaints about the safety of children in the rooms.  Tourists drew attention to the fact that the windows are low enough, and the child, if desired, can easily climb on it, and the consequences can be any.  Therefore, if you go to a hotel with a child under three years old, it will be reasonable and safe to settle on the first floor, especially since the dampness is not particularly noticeable. </p><p>  In general, the guests praised the hotel rooms, some guests noted the presence of old furniture, but all the equipment - air conditioners, televisions - worked properly. </p><p>  Almost all tourists, with the exception of 2-3 guests, were pleased with the daily quality cleaning of rooms. </p><p>  Some guests regretted the irregularity of the change of linen and the quality of the textiles themselves.  But do not forget how many stars the hotel has, especially since the staff, if there was something wrong, responded to requests and eliminated all the flaws, taking into account all the comments of the guests and quickly responding to them.  In general, the guests noted a very friendly attitude of the hotel staff to the Russians. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The most vivid and varied experience of guests who visited Hotel Xeno Sonas Alpina 4 was hotel reviews. </p><p>  Of the pluses, the hospitality of the Turks was noted in terms of the number of salads, vegetables, herbs, salinity (very juicy and not poisoned with olives of different types).  Potato, cabbage (cauliflower and ordinary), zucchini and other vegetables were tasty.  Fresh fruits - watermelons, apples and oranges - were provided in abundance. </p><p>  Bread and cakes, as well as pies and muffins, were very popular with children, especially chocolate and carrot with cinnamon. </p><p>  Now about the cons.  The meat dishes in the buffet restaurant are very limited.  Guests at the restaurant also did not find good cakes and oriental sweets. </p><p>  But the inventive staff offered an interesting alternative to the powdered drinks that are offered to guests during each meal.  The kids were poured with a phantom, the natural origin of which could not be doubted, since it was made before their eyes from soda water and orange juice with the addition of sugar. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  This is how the Xeno Sonas Alpina 4 hotel appears to us, reviews, impressions, a photo and a description of which will help to make a conclusion about the quality of the services provided.  You should not expect a five-star level from a hotel, but you can confidently put a solid ‚Äúfour‚Äù on it.  In general, this hotel is designed for absolutely all categories of tourists who want to have a good rest by the sea for little money. </p>
