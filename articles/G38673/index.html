    <h2>  Caucasian legends </h2><p>  Beautiful names of these natural wonders owe to ancient legends.  According to local legends, once among the rocks of the waterfall in the hollows and crevices, wild bees built honeycombs, collecting nectar from honey plants, which are rich in the slopes of the gorge.  Torrential rains and spring floods washed away the hives, staining the rocks with amber droplets.  The water became sweet, and the gorge was filled with a delicate aroma of honey.  The bees died out long ago, unable to withstand the harsh winters, but the name remained. </p><p>  According to legend, once the daughter of a noble prince, contrary to the will of her father, fell in love with the common shepherd Ali Konov.  In honor of the young shepherd, the river is also named, as well as the settlement, which was formed later.  The prince was angry at the girl‚Äôs disobedience and decided to pass her off as a rich old man.  Unfortunate lovers had no choice but to leave their native land.  The fugitives chased, the servants almost caught them.  And then the young decided to break off their life by jumping into a stone abyss.  However, the shepherd took this step first.  He crashed on the rocks, and the prince‚Äôs daughter got scared and ... didn‚Äôt have time to rush after the young man.  The gorge was nicknamed "Castle of treachery and love."  It is a few kilometers from the network of waterfalls.  In those places, a ridge of rocks stretches, reminiscent of the ruins of the battlements of the castle.  Hence the name came from. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get honey waterfalls" class="if" height="418" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18627/462042.jpg" width="322"></div>

On the highway, the distance from Pyatigorsk to Kislovodsk is 43 km, which can be overcome in forty minutes.  Also, electric trains go there every hour (journey time is 57 minutes), the departure point of which is the city of Pyatigorsk.  Honey waterfalls are located about 17 km from Kislovodsk, near the village of Krasny Kurgan.  This path can be done on foot or by car, passing the border with Karachay-Cherkessia.  Do not worry about this.  No one will check documents.  Pointers with the inscription "Honeyfalls" can be found immediately after the sign "Karazhaevsky Konzavod".  They will help you navigate among the mountain landscapes.  The top of snowy Elbrus adorns the green panorama of this region.  A road tape leads through the field and descends into the gorge Alikonovka.  The view offers an incredibly picturesque panorama: the walls of the Dolomites from one edge of the tract and thickets of hazel among the rocks and lowlands - on the other side. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="honey waterfalls map" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18627/461900.jpg" width="377"></div>

    <h2>  Honey Walk </h2><p>  Sightseeing of famous sights - a group of waterfalls of the Alikonovsky tract, begins with a descent through an arch made of stones.  You need to go into the narrow aisle along the stairs between the rocks, the so-called "Mother-in-Ribs." </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At first, tourists see the second largest (6 meters) Zhemchuzhny waterfall.  Snow-white large splashes of this powerful source, sparkling in the sun, like strands of pearls, undoubtedly delight the eye.  Crystal clear, this wide cascade resembles the magnificent skirt of a bride's wedding dress! </p><p>  Then, the Secret Waterfall continues the acquaintance with the sights, which quietly paved the way under a huge boulder.  In some sources, it is called "Girl's Braids" (for its interwoven jets of three streams). </p><p>  Further, the path leads to the Snake waterfall, which, meandering, slides along a steep rock on the other side of the boulder, playing loudly with cold spray. </p><p>  Communication with nature continues ‚ÄúMill‚Äù - the fourth erupting stream of foaming water.  He falls noisily to the stone bottom. </p><p>  The walk ends at the main waterfall 18 meters high, which is called "Honey" or "Echki Bash", which means "goat‚Äôs head".  Its source is spring.  It is said that the <span>mountain water</span> here is very tasty, even sweetish, like honey. </p><h2>  Walking to the biggest waterfall </h2><p>  A bridge has been built at the largest cascade, on which you can walk to experience the chilling freshness of crystal splashes and take stunning photos of Honey Falls, which are beautiful at any time of the year!  In the summer, they will give coolness on a sultry day and cheer up their "music."  In winter, tourists are struck by bizarre compositions of frozen power and mysterious silence.  Autumn with its colors brings a new breath to the picturesque panoramas of nature.  And this has its own charm.  In addition, in autumn, as in spring, water flows are fuller and more impressive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pyatigorsk honey waterfalls" class="if" height="346" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18627/461890.jpg" width="463"></div>

    <h2>  The healing power of the elements </h2><p>  The stream, dropping from a height, hits a stone bed, above which clouds of water dust form.  Sunlight, playing with crystal droplets, draws rainbow paintings.  On a bright cloudless day, you can see dozens of rainbows.  Their beauty has healing power.  The magic drops of a falling veil under the rays of the sun create electric charges.  So, Honey Falls with cool air, saturated with negatively charged ions, have a miraculous effect on the human body, nourishing vigor and magical energy.  It is very good for restoring strength and strengthening the immune and nervous systems. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="photos of honey falls" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18627/461887.jpg" width="360"></div>  Modern research has established that after visiting the waterfalls, the general condition improves and a sense of peace appears.  In addition, the Alikonovka gorge is fragrant with flower meadows and lush vegetation.  Therefore, the water dust of cascading downfalls in a mixture with aromatic phytoncides has a beneficial effect on people prone to allergies and asthma attacks, as well as cardiovascular diseases.

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  It is no coincidence that poets and musicians go to admire the beauties of nature in search of inspiration!  Change the state of mind, recharge your batteries with energy and positive emotions, fill your heart with joyful warmth - this is not a complete list of reasons to visit Honey Falls.  The map of Kislovodsk does not describe for beginners travelers the charms of either the sea or the golden beaches.  But it will attract with a unique mountain microclimate, resort parks and magical sources of narzan.  And the incomparable landscapes of the Alikonovka River Valley and the delightful sight that the bubbling Honey Falls give, will make an indelible impression. </p>
