  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to get guardianship benefits</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Guardianship is a rather complicated thing, because it is not easy: to take responsibility for the life, safety and upbringing of the child.  Especially a baby from someone else's family.  Not many people cope with this task and are ready to assume such complex responsibilities.  This is evidenced by a huge number of boarding schools and orphanages.  However, those who undertook to do such a good deed will never regret it. </p><p>  The state does not leave such families alone with their misfortune.  Monthly they receive guardianship allowances, organize special charity programs for <span>orphans</span> and half- <span>orphans</span> to promote their development.  However, in order to receive such benefits, it is necessary that the child undergo training in educational institutions.  If he does not, guardianship benefits are not paid.  That is, if you become a guardian, you must ensure that the child attends school, then enters a technical school or university.  While he will study, money for his maintenance will be paid every month without any kind of delay.  However, in order to fill out this request for money, you need to provide the custody authority with a certificate stating that the child is not fully supported by the state. </p><p>  In the case of guardianship, people who take responsibility for the child are paid a kind of salary in the amount of about 3,000 rubles.  She is also included in the allowance.  Although this amount is symbolic, it helps a little.  Naturally, when you make custody, you should understand that you are doing this not because of money, but for moral reasons or because of the breadth of your soul.  However, if the main point is money, stop and do not do it!  Money has never helped people love a child!  You only ruin your life and yourself! </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What are the benefits for guardians in 2012?  According to some reports, the allowance is 10 MCI.  However, in each case, this amount can be calculated by the guardianship authorities in different ways: depending on the situation.  However, the size of the guardianship allowance has never been impressive.  This is the usual average salary.  By the way, the so-called ‚Äúsalary‚Äù for raising a child is issued to each adoptive parent. </p><p>  What must a guardian do in order to receive guardianship benefits?  First, he needs to legalize guardianship, then submit all the necessary documents to the guardianship authorities.  It will be necessary to open a special account to which funds will be transferred.  And after that, the details must be reported to the guardianship authority. </p><p>  However, the guardian should not only take care of the documentation, he also needs to create favorable conditions for the life of the child.  Such guardianship families are constantly visited by social educators, you will be constantly monitored, a psychologist will periodically talk with your child to find out how comfortable the child is in your family. </p><p>  By the way, after you officially adopt or adopt a child, your family is registered as dysfunctional.  And the point is not that something is wrong with you, it‚Äôs just that they will monitor and track any problem.  No need to negatively relate to this type of invasion of your life and the lives of all members of your family.  So the state shows its concern for the person whom you have accepted. </p><p>  How can I spend custody benefits?  Naturally, teachers and social workers will constantly pay attention to how your child is dressed, in what condition his textbooks are, whether he has everything necessary for a normal educational process.  If this is not the case, they will talk with you and, perhaps, after several warnings, will deprive you of guardianship.  So work hard so that your adopted child is not deprived of anything in material terms. </p><p>  It is advisable that you write it in some circles.  You will also have to pay for them.  In general, you should spend most of all funds that require guardianship benefits on a child. </p><p>  This type of cash is not subject to accounting and taxation.  You may not specify benefits as a source of income. </p>
