    <p>  The writer herself in some interviews hinted that the school of sorcery is located in Scotland.  It was there that she drew inspiration for writing her books.  Images from the film confirm these revelations. </p><p>  To understand where the Hogwarts school is located is not possible for an ordinary Muggle.  This place is bewitched, and even if an ordinary person approaches the castle, he will only see the ruins with a prohibitory sign. </p><p>  It is also impossible to cross the border of Hogwarts.  This can be done at a specific time and in a strictly limited place.  There are no usual technical innovations at school, since the use of any energy other than magical is unacceptable. </p><p>  Near the castle is the village of Hogsmeade, in which only magicians live.  It is at the Hogsmeade station that the train with the students arrives. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Other sorcery schools are mentioned in the film: </p><ul><li>  Salem Witch Institute (possibly USA). </li><li>  Sharmbaton (France). </li><li>  Brazilian school of magic. </li><li>  School of magicians Durmstrang (possibly Holland). </li></ul><p>  Of course, sorcery and all the characters <span>are fiction,</span> but the shooting was carried out in real architectural and natural objects.  Although not without a layout.  It was built on the site of the Warner Brothers film studio.  Next, we will talk about where the Hogwarts Castle and its main premises are located. </p><h2>  Key Hogwarts School Places to Know </h2><p>  Adherents of the saga, of course, would like Hogwarts, where the "city" of magic is located - many hidden places - and the main events take place, to be a single ensemble.  However, this is not so, therefore, in order to visit all parts of the fictional castle, the tourist will have to travel fairly well.  Although, no doubt, it's worth it. </p><p>  What places are worth visiting in the footsteps of Harry Potter and his friends?  Here is a sample list: </p><ul><li>  Hogwarts Castle - Northumberland County. </li><li>  Dark Forest - County Buckinghamshire. </li><li>  Dining Room - Oxford. </li><li>  Library - Oxford. </li><li>  Chamber of Secrets - County Wiltshire. </li><li>  Corridors of the castle - Gloucester Cathedral. </li><li>  Kings Cross Station - London. </li><li>  Hogsmeade Station - Gotland, Yorkshire. </li></ul><h2>  Hogwarts Castle </h2>

It is located in Northumberland, on the border with Scotland.  It was in the courtyard of this ancient castle that wizards played Quidditch and learned to fly on brooms. </p><p>  The story of Alnik is not limited to the Harry Potter movie.  Information about him dates back to 1096.  He was always known for his interior decoration, art galleries, and a library.  He was used to shoot films about Robin Hood, Queen Elizabeth, the knight of Ivanhoe.  In the movie saga of the books of Joan Rowling, he turned into Hogwarts. </p><p>  Where is this magical place, thousands of readers dreamed to know.  That is why special attention has been riveted to the castle of Alnik, which has not faded away for many years. </p><p>  However, the film was not shot only in the pavilion and Alnika.  The directors created a collective image of the school, combining many fascinating places. </p><h2>  forbidden Forest </h2><p>  According to the plot, the school of sorcery is located near the forest, in which unicorns and ominous werewolves live.  The real location for filming was Black Park, which is located in Buckinghamshire.  The atmosphere of the forest did not have to be complemented by decorations, since it is so dense in itself that even on a sunny day, twilight reigns there. </p><h2>  Canteen </h2>

    <p>  Often a dining room appears in the frame.  It is in it that young wizards begin and end the school year in each series of film sagas.  She is not in Alnik.  This is actually Christ Church College's canteen, which is part of Oxford. </p><p>  This educational institution has a long history.  At one time he was graduated by Lewis Carroll - author of "Alice in Wonderland" and a world-famous scientist Albert Einstein.  Other equally well-known students were distinguished writers Oscar Wilde and John Ronald Ruel Tolkien. </p><h2>  Library </h2><p>  Oxford provided another filming location for the creation of the Hogwarts School.  Where is the book depository in which young Hermione loved to draw information?  Everything happened in the famous Bodleian library of a famous university.  It belonged to the Duke of Humphrey.  Until now, it is considered the oldest and largest bookstore in Western Europe. </p><h2>  Castle corridors </h2>

    <p>  The corridors run by students of the school of magic and wizardry are actually located in <span>Gloucester Cathedral.</span>  Their fan arches fascinate with their appearance.  The cathedral itself was erected in the 14th century in the southwestern lands of England.  It is considered to be the pearl of architecture of both that time and modernity. </p><p>  In his district - incredibly picturesque landscapes that amaze with a variety of shapes and shapes.  It was in these corridors that Harry and Ron saved his girlfriend from the giant troll in the first part of the saga. </p><h2>  Chamber of Secrets </h2>

    <p>  The Lacock Abbey, located in Wiltshire County, was chosen as the premises for the Chamber of Secrets.  In addition, scenes were shot here, where Harry heard the voice of Basilisk while serving his sentence. </p><p>  The abbey is famous for the fact that it was inhabited by an English inventor in the field of photography.  His name was William Tabolt.  Visiting the convent, you can find many audiences in which the classes of young wizards took place. </p><h2>  Kings Cross Station </h2>

    <p>  In the story, the train to the school of magicians leaves from platform 9 ¬æ of Kings Cross Station.  On the set, a vaulted wall was used between the fourth and fifth platforms.  For fans of Rowling's work on the platform, an installation was created in the form of a trolley disappearing into the wall.  There is also a plate attached on which in English it is written: "Platform 9 ¬æ." </p><h2>  Hogsmeade Station </h2><p>  It is from this station that the steam engine takes young magicians to the school of magic.  The real place of filming was the Gotland station area, located in Yorkshire.  It was there that one of the first railways in England was built. </p><p>  This is only part of the places that were used to shoot a fascinating saga about a young wizard and his friends who were desperately fighting a dangerous magician, whose name few dared to pronounce. </p><p>  So, many of the scenes in the films are real.  Of these, the creators of the movie saga made up the Hogwarts.  Where is the prototype of the famous school located in Russia?  Unfortunately, none of the listed attractions to our country is related. </p>
