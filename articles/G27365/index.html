Description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many people ask: tie-break - what is it?  Where is it used?  We will consider these and other questions in the article.  The term "tie-break" ("stop a draw") comes from the English words tie (draw) and break (stop, break).  It means a shortened specific game (in volleyball (short set), in tennis (game) and other sports), with which you can determine the winner in a draw. </p><h2>  When is tennis played? </h2><p>  Tennis tie-break - what is it?  In solitary tennis, athletes play a shortened game with a score of 6: 6 in games.  The game continues until a set of seven points.  If with seven points the difference in points of opponents is less than two, then the tie-break continues until the difference of two points appears. </p>

    <p>  In paired tennis, in addition to short games in a simple set with the same score on sets, a crucial set in the form of a tie-break for the champion can be played.  In this case, the rivals compete until they score ten points.  The game can last until the advantage of one of the pairs in two points.  And it is written as 1: 0 or 0: 1. </p><h2>  How is tennis played? </h2><p>  So, you already know that a tie-break is a short match.  How is he played in tennis?  The submitting contestant performs the first serve, then the opponent carries out two innings, after which the change goes through a couple of innings.  A tie-break lasts until a difference of two points is obtained.  Venues are replaced after every six points. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Badminton </h2><p>  Many people know that tie-break is an exciting game.  This game in badminton is held when the game is 20:20.  And how are athletes implementing it?  The side that was the first to score a difference of two points, with a score of 20:20 wins the game.  The side that first received the 30th point wins the game with a score of 29:29. </p><h2>  Volleyball </h2><p>  Next, we will find out how a tie-break is performed in chess, and now we will consider holding a short game in volleyball.  In this sport, it is carried out with the score of the parties 2: 2.  How is its implementation going? </p>

    <p>  The fifth (decisive) game is played up to fifteen points with the least advantage of two points.  If there is an equal score of 14:14, the game lasts until there is an advantage of two points (16:14, 17:15, ...). </p><h2>  Chess </h2><p>  A tie-break in chess is held when the points of the current champion and applicant in the matches for the title of chess king are equal.  According to the rules of the championship, a short game includes four games in fast chess.  Each player has twenty-five minutes per game with ten seconds added per turn. </p><p>  Agree, a tie-break in chess plays a crucial role.  But back to the story.  If these games are ended in a draw, then the chess players will have to play two more blitz games, each of which will be allocated to the players for five minutes, and for each move - for three seconds.  If the score remains the same, then the athletes will play two more blitz games (match).  In general, they can play no more than five such matches. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In which case is a tie-break in chess at the World Cup useless?  If these ten parties do not determine the winner, then the players have to hold a crucial party - armageddon. </p><h2>  Strategy </h2><p>  Of course, grandmasters must know what kind of predator this is - a tie-break in chess.  Moreover, at the world championship in 2016 in the match Karjakin - Carlsen, the fate of the match was decided on a tie-break.  So, a tie-break is a prolongation of a match. </p><p>  The tactics and strategy of a game with facilitated control are somewhat unusual.  Experienced chess players say that the search for the best plan, ingenious combination, the strongest move is all great, but it‚Äôs better to postpone the game in the model format.  All these innovations need to be considered, and it takes a lot of time.  At a tie-break in chess, long reflections are an unacceptable luxury.  Control is shortened. </p><p>  Try to escalate your opponent‚Äôs problems.  A tie-break in chess should be intricate.  Strive to get a position mainly from the opening where the opponent must play accurately.  Time is short, and in an unknown position, the enemy can panic and make a mistake. </p><p>  For this, most strong chess players have special opening pieces. </p><h2>  Common mistakes </h2><p>  If you follow the rules of a tie-break in chess, you can become a favorite of the world.  What are the typical mistakes made in this short batch?  The first error is getting into time trouble.  The player can lead the game perfectly - strong, beautiful and inspired.  However, chess players have the following saying: the most difficult thing is to win the position that you have already won.  If you don‚Äôt leave time for yourself to realize the advantage, all your efforts can easily disappear in time trouble. </p>

    <p>  Of course, everyone needs to know the rules of a tie-break in chess.  The second error is the fascination with long versions of the calculation.  It is known that accurate calculation requires skill and time.  If you are not a grandmaster, then do not overestimate your own strengths.  Even in the ‚Äúmost accurate‚Äù of your calculations, almost always the opponent may have a chance to go ‚Äúto the left‚Äù. </p><p>  In a tie-break, you need to try to play hard, not to get into time pressure and not to allow gross miscalculations.  And, as a rule, the matter will not be behind the opponent‚Äôs mistakes. </p><h2>  Match </h2><p>  Many people know that a tie-break in chess is an exciting game.  In 2016, the 55th ever chess game for the world title was held in New York.  The current world favorite <span>Carlsen Magnus</span> (Norway) and the challenger Sergey Karjakin (Russia) competed.  The representative of the Russian Federation for the first time since 2008 participated in the match for the title of chess king.  The match was held from September 11 to 30.  The prize pool was one million euros. </p><p>  Many say that a tie-break in chess is a stunning action.  The 2016 match consisted of 12 games (limit number) with an exemplary time inspection.  If one of the players scored 6 ¬Ω points, the match would be completed ahead of schedule.  Since the score was identical - 6: 6, a tie-break was carried out with a reduced time calibration (fast chess).  Then armageddon and blitz were not needed.  In this short game, Carlsen won with a score of 3: 1 and saved the title of world champion. </p><h2>  Forecasts </h2><p>  It is known that a tie-break in chess is a celebration for fans.  Many seek to predict the game.  So, the president of the International Chess Federation (FIDE) Ilyumzhinov Kirsan before the tournament suggested that Karjakin and Carlsen would play on equal footing in the match for the world‚Äôs chess crown. </p>

    <p>  And the president of the Chess Federation of Russia, Filatov Andrei, after winning the 2016 Russian Grandmaster Sergey Karjakin‚Äôs championship, declared that he would be able to take the championship from Carlsen. </p><h2>  Grandmasters History </h2><p>  You still ask, what is a tie-break in chess - what is it?  Over the long period of private meetings that began in 2005, Kalsen and Karjakin played eight times in quick chess.  Interestingly, no one has any advantage in this science: the Russian won three times (2010, 2006, 2008), the Norwegian won the same number of times (2012, 2009, 2001) and the draw was marked twice (2014, 2006). </p>

    <p>  Chess players know that a tie-break in chess is a game for the powers that be.  Magnus recorded all his victories when he played with white pieces.  Along with this, he is the leader in the rating, as in the classic version. </p><p>  On the decisive day of the battle for world championship, the current world favorite Carlsen defended his title in a confrontation with Karjakin, which we discussed above.  Carlsen won the tie-break in two games, and two tied. </p><h2>  Armageddon </h2><p>  So, you already know that a tie-break in chess is a competition of great people.  How is armageddon played?  The player who wins the draw can choose whether to play white pieces to him or black.  The one who plays black is given four minutes, and the one who plays white is five.  If here everything ends in a draw, then the one who plays black will be awarded the chess crown of the world.  If already 60 moves will be executed in the armageddon, the participants in the game will also receive an additional three seconds for each move. </p>
