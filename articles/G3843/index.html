  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IPhone notifications: reasons why notifications disappear and remedies</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many users of "apple" smartphones sooner or later encounter such a problem when they stop receiving iPhone notifications.  As a result of this, the user can simply skip any important message that he was waiting for.  Why does this happen?  The reasons can be different, ranging from a malfunction of the system to a malfunction of the Apple ID account.  In today's article, we will analyze common problems with notifications, and also talk about ways to resolve them. </p><h2>  Check activation notifications </h2><p>  The first and most common reason why iPhone notifications may not work is that the notification function is simply disabled.  Check if this is so, you can quite simply.  First you need to go to the Settings app.  Then in the list you should find the item "Notifications" and go there. </p><p>  This submenu contains absolutely all iPhone applications that can send notifications.  So, as a result of a software failure, the settings for each application could be lost, because of which they stopped sending alerts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="it-here.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to set up notifications on iPhone" class="if uuid-2601959" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2601959.jpg"></div><p>  How to enable notifications on the iPhone in this case?  Everything is simple.  You must select the desired application, alerts from which you need to come.  Next, in the application menu that opens, you need to pay attention to the very first switch "Allow notifications" - it must be activated.  Just below, you can also set the desired sound for notification.  Everything is simple. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A similar operation must be done with all other applications from which it is necessary to receive alerts. </p><h2>  OS software malfunction </h2><p>  The second reason why iPhone notifications do not appear is a malfunction in the operating system.  Yes, this also happens on iOS, so don't be surprised.  The problem is solved very simply and quickly.  All you need to do is reboot the device. </p><p>  You can perform this procedure by holding the power button, and then through the appeared switch, first turn off the phone, and then turn it on again.  You can also hold down the power button and the volume down button (or the Home button) to force a reboot of the device.  When clamped, <span>the Apple logo</span> should appear <span>,</span> after which the smartphone will reboot, and the problem with notifications will disappear. </p><h2>  Do Not Disturb </h2><p>  Often the reason why iPhone notifications do not come is the activated Do Not Disturb mode, which many users love to forget about.  To check whether this mode is enabled or not, just look in the status bar.  If there is a crescent icon next to the battery icon, then the mode is activated. </p><p>  Disabling Do Not Disturb is easy enough.  First you need to go to the "Settings" menu.  Further in the list you need to find the item "Do not disturb" and click on it.  In the submenu that appears on top, there will be a switch with which the mode is disabled. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ichip.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="notifications on iphone in do not disturb mode" class="if uuid-2601968" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2601968.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, the Do Not Disturb mode can be enabled for individual contacts from which notifications will not be sent if they send SMS.  To check if the mode is turned on for someone, you need to go to the Messages application and look among the list of contacts to whom the messages were sent, whether there is a crescent icon next to their name.  If there is, then the mode is active for them and it needs to be removed.  To do this, just go to the "Contact Details" tab, find the corresponding parameter there and turn it off. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Silent mode </h2><div class="photo" data-original="iphone-now.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone notifications in silent mode" class="if uuid-2601962" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2601962.jpg"></div><p>  The next reason why notifications do not come on iPhone is the active "Quiet Mode".  It is easy to make sure that the mode is active, you just need to look at the corresponding switch on the smartphone case (located on the right side at the very top).  If an orange bar is visible when you look at the switch, then "Quiet mode" is working.  Disabling it is not difficult, just flip the switch to the desired position. </p><h2>  Apple ID and iCloud </h2><p>  No matter how strange it sounds, but the Apple ID account and iCloud itself also often become the reason why notifications do not come to the iPhone.  No one really knows what kind of malfunctions are happening there or something else happens, but there is a fact - Apple ID and iCloud are the reason for not receiving notifications. </p><p>  How to deal with this problem?  Yes, in principle, there is nothing particularly complicated here, and everything about everything will take a maximum of 5 minutes, but no more. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.apple-iphone.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="due to apple id account" class="if uuid-2601964" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2601964.jpg"></div><p>  The first step is to log out of your Apple ID account and log in again.  This is done as follows: </p><ol><li>  You need to go to the "Settings" menu and find the item "Apple ID, iCloud ...". </li><li>  We go to this item and in the opened submenu we see the account. </li><li>  You must click on your account in the window that appears, click "Logout". </li><li>  After logging out, you will need to re-add your Apple ID account. </li></ol><p>  These manipulations will have to help with the issue of notifications, but if this did not happen, then you should repeat the manipulations, but with your iCloud account. </p><div class="photo" data-original="akket.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="due to icloud account" class="if uuid-2601963" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2601963.jpg"></div><p>  Here the procedure is slightly different: </p><ol><li>  You need to go to the "Settings" menu, find the iCloud item there and click on it. </li><li>  In the submenu that appears, at the bottom there will be a button "Exit", which should be pressed. </li><li>  After clicking, you need to confirm your actions by selecting "Logout" again, and then "Delete from iPhone". </li><li>  The next step is to re-add your iCloud account and sync. </li></ol><p>  As a rule, after these actions, notifications begin to arrive on the iPhone regularly. </p><h2>  No sound </h2><p>  Well, and finally, another reason that is somehow connected with notifications - there is no sound of iPhone notifications.  Also, very often you may encounter the fact that notifications seem to come, but there is no sound from them.  There may be several reasons why this happens: </p><ol><li>  The user accidentally deleted the folder with sounds through the file manager. </li><li>  A third-party application for ringtones and alert sounds, for example, UnlimTones, is installed. </li><li>  Well, the third is a poorly made jailbreak. </li></ol><p>  In the second case, the solution to the problem is extremely simple - you just need to uninstall the application, and the notifications will work. </p><p>  As for the first and third options, it will only help restore the phone to factory settings.  You can do this through the "Settings", the "General" item and the "Reset" button at the very bottom (without data backup, all data will be deleted). </p><p>  That, in fact, is all. </p>
