"Great-grandfather" of the camera</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The pinhole camera is <span>a prototype of a</span> modern camera.  It was this simple device that helped our ancestors capture the bright moments of life. </p><h2>  Definition </h2><p>  The pinhole camera is the simplest optical device that allows you to reproduce the image of objects.  From Latin it is translated as "dark room", which most clearly displays the device device.  It is a box with a hole, as well as a frosted glass or paper screen.  Penetrating through an improvised lens, light transfers the contours of the object to the surface. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1568787" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1568787.jpg?1555772671"></div><h2>  Historical information </h2><p>  The history of photography dates back more than one century.  Naturally, it is inextricably linked to such a device as a pinhole camera.  The first mention of it dates back to the V century BC.  The Chinese philosopher Mao Tzu described in his works an interesting phenomenon: an image appeared on the wall of a dark room.  Aristotle also described similar situations. </p><p>  The next stage can be considered the X century.  Ibn Alhazen (an Arab scientist), studying the Sun, made special observation tents.  It was he who, in parallel with the creation of a new theory of the propagation of light, explained the principle of the pinhole camera. </p><p>  The history of photography is inextricably linked with the development of astronomy.  So, initially the pinhole camera found its application in observations of a solar eclipse (XIII century).  But Leonardo da Vinci used this device in his painting classes, about which he wrote in detail in his works.  Since then, many artists have used a pinhole camera in their work. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The idea to equip the camera with a lens first appeared in 1550 by the Italian physicist J. Cardano.  He concluded that such an innovation would significantly improve image quality.  And after a few years, another Italian - D. Barbaro - suggested additionally diaphragm the lens. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1568771" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39549/1568771.jpg?1555772671"></div><h2>  Artists Tricks </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the pinhole camera is a tool of ancient astronomers and opticians, it was the work of artists that stimulated scientists to create photographs.  In an effort to facilitate their work, artists actively used this device.  So, with the help of a pinhole, the artists projected the image onto paper or plaster, after which they circled it with charcoal, pencil, paint or other materials.  It was this action that prompted physicists to think that the camera should not only project, but also capture the image. </p><p>  Thus, the realism of the work of most artists is a merit not only of their personal skills, but also pinhole cameras.  It is proved that the magnificent portraits of Carmontel and the picturesque cityscapes of Belotto are the result of using this device.  And even in the XIX century, when the obscura began to transfer the image to paper, the artists used this property, slightly tinting the lithographs with watercolors. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1568772" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39549/1568772.jpg?1555772671"></div><h2>  Principle of operation </h2><p>  A rather primitive, but at the same time sophisticated device is <span>a pinhole camera.</span>  <span>The principle of operation</span> is that, passing through a hole on the front of the device, the sun's rays create an image on the screen.  In this case, it will turn upside down. </p><p>  It is worth noting that low-definition images help to make a pinhole camera.  Photos are pretty blurry.  Sharpness can be increased only by reducing the opening of the "lens", which minimizes the impact of extraneous rays on the screen.  However, only a large hole can make the image bright. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1568786" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1568786.jpg?1555772671"></div><h2>  Prototype of a modern camera </h2><p>  The first pinhole camera was quite primitive.  Moreover, at the output she gave an inverted image, which is not very convenient.  But by 1686, Yoganess Tsang upgraded the device, resulting in the first portable camera.  He equipped the device with mirrors, placing them at an angle of 45 degrees.  They projected the image onto a horizontal platinum. </p><p>  The development of photo art did not stop there.  Scientists are constantly improving the device, equipping it with lenses, which not only expanded the viewing angle, but also made images clearer.  As a result, they managed to get a small mobile camera, which at the output gave fairly clear photographs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1568773" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39549/1568773.jpg?1555772671"></div><h2>  Modifications </h2><p>  Knowing how a pinhole camera works, some resourceful people set up real home theaters.  So, having drilled a small hole in the outer wall, one could observe on the opposite plane what was happening on the street.  In the absence of television, this was quite interesting entertainment.  But this, of course, is a primitive use of the pinhole principle. </p><p>  A more progressive invention was the so-called "stenop."  This is a kind of camera in which a small hole is provided instead of the lens.  Pictures taken with this device are soft, but rather deep.  At the same time, an almost ideal line of perspective is noted.  This device is popular even among modern photographers. </p><p>  In 1807, Wollaston invented the lucida chamber.  It was a prism with four faces.  By placing it at a certain angle, it was possible to transfer the image to paper.  Thus, lucida fell in love with artists who made very accurate sketches and sketches with it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1568775" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39549/1568775.jpg?1555772671"></div><h2>  How to make a camera yourself </h2><p>  When reviewing photographic equipment, few people think about what the first cameras were like.  Of course, you can find information on the Internet or in encyclopedias, but it will be much more interesting and informative to make a camera yourself.  For this you will need a regular matchbox.  On its front side you need to make a small hole (no more than half a millimeter, otherwise the camera will not work).  At the bottom of the box you need to put photo paper or film.  Now place the makeshift camera so that its ‚Äúlens‚Äù faces the street.  After 4-5 hours, when you open the matchbox, you will see that the outline of the object is displayed on the paper (film). </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1568776" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39549/1568776.jpg?1555772671"></div><h2>  For professionals </h2><p>  A pinhole camera is a simple but interesting enough device that occupies modern minds.  Of course, you can make a primitive device from a matchbox, shoe box or tea can, but if you are seriously interested in photography, you can make a camera close to the original.  Thus, combining modern technology and age-old knowledge, you can create quite original pictures. </p><p>  You will need: </p><ul><li>  a cover from the camera body; </li><li>  a square piece of aluminum (can be cut from a can of beer or carbonated drinks); </li><li>  needle; </li><li>  electrical tape of black color; </li><li>  sandpaper; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  drill. </li></ul><p>  Drill a hole with a diameter of 5 mm in the cover of the camera body.  Sand all irregularities thoroughly with fine sandpaper to prevent fragments of plastic from entering the camera. </p><p>  Next, the hole must be made in a piece of aluminum.  This can be done with a needle, puncture the material 7 times.  This fragment also needs to be carefully polished, then attach it to the lid using electrical tape.  It is important that the center of both holes matches. </p><p>  Now it remains only to attach the cap to the lens and begin shooting.  Given that the aperture will be small, experts recommend using a tripod.  To make the pictures sharper, use the flash for additional lighting. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Even in ancient times, the sages knew how a pinhole camera works.  From the field of science, this device gradually migrated to the field of art.  As it turned out, the amazing realism and documentary accuracy of the work of many artists is the result of using a pinhole.  Nevertheless, the device was most widely used in the field of photography.  Thanks to the primitive black boxes, our ancestors were able to capture the most important moments that are invaluable to history. </p>
