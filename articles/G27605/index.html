But often homework is not done by the children themselves, but by their parents.  And when it becomes necessary to make, for example, a hare of their cones, mothers panic.  In this article we will tell you in detail how to make plain figures. </p><h2>  Hare with felting elements </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cone hare" class="if uuid-2230911" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2230911.jpg"></div><p>  As the basis of this craft, you need to take a pine cone.  It is better to stock up with such gifts of the forest in advance.  After all, often work from the cones needs to be done in the winter, and digging them out from under the snow is not the greatest pleasure.  Therefore, as they say, <span>prepare a sled in the summer, and a cart in the winter.</span> </p><p>  Let's start making crafts.  How to build a hare from a cone?  The first step is to make the animal's ears.  They are made of wool by felting.  This will require brown material, a needle and a sponge.  We put the wool on the sponge and with the help of a needle we seal it, giving the shape of an oval.  When the brown base is ready, according to the same system, you need to make the inner pink part of the ear.  The parts are glued to each other using the same needle.  But to attach ears to the bump will help superglue.  The nose of the hare should be made of beads, and the mustache of twine.  Eyes for toys can be bought at the store, or you can cut them out of paper yourself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hare from a cone and plasticine </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cone and plasticine hare" class="if uuid-2230914" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2230914.jpg"></div><p>  The easiest way to make crafts is to mold it from plasticine.  But what if the toy needs to be made from natural material?  In this case, you should make a hare from a cone and add it with plasticine details.  A similar craft will be able to make even a child of 3 years old.  We take a small piece of plasticine and divide it into two parts.  From the pieces we roll two balls.  Now they need to be flattened a little and attached to the bottom of the cone.  These details will be cleft legs.  We make hands according to the same principle.  Only they need to give a drop shape.  Attach the front legs on two sides of the bump.  We sculpt the head in the shape of a pear.  To its upper part should be attached flat oval ears that can bend down.  Now you need to detail the face.  From pink plasticine we sculpt a nose-droplet and the inner parts of the ears.  We put blue dots on our eyes, and a mustache should be made from a toothpick. </p><h2>  Natural hare </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts from cones hare" class="if uuid-2230913" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2230913.jpg"></div><p>  To create such a craft, you will need not only a fir cone and plasticine, but also maple planes.  Let's start manufacturing.  Set the bump on two plasticine balls.  To make the design more stable, you should tap the workpiece on the table a little.  Next, you need to glue the ears from the bunny.  We take two maple ‚Äúairplanes‚Äù and with the help of plasticine sausages we glue them to the top of the cone.  Now from thin branches should make a toy hands.  We attach the sticks with plasticine to the bump.  You can put carrots in one of the paws.  It remains to give the hare a touching expression on his face.  From two brown flattened circles we make a muzzle, in the middle we put a round black nose.  Mustache should be made of thin green twigs.  The eyes are made of white plasticine, and the pupils are placed with green dots.  It remains only to glue a thin strip of mouth, and the craft will be ready. </p><h2>  Cone hare </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts from cones hare" class="if uuid-2230912" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2230912.jpg"></div><p>  Creating such a job will be very simple.  To make it, you need 3 fir cones and 5 pine.  How to create this craft?  A hare of cones is made according to the following scheme.  First you need to prepare the material.  We trim the tops of all pine cones so that one edge becomes flat.  Glue the material is a hot gun.  We attach 4 pine trees to the fir cone.  Two of them are glued from below, and two from above.  It will be paws.  The crown of the cone should be cut, and ears should be placed in this place.  When the structure dries, you can proceed to the manufacture of the muzzle.  Glue the fir cone on the nose with the flat side, and cut out the eyes from the paper.  If desired, a mustache can be created from the twigs. </p>
