This is the name of the device for watching television in a modern format.  The features of these devices, as well as their connection to TV receivers will be described in this article. </p><h2>  To watch free channels </h2><p>  As you know, every resident of Russia with the onset of the new 2019 received as a gift two dozen television channels in digital broadcasting format, which can be watched completely free of charge.  But only owners of appropriate equipment can take advantage of this.  What is needed for this?  Firstly, you need to get a digital television receiver DVB T2.  The last letters and numbers in this name indicate that such a prefix is ‚Äã‚Äãdesigned to receive a digital signal in the second generation DVB format. </p><h2>  Functions </h2><p>  Many digital television receivers with media player function are available.  Such models allow in addition to the usual broadcast to watch videos and films.  In addition, on this unit you can listen to music by connecting it to a stereo system.  Most models of digital television receivers do not have built-in memory, and read information from external drives.  Therefore, in order to listen to music or watch movies on such a device, you need to get a "flash drive" of a sufficiently large volume. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.jakartanotebook.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Flash-card" class="if uuid-3134339" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58679/3134339.jpg"></div><p>  The USB connector to which the drive is connected provides another valuable opportunity for users of such devices.  Digital television receivers of many models allow not only watching videos and listening to audio, but also recording them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Time Shift and other features </h2><p>  Recording can take place in three different scenarios.  The simplest of them is when a person watching TV decides to keep for himself a certain moment of transmission.  To do this, he simply presses the Record button on the remote control.  The following situation may also happen: the viewer for some reason does not have enough free time to watch the entire program, but must periodically pause.  Then it is best for him to choose the "Time shift" mode, that is, "time shift." </p><p>  This is the same record, only, it starts at the moment when the viewing is paused, so that later it can be resumed from the time when it was necessary to interrupt.  And the third option is to choose from the electronic television program, usually called using the remote control, the transmission that should be recorded.  In this case, the process will begin and end at the time specified in the program.  An important characteristic of a digital television receiver is its ability to work offline, that is, when the TV receiver is turned off.  This function is necessary for those who are going to often record live broadcasts.  After all, if the desired program is broadcast late at night, it is convenient to record it when the TV is off, which means that it is in silent mode. </p><h2>  Model selection </h2><p>  Currently, there is no shortage of television digital receivers on the shelves of equipment stores.  On the contrary, a huge selection of models sometimes confuses the buyer.  What should I pay attention to when acquiring such an apparatus?  Its main function is the reception of television broadcasts.  Therefore, first of all, you should pay attention to the purity of the picture or, in other words, to the stability of the received signal. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Experts say that many models do an excellent job of this task, provided that a normal antenna is connected to the device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="productondeal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="TV antenna" class="if uuid-3134331" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58679/3134331.jpg"></div><p>  After that, you can pay attention to other functions of the tuner.  If the user just needs to watch TV channels, then there is no point in overpaying the extra money and you can stop on the budget options, the price of which starts from six hundred rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dvbmarket.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bbk digital tv receiver" class="if uuid-3134336" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58679/3134336.jpg"></div><p>  For example, there are currently several similar models of BBK digital television receivers on store shelves. </p><h2>  the Internet </h2><p>  In addition to these functions, some television tuners (another name for receivers) also have the ability to connect to the Internet via Wi-Fi.  This is required in order to be able to watch videos, for example, from the YouTube site.  Owners of Lumax television digital receivers also receive a free opportunity to use the ‚Äúcinema‚Äù, which contains several hundred of the best domestic films. </p><h2>  Connection </h2><p>  Having purchased the model you like, you need to connect it to the TV.  This can be done via the tulip connector, HDMI, or any other available on the rear panel of the digital receiver. </p><div class="photo" data-original="textbookcentre.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="HDMI connectors" class="if uuid-3134355" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58679/3134355.jpg"></div><p>  If the ports of your TV receiver and tuner do not match, then you can use the adapters, which are usually called modulators or converters.  Owners of Soviet TVs will also need the same device, to which any peripheral device can be connected only through the antenna "socket". </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.videoblocks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="old tv" class="if uuid-3134344" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58679/3134344.jpg"></div><p>  The receiver must also be connected to an antenna that is capable of receiving waves in the decimeter range.  Most likely, your indoor or outdoor common antenna is suitable for watching TV in digital format, as some analog channels broadcast their broadcasts at the same frequencies. </p><p>  How to set up a digital television receiver?  After connecting, go to the menu of the device, select the region of residence, as well as the item "automatic setup".  In most cases, the device independently finds twenty free TV channels and three radio stations.  If this did not happen, then the frequencies must be entered manually (for each city they are different). </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  This article briefly described what a digital television receiver is.  This device should be at home for everyone who spends part of their free time watching TV. </p>
