    <h2>  What? </h2><p>  The tax rate on the transport tax is undoubtedly important.  But what kind of payment are we talking about?  As already mentioned, not all citizens of the Russian Federation are associated with such a tax.  But only those who own this or that transport. </p><p>  The thing is that such penalties are annual payments for registering a vehicle with the traffic police.  It is important to remember: the transport tax applies only to everything that the engine has.  So, for example, citizens who own scooters and bicycles are completely exempt from paying these fees.  This tax is regional in nature. </p><h2>  Not the same everywhere </h2><p>  What does it mean?  Everything is extremely simple: the payment amount is calculated separately in each subject of the Russian Federation.  That is, in Moscow and St. Petersburg taxes on the same car are different from each other.  This is a normal occurrence. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  An important role here is played by transport tax rates.  They are installed, as a rule, in each city separately.  And they tend to change from year to year.  It is quite common.  Therefore, all taxpayers should have a clear idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow to calculate the value of the vehicle in relation to ownership.  It is preferable to be interested in data immediately before payment of the payment document. </p><h2>  tax code </h2><p>  Legislation is not completely detached from our current issue.  An important role in it is played by the Tax Code.  Transport tax rates (generally accepted) are set here.  To be more precise, then refer to article 361. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transport tax tax code" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1197095.jpg"></div>

    <p>  It also specifies the rules according to which the subjects of the Russian Federation have the right to change and set their own tax rates for transport.  It should be noted: in comparison with the proposed options, the established norms in the regions cannot differ by more or less than 9 times. </p><p>  By the way, the tax rate on the transport tax depends on many factors.  It takes into account engine power and the characteristics of your vehicle.  What you should pay attention to?  What does article 361 of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation say?  It is worth looking at the proposed tables (for the main transport).  They set the standards stipulated by the laws by default per unit of capacity.  For passenger cars: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if" style="width: 654px; height: 140px;"><tbody><tr align="center"><td>  Engine power (horsepower) </td><td>  Tax rate (rubles) </td></tr><tr align="center"><td>  Less than 100 </td><td>  2,5 </td></tr><tr align="center"><td>  101-150 </td><td>  3,5 </td></tr><tr align="center"><td>  up to 200 </td><td>  5 </td></tr><tr align="center"><td>  201-250 </td><td>  7.5 </td></tr><tr align="center"><td>  Over 250 </td><td>  fifteen </td></tr></tbody></table><p>  For motorcycles: </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr align="center"><td>  Engine power (horsepower) </td><td>  Tax rate (rubles) </td></tr><tr align="center"><td>  up to 20 </td><td>  1 </td></tr><tr align="center"><td>  21-35 </td><td>  2 </td></tr><tr align="center"><td>  26 and more </td><td>  5 </td></tr></tbody></table><p>  For buses: </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr align="center"><td>  Engine power (horsepower) </td><td>  Tax rate (rubles) </td></tr><tr align="center"><td>  up to 200 </td><td>  5 </td></tr><tr align="center"><td>  From 201 and more </td><td>  10 </td></tr></tbody></table><p>  For trucks: </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr align="center"><td>  Engine power (horsepower) </td><td>  Tax rate (rubles) </td></tr><tr align="center"><td>  up to 100 </td><td>  2,5 </td></tr><tr align="center"><td>  101-150 </td><td align="center" valign="middle">  4 </td></tr><tr align="center"><td>  up to 200 inclusive </td><td>  5 </td></tr><tr align="center"><td>  201-250 </td><td>  6.5 </td></tr><tr align="center"><td>  from 251 and more </td><td>  8.5 </td></tr></tbody></table><p>  As you can see, the tax rate on the transport tax is taken into account based on the number of horsepower in the engine of a particular vehicle.

Look for the data you need on a variety of sites and in motoring communities.  They are different for each city.  Keep this in mind when searching.  Not the best, but very popular technique that you can imagine. </p><p>  Also, users have the opportunity to see what tax rate on transport tax is due in a particular subject of the Russian Federation by referring to the official website of the tax authorities of Russia.  Here you can find all the information that interests you.  For taxpayers, this service is a real find.  It is enough in the search on the corresponding page to type the necessary words - and the thing is done. </p><p>  An older, but no less effective method is to call the tax authorities in your city.  Or a direct appeal to this organization.  Just say that you would like to know the current tax rate in your area.  And employees must provide you with information.  The one that is relevant at the moment.  Therefore, it makes sense to be interested in rates by the end of the tax reporting period. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transport tax rates payment procedure" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1197092.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Terms of payment </h2><p>  So, we need to pay the transport tax.  Rates, payment procedures and other important information can be found both by calling the <span>tax office</span> in your city, or on the official website thereof.  It‚Äôs better, of course, to remember the terms and procedures for making a payment yourself.  This will save you trouble. </p><p>  The tax reporting period lasts until April 30.  It turns out that it is by this time that you must pay the state and make all payments that are required by law.  In general, it is better to pay the transport tax immediately after receiving the notice.  But keep all checks and receipts for about 5 years.  This period is set on average for storing all payments.  Just in case, to be able to prove the fact of paying the bill if necessary. </p><h2>  How to apply </h2><p>  There is no need to talk much about the application of transport tax rates.  This component is used in special formulas.  They are extremely easy to understand.  And they help to calculate the amount of transport tax that you must pay to the state treasury. </p><p>  So, standard calculations are extremely simple.  The tax rate (for transport tax) is multiplied by the amount of horsepower.  It‚Äôs not so difficult to guess.  After all, all tariffs are set per unit of engine power. </p><p>  If the vehicle is owned for less than a year, then slightly different calculations will be applied to it.  What kind?  The standard formula is multiplied by the quotient of dividing the number of months of car ownership by 12. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="on the application of transport tax rates" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1197097.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Luxury cars are a separate category of transport.  And she needs attention.  It should be borne in mind that luxury in this matter starts with 3 million rubles.  If transport costs so much or more, you will have to use a special formula.  To do this, the standard formula is multiplied by the so-called <span>increasing factor.</span>  It is established, like the tax rate on transport tax, in each region.  When it comes to a luxury car that has been owned for less than a year, you need to refer to the last formula to calculate the due payment. </p><p>  To do this, take the second version of the calculations (cars owned less than 12 months) and multiply it by a factor.  That's all.  Now it‚Äôs clear how you can independently calculate the amount payable in the form of a tax on transport.  As you can see, knowing certain data will not cause any problems. </p><h2>  Privileges </h2><p>  We know the transport tax rate.  <span>Tax benefits</span> in this regard also take place.  And they are distributed individually in each region.  After all, the transport tax is considered regional. </p><p>  Who is considered to be beneficiaries?  Of course, the elderly.  Elderly people have every right to a kind of discount from the state.  Or for a full exemption from payment of transport fees.  According to modern laws, pensioners who own a particular vehicle with a motor engine pay only 10% of the total payment.  But their benefits must be announced in advance.  To do this, it is customary to contact the tax service of your region with a PTS, documents of ownership, a standard form application, a passport, as well as certificates confirming benefits (pension certificate, for example). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transport tax rate tax benefits" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1197098.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Full freedom </h2><p>  Who is not afraid of the transport tax rate?  Of course, those who are completely exempt from this payment.  Oddly enough, there are such categories of people in the Russian Federation.  There are not too many, but they are available. </p><p>  Who are you referring to?  Veterans, Heroes of the USSR, retired military personnel who participated in the hostilities (fought, simply put), disabled people of the 1st and 2nd groups.  Also, organizations that transport people with disabilities and repair and create roads of various importance are free from paying transport tax.  Families with many children, as a rule, have all the rights to refuse to pay the contribution in question.  In such families should be from 3 minor children. </p>
