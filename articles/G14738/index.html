    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Ideal hotels do not exist.  ‚ÄúMediteran‚Äù (Becici, Montenegro) was no exception.  Guest reviews are not only full of praise, but also emphasize the shortcomings of the complex.  Tourists note the following problems that you may encounter when choosing it as your place to relax: </p><ul><li>  Poor Internet, intermittent.  Wi-Fi has a low speed and you can not find it everywhere. </li><li>  When leaving the sea, yarn comes across stones that can be injured. </li><li>  Air conditioning is not working properly.  Very noisy, slightly cooling. </li><li>  The hotel calls for an expensive taxi, although there are cheaper options. </li><li>  Unripe fruits and vegetables are often served. </li><li>  The cleaning is frequent, but of poor quality.  A lot of dust remains on the tables, and the balconies, according to tourists, are not tidied up at all.  Towels are changed only after paying an extra tip. </li><li>  During the rest of the hotel, noisy repairs are underway. </li><li>  Lack of entertainment for children. </li><li>  Inconvenient furniture in the room, as well as broken and leaking plumbing in the bathroom. </li></ul><h2>  How much will it cost to relax in Mediteran? </h2><p>  Hotel "Mediteran" can hardly be called a budget resort.  The average cost of a standard room starts at 5,500 rubles per night and ends at 16,000. Thus, a weekly trip for two will cost an average of 40,000 to 60,000 rubles.  In addition, it will require additional expenses for maintenance, tips, food, drinks and entertainment, as well as visiting the sights that Montenegro (Becici) is famous for.  Hotel "Mediteran", reviews of which are rather controversial, is considered one of the best on the coast of Budva, so the cost of the rest corresponds to the quality of the services provided. </p><p>  Thus, the complex meets all the requirements, although it has some disadvantages.  Do not count on first-class service when buying a ticket to Mediteran (Montenegro).  Traveler reviews recommend travelers with children to stay at another hotel.  Nevertheless, the complex will be a great place to relax childless couples of any age.  Mediteran will delight you with its polite staff, delicious food and the cleanest coast. </p>
