They decorate the interiors of houses, apartments, banquet rooms.  <span>Artificial flowers</span> or bouquets complement wardrobe details, accessories and home textiles.  "How to make artificial flowers with your own hands?"  - Many craftswomen ask this question, and this is understandable, because everyone who is fond of needlework wants to diversify their skills. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pixabay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Artificial flowers" class="if uuid-2486335" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/86500/2486335.jpg"></div><p>  The Internet was flooded with photos of artificial flowers, it‚Äôs not so difficult to make them with the right approach and the presence of inspiration.  As a rule, they are used as a decoration or gift.  In addition, an artificial flower made by yourself and added to the interior will look much more beautiful and pleasant than the purchased option.  A nice bonus - less money will be spent on its manufacture than on a finished product bought in a store, and you can even sell the craft if you wish.  You will learn about how to make artificial flowers with your own hands from this article. </p><h2>  Paper flowers </h2><p>  To start the creative process, if you are still new to the technique of making flowers, you can do it yourself with a paper artificial flower.  It will cost less than fabric products, but it will look no worse. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="pixabay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tulips from paper" class="if uuid-2486339" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/86500/2486339.jpg"></div><p>  Paper of any texture will suit your taste: plain white or color, corrugated or newsprint, napkins or color cardboard.  In the process of creativity, you must not forget about the type of flower that you are going to make.  For example, for a peony you need to make as many petals as possible, and for most wildflowers you can make petals of different shades, then an artificial flower made by yourself will look more lively and realistic.  For a tulip, on the contrary, choose one color, the same as a living plant.  A handmade flower bouquet made of artificial flowers will give a piece of joy to the person you give it to. </p><h2>  Paper roses </h2><p>  No wonder roses are considered the most beautiful and sought-after flowers for women.  Perhaps in our time there is no woman who would remain indifferent to them.  Even if the roses donated to her are handmade artificial flowers for the interior. </p><p>  Despite all the complexity in the structure of the petals of a real live rose, making it yourself is very simple.  To work you will need: </p><ul><li>  double-sided colored paper of dense texture; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  transparent glue (not PVA, as it leaves white marks). </li></ul><p>  First you need to decide how big the <span>rose bud</span> will be - the same size you need to cut a square.  In the square, draw a spiral, as on candy, and be sure to ensure that the spiral lines are as even as possible, then the flower will look as neat as possible.  Cut the workpiece with scissors.  Then form a rose bud, twisting the spiral, starting from the end from the outside. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="pixabay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rose from paper" class="if uuid-2486333" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/86500/2486333.jpg"></div><p>  Fix the resulting flower with glue and let it dry.  Finally the rose is ready.  To complete the effect, you can try to bend the edges of the petals to the outside, like a real bud. </p><h2>  Artificial fabric flowers </h2><p>  Fabric products are a little more difficult to make than paper, but fabric artificial flowers look like real ones.  Of course, many would prefer natural flowers to artificial, but it is important to remember that natural flowers will sooner or later begin to fade, which can not be said for the fake.  In addition, not all ladies will be able to pamper themselves with flowers because of a banal allergy, and with an artificial flower made by their own hands, such a problem certainly will not arise. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pixabay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Artificial fabric roses" class="if uuid-2486338" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/86500/2486338.jpg"></div><p>  Creating fabric flowers, you can use materials such as satin, silk, satin, brocade, organza, foamiran and leather.  Leather flowers will be very unusual.  You can combine materials, but it is important to monitor the harmony of the composition. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Do-it-yourself simple flower made of fabric </h2><p>  It is quite simple to form an artificial flower from a fabric, for this there is the easiest way.  Thanks to this method, the resulting rose can serve as an ornament for a handbag, hair clip or any clothing.  To do this, it is enough to have: </p><ul><li>  any fabric (100 x 10-15 cm); </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  threads and needles. </li></ul><p>  Take a piece of cloth and tuck one edge to hide the edge, then fold the piece in half and fasten the corner with thread.  Next, you need to flash a seam along the length of the entire piece of fabric.  When the needle comes to the edge, tuck the material inward and wrap it in the same way as the first edge. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pixabay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fabric flower" class="if uuid-2486341" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/86500/2486341.jpg"></div><p>  Having finished with the estimate, you need to collect the ribbon obtained, namely, pull the thread from one edge so that, wrinkled, the ribbon forms a flower.  The assembly does not end there, then you need to twist the flower with a spiral, starting from one of the edges.  You can leave it as it is, that is, a neat little bud.  It was he who was supposed to succeed.  And you can shape each petal to your taste: make them more magnificent, creating the effect of a blossoming bud. </p><p>  When you finish assembling the flower, fix the result with a thread, otherwise it will disperse, and nothing will remain from the selected shape, for this you will need one simple seam along the edge of the fabric.  Layers of petals should be at the same level as possible, then the flower will turn out neat and tidy. </p><h2>  Flower of foamiran </h2><p>  If when working with woven material you want to get an unusual and special artificial flower, we recommend choosing a relatively new type of fabric - foamiran.  Foamiran is somewhat similar to ordinary suede.  As a rule, it is from it that some types of toys and decor for scrapbooking are made. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pixabay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fabric flowers" class="if uuid-2486334" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/86500/2486334.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Prepare petal templates in advance.  According to them, it is necessary to cut out each petal already from foamiran.  We recommend purchasing material in different colors.  With everything you need at your fingertips, you can experiment.  For example, in addition to the main color, buy yourself a sheet of green foamiran and white. </li><li>  In the second stage, you will need a hot iron, put it to bask.  When the iron is hot enough, attach it to the petals for a couple of seconds.  This is necessary so that the petals curl a little and take a more realistic shape. </li><li>  The final stage is gluing all the petals into one big bud.  You need to do this with hot glue and a brush, it will turn out neater. </li></ul><p>  It is important to know that flowers from foamiran look like live from the side, therefore we strongly recommend not fixing jewelry such as beads, rhinestones and beads in the middle.  DIY handmade compositions of artificial flowers will look like a living bouquet of real plants.  In addition to realism, such a composition from foamiran has commendable durability, which means that over time it will not lose shape at all. </p><h2>  DIY artificial flower topiary </h2><p>  Topiary made of artificial plants are original, because you can make a composition from any favorite flowers and decorative elements. </p><p>  The creation of a topiary from artificial flowers, as a rule, begins with the manufacture of a base - a tree, as well as the selection of a suitable pot.  First you need to prepare and pick up all the necessary materials in the store, from plain paper to artificial flowers (well, if you make them yourself too).  The essence of making any topiary is decorating crumpled paper that is worn on a wooden base. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Topiary from flowers" class="if uuid-2486332" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/86500/2486332.jpg"></div><p>  Make a topiary is not difficult, even a beginner needlewoman will cope with the work.  A big plus of this craft is the variety of options, you can safely give vent to imagination. </p><h2>  Artificial Organza Flowers </h2><p>  Organza is the very material that designers use to make original wedding decorations, tulle and artificial flowers.  Unlike foamiran, buds made of this material will look great with various decorations in the form of beads, rhinestones, beads, sequins and even any beautiful buttons. </p><ul><li>  A flower with four petals is cut from the fabric, while the petals can be of any shape - as you wish.  Such flowers will need 2 pcs.  If desired, you can make three or four flowers - so the resulting bud will be more magnificent. </li><li>  The next step will need glue, preferably with sparkles.  It is applied along the contours of each flower, and they are also drawn in three lines on each petal. </li><li>  When the glue dries, you need to glue each flower next to another with glue, but you can use double-sided tape.  It is necessary to stick so that each upper petal is between the two lower petals from the lower flower. </li><li>  Sew or glue beads or any other decoration in the center of the flower made. </li></ul><h2>  Leather artificial flowers </h2><p>  The advantage of leather is that this material is very malleable in the manufacture of various products, and floral arrangements made of leather look extremely expensive and elegant.  If you know certain subtleties, then working with the skin will be very simple. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pixabay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Artificial tulips" class="if uuid-2486340" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/86500/2486340.jpg"></div><p>  It is important to know that it is from thick leather material that straight petals will turn out, and thin skin, on the contrary, is more plastic and the compositions will be quite voluminous.  When you have acquired the necessary materials, you can begin to work. </p><ul><li>  Cut the petals out of the material, then coat them on the inside with PVA glue.  Glue must be mixed with water in a proportion of one to four.  While the glue dries, stretch the edges of the petals a little, this will help give the future flower more realism and elegance. </li><li>  When the glue is completely dry and the petals will take the desired shape, fasten them with a thread and a needle.  The core of the flower can be decorated with a bead. </li></ul><p>  Tip: to fasten the flower more quickly, glue special lining material to its wrong side. </p><h2>  Artificial flowers for the interior </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pixabay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Artificial poppies" class="if uuid-2486337" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/86500/2486337.jpg"></div><p>  You can add coziness, decorate the interior of your home, office or patio by creating beautiful artificial flowers with your own hands.  Just choose your favorite material and method, and inspiration will come to you.  Floral arrangements will decorate any surface in your home, and clothes, accessories and even shoes can be easily supplemented with original flowers made of fabric. </p>
