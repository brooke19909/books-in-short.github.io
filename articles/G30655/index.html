    <h2>  Rubber Bead Bracelets </h2><p>  Schemes for the manufacture of such jewelry can be very different.  Accessories are easy to make of such types: </p><ul><li>  Single row. </li><li>  Double row. </li><li>  No gaps. </li><li>  With the "windows" between the beads. </li><li>  Of round elements or cylindrical. </li><li>  From large or small. </li><li>  In the form of an ordered line or in a chaotic arrangement between the rubber bands. </li></ul><p>  As you can see, there are many options. </p><h2>  Materials and fixtures </h2><p>  To make gum bracelets with beads, you need the following: </p><ul><li>  Colored gum Rainbow loom bands (better original branded). </li><li>  Suitable size beads (from sets or purchased separately). </li><li>  Hook (special or regular for knitting). </li><li>  Slingshot. </li><li>  Machine. </li><li>  Clasp clip. </li></ul><p>  If you train, then some of the options you can easily perform without any devices, just on your fingers.  Usually use the middle and forefinger of the free hand (for right-handed people - the left and, accordingly, vice versa).  By the way, instead of a hook, an ordinary toothpick is suitable, although it is not so convenient to work with.  Tools make work easier, help you and make weaving easier. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Beginning of work </h2><p>  Before learning <span>how to weave gum bracelets</span> with beads, it is worth practicing in preparing the elements for work. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rubber bands with beads" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/988364.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Regardless of the technology used, you will have to put the beads on the gum.  If one shade is chosen for braiding, the preparatory stage will be as follows: </p><ol><li>  Take the right amount of beads and the corresponding number of elastic bands. </li><li>  Prepare a wire of short length (5-10 cm) and such a thickness that folded in half, it passes through the hole in the bead. </li><li>  Fold the cut piece in half in the form of a loop. </li><li>  Loop the elastic. </li><li>  Pass the wire with the fixed elastic through the hole in the bead so that one end of the elastic is on the other side of the hole, and the second remains at the beginning. </li><li>  Do the same with all the beads. </li></ol>

    <p>  As a result, there will be beads in front of you, on each side of the hole there is a loop of elastic.  It is easier to work with material prepared in advance in the future.  You do not need to be distracted by threading gum through the beads during the weaving process. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition to the method presented above, one more can be used when a needle with a thread is used instead of wire.  The elastic, threaded through the hole in the bead, is not fixed in a loop of wire, but on a thread previously put into a needle that is tied in a knot. </p><h2>  The easiest way to weave on your fingers </h2><p>  You can weave gum bracelets with beads on a slingshot, but easy options are made quickly even without any attachments.  In this bracelet, the beads will go sequentially one after another, touching each other, that is, between them there is no weaving with elastic bands. </p><p>  The sequence of work is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Take an empty elastic band and put it on the middle and index fingers of your left hand (if you're a right-hander) in the form of a figure eight. </li><li>  The next gum with a bead, also put loops on these fingers. </li><li>  Remove the previous gum on the left and right to the middle through the fingertips. </li><li>  Repeat the previous two steps until the desired length of the bracelet. </li><li>  After fixing the last bead, put on an empty elastic band and discard the loops of the elastic band with a bead on it. </li><li>  Fasten the clip in the formed loose loops. </li><li>  Hook the other end of the clasp onto the very first loop of the bracelet. </li></ol><p>  Work is done. </p>

    <h2>  <span>Weaving bracelets</span> from rubber bands with beads on a slingshot </h2><p>  To get a simple single-row version, where the beads go sequentially without gaps, but with braiding of each bead on both sides, work as follows: </p><ol><li>  Put an elastic band on both horns of a slingshot, crossing it in the form of a figure eight. </li><li>  Put on two more elastic bands also on both columns without crossing. </li><li>  Pick up the bottom elastic on each side and discard the loops through the top to the middle between the horns of the slingshot. </li><li>  Take the prepared bead and put the loops on the horns of the slingshot. </li><li>  Drop the lower elastic band on the right and left through the top to the middle, securing the elastic band with a bead. </li><li>  Put one more elastic on both horns of the slingshot without a bead and without crossing. </li><li>  Throw off the loops of the gum on which the bead is located, also through the top to the middle between the columns, fixing the gum worn in the previous step </li><li>  Put on the next gum with a bead. </li><li>  Drop the loops of the lower gum through the top to the middle.  As you can see, the 8th and 9th steps are repeated 4 and 5. </li><li>  Weave in this order to the desired length of the bracelet. </li><li>  Fasten the last loops and install the clip-on fastener with one end in the final loops, and the second in the first. </li></ol><p>  The product is completed. </p>

    <h2>  Alternative tools for work </h2><p>  So, you have already learned several ways how to weave a bracelet made of rubber bands with beads.  The first, unlike the following two, was proposed to be done on the fingers.  In fact, all three methods are suitable for working without special devices, if you do not have them.  In addition to the fingers, instead of a slingshot, you can use a homemade tool.  It is enough to connect two sticks, for example, felt-tip pens at a short distance.  The spacer is easy to make from an eraser or parts from the designer "Lego".  All elements are easy to fasten with ordinary tape.  The performed adaptation will help to significantly facilitate the work, since all your fingers will be free. </p><h2>  Double row bracelet </h2><p>  Very beautiful and at the same time simple bracelets made of rubber bands with beads can be made on the machine.  To do this, you will need only four columns.  The decoration will turn out to consist of two rows of weaving, between which beads are located, at a certain distance or without it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gum bracelets with beads patterns" class="if" height="287" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/988378.jpg" width="430"></div>

    <p>  For the first experiment, take gum of the same color.  You can take any distance between the beads.  The main thing - here you have to count the number of elastic bands woven between the beads.  Work as follows: </p><ol><li>  Put the first pair of elastic bands on your four columns on the diagonals, that is, crosswise. </li><li>  Put the next gum on the pair of posts closest to you, and the second on the far one. </li><li>  Remove the lower elastic bands inside the four columns through the top. </li><li>  Now put on two elastic bands for each pair of columns, as in step 2. </li><li>  Fold the bottom gum to the middle. </li><li>  Repeat twice steps 2,3 with one elastic band put on on each pair of columns. </li><li>  Put on an elastic band with a bead so that one loop stretches over the two columns nearest to you, and the second loop - over two distant ones. </li><li>  Discard the lower loops to the middle. </li><li>  Put on one elastic band again for every two columns and discard the lower loops to the middle. </li></ol><p>  In fact, the general principle of weaving is set forth.  Then you can repeat the actions in the way you want, that is, place the beads through three or four elastic bands.  If you initially decided to alternate elastic bands of two different colors, count the loops and arrange the shades in accordance with the selected pattern.  The above sequence, when double and single elastic bands alternate, is convenient in case of using an odd number of elastic bands of different tones.  In fact, you can use only single or only paired options, if you are alternating two through two, for example.  In a word, understanding the principle of work, you can create completely different options for jewelry. </p><p>  As you can see, weaving bracelets from rubber bands with beads is quite simple.  Choose your favorite scheme of work.  Learn, exercise.  Create beautiful accessories for yourself and girlfriends. </p>
