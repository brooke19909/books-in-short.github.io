This leads to negative reviews about the Minima hotel in Kuzminki. </p><p>  Most often you have to complain about the rudeness and rudeness of the staff.  First of all, this claim concerns administrators. </p><p>  It turns out that finding this hotel is very difficult, especially if you are heading into it by car for the first time.  There is simply no sign or signage confirming that the traveler or business traveler is moving in the right direction.  You constantly have to call the administrator, but employees often find themselves unable to clearly explain how to get to their hotel, and if the client begins to question or clarify something, they begin to be rude. </p><p>  If any domestic inconvenience occurs, the staff is not ready to help their customers.  Most likely, because there are simply no such opportunities.  For example, when a couple rents a double room and discovers a short and frankly small blanket.  The request to give out the second is impossible, because it simply does not exist.  At the same time, the administrator is not ready to offer any alternative - neither a duvet cover, nor a plaid.  This all demonstrates that the hotel is completely not equipped to fulfill even the simplest and most obvious requests of its guests. </p><p>  Another big minus that can be found in most reviews is disgusting soundproofing.  As a result, guests are aware of everything that happens in several neighboring rooms located nearby.  It is even audible how guests simply talk among themselves behind the wall.  Because of this, it‚Äôs not possible to relax at all, since there is always a feeling that strangers are nearby, which is absolutely impossible to get rid of. </p><p>  Some note the high cost.  For the conditions that are created here, they ask too much money.  Yes, and additional services bite.  For example, breakfast does not pull at the declared 400 rubles.  If desired, you can find a hotel with more affordable prices and comparable conditions, or even better. </p><p>  Guests themselves do not recommend staying here if you have a lot of luggage.  The hotel is located on the fourth floor with no lift.  So with heavy bags and things you have to climb the stairs yourself.  Most rooms have heavily padded mattresses.  All this creates an extremely negative overall impression. </p><p>  Some guests had problems with check-out.  Administrators often show excessive importunity, urging them to leave the room as quickly as possible. </p>
