    <h2>  Moscow, Komsomolskaya Square.  General information </h2><p>  Komsomolskaya Square in the capital until 1933 was called Kalanchevskaya.  There are three railway stations here today.  These are Kazan, Yaroslavl and Leningrad.  Unofficially, this place is called the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthree stations. </p><h2>  Historical information.  Title </h2><p>  There is a fairly common opinion on this subject.  It is assumed that Kalanchevskaya is the original name of the square.  It was associated with the palace of Alexei Mikhailovich.  More precisely, with its wooden tower, that is, a sea otter.  Later, the area was renamed and became known as Komsomolskaya.  This happened in 1933.  The square was named after the Komsomol members who took part in the construction of the subway.  Just below it was his first line.  It was a kind of gift for the anniversary of the Komsomol.  In everyday life, Komsomolskaya Square is also known as the square of three stations.  Once in some newspapers there was information that it was allegedly renamed.  However, in reality this did not happen.  Komsomolskaya Square still retained its name. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Komsomolskaya Square" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/475206.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Occurrence </h2><p>  In the 17th century, swamps and meadows were located on the site of the future square.  Together they formed the Kalanchevsky field.  The swamp was located on the south side of it.  Now this territory is a modern Kazan station.  At that time, a stream called Olkhovets flowed through the swamp.  On the east side, the field was limited by a large pond.  This is the territory that is now located between Upper Krasnoselskaya Street and the Yaroslavl Station.  The pond was created using a dam on Olkhovets.  In 1423, it was called the Great, and later was renamed Red.  It covers a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã23 hectares.  <span>This is commensurate with the</span> territory of the Moscow Kremlin. </p><h2>  Location Features </h2><p>  The Chechera River flowed from the south side of the pond.  A wooden bridge was thrown over it.  The Stromynskaya road ran along it.  She passed through the village of the same name and then led to Suzdal.  This road also ran through the western region of Komsomolskaya Square and Krasnoprudnaya Street to Stromynka.  Alexei Mikhailovich ordered the construction of a track palace in the northern part of the pond.  According to data from other sources, he was on the territory of Bolshaya Spasskaya Street.  The palace was equipped with a wooden tower.  In the Tatar language, this word sounds like "kalancha".  Thus, the field in front of the palace got its name.  It became known as Kalanchevsky.  Palace <span>Red Village</span> was located on the opposite side of the field.  Over time, it turned into a large craft settlement.  From the western side, the field lasted until the middle of the territory of modern Bolshaya Spasskaya Street.  She, in turn, became so called because of the church of the same name.  At that time, the temple was just on the edge of the field. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the XVII century, the New Field Artillery Yard was built on the west bank of the pond, namely from the Yaroslavl and Nikolaev stations.  The first was considered the land of the coachmen from the Pereyaslav settlement.  The artillery yard was a warehouse for cores and cannons with a shooting range.  It consisted of many wooden buildings.  They were surrounded by a stone wall.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe territory totaled about 20 hectares.  For this reason, the field continued to be undeveloped. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Komsomolskaya Square 6" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/475207.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Further development </h2><p>  The Time of Troubles affected the territory of the Red Village.  Envoys of False Dmitry I visited here. They were Naum Plescheev and Gavrila Pushkin.  With their appearance, an uprising began, which spread to Moscow.  As a result, the Godunov dynasty came to an end. </p><h2>  Functioning in the XVII-XIX centuries </h2><p>  <span>The Red Pond</span> was a favorite place of Peter I. He often arranged holidays with fireworks and cannon firing here.  For example, the capture of Azov and the conclusion of peace with Turkey and Sweden were celebrated.  There is an alternative opinion on the name of the field.  It belongs to academician I.E. Zabelin.  He believes that the field was named after the capture of Azov.  The fact is that two towers were built on it, which were called kalanchas.  These were original copies of the Azov ones.  During the holiday, the towers were demonstratively stormed by Russian soldiers.  During the reign of Catherine II, this territory joined Moscow. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Komsomolskaya Square 2" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/475208.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  XVIII century </h2><p>  In 1812, the artillery yard was burned, after which there was an explosion that shook the entire eastern territory of the city.  After several decades, the station was built here.  The architect A.K. Ton was responsible for the project.  The station was built on the site of the Artillery Plant.  At first it was called Nikolaev, and then Leningrad.  In its western side was a large, by the standards of the time, building.  Later, customs, which was previously located on Pyatnitskaya Street, were transferred to it.  Forest rows were located on the opposite side.  The modern alley of the same name serves as a reminder of these events.  Later, the Yaroslavl station was built, which was located next to the Red Pond.  Subsequently, the master F.O. Shekhtel worked on its reconstruction.  Thanks to his efforts, the station was made in the Art Nouveau style, with an admixture of elements of ancient Russian architecture.  Later, the Ryazan Railway was held.  Currently, it is called Kazan.  In place of the forest rows, the construction of a new station began.  The swamp was drained.  Olkhovets was enclosed in a pipe.  The forest ranks have disappeared.  The station building was erected in 1864.  It was later replaced by a more modern structure.  The architect A.V. Shchusev was responsible for the implementation of the project.  The Chechora River was enclosed in a pipe at the end of the 19th century.  Krasnoprudnaya street is located on the territory of the former wooden bridge.  Later, timber depots were organized here.  The pond itself was filled up. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rostov Komsomolskaya Square" class="if" height="235" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/475205.jpg" width="550"></div>
