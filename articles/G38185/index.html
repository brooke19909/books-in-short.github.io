  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to set up the Internet on the phone? Easy peasy</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Currently, Internet networks have grown around the world, and only newborns do not know what it is.  For some, the Internet is quite stable income, and someone simply can not live without social networks.  But the main goal of Internet technology is to obtain information. </p><p>  The frantic rhythm of life today does not allow us to tear ourselves away even for a moment from a mobile phone.  We are constantly on the move and may be needed at any time by friends, relatives or superiors.  It is for such purposes that this technological miracle was invented, which has already become an integral part of our life.  Nowadays, the exchange of information occurs thanks to a high-speed assistant. </p><p>  Most people who can use the World Wide Web don‚Äôt know how to set up the Internet on their phones.  Unfortunately, everything is not so easy and simple if you dig a little deeper.  In order for the Internet to work on your cell phone, you will need to configure this service.  The question arises: how to <span>set up the Internet</span> on the phone?  At first glance, it might seem that this is a very simple procedure.  Changing the configuration settings on the telephone is significantly different from setting up network access on a PC. </p><p>  Using a telephone option such as the Internet, you can receive news in a timely manner, for example, from a company in which you work, without carrying around a bulky laptop and other equipment.  The most convenient thing is that it will be possible to work and be in touch, even while on vacation with your family.  To do this, you need to know how to set up the Internet on your phone. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To gain access to Internet resources, you can perform one of the 2 proposed actions.  You can call the operator and find out how to set up the Internet on your phone.  But you can not spend your money and do it yourself after reading the detailed instructions below in this article. </p><p>  So, how to configure the Internet through the phone? </p><p>  I offer you three types of installation depending on your provider / operator.  A common function that must be present is support on the GPRS phone, which, of course, is available on most phone models.  Consider the connections from the three main cellular network operators in the Russian Federation. </p><p>  We start the procedure by connecting the GPRS service on your phone.  Despite the fact that this function is already available, the operator must activate the service.  As a test model to connect, take a Samsung phone. </p><p>  1. To <span>configure the Internet,</span> MTS subscribers need to go to Profile Settings, then create a new one and enter certain data.  In the Profile Name, enter ‚ÄúMTS‚Äù.  Home URL will be "wap.mts.ru".  In the Channel column, select GPRS Only. </p><p>  Disable proxies.  GPRS settings - DNS 1 / DNS 2, indicated on the operator‚Äôs website.  Next, enter the login "mts" and a similar password.  APN should be of this kind: "internet.mts.ru".  After the work done, save the settings. </p><p>  2. To set up Internet for Beeline subscribers, go to Profile settings, create a new profile or edit the old one.  In the Profile Name, enter "BEELINE."  Home URL should be ‚Äúwap.beeline.ru‚Äù.  In the Channel column, select GPRS Only. </p><p>  Proxy must be turned off.  GPRS settings - DNS 1 / DNS 2, indicated on the operator‚Äôs website.  APN do "internet.beeline.ru". </p><p>  Next, enter the login "beeline".  And a similar password.  After the work done, save the settings. </p><p>  3. Well, finally, to configure the Internet for Megafon-Moscow subscribers, we again go to Profile settings, create a new profile or edit the old one.  In the Profile Name, enter "MEGAFON."  Home URL should be "wap.megawap.ru".  In the Channel column, select GPRS Only.  Proxy must be turned off.  GPRS settings - DNS 1 / DNS 2, indicated on the operator‚Äôs website.  APN do "internet.msk".  Next, enter the login "gdata".  And the same password.  After the procedure, save the settings. </p><p>  After entering the profile settings, you need to restart the phone.  To use, select the profile that you edited, then go to the "native" browser and download a more advanced one.  For example, a browser for a Netfront cell phone. </p><p>  Now you know how to set up the Internet on your phone.  You can use all profiles.  To do this, you need to change the SIM card and activate GPRS.  Therefore, it is best to save all three profiles, but use the one whose SIM card is currently on your phone. </p>
