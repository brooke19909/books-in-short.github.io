Located in the resort city of Dubai (United Arab Emirates).  The tower soars to the sky at a record 828 meters.  This is a multifunctional complex where apartments and apartments, gyms, swimming pools and entertainment facilities, offices and catering facilities are located.  And 11 floors out of 163 are occupied by the Armani Hotel in the Burj Khalifa. </p><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbuilding the tallest building in the world in Dubai was born in the early 2000s.  The work started in 2004 and lasted 6 years.  Architects had to solve a number of complex problems.  To improve the strength of building materials, it was necessary to develop special grades of concrete that can withstand temperature extremes in the range 0 ... + 50 ·µíC.  In addition, ice was added when pouring it. </p><p>  Unstable sandy soil became another challenge.  To ensure the sustainability of a giant skyscraper weighing 500,000 tons, 45-meter ‚Äúhanging‚Äù piles were used as a foundation support.  And to reduce the effect of rocking the structure during strong winds, the building was given a complex asymmetric shape resembling stalagmite growing from the ground.  The grand opening of the unique new building took place on January 4, 2010. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.daytur.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Burj Khalifa Hotel, Dubai" class="if uuid-2592489" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2592489.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotel Armani (Burj Khalifa) </h2><p>  The cyclope construction could not fail to attract the attention of hoteliers.  Dozens of world-famous companies fought for the right to place a hotel here under their own brand.  An example of future success was the nearby Burj Al Arab hotel-sail, located nearby.  Ultimately, the best conditions were offered by the Armani firm, specializing in serving wealthy clients. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The hotel in the tower "Burj Khalifa" from the eminent Italian brand opened its doors in late 2010.  By the way, interior design was developed with the active participation of maestro Giorgio Armani himself. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.insydodubai.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel in the Burj Khalifa Tower" class="if uuid-2592471" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2592471.jpg"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  When searching for <span>Armani Hotel Dubai,</span> you need to focus on the Burj Khalifa skyscraper.  Armani Hotel is located in downtown Dubai in the Downtown area at Burj Khalifa, Sheikh Mohamed Bin Rashid Boulevard.  Nearby is the Financial Center Road junction.  Three kilometers of "stone jungle" (residential areas, office and banking centers, hotels and restaurants) separate the skyscraper from the Persian Gulf coast. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="25.1975148" data-lng="55.2748732" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/5/1/1/6/5116.png"></div><p>  The main form of transport in the city is a taxi.  From the international airport to the tower, the journey by car will take about 20 minutes.  Hikers should stick to Burj Khalifa / Dubai Mall Subway Station, 600 meters away from the sea.  Using the local metro, you can reach the most interesting places in the city.  Just keep in mind that less well-off residents also use it - emigrants from South Asia (India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, etc.).  However, the criminal situation in Dubai is safe. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  The 5-star Burj Khalifa hotel has 160 rooms of the following types: </p><ul><li>  luxury class; </li><li>  for non-smokers; </li><li>  for smokers; </li><li>  Family rooms </li><li>  for people with disabilities. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="myfashdiary.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Burj Khalifa Skyscraper, Armani Hotel" class="if uuid-2592504" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2592504.jpg"></div><p>  The cost of daily accommodation in double rooms is as follows: </p><ul><li>  Deluxe - from $ 430 (27,000 rubles); </li><li>  Classic - from $ 490 (30,800 rubles); </li><li>  Premier, residence - from $ 620 (39,300 rubles); </li><li>  Fountain - from $ 760 (47,900 rubles); </li><li>  Executive Suite - from $ 820 (51,300 rubles); </li><li>  Ambassadorial Suite - from $ 1,360 (85,500 rubles); </li><li>  Brand Suite - from $ 1900 (94 000 rubles.). </li></ul><p>  Located on the lower floors of the Burj Khalifa Tower in Dubai, the hotel offers a wide range of services.
