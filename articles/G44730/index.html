    <h2>  How to age paper at home? </h2><p>  Consider a few simple ways by which a piece of "ancient papyrus" can be obtained from a modern white sheet.  By the way, everything necessary for such a transformation can be found in every home. </p><h2>  Method One: Tea </h2><p>  To do this, you need to brew this drink of a certain strength (the color of the page will depend on this) and put a leaf there at night.  The next morning the paper will look as it was intended.  You can also experiment with gulls, they leave nice circles on paper. </p><h2>  Method number 2: Coffee with milk </h2><p>  The next way, telling how to age paper at home, involves using coffee with sugar and milk.  This finished drink needs to be poured onto paper, and then through a gauze to iron a leaf.  You will also need to work with the edges by tearing them manually. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to artificially age paper" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/330532.jpg" width="500"></div>  Method Three: Remember Lenin‚Äôs Grandfather </h2><p>  How to age paper at home if you don‚Äôt have any coffee or tea at hand?  Use milk.  So, you need to put the paper on a flat surface and paint over it thoroughly with milk with a brush.  Allow the sheet to dry, and then iron the iron through the iron.  The page will gradually turn yellow.  Please note: the fatter the milk, the darker the finished leaf will be.  This method is good to use if you want to give the product the look of paper miraculously saved from the fire.  The result is amazing! </p><h2>  Method number 4: Varnish! </h2><p>  And now we will tell you how to quickly age paper.  To do this, use <span>craquelure varnish,</span> which is sold in stores for artists.  They need to cover the surface of the sheet, and it will begin to crack, as it were, acquiring a certain shade.  However, it is worth mentioning that then writing on this paper will no longer work, so the inscription needs to be done in advance. </p><h2>  The fifth method, classic </h2><p>  But the easiest and surest way to age paper is to put it in the sun.  The process will be quite lengthy, however, at the same time, failures or any mistakes are almost impossible - the paper will age evenly. </p><h2>  Method number 6: Not for the faint of heart </h2><p>  There is another, but rather dangerous way, to age paper at home.  To do this, you need to put it in the oven for a certain time.  But in such a situation, it is very important to correctly calculate the temperature and time in order to avoid a fire.  Still, this method is better to use in extremely extreme cases. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to age paper quickly" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/330483.jpg" width="600"></div>  Edge processing </h2><p>  Understanding how to artificially age paper, do not lose sight of one very important point.  The edges of your "manuscript" should be at least slightly shabby.  The most true thing is to unevenly tear off the strips manually (the edges of the sheet can be moistened, so they will be easier to tear).  On top of all this you need to lightly scorch the flame of a candle, then the edge will look natural and very aesthetically pleasing.  If you want, you can also make some dark spots on paper (again with a flame).  Just hold your little leaf over the candle.  However, you must be extremely careful so that it does not burn through. </p>
