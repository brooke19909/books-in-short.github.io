  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is a buck: history of the origin of the term</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It is not known when this word appeared in Russian, but almost everyone knows what a buck is.  So affectionately called American dollars.  Over the entire history of the existence of this word in Russia, many jokes and jokes have been compiled.  Some get to the point that they call Pets Bucks and compare their growth with the growth of the dollar.  Everyone uses the word, but to explain where it came from in Russian is not an easy task. </p><h2>  What are your opinions on this? </h2><p>  The word "bucks" entered the Russian language from the vocabulary of the Americans.  Naturally, they use it for its intended purpose, that is, they call it their national currency - the American dollar.  In America itself, there are several versions of the origin of such a designation of its currency, what is the buck, where did this expression come from and what used to mean. </p><h2>  That's what deer skins used to be called </h2><p>  Indeed, the word buckskin literally translates to ‚Äúdeer skin‚Äù in English.  Deer skins and horns were the embodiment of wealth in Old England, since in the early period they were used as money.  Naturally, new settlers from England used this familiar expression in their new place of residence.  The first settlers of North America used this expression not only in relation to deer skins, but also to the skins of other animals that went on sale.  Therefore, what is the buck in Europe learned from ships loaded with deer skins and furs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="munster.sasktelwebsite.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the word bucks" class="if uuid-2998444" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57537/2998444.jpg"></div><p>  Skins of foxes, martens, beavers, and bears went into circulation.  They were not only mined by the settlers themselves, but also traded for some goods from the indigenous population, for example, for guns and matches.  In Europe, North American furs and skins were in great demand.  In addition, tax collection in animal skins did not cause riot even among Indians.  It was not difficult to get them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Gold and silver coins were in short supply at that time, and paper money did not inspire confidence.  Moreover, local officials often tried to pay with paper, but at the same time demanded that taxes be paid either with precious metal or furs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.history.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bucks word origin" class="if uuid-2998426" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57537/2998426.jpg"></div><h2>  It's all about coloring </h2><p>  Another version that such a buck was named due to the fact that one of its sides is gray and the other is green, in English green back ("green back").  But, firstly, if Americans call dollars "green backs", they pronounce the phrase completely, without abbreviations, that is - "greenbacks", which is another nickname for the dollar.  Secondly, the banknotes got their usual form and color today in 1913, when the Federal Reserve System was organized.  Prior to that, dollars were colorful, if not to say motley.  Each state had its own banks, which themselves printed money.  In one state, the money was green, in the other black and white, in the third - golden.  Each bank developed its own banknote design.  According to the law, the bank that issued the bill had to exchange it for gold at the first request of the bearer.  The owner of the banknote had only to find the issuing bank.  They did not inspire confidence, so in the United States almost until the very foundation of the Federal Reserve, the population gave preference to gold and silver. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="theconversation.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="two banknotes" class="if uuid-2998416" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57537/2998416.jpg"></div><h2>  Which version is more believable? </h2><p>  Of the two versions above, the first is most trusted, that is, dollars have come to be called "bucks" for a long time, and this word was first used to refer to deer skins, and then American paper dollars.  The fact that dollars are called bucks still speaks of deep memory.  This means that for a long time the country did not have a banking system that was credible, and all calculations were carried out either in kind or using expensive items: animal skins, gold and silver coins and bullion.  Therefore, what the word bucks means, and which version is more believable, is not hard to guess. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cincodias.elpais.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what the word bucks means" class="if uuid-2998456" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57537/2998456.jpg"></div><p>  There is another version of the origin.  In 1862-1863, a ten dollar denomination was issued, on the back of which a Roman numeral ten in the form of X was displayed.  Americans jokingly called such ten-dollar bills "saw goats" (sawback).  Where does the word "buck" pronounce at the end.  Soon, ten-dollar bills dropped out of circulation, and the name remained.  But this version is also less plausible, if only because the banknotes were not in circulation for long, and the name refers exclusively to one banknote.  Again, one of the many banks operating throughout the United States issued them.  This means that the name has not received wide distribution even in the United States. </p><p>  Whatever version of the origin of the word ‚Äúbucks‚Äù may be discovered and voiced in the future, it is unlikely that the American dollar will cease to be so called.  The word is well-aimed, convenient and best suits the character of this currency. </p>
