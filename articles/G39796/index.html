For each country, these signs are the same, they include the scepter, crown and power. </p><h2>  How regalia appeared </h2><p>  That this phenomenon takes its origin from antiquity can be argued unconditionally.  So, the ancestor of the crown was a laurel wreath, which was laid on the head of the winner of the competition.  Later, he turned into a symbol of honor, which was received by the military leader or official who distinguished themselves in the service.  From this tradition a crown appeared, which gained popularity in European countries in the early Middle Ages. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="regalia what is it" class="if" height="308" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/407440.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Monomakh hat </h2><p>  Russian royal regalia were especially luxurious.  A very remarkable attribute stands out among them - the ancient medieval crown, which, according to some historians, the emperor of Byzantium Constantine sent as a gift to the Kiev prince Vladimir Monomakh.  There is a version according to which, together with such a crown, the prince also received a scepter. </p><h2>  How did the scepter appear? </h2><p>  This attribute of state power also appeared in antiquity.  According to legend, the scepter was used by the inhabitants of Olympus Zeus and Hera, whom some ancient rulers and officials decided to imitate, considering it an indispensable symbol of dignity.  Interestingly, the most important persons of the state - emperors - did not use scepters.  However, already in the Middle Ages it was used throughout Europe, including Russia, where regalia was used during the wedding of kings.  That this happened in the same way, testifies to the story of a certain Horsey, who was an eyewitness to the coronation of Fyodor Ivanovich. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="royal regalia" class="if" height="408" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/407439.jpg" width="600"></div>

There are also not very popular royal regalia, among which are <span>family jewels,</span> sabers, swords and various ornaments.  They were made of gold, precious stones, including emeralds, rubies and sapphires.  Some of these jewelry are quite famous for their impressive size and incredible beauty.  In the British royal crown, for example, there is a very large ruby, which was nicknamed the "Black Prince". </p><h2>  When regalia was used </h2><p>  Rulers and important officials wore these state symbols of power during various ceremonies.  Monarchs, for example, used their regalia during meetings of foreign nobles or important exits.  Nevertheless, there were special jewels that were used exclusively in special cases, for example, the Great Imperial Crown, which was worn only during the coronation of royal persons, a queen or a king. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="royal regalia" class="if" height="493" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/407438.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <p>  The British monarchs even have a special diamond diadem, which the queen must wear during visits to foreign countries and ceremonial exits, which is even noted in the diplomatic protocol.  It was her that Elizabeth II wore during her official visit to Russia. <br>  The most significant symbols of power were created more than one century ago, this can be said about almost all the remarkable regalia.  What does this say to those who want to see them with their own eyes? </p><p>  The fact is that, given the value and antiquity of some symbols of power, today they are no longer used, and they are exhibited in museums.  For example, some important jewels are exhibited at the French National Museum - the Louvre.  In Copenhagen, in the castle of Rosenburg, you can see the treasures of Danish kings.  Even in Russia, you can see some royal regalia, which are stored in the <span>Armory,</span> or rather, in the <span>Diamond Fund,</span> which anyone can visit. </p><p>  Since ancient times, the symbols of power have been called upon to demonstrate the power of the state and the monarch himself and are still the subject of discussion for many historians, because so many secrets have remained hidden for centuries.  Regalia - that these are symbols of power, is controversial among our contemporaries, and this will remain unchanged for a very long time. </p>
