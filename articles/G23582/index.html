Needless to say, that its standard equipment significantly exceeds the divisional one. </p>

    <p>  As of 1943, the number of tanks in the Wehrmacht division was 200, but the reality showed much less equipment, about a third, which was caused by constant combat losses and technical malfunctions. </p><p>  The seventeenth <span>tank corps,</span> on the basis of which the Kantemirov Division was formed, had 180 tanks in service, with their absolute qualitative superiority over the German ones.  The number of T-34 ranged from 55-70, and there were also heavy KV, and light T-60, superior to <span>German tanks, which</span> formed the basis of the Wehrmacht technical park.  But the situation on the military scene was dramatic, despite the technical superiority of the Soviet armored forces.  Air dominance at that time was held by Nazi troops, which greatly impeded the successful work of our armored forces. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The corps received its formidable name, as well as the title of the guard, in honor of a small settlement, which was liberated by it with heavy battles, and then the number changed to 4th. </p><p>  There were heavy fights ahead, and the glorious tradition of giving honorary names in honor of the cities and villages liberated by the corps continued at the battalion level.  Stalingrad, Western Ukraine, Krakow, Dresden, Elba and, finally, Prague - these are briefly the combat path that the Kantemirov <span>Tank Division</span> passed <span>.</span> </p>

    <p>  Thirty-two division soldiers were awarded the title of <span>Hero of the Soviet Union,</span> 5 became full holders of the <span>Order of Glory,</span> and more than 20,000 people were awarded. </p><p>  A separate parade in 1946 was dedicated to Soviet tankmen, and Kantemirov‚Äôs tanks marched along Red Square.  It was September 8, and since then another glorious tradition has arisen - to celebrate the holiday of tankers on this day. </p><p>  In the post-war period, the Kantemirovskaya division was repeatedly reformed.  To her name was added the name of Yu.V.  Andropova.  Armament changed, additional units responsible for air defense (according to the experience of the Great Patriotic War) were introduced into the combat structure.  Self-propelled guns were added, including long-range howitzers "Acacia", capable of hitting targets with high accuracy at distances up to 24.5 kilometers, and self-propelled guns "Msta".  Motorized infantry was not left without attention, without the support of which tanks in a modern war could not do. </p>

    <p>  As for the Tor mobile defense complex, there are practically no equal to it.  The data on the number of all-weather stations possessed by the Kantemirovskaya Division are modestly silent.  The photo only demonstrates their presence in its military composition.  In service are also unmanned reconnaissance vehicles. </p><p>  In modern, unfortunately, not always peaceful conditions, the division has demonstrated its combat effectiveness and ability to defend Russia's interests and its territorial integrity. </p><p>  During the military reform in 2009, the Kantemirovskaya division was renamed.  Now this is the 4th Separate Tank Brigade.  However, there is hope that the glorious and formidable name will be returned to her.  You can‚Äôt refuse such a thing. </p>
