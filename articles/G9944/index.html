Year after year, he launches a dozen smartphones in different price segments.  Bluboo Picasso, reviews of which appeared not so long ago, remains to this day a budget smartphone, but not without quality and optimization. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The Chinese did not bother about the configuration.  The box is very simple and looks cheap.  But this can not be attributed to the minuses.  On the back side of the box are briefly the characteristics of the model.  An unpleasant surprise was the lack of one of the WCDMA frequencies.  Moreover, it is indicated on the box, but sellers are forced to sketch 900 MHz directly on the box in order to avoid claims from the buyer. </p>

    <p>  Inside is the smartphone itself, instructions are attached to it.  In addition, there is a charger, and the most budget.  A micro-USB cable and a cheap unit are only 0.6 A. There is no headset, there are no additional ‚Äúgoodies‚Äù either.  The only thing is that the protective film is already on the display. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  On Bluboo Picasso, you need to start your review with appearance.  At first glance - nothing unusual.  The front of the device is similar to many models in the Chinese market.  But his main ‚Äútrick‚Äù was the back panel.  It is made of high quality plastic.  It displays diamond-shaped patterns that are similar in style to the art of Picasso. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The texture of the back cover is pleasant to the touch.  It is rough, so the smartphone confidently lies in the hand and you should not be afraid of accidental falls.  The good news was that fingerprints do not remain on the rear panel.  The manufacturer presents a sufficient number of color solutions, but in the public domain you can often find a dark blue and golden model. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bluboo picasso camera" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1421334.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  All in places </h2><p>  When reviewing a design for Bluboo Picasso, you should pay attention to all the details of the case.  In front, the smartphone looks normal.  A conversational speaker is located above the screen, to the right of it is a flash for the front camera and the lens itself.  On the left is a notification indicator and <span>proximity</span> and light <span>sensors</span> . </p><p>  It should be said right away that the LED reluctantly displays alerts about events.  The notification indicator is very dim, and despite the variety of colors, the most noticeable is green, which warns of the end of charging.  Missed calls or messages may not be visible. </p><p>  Under the screen, the smartphone is free of any buttons or connectors.  On the back cover is a camera with a dual LED flash and a company logo.  The left end of the case is free, but the volume rocker and the lock button are classically placed on the right.  Also on the right side you can pry the back panel. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On the top there is a headphone jack and some other small hole.  In general, if you recall all Chinese smartphones, it could be a second microphone, but the manufacturer did not indicate this element of the case, and therefore it remains to guess what it is for. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bluboo picasso w3bsit3-dns.com" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1421331.jpg"></div>

    <p>  At the bottom there is a connector for the charger.  There are two speakers on the sides of it, well, at least they look like that.  In fact, one of them serves as the main microphone, but is stylized as an external speaker. </p><h2>  Under the hood </h2><p>  Bluboo Picasso users left behind reviews unflattering.  The thing is that the lid is made of fragile plastic, and at first it does not open very easily.  Therefore, there were troubles when, without calculating the strength, the owner could break the socket.  It should be careful and accurate when removing the cover. </p><p>  Below it is a 2500 mAh battery, as well as three slots: two for a SIM card and one for a memory card. </p><h2>  Ultra Budget </h2><p>  Considering that you can buy a Bluboo Picasso smartphone at a low price, you should not expect some kind of super-assembly from it.  You can find backlash if you want, creaks are also heard.  The back panel is very fragile and flexes when pressed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The dimensions of the device are compact.  It weighs 154 grams due to the fact that even the side edging is made of plastic, it is light.  Thanks to the rough back panel, the phone confidently lies in your hands and does not slip out.  Perhaps it would be worth working on the thickness of the case.  Given that the battery is only 2500 mAh, the thickness of 8.2 mm is somewhat not justified. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The Bluboo Picasso has a 5-inch display.  This is the best option for those who do not like "shovels."  <span>IPS matrix,</span> so the colors are natural, without too much artistry.  The sensor responds to a maximum of 5 simultaneous touches. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bluboo picasso review" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1421336.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Bluboo Picasso reviews on the screen receives not so encouraging.  In fact, the display is inferior to more expensive models.  It is not very saturated and displays a less detailed image. </p><p>  From different viewing angles, it slightly distorts the picture and changes colors.  But the brightness is enough for everyone.  You can comfortably use the phone in the bright sun and in the dark.  If the user does not like the color rendering, it can be adjusted in the settings. </p><p>  The sensor is not bad for a state employee.  There is enough working out for five touches.  The screen responds promptly, and the owners still have not noticed "phantom clicks."  Not very conveniently placed the on-screen buttons.  You have to get used to the fact that the Back command is now on the left. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  The smartphone is controlled by Android 5.1 with a new graphical shell.  Thanks to this, you can change the design of the system for yourself, using more than 20 wallpapers and eight themes.  ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù works adequately, without any problems.  OS updates are coming, which means you can hopefully get version 6.0 in the near future. </p><p>  No third-party software was found inside.  That is, before the buyer, ‚Äúclean‚Äù Android without unnecessary programs.  All "Google applications" are in place, so the desired is easy to find in the Play Store.  Basically, everything is standard. </p>

    <p>  Problems were found with the option "Gesture recognition."  More precisely, not with her work, but with the translation of the name.  Everything else in the smartphone is correctly translated.  By the way, there is even a ‚Äúdouble tap unlock‚Äù. </p><h2>  Operability </h2><p>  The Bluboo Picasso technical specifications surprised.  Again, it is worth recalling the price of $ 70 and a look at the equipment of the device.  Stable MT6580 processor runs on four cores.  For graphics meets the MALI-400 MP2 on two cores. </p><p>  The memory in the phone is more than enough.  For this price, you usually cannot find models with 2 GB of RAM.  The built-in here, by the way, is also enough - 16 GB.  From the "RAM" available to the user about 1400 MB, and the built-in - about 12 GB. </p><p>  In practice, the smartphone shows good performance results.  But do not rely on a gaming phone.  Here the "hit" games will go, but only at low graphics settings.  But with all standard software, the system copes well, without brakes and hangs. </p><h2>  Camera at work </h2><p>  Bluboo Picasso has a mediocre camera.  The manufacturer claims that both lenses take pictures with a resolution of 8 megapixels.  In practice, there are doubts, although there is still no information on interpolation. </p><p>  The main disadvantage of the main camera is that when you enter the application, Face Beauty mode is automatically turned on.  It is designed for portraiture, so it ‚Äúblurs‚Äù the background and removes detail.  Each time you have to turn on the usual ‚ÄúPhoto‚Äù mode to take a picture of the landscape or any objects.  If this part is very annoying, you can install third-party camera control software. </p><p>  Gets Bluboo Picasso reviews regarding the camera are mixed.  Many were absolutely satisfied with the quality of the images, and some users had quality problems.  This was especially observed among those who updated the system. </p>

    <p>  Upset and work double flash.  It is so bad that even a flashlight is dim from it, so there can be no talk of any pictures at night. </p><p>  <span>The front camera is</span> quite good.  Especially when compared to other budget smartphones.  Selfie photos turn out to be good, there‚Äôs no point in waiting for more from the front-end.  By the way, hoping for the front flash is also impossible, it is so dim that it does not play any role whatsoever. </p><p>  The videos are pretty good with FullHD resolution.  Detailing is lame in them, but 30 frames per second are generated, so the clips are not bad.  Sound is also recorded good, loud, but very sensitive, so all extraneous noise also remains on the video. </p><h2>  Longevity </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, the smartphone has a 2500 mAh battery.  The tester showed a little less, but the error in this matter is permissible.  Watching videos in an hour "spent" only 15% of the charge.  That is, the autonomy of the device is above average.  He can withstand continuous activity for more than five hours. </p><p>  According to the reviews of the owners, it became clear that with moderate use of the smartphone it lasts for a day and a half.  In some cases, he "lived" without charge for two whole days. </p><p>  The only problem is the charger with a power of 0.6 A. As a result, the phone charges from 0 to 100% for about 4 hours.  This time is very long.  But the problem is different.  The fact is that it will not be possible to acquire a more powerful z / y unit, since the model controller blocks a current with a force exceeding 0.6 A. </p><h2>  Addition </h2><p>  There were enough reviews of this model.  About Bluboo Picasso w3bsit3-dns.com has published several articles.  One of which was a selection of tips for purchasing accessories for this model.  A film is already pasted on the screen.  But it is best to buy a protective glass, which is considered more durable and durable. </p><p>  Also for Bluboo Picasso w3bsit3-dns.com advises to buy back panels.  Given that it is the pattern on the cover that attracts buyers, you can purchase several options.  If over time the dark blue color is tired, it can easily be replaced with sky blue or sunny yellow.  By the way, the back covers can be ordered in China, it is much easier to do than to find a smartphone of the desired color. </p>
