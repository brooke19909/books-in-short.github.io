Rhodes is a Greek island that every year collects a rich harvest from travelers eager to taste the blessings of European civilization, join the ancient history and world culture, and at the same time soak up the rays of the southern sun.  To think that all these joys are accessible only to the rich is wrong.  If you have a Schengen visa, then <span>rest on Rhodes</span> can be obtained for little money.  Especially if you spend a vacation in the hotel "Civil 3 *". </p><p>  What do tourists say about the hotel?  We analyzed them and made a small digest to give you the most complete overview of the conditions and services at this hotel.  Photos of the hotel will help you get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãit. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sivila Hotel 3 Rhodes" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1517582.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is the hotel Sivila Hotel Afandou 3 * located (Rhodes) </h2><p>  At the northeastern tip of the Greek island there is a small resort village of Afandou.  He is famous for two things.  First: the longest <span>beach of Rhodes</span> and, as reviews add, the most spacious.  Even in the midst of the holiday season, there is no feeling of crowding.  And the second attraction of Afandou is the largest golf course on the island.  Here in this village, not far from its center, on the third line from the sea, the Sivila Hotel 3 * is located. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Rhodes (the capital of the island where the international airport is located) is only twenty-two kilometers from the hotel.  Another village with a beautiful beach - Kolymbia - is located two kilometers away.  The nearest town, Faliraki, is just 5 km away.  In the summer, a small free "train" goes to the famous Afandou beach, with a stop in the most key sights of the village.  But four hundred meters can be easily overcome on foot in five to seven minutes.  The hotel is located one and a half kilometers from the center of the village of Afandou and is surrounded by its tourist infrastructure. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sivila Hotel 3 Rhodes reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1517590.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Territory, buildings </h2><p>  All the reviews of tourists suggest that the territory of the three-star Hotel Civil is small.  Nevertheless, there is room for parking, which is at the free disposal of guests, and a playground, and even a functioning Orthodox chapel.  The hotel is a two-story building.  In its basement there is a reception and a restaurant with a small outdoor terrace.  Having passed a large bright, stylishly decorated hall, you find yourself on a platform from where a staircase and ramp lead to the pool.  It has a sun terrace: umbrellas are sunny and sunny on one side, and a canopy on the other.  There is also a small pool bar.  A beautiful snow-white building with balconies was built in the ninety-fifth year of the last century.  And the last reconstruction it took place in 2012. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sivila Hotel 3 about Rhodes Afandou" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1517584.jpg" width="600"></div>

They all have balconies - even those few rooms that are located in the basement level of the building.  The hotel has two categories of premises.  The most demanded are standards.  These rooms are designed for comfortable accommodation of two guests.  The standard area is twenty-five square meters.  Guests can choose one twin bed or two single beds. </p><p>  A more expensive room category is a studio.  This room can accommodate even three guests, because the bedroom has a folding sofa.  A characteristic feature of the studio, which tourists described as a virtue, is the kitchen corner.  Those guests who paid for All Inclusive may not need it, but for those who had half board, the opportunity to cook their own meals was useful. </p><h2>  What's in the rooms </h2><p>  A kitchenette and a slightly larger room area - that‚Äôs all the difference between a studio and the usual standard.  Tourists liked the fact that all rooms have private balconies.  Of the equipment in the room, only watching TV is free (there are several Russian-language channels).  In order to get the remote control from the air conditioner, as well as the Wi-Fi code, you need to part with some money.  Tourists especially complain about the cost of Internet access: an hour - three euros, a day - ten, and a week - twenty-five!  Also paid is the filling of the minibar, which is present in the room, even for drinking table water you have to pay. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Tourists who visited the hotel Sivila Hotel 3 * (Rhodes) in June, noted the presence of mosquitoes.  But in general, the guests liked the rooms.  The furniture is good, new, the pillows are comfortable, the linen is clean and fresh.  You can ask for a hairdryer at the reception.  The bathroom has a shower.  They clean the rooms every day and very carefully.  Bed linen is changed twice a week. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sivila Hotel 3 Greece o Rhodes" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1517587.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The lion's share of tourists who visited the Sivila Hotel 3 * hotel (Rhodes), rested on the program "All inclusive".  What does ‚ÄúAll inclusive‚Äù look like in the Greek ‚Äútroika‚Äù?  All main meals are served in the hotel‚Äôs only restaurant.  Reviews warn that the Greek "All inclusive" is slightly different from the Egyptian.  Meals - strictly on schedule.  I did not have time for breakfast until half-past nine, be patient until dinner.  Or be satisfied with the snacks that are exhibited in the pool bar from half past ten to half past twelve.  Lunches and dinners are also on schedule.  From three o‚Äôclock to five in two bars of the hotel (in the lobby and by the pool) they are served desserts and ice cream, tea and coffee.  What about refreshing and strong drinks?  There is a small limitation.  At lunches and dinners, you can order soft drinks, draft beer and homemade wine.  Bars also do not let go of distillates and branded alcohol until five in the evening. </p><h2>  What tourists say about food </h2><p>  The meals at the Sivila Hotel 3 * (Greece, Rhodes) were varied and delicious.  There are always several meat dishes, often give fish.  Of course, there are always a lot of vegetables and seasonal fruits on the tables.  Children really like ice cream, sweet tooth - delicious desserts.  Greek wine - even table wine, homemade - is of very high quality.  All meals are varied - the menu changes every day.  In bars, Greek cognac and the like drinks are poured after five in the evening.  There are no queues at the buffet line even in high season, when the hotel is 100 percent full.  Reviews note the cleanliness in the snow-white room of the restaurant.  It is very nice to have a meal on the open veranda under a <span>canopy from the sun.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sivila Hotel 3 rhodes island kolymbia afanda" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1517588.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach and Pools </h2><p>  In summer, you can drive to the sea on a small tourist "train".  But walking to the beach of Afandou will not take more than ten minutes (and many reached there in five).  This coast is not in vain enjoyed fame throughout Rhodes.  Afandou beach is pebble, but the pebbles are so small and ironed by the sea that they resemble Montpensier.  A meter from the shore, sand is already starting.  Swimming in the sea is a pleasure.  After all, Afandu beach is awarded the ‚ÄúBlue Flag‚Äù from year to year - an award for environmental friendliness and well-being. </p><p>  However, reviews warn, with night swimming you should be careful - sea urchins are approaching the shore.  Afandou Beach is very long and long.  Even at peak season there is no sense of ‚Äúrookery‚Äù.  But umbrellas and sun loungers on the beach are paid, although it is possible to rinse with fresh water under the shower for that.  Sivila Hotel 3 * (Rhodes Island, Kolymbia, Afandou) has a swimming pool with a children's section.  It is surrounded by a spacious sun terrace.  Sun loungers, umbrellas and awning places are free for hotel guests. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sivila Hotel 3 greece about rhodes afanda" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1517592.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  On a small territory of the hotel there is a mini market, a currency exchange, a travel agency.  You can take the clothes to the laundry.  Jewelery will be better preserved if you entrust them to the safe at the reception.  But this service is paid (fifteen euros per week).  Bike rental is available.  The playground is equipped in such a way that in the afternoon the shadow from trees constantly falls on it.  A feature of the Sivila Hotel 3 * (Rhodes, Afandou) is that an Orthodox chapel is located on its territory.  Tourists liked that the rented car can be put on a guarded parking lot in front of the hotel for free.  The main bar has karaoke.  You can play table tennis outdoors. </p><h2>  Service and Facilities </h2><p>  Hotel Sivila Hotel 3 * (Rhodes) has a 24-hour reception.  Its employees speak several languages.  By the way, in the lounge, near the reception, Wi-Fi is free.  Therefore, tourists recommend booking rooms on the ground floor, not far from the reception - it catches there too. </p><p>  Civil 3 * is one of the few Greek hotels where pets are welcome.  But the dog must be medium or small breeds.  For the kids there is a swimming pool department, a playground with swings, a sandbox, etc., a playroom.  And for older children there are video games.  There is no animation in the full sense of the term in a hotel.  No one will force you to break away from beach reading and go do aqua aerobics or play water polo.  But in high season, the Greek Nights show is held for the entertainment of guests.  At the bar you can try your vocal abilities with karaoke. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Sivila Hotel 3 Rhodes" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1517594.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Excursions and independent trips from the hotel Sivila Hotel 3 * (Greece, Rhodes) </h2><p>  Afandou is a very ancient village.  Previously, it was located near the sea, but the pirates, who attacked coastal settlements for the sake of the slave trade, forced residents to settle deep in the mainland.  It is worth visiting the village church dedicated to the Mother of God. </p><p>  But Kolymbia was founded in the thirties of the last century, when the Italian fascists captured Rhodes.  The attraction of this village is the alley of eucalyptus trees that were planted in honor of the arrival of Mussolini. </p><p>  A trip to Archangelos, a small village famous for carpets and handmade ceramics, will be interesting.  For nature lovers, tourists recommend an excursion to Epta-Piges - Valley of Seven Springs.  If you walk barefoot through the tunnel where these cold waters flow, you can throw off a dozen years at once.  And the convenient location of Afandou between the capital of the island of Rhodes and the city of Lindos makes it convenient to travel independently to antiquities. </p><h2>  Hotel reviews </h2><p>  Tourists enjoyed their stay at the Sivila Hotel 3 * (Rhodes).  The reviews say that for a little money you get a whole range of services that you don't often find in the Quartet.  The hotel staff is very friendly, trying to please everything.  The food at the hotel is good and varied.  No animation was announced, but guests were surprised that the bar sometimes hosts shows and plays live music.  The administration still cares about the variety of leisure activities of its guests.  Bicycle rental is available for them.  Here you can play darts, pool, table tennis.  And near the hotel there is the largest golf course in Rhodes. </p>
