  <section class="page js-page"><h1>System analytical research method</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Every day a person has to face many problems, some of them require quick solutions, and some may be delayed for some time.  To make a spontaneous decision, they most often use intuition (when the answer comes at the subconscious level) or common sense (the decision is based on existing experience and a clear calculation).  The latter method, according to many scientists, is beneficial only in standard situations.  However, there are times when a decision must be correct and there is no right to make a mistake, because the outcome can be disastrous.  In this case, use a system analysis of the object of study. </p><p>  By analysis is meant mental work aimed at mentally dividing a specific object or situation into components in order to find the answer to a question of interest by studying them.  In system analysis, the object is a problem that is divided into subproblems.  This analytical <span>research method</span> involves the following procedures: <br>  - description of the object, <br>  - the operation of the facility, <br>  - development trends. <br>  This method is essential for solving problems in which it is impossible to be guided only by common sense. </p><p>  System analysis as a research method divides the existing problem into several classes: <br>  1) first class - problems with a certain structure and quantitative characteristics, <br>  2) the second class - problems with a weakly expressed structure, in which there are no clear quantitative characteristics, <br>  3) the third class - problems in which there is no structure. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The analytical research method for the second class of problems showed that it is impossible to use only mathematical calculations here, intuition and experience will also be required;  for the third class, it is necessary to transfer the problem to a higher level due to intuition and logic, and then look for a solution. </p><p>  The advantage distinguishing a systematic analysis of the object of research over other types of analysis is a deep awareness of the problem, based on the identification of connecting links, which is extremely useful for identifying non-standard solutions, as well as a clear understanding of the purpose and efficiency of resource use. </p><p>  However, this analytical <span>research method</span> has its drawbacks, the main among which is the inevitable incompleteness of the study, a fairly approximate <span>estimate of the effectiveness</span> and the inability to obtain an accurate forecast. </p><p>  It is worth noting that it is not possible to completely structure the system analysis as a research method, but the possibility of using some rules that have been confirmed in practice is: <br>  1) They recommend creating the maximum possible number of models to solve the problem, <br>  2) It is necessary to consider the problem both in a static and in a developing state, <br>  3) Use a deductive approach to solving the problem. </p><p>  To identify the correct solution, this analytical research method involves the selection of not only the task and its consideration, but also the coordination of the solution, based on existing practical data on its feasibility, on the basis of which a final judgment and a verdict on the decision are made. </p><p>  In many cases, the problems are mostly far-fetched, so before you begin to solve them, you need to ask a question about their relevance.  If the problem really exists, then it will have many related problems that develop along with it.  A very important point is the purpose of the study.  It is on its achievement that all the decisions received will be directed. </p><p>  Depending on the task, various strategies are used to solve the problem.  One of these is a system analysis that allows you to sort the situation ‚Äúon the shelves‚Äù and, with the right approach, find competent options for turning ‚Äúbad‚Äù into ‚Äúgood‚Äù. </p>
