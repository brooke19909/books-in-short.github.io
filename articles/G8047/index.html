LCD "Shuvalovsky quarry"</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Here, according to reviews, quite a lot of small roach and perch.  According to the observations of fishermen, the Shuvalovsky quarry (the map is presented in the article) is distinguished by an interesting relief - by the presence of depth differences from 2 to 4 m, separated from each other horizontally by 10-20 meters of distance.  There are also ‚Äúbanks‚Äù up to 50 cm deep. In winter, the Shuvalovsky quarry is usually empty.  Almost nothing is caught here at this time.  But some say that on the first ice can be quite a good bite.  And in April, when fringes are already appearing off the coast, the Shuvalovsky quarry attracts fans to pamper themselves with a small fry. </p>

    <h2>  Geography </h2><p>  The Shuvalovsky quarry is formed by a dam on the Kamenka River, flowing from the Suzdal Lakes and flowing into the <span>Lakhta Spill.</span>  The Kamenka Valley is known for the fact that sand has long been actively mined in it.  As a result, the Shuvalovsky quarry took on bizarre shapes and looked like a lake, whose green capes and islands amidst high sandy hills attracted nearby residents here who loved to swim, fish and have picnics here. </p>

    <h2>  History </h2><p>  Once a certain company made a promise to improve the Shuvalovsky quarry and create a recreation area here.  An armada of machinery was piled up on the south bank, a pine forest was cut down, and thousands of dump trucks pulled out sand.  The earth was deeply pitted - to the very clay.  The company suddenly stopped work surprising local residents and fishermen from St. Petersburg.  Shuvalovsky quarry was a hole filled with dirty water.  Then these spaces turned into a grand dump.  But over time, the outlines of the lake have changed.  Today, the quarry is at least slowly, but still comes to life. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Our days </h2><p>  At the quarry, which is located at the address: St. Petersburg, Primorsky district, st.  Zapovednaya, 55, as the authors of the reviews advise, you can drive through Kolomyagi or Parachutnaya.  The second way is more complicated - a road is being built here and you will need to go along gravel and sand.  On the street  Fresh asphalt is laid in the reserve, there are usually few cars, there is a forest around and a pond nearby.  Many consider the quarry a pleasant place to relax, to which, moreover, get very close. </p>

    <p>  Locals and fishermen say that in winter the ice here is very weak, because keys are being hit from the bottom of the quarry.  Wormwood forms above them, which are sprinkled with snow.  But, despite the danger, lovers of drift winter pokatushki often gather in these places.  It happens that cars go under the ice.  In addition, various driving schools conduct winter driving courses here, without coordinating their activities with the district administration of the city.  They bring with them tires that they don‚Äôt clean after classes.  In the spring, all the garbage left after the winter visitors visited the quarry drowns safely in the lake, cluttering its bottom. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Children's railway </h2><p>  To the north of the Shuvalovsky quarry is a children's railway.  Once upon a time they went to the factory of the Physicotechnical Institute named after  Joffe.  Now the road is in poor condition, the premises of the enterprise are rented by the Horizont pilot plant. </p><h2>  Test station </h2><p>  Not far from the quarry, a test station of the V.Ya.  Klimova, on which gas turbine engines for fighters and helicopters are designed, manufactured and serviced.  The enterprise plans to transfer 2 units located in the Vyborgsky district to the territory of the Primorsky district.  Expected deployment of the construction of new industrial facilities in the territory, occupying about 50 thousand square meters.  m, as well as major repairs of existing ones, laying of modern <span>engineering networks, installation of</span> new high-tech equipment. </p><h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  Many reviewers write that it pains them to see rubble collapses cluttering the quarry.  Departures here, according to holidaymakers, are excellent.  At the quarry you can take a walk and catch a fish.  But depressing piles of garbage on the shores.  To tidy up there, the authors of reviews reflect, it would turn out no worse than any park. </p>

    <p>  Enthusiasts tried to raise a question about the pollution of the Shuvalovsky quarry, but everywhere they received only unsubscribes.  Apparently, those in power have no interest in him.  Bloggers and environmental organizations urge career guests to respect nature, take their garbage with them and throw it in authorized landfills.  If everyone was sympathetic to this appeal, the quarry defenders could have avoided the unpleasant need to rest in the neighborhood of the landfill. </p><h2>  LCD "Shuvalovsky quarry" </h2><p>  Not so long ago it became known that the LSR group will be developing housing at the Shuvalovsky quarry.  In the north of St. Petersburg, LSR is planning the implementation of a new mass-market residential complex project.  It is expected that a plot of 30.9 hectares will be built up during 2014 - 2019.  Citizens will receive 420 thousand square meters.  m of housing.  At the moment, the first residential buildings of the quarter are already under construction. </p>

    <h2>  Perimeter </h2><p>  The territory is limited by Shuvalovsky Avenue, Parachute Street, a continuation of the streets of Glukharsky and Shuvalovsky quarry.  Previously, all this space was occupied by forest.  Now only a small part of it is preserved near Shuvalovsky Avenue - according to the general plan, over time, a square will be broken up here. </p><p>  If you believe the approved draft layout of the quarter, the construction of 3 new streets is planned along the perimeter.  One of them has already been named Orlovo-Denisievsky Avenue.  It will stretch north from Shuvalovsky Avenue to the Suzdal Highway.  The other two have no names yet.  It is known that they plan to build the embankment of the Shuvalovsky quarry.  In addition, a passage from ul.  Parachuting to the promenade.  The length of the quarry is planned to build two residential buildings, as well as a kindergarten.  Along the street  Parachute - shopping center, clinic and two more residential buildings. </p><p>  The residential complex "Shuvalovsky quarry" from the GDSK (the former name of the unit "LSR. Real Estate - North-West", engaged in development) will be represented by panel houses with seamless facades.  The implementation of a single architectural solution and the exterior design of all buildings is planned, their facade glazing is provided.  Each land plot includes the necessary places for recreation and walks, as well as playgrounds. </p><p>  The construction of the south side of the passage from Parachute Street to the quarry will be represented exclusively by parking lots, which are planned to be separated from the housing by a high-voltage power line. </p><h2>  Center </h2><p>  Five residential buildings, a kindergarten and a school will be built in the center of the block.  It should be noted that the square along Shuvalovsky Avenue remained preserved for agricultural use, it was not altered for recreation.  Therefore, it is possible that new settlers will have to observe how cabbage is grown under their windows or cows are grazed. </p>
