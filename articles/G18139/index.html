Most of the trains run here only in the summertime, when tourists from all over the country head south to enjoy a wonderful vacation.  There is no suburban communication as such, since there is a well-developed bus network, and it is generally possible to walk to some settlements. </p><h2>  Anapa </h2>

    <p>  The railway station in Anapa is one of the most important infrastructure facilities in the city; 3-4 million passengers pass through it annually.  Most tourists come here, of course, in the summer, when everyone wants to relax and forget about the difficulties accumulated over the year.  The Krasnodar Territory is very picturesque in the summer, and Anapa is especially beautiful in the evening, when the sound of the sea and a little wind create a romantic atmosphere here. </p><p>  The city is located on the Black Sea and is one of the most popular resorts in Russia.  About 70 thousand people permanently live here, all of them are somehow engaged in the tourism sector: some rent housing to vacationers, others organize vacations on the beach, and others are engaged in transportation.  Prices for food and housing here are quite reasonable, the main thing is to reach an agreement with the owners on time, because during the tourist season private houses, rooms in hotels and mini-hotels are bought up quite quickly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Railway station </h2>

    <p>  Railway station "Anapa", whose address Privokzalnaya street, 1, works around the clock, receiving and sending trains.  The station is a dead end: trains don't go anywhere further, so at the landing you can take your time and calmly get your things out of the train.  The station and the station were opened in 1978, in 2005 they underwent partial reconstruction and acquired a completely new look. </p><p>  The building of the station provides all the services necessary for the passenger: a hotel, a cafe, a relaxation room are operating, waiting rooms operate around the clock.  Pay attention to the fact that there is a room for mother and child, so if you suddenly need to swaddle a baby, you can use it. </p><h2>  Train station schedule </h2>

    <p>  Anapa waits for tourists all year round, so the station works without breaks and weekends.  There are three ticket offices in the building where you can purchase a ticket, as well as vending machines for printing travel documents.  One box office operates around the clock with lunch breaks, the other two only in the daytime.  However, many tourists have long begun to purchase electronic tickets on the Russian Railways website, where you can even choose a convenient carriage and location. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You should pay attention to the fact that the station is located at a distance of 7 kilometers from the city itself and you will need to get there by public transport or taxi.  Therefore, try to choose a train with such an arrival time so that you can leave for the city without any problems. </p><h2>  Public transport </h2><p>  If you do not want to use taxi services, pay attention to public transport that connects Anapa Train Station with the city.  We are talking about bus routes 100,113,120,127 and 129. Most of them are transit, the 120th route runs between the railway and the bus station of the city.  Using route No. 113, you can get to the airport from the train station, bypassing the paid transfers offered by travel companies. </p><p>  You can also use the services of a fixed-route taxi, which will take you anywhere, however, this option is not suitable for everyone, because it is not cheap.  Some locals are engaged in private carriage and offer to use their vehicles.  This is cheaper than regular taxi services, but if the traffic police stop the car, it may violate your plans. </p><h2>  Where can I go from here? </h2>

    <p>  In the event that you have any question, the answer to which you cannot find yourself, you can call the Anapa train station and clarify all the information you are interested in.  Contact phone number of the help desk is +7 (86133) 33186, please note that it works only on weekdays and in the daytime. </p><p>  If you go on a trip and take your pet or extra baggage with you, you will need to purchase special tickets at the box office.  It‚Äôs best to buy all travel documents right away, as they may not be available in the future.  When boarding, luggage will most likely have to be placed in a completely different carriage, so be prepared for the fact that you will have to rush to board the train.  An animal can ride with its owner; for pets, usually one carriage is allocated in each train. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Now that you know exactly where the Anapa train station is located, it‚Äôs easy to get tickets.  Please note: tickets for luggage and animals are purchased only when visiting the ticket office of the station, an electronic view of them is currently not available.  Russian Railways promises to rectify the situation, but it is still unknown when exactly the solution will be found. </p><p>  If you want to immediately enjoy the warm sea, it is not necessary to go to the city for settlement.  The Black Sea is only 1.5 kilometers from the railway station building.  You can get there on foot or use the services of numerous taxi drivers, alternately on duty at the station building. </p>
