    <h2>  Brief description of the mountain village </h2><p>  Locals from Soviet times, wanting to ski, went to Esto-Sadok.  Hotels marked with five stars, and modern routes were not there then.  But this did not stop athletes from enjoying their vacation in this wonderful place. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Over the past ten years, the village has grown markedly.  Now this is not a remote mountain village with eight hundred inhabitants, but a real center of winter recreation for Russians and foreign guests.  The resort has especially developed on the eve of the Olympics, but even now the construction of infrastructure has not stopped.  Every year Esto-Sadok is becoming more beautiful, which is confirmed by tourists who have come here for many years. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that some vacationers get to this resort absolutely by accident.  They simply drop out of curiosity after a tour of Krasnaya Polyana to Esto-Sadok.  Hotels, cafes, pistes and the general atmosphere are so amazing that many spend their next vacation here. </p><h2>  Location of the resort area </h2><p>  Most lovers of skiing believe that Esto-Sadok is located in a unique climate zone, which ensures it is so popular among tourists from all over the world.  The village itself and the ski slopes are protected by the ridges of the Caucasus, so there is almost never frost and piercing winds.  In turn, through the gorge, the warm Black Sea air freely penetrates here, which makes the riding conditions even more comfortable.  Professionals appreciate that here you can do what you love from December to May.  All this time, tracks are waiting for athletes and amateurs who only master skiing.  Indeed, many first time skiing in Krasnaya Polyana. </p><p>  Esto-Sadok (resort hotels offer rooms of any price category) is located almost immediately after it.  Local residents themselves cannot determine where the border between the two villages lies. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Most of the tourists, having arrived in Adler, do not stay in Sochi and immediately go to the resort.  Travel time from the airport takes no more than forty minutes.  However, please note that hotels in Esto-Sadka must be booked in advance.  Experienced travelers do this even in the summer, when you can easily find the right price and comfort room in your favorite hotel complex.  We will tell about the most popular of them in the following sections of the article. </p>

    <h2>  Resort areas of Esto-Sadka </h2><p>  Before you start choosing a hotel complex or an apart-hotel in Esto-Sadka, you need to find out what zones the resort is divided into.  After all, what routes you will ride directly depends on this.  Of course, all of them are well equipped, but still some tourists have their own preferences. </p><p>  There are three resort areas in the village: </p><ul><li>  <em>"Rosa Khutor".</em>  This place is considered the best for snowboarders and freestylers, because for them there are as many as five parks of varying complexity.  All are equipped with modern lifts and equipped with dozens of tracks, divided into several levels of difficulty. </li><li>  <em>GTZ Gazprom.</em>  The tracks and hotels of this resort are located at an altitude of one and a half thousand meters, so it is much quieter and calmer here than below.  In addition, the slopes are ideal for those who prefer cross-country skiing and leisurely walks in the woodlands.  The main highlight of this resort is the unique ring cable car, it stretches for more than five thousand meters. </li><li>  The most luxurious hotels in Esto-Sadka are in <em>Gorki</em> Gorod <em>.</em>  The most comfortable ski slopes are equipped here in the evening.  In addition, they are the longest. </li></ul><p>  If you want to explore all the ski slopes on your own, then do not choose hotel complexes and apart-hotels in Esto-Sadka.  In this case, it is best to stay in Krasnaya Polyana and from there go to conquer the mountain peaks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  List of the most popular hotels </h2><p>  Tourists coming to Esto-Sadok have a fairly wide selection from the mass of hotels represented at the resorts.  For our readers, we have chosen the most popular and famous: </p><ul><li>  Hotel "Alpika" (Esto-Sadok). </li><li>  Complex "Arcadia". </li><li>  Hotel Flamingo (Esto-Sadok). </li><li>  Hotel "Calypso". </li><li>  Hotel "Troika" (Esto-Sadok). </li><li>  Hotel "Polyana". </li><li>  Hotel Gala Alpik (Esto-Sadok). </li></ul><p>  For each of the listed hotel complexes, we made a brief review. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel "Alpika" </h2><p>  This complex has three stars, and therefore is suitable even for budget tourists who are not able to spend a large amount of money on vacation.  The hotel on two floors has only ten rooms, the average price per night is equal to nine hundred rubles. </p><p>  ‚ÄúAlpika‚Äù, judging by the reviews of tourists, is very well located.  For example, the Carousel cable car is located two hundred meters from the hotel.  And one of Gazprom‚Äôs lifts is a kilometer away. </p><p>  Apartments mainly have an area not exceeding fifteen square meters.  Some have their own bathroom and shower, while others suggest a sanitary room on the floor.  Everywhere it catches Wi-Fi perfectly, but you don‚Äôt need to pay extra for it.  A bonus for vacationers is a magnificent view of the mountains. </p><p>  From the reviews you can understand that in the summer it is pretty boring, but in the winter, vacationers always find something to do.  Many delights cause a guided tour of the cable car.  The disadvantages of leisure tourists include the frequent lack of hot water and food.  It is organized in a hotel on a rather mediocre level. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel Gala Alpik </h2><p>  This hotel is often called the most popular in the resort, because it offers a wide range of services at affordable prices.  By December, the hotel does not have any rooms left, so you can get here spontaneously only by a lucky chance. </p><p>  Guests are offered eight categories of rooms.  The cheapest of these is the double standard.  It costs two and a half thousand rubles a day, breakfast is already included in this amount.  A suite with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãtwenty-five square meters will cost nine and a half thousand rubles. </p><p>  Many guests are enthusiastic about the luxurious restaurant with a fireplace room.  The hotel also has saunas and a conference room.  Guests can leave their equipment brought from home in a special room for storage. </p><p>  The main negative comments relate to food at the Gala Alpik Hotel (Esto-Sadok).  His guests do not appreciate much, many lack only diversity, while others are not satisfied with the quality of the menu dishes. </p><p>  Esto-Sadok is an amazing place to relax from the bustle of the city and enjoy communicating with nature.
