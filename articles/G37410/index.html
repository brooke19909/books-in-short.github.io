    <p>  Consumer behavior is currently being studied by scientists, and in many universities this is a separate discipline.  Only relatively recently there was an <span>urgent need</span> for this subject, which is formed on the verge of several sciences: economics, psychology, marketing and management. </p><p>  For the development of the economy, it is important to know what the psychology of consumer behavior is: this allows you to increase sales and advertise goods effectively. </p><p>  To better reflect what is at stake, we note that the model is a simplified view of reality.  Thus, consumption patterns are stereotyped views on how a customer reacts to a product, what makes him shop and what product he ultimately chooses. </p><p>  <strong>Consumer Model “Common Wagon”</strong> </p><p>  Such a model is realized when a person seeks to be like the rest.  The "herd instinct" is still driving humanity, and, based on it, you can create the effect of "mass" in purchases to increase sales.  Numerous examples of advertisements demonstrate this with their characters: for example, products targeted for sale to medium social groups are most often advertised by people who are similar to the middle class.  The set for video advertising is set up like a small but cozy house or room without extra luxury, the heroes are dressed inconspicuously and often the plot is that one offers to try a product to another, and for the latter this is a whole discovery, he is grateful to his friend for that he made his life easier. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 2004-2009, often on television screens one could watch an advertisement of one Russian cosmetics for women with the following format: the heroine tells how hard it was to put up with age-related skin problems and that she discovered a brand that transformed her appearance .  Then another, “unaware” heroine appeared with the same problems, and the first shared her wonderful experience of transformation with her, and then handed a jar of cream.  The video ended with a happy expression on the face of the transformed (brighter painted, neatly combed and dressed in a more beautiful outfit) heroine, who now also uses this cream. </p><p>  Naturally, the spectators “bought” this trick, because on the screen there were heroines who looked like themselves with the same problems, and not ideal photo models, who were already fine with the skin.  When one hero transfers something to another in advertising, this is a clear sign of the “common carriage” model playing, and their visible social status shows who the product is oriented to. </p><p>  <strong>Consumer behavior "snob"</strong> </p><p>  This model is the opposite of the previous one, because  focuses on the fact that a person acquiring a product, becomes special, and clearly stands out from the "gray mass".  This is often found in car advertisements and among youth products that use youthful psychology.  The number of <span>youth subcultures</span> suggests that the problem of uniqueness and preservation of individuality is very important for young people, and therefore, to increase sales, such products are accompanied by the words: “unique”, “special”, “best”, “distinguish yourself”, etc. </p><p>  <strong>Demonstrative consumer behavior</strong> </p><p>  It is based on the fact that people choose a product at a price: the higher it is, the better the product.  And if the price threshold rises, then the demand for it increases.  The scheme works and vice versa: the lower the price of the product, the fewer people with this manner of consumption are ready to buy it. </p><p>  <strong>Consumer Price-to-Quality Behavior</strong> </p><p>  This idea of ​​purchases implies that not all expensive products correspond to high quality, so consumers try to be more attentive to the composition of materials, the ingredients of the product, thus evaluating its quality. </p><p>  <strong>Brand Loyalty Model</strong> </p><p>  In this case, buyers choose a brand that they trust and are ready to purchase unusual products or novelties of typical products. </p>
