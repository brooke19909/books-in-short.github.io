  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to choose an LCD TV: description, specifications</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Modern household appliances not only pleases the eye with its beautiful design, but also amazes with its characteristics and functionality.  Current TVs are already very different from those that were in use 10 years ago, the more they do not go to any comparison with models of twenty years of exposure and older.  Today, even in them there are many related functions that are very useful to the owners of this entertainment equipment.  But now consumers are again faced with an important question: ‚ÄúWhich TV is better to choose - LCD or LED?‚Äù  Also, people are interested to know which manufacturer of equipment is worth buying.  We will discuss this in more detail in the article. </p><p>  In terms of design, colors and functionality, all modern models are at a high level - crisp and clear image, rich colors, excellent signal.  All this has already become commonplace and it is difficult to surprise a customer with any of these advantages.  Moreover, literally all models and manufacturers are now demonstrating this.  But then how to choose a TV for home?  Or take any, focusing only on the fact that the design is suitable for the interior?  Consider below what TVs are and what you need to pay attention to when choosing this device. </p><h2>  <span>Types of TVs</span> and their features </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.popsci.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to choose a lcd tv" class="if uuid-3077136" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/3077136.jpg"></div><p>  The choice of TV is now very difficult, since the range of these popular devices is unusually wide and varied.  And first of all, you need to understand how you represent the appearance of the TV and which matrix you prefer.  But what if, if you have not decided yet, which TV is better to choose - plasma or LCD?  True, plasma screens are still very expensive today and are available with large sizes on a diagonal, which are more convenient to watch in a home theater rather than in an ordinary room, so ordinary people living in standard houses or apartments can choose from among liquid crystal models.  But here everything is not so simple and narrowing the search circle does not simplify the task in any way, only now the question sounds a little differently - how to choose an LCD TV for home? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are four varieties of liquid crystal devices on the market, made using different technologies.  We give some ideas about each of them, as well as about plasma panels, since they also have many hunters.  So, how to choose an LCD TV. </p><p>  The most common type of LCD, the so-called LED-TVs.  For their manufacture, LED backlight technology is used, which is very popular today and in the vast majority is the most popular.  At one time, she very quickly replaced other types of backlights and single-handedly captured the TV market.  Today, other innovative technologies are breathing in her back, but so far this type of TV remains the leader in sales.  These devices are light and convenient, can be put on a pedestal or hung on a wall - they are thin and small-sized, save space and do not heat up. </p><p>  To less puzzle over how to choose an LCD TV, you should learn about the features of each variety.  And then you can make your choice in favor of a particular performance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.popularmechanics.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="choose a good lcd tv" class="if uuid-3077521" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/3077521.jpg"></div><p>  TN - provides a viewing angle in the range of 90-150 degrees, has the best response time and very affordable prices.  Color reproduction may not always be accurate. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  IPS - here the viewing angle is already much larger - about 178 degrees and the most complete range of colors and shades. </p><p>  VA / MVA / PVA is a technological mixture of the two previous types, which also has a wide viewing angle - 176-178 degrees.  She also has a quick response to the matrix signal.  This variety is characterized by a deep shade of black. </p><p>  PLS - this variety has such advantages - higher pixel density and lower power consumption compared to IPS, whose modification is PLS. </p><p>  All these models are good in their own way and can please your family for a very long time.  Therefore, how to choose the right LCD TV from the presented groups will mainly depend on the level of financial security of the buyer.  The cheapest devices are of the TN type, then prices increase and the most expensive of the LCD TVs is the PLS type.  LED TVs are very widely represented in the distribution network.  Among them, you can choose the best model for any price category. </p><h2>  OLED TVs.  Description and their features </h2><p>  Today, not only electric lamp televisions are falling into oblivion, but plasma panels are losing their popularity, giving way to new technologies.  Worthy representatives of the TV family are LED-TVs.  They are made using new technologies.  Next, we will tell you how to choose an LCD, LED TV among the most modern models. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sg.theasianparent.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="choose LCD TV or plasma" class="if uuid-3078094" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/3078094.jpg"></div><p>  OLED TVs are based on organic light-emitting diodes and are a completely new word in television technology.  These models have an even thinner monitor and a wider viewing angle.  They have high contrast, the lineup consists of TVs with large screens and these new models are quite expensive.  They successfully compete with plasma TVs.  And wealthy buyers have a question about which TV to choose - LCD or plasma?  OLED screens do not have a backlight, because each of their pixels independently emits a glow when electricity is received.  These are the distinguishing features of OLED screens.  Next we talk about the QLED model. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  QLED type and SUHD.  Description of technologies and their features </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.adorama.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to choose a lcd tv for home" class="if uuid-3077133" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/3077133.jpg"></div><p>  QLED also belongs to the latest technological advances and has a quantum dot screen.  Its characteristics are similar to the previous type, but also less energy-consuming - it consumes 30% less energy than its counterpart.  The display here can be not only flat, but also round, curved and any other shape.  If you want to choose a good LCD TV, then the QLED type is a very worthy option.  By the way, many people pay attention to this particular species.  Since this technology provides ultra-clear color reproduction due to the fact that a minimum of distortion is introduced into the light structure.  The viewing angle is so wide that the picture is not distorted on either side. </p><p>  SUHD is a super high definition technology that is used in the latest TV designs.  But this is not the limit in the development of television gadgets.  It is expected that the ultra-modern devices with flexible panels that can be rolled up like a carpet, or modular units that can take on any shape at the request of the owner, will soon appear on the market.  With such a variety of market offers, it will be even more difficult to choose an LCD TV in terms of parameters. </p><h2>  The diagonal of the device (in inches) is an important selection criterion </h2><p>  What characteristics are important for choosing a TV?  However, let's return to today's day and continue to consider what characteristics should be considered when choosing a home TV.  Whatever type of TV you like, an important parameter in the quality of its work will be the resolution and size of the screen diagonal.  Thinking about which TV to choose, LCD or LED, the first thing you need to decide for yourself is what size will suit you and will be optimal for the room in which the new TV will be installed. </p><p>  So that the screen does not turn out to be too large, for which it will be very difficult to keep track of from a close distance, or too small, the image of which will be difficult to distinguish from a long distance, you should know the distance from the viewer to the screen.  At this distance, you can choose the optimal screen size with which it will be most comfortable to spend quite a long time.  There is a gradation of the dependence of the screen size (in inches) on the distance to the viewer: </p><ul><li>  24 "- 1.8-2 meters; </li><li>  28-32 "- 2.5 meters; </li><li>  40-43 "- 3 meters; </li><li>  49-50 "- 4 meters; </li><li>  55 "- not less than 4.5 meters. </li></ul><h2>  TV resolution </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.skynettelecom.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to choose a led tv" class="if uuid-3078085" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/3078085.jpg"></div><p>  Depending on the size of the screen, it will be clear how to choose an LCD TV for home.  The characteristics of the device are primarily represented by its resolution.  So, with a diagonal size of 32 or less inches, in order for the picture quality to be good, the resolution should correspond to HD 1366x768.  This is the optimal resolution for kitchen televisions or installed in small bedrooms. </p><p>  More often, for budget televisions with a diagonal larger than 32 "FullHD 1920x1080 resolution is used. With this resolution, the video image is displayed without distortion. </p><p>  For screens over 43 inches, 4K / UltraHD 3840x2160 resolution is used.  With it, the horizontal to vertical ratio is 16: 9.  There is also a resolution of 7680x4320 pixels for large screens. </p><p>  If you do not know how to choose an LCD TV with this option, pay attention to its description.  If you see the abbreviation HDR or HDR10, be aware that the first indicates a high level of contrast of dark and light tones, as well as additional shades on the display of blue, red and green.  On a television with such markings, the image takes on very realistic forms.  The second format provides support for shades at a depth of 10 bits, which greatly enlivens the picture, making it as close as possible to reality.  And sometimes it is with HDR10 that we see on the screen an image even more realistic than the real reality. </p><h2>  Device response time.  What is this parameter and how important is it when choosing a home appliance </h2><p>  What else you need to know and how to choose an LCD TV for home?  The characteristics of modern TVs are very numerous and, of course, important.  Another ability of the device for the home should not be ignored - this is the response time.  It indicates the rate of movement of liquid crystals from horizontal to vertical.  If the indicator is above 8 ms, some problems may arise when viewing fast-paced scenes - the edge may seem blurry.  With a decrease in the value of the indicator, dynamic scenes will look more qualitatively and naturally. </p><h2>  The sound quality of the device.  Which will be perfect </h2><p>  So how to choose an LCD TV for home?  Another important factor to consider when choosing is the sound quality.  Modern ultra-thin TVs are not able to provide the power of sound, because in their insides there is not enough space for a high-quality speaker system.  However, with each new development, the quality and sound power are noticeably improved.  If this feature is important for you, pay attention to models with stereo speakers providing power above 20 W, a built-in subwoofer Dolby Digital-system. </p><h2>  Curved model.  What is the advantage of such a TV and why should it be purchased </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.wisegeek.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="which lcd tv is better to choose" class="if uuid-3078083" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/3078083.jpg"></div><p>  So how to choose an LCD TV?  Such an important detail as the viewing angle has already been said.  It should only be added that the larger it is, the more convenient it is to watch it from the side points.  Ask sellers for models with a viewing angle of over 170 degrees.  Another little tip - choose devices with a curved monitor.  This trick provides a full degree of immersion in what is happening on the screen, but this happens only when two conditions are fulfilled simultaneously - you need to be opposite to the highest point of the bend of the screen, and the diagonal of the screen should not be less than 55 inches. </p><p>  A large role in choosing a TV is played by the diagonal of the screen.  It can be very small - 26 inches, or just giant - 180 inches.  The diagonal range is very large, but you do not need to think that the larger the screen, the better the TV.  How to choose the right screen size has already been mentioned above.  We can only add that, according to science, the distance from the screen to the viewer should be about four diagonal lengths. </p><h2>  Functional features of the device are an important criterion. </h2><p>  Which LCD TV is better to choose?  Seriously can affect the choice of the richness of the functionality of the device.  Since today TV is not only a means for watching TV shows and television films, but also has much greater capabilities and performs many additional functions.  For example, the ‚ÄúSmart TV‚Äù function is very popular among today's customers, because using a smart TV you can now not only watch videos or play games, but also surf the Internet, and even connect with friends on social networks, download applications and games.  Such TVs have different platforms.  One of the most popular is the Android platform, known to everyone on smartphones. </p><h2>  TV interface.  What should be equipped with a good LCD TV </h2><p>  Talking about how to choose the right LCD TV, you need to identify the role of the interface.  Thanks to him, various external media are connected to the device.  If it is not equipped with the necessary ports, then no function will work.  Therefore, the TV must have a USB port through which it connects flash drives, hard drives, smartphones, cameras and other devices.  Then you also need HDMI to be able to connect to a personal computer or laptop, use a game console or video server. </p><p>  If you need a TV for entertainment, then you should choose a model where there are more HDMI ports, where you can connect several other gadgets at the same time.  There must be a LAN port for connecting to the Internet, and then the TV will be able to access the network without Wi-Fi.  And also pay attention to the presence of the AV port, which is needed in order to connect audio equipment. </p><h2>  Device power consumption </h2><p>  You also need to pay attention to the power consumption and life of the TV.  LCD TVs consume much less energy than tube TVs, and if the screen size is small, then they are very economical devices.  But the larger the screen, the higher the consumption.  For example, an LED TV uses an average of forty to 300 watts per hour.  OLED models are more economical in terms of energy; they have a special energy-saving mode and intelligent backlight control. </p><h2>  TV service life.  Which model is it longer </h2><p>  In terms of service life, everything is clear here - the longer the period, the better the TV, and the more expensive it is.  Modern TVs last twenty to thirty years, but should you pay extra for such a long period of use if completely new technologies are already knocking on the door?  But everyone will decide for himself.  LCD televisions are designed on average for 50-100 thousand hours or 6-11 years of operation.  After this period, he, of course, will not cease to function, but will slowly lose the brightness of colors. </p><p>  It remains to consider the question: "Which company to choose an LCD TV?"  One thing can be said about this - there are many ways to find out which company is better, starting from the advice of friends and ending with rating surveys on the Internet.  But from the point of view of logic, preference should be given to those companies that have long been known in the market, have a good reputation and have been manufacturing TVs for quite some time.  Each serious company in the process of developing new models seeks to improve them more; therefore, it pays more attention to the quality of its products. </p><p>  The highest reliability of the Sony brand.  Following are Samsung and LG.  Then come brands like Philips, Panasonic and Toshiba.  There are other less well-known and trusted companies, but we will not indicate them in the article, since there is no confirmation of their reliability. </p><h2>  Which is better and why </h2><div class="photo" data-original="mybroadband.co.za" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to choose a lcd tv for home specifications" class="if uuid-3077168" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/3077168.jpg"></div><p>  It remains to summarize - which is better: LCD or ICE?  This question worries a lot of people.  It should be said that both of these TVs have a liquid crystal base, but use different backlights.  LCD TVs use fluorescent lamps with cold cathodes, which makes the black color lighter, and LED models use LED backlighting on the sides, and often around the perimeter of the matrix used, which gives a thick black color and stronger contrast.  LED TVs are more energy efficient - that‚Äôs all the difference. </p><h2>  Little conclusion </h2><p>  In this material, different types of TVs were considered, their features and differences, and also the main characteristics of individual types are given.  It can be seen from the article that, in fact, the choice comes down to two types of TVs - LCD and LED, the differences between which are minimal.  Both the one and the other TV with the right screen size will bring joy to its owners and will make good company on long winter evenings. </p>
