The next year is dedicated to the dog, which means that the crocheted dachshund will be a wonderful addition to this wonderful winter holiday. </p><h2>  Mi-Amigurumi </h2><p>  Our crochet dachshund dog will be crocheted in a very interesting style - amigurumi.  This is a Japanese trend in needlework, when all the toys are cute, with rounded features and simplified graphics. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet dachshund" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2100468.jpg"></div></h2><p>  Our dog is no exception: due to the fact that we chose this breed, it will be very simple to stylize it under the Japanese Amigurumi style.  In addition, given its small size, the toy will look very cute and will fit even in the smallest gift box. </p><h2>  Unfamiliar signs </h2><p>  To crochet a dachshund, you need to know some abbreviations that are often used in knitting circles.  Of course, if you are a skilled craftswoman, then you are unlikely to need this information, so feel free to skip this point and proceed to the next. </p><p>  But if your knitting career is only at the very beginning of the path, then do not neglect this point, which can be very useful. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  RLS - SC.  This is the main way of knitting in all amigurumi toys, because in this way the loops are obtained tightly lying to each other, so that the fabric comes out whole. </li><li>  CCH - reverse RLS, double crochet. </li><li>  PB - increase. </li><li>  UB - decrease. </li></ul><h2>  Everything you need </h2><p>  Now that we have understood the notation, we can discuss all the materials from which we crochet a dachshund.  Everything that you find on this list, you can find in any store for creativity or needlework. </p><p>  In addition, you should not take the listed materials too seriously, since the crocheted dachshund can consist of absolutely any materials that you don‚Äôt have to buy, but can be found at home. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet dachshund" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2100481.jpg"></div>

    <ul><li>  Yarn.  We will use several colors to make the toy more colorful and festive.  So, we will prepare a dark color for the nose and ears of the dog, and use the other main color for the head, body, legs and tail.  We also take small colored trimmings of yarn to create stripes on the body of the toy.  There are also no restrictions on the composition, so rely on your preferences and the desired result. </li><li>  Filler.  It is also worth choosing based on personal preferences.  We will choose the usual synthetic winterizer, because it is not only very light, but also holds its shape perfectly. </li><li>  Eyes.  You can buy them at the store or use buttons, beads of dark colors, found at home. </li><li>  And of course, a hook matched to your thread thickness. </li></ul><h2>  Crochet Dachshund: Description </h2><p>  We will start knitting from the dog‚Äôs head, namely from the nose: we will make the amigurumi ring from the darkest yarn and knit 6 crochet into it.  In the second row, we begin to make an increase (PB) every second loop, in the end we get 18 single crochet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet dachshund description" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2100478.jpg"></div>

In the next row, we again reduce every third column, at the end of the row we have 9 loops.  At this stage, knitting of the nose ends, and the head of the toy begins, already knitted with the main color yarn. </p><p>  In the fifth row we make an increase (BP) every third loop and get 12, in the next every fourth loop and get 15 single crochet.  We simply knit the seventh row without performing any actions with crochets.  Then we continue in this way: </p><ul><li>  4 (RLS), (PB) ... = 18 (RLS). </li><li>  18 (RLS). </li><li>  5 (RLS), (PB) ... = 21 (RLS). </li><li>  21 (RLS). </li><li>  6 (RLS), (PB) ... = 24 (RLS). </li><li>  ... (do not forget to insert or sew eyes). </li><li>  9 (RLS), (PB) ... = 33 (RLS). </li><li>  19-23 rows: 33 (RLS). </li></ul><p>  Now we begin to reduce every tenth single crochet, and in the next row every fourth.  As a result, we get 24 loops and do not forget to fill your head with filler, carefully distributing it inside. </p><p>  After stuffing, we continue knitting, making a decrease (UB) every third loop, and then every second.  At the end of the row we get 12 loops, which we decrease, making contractions each loop (total at the end of 6 single crochet). </p><h2>  Endless body </h2><p>  A crocheted dachshund will never look like itself unless you make it a long body that makes it so recognizable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet a dachshund" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2100486.jpg"></div>

    <ol><li>  Again we make an amigurumi ring and 6 columns into it. </li><li>  Now we begin to make increases (PB) in each loop, after which we get 12 single crochet. </li><li>  Now add loops every second column = 18 single crochet. </li><li>  Every third = 24 (RLS), and then just knit all the resulting single crochet columns in the next row. </li><li>  Again, increase the number of loops in every fourth loop = 30 (RLS) and again we knit all of them in the next row. </li><li>  4 (RLS), (PB) ... = 36 (RLS). </li><li>  9-11 rows: 36 single crochet </li><li>  10 (RLS), (UB) ... = 33 (RLS). </li><li>  13-14 rows: 33 single crochet. </li><li>  9 (RLS), (UB) ... = 30 (RLS). </li><li>  16-17 rows: 30 single crochet </li><li>  8 (RLS), (UB) ... = 27 (RLS). </li><li>  19-32 rows: 27 single crochet </li><li>  7 (RLS), (UB) ... = 24 (RLS). </li><li>  We stuff the body with the filler, carefully distributing it over the entire surface and removing the lumps. </li><li>  2 single crochet, (UB) ... = 18 single crochet. </li><li>  1 single crochet, (UB) ... = 12 single crochet. </li><li>  Fill the body to the end and reduce the remaining loops 6 times. </li></ol><h2>  Ears, legs and tail </h2><p>  To <span>crocheted a</span> dachshund captivate everyone around her, she lacks funny ears, short paws and a tiny tail. </p><p>  We start all the same with funny dachshund ears, which usually hang down.  As always, knitting starts with an amigurumi ring and 6 single crochet stitches.  Then, according to the old pattern, we begin to make increases in each row until we get the desired width. </p>

    <p>  Then with the number of loops we knit a couple of rows, after which we begin to make decreases, but not until the end, leaving about 9-10 loops.  Now we fold the eye in half and sew it along the outer edge, after which we create a second copy and set it aside. </p><p>  Paws are also created for this motive, but with one exception: they do not require any reduction.  After you have tied a small ‚Äúcap‚Äù, scored the desired height and filled it with a synthetic winterizer, boldly cut the thread more authentically (so that later you can use it to sew paws to the body), knit three more legs and again lay the parts aside until assembly. </p><p>  The tail is no different from the parts of the body that preceded it, except that only 4 single crochets are knitted into the amigurumi ring, then a couple of increases, stuffing, and that's it, the tail is ready! </p><h2>  Piecemeal </h2><p>  In this form, our dachshund, crocheted, does not exactly impress others, so let's put it together.  Moreover, it does not take much time! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet dachshund dog" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2100487.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  We fix the ears to the head with pre-prepared threads and hide the unnecessary ends of the yarn inside the toy.  Sew paws to the dachshund body, placing them symmetrically between each other, as well as the tail and head. </p><p>  If the packing is slightly knocked out of its paws, tamp it tightly so as not to create voids in the legs, since the ability of the dog to stand on its own depends on them.  Do not forget that the tail of the dachshund should be directed upwards, like the head. </p><h2>  In the end </h2><p>  Now that the wonderful dachshund created by crochet is ready, you can enjoy the result with pleasure.  The toy turned out to be very miniature, but also soft and pleasant to the touch. </p><p>  If you still want to add festivity and New Year's mood to our dachshund, you can tie a Christmas ribbon with bells on her neck or whip up a small cap of red felt. </p><p>  In addition, due to the size of the product, they can decorate the Christmas tree by sewing a ribbon to the back, or just put the dog in the New Year's package along with the rest of the gifts.  Although in fact such a toy can independently cope with the role of a <span>New Year's</span> gift <span>.</span> </p>
