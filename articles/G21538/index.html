  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sociology of Conflict</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  With the development of society, not only new scientific and technological achievements appear, but relations between people develop and become more complicated.  There are more <span>and</span> more <span>types and types of conflicts</span> that involve an increasing number of people in them, each of which has its own values ‚Äã‚Äãand interests. </p><p>  <strong>Sociology of conflict</strong> specializes in a comprehensive study of situations in which the interests of people clash.  The causes of the clashes can be a variety of problems, for example, <span>material values,</span> power, personal relationships, etc.  Conflicts cover absolutely all spheres of human life, all types and types of social relations and interactions of individuals in society. </p><p>  <strong>The sociology of conflict</strong> studies the subjects and participants of conflicts, which are individuals, as well as <span>social groups</span> and entire organizations.  <strong>Social conflict</strong> - a clash or confrontation of several participants in social relations, seeking to defend their own values, needs and interests. </p><p>  The theory of conflict in sociology in world practice has been considered and studied for a long time.  The main merits in the study of this problem belong to <span>Lewis Coser,</span> Ralph Darendorf and Kenneth Boulding.  <span>In Russia, the sociology of</span> conflict as a scientific discipline has more applied character.  On the basis of her research, only the first steps are taken to generalize the problem, and the formation of scientific concepts begins.  In connection with these, the need for understanding <span>conflict situations</span> as a social phenomenon in order to rationalize it and give it civilized forms remains urgent. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Conflicts are an inevitable part of the development of society.  Their essence boils down to the relaxation of emerging psychological tension between the parties involved.  Conflicts help individuals to mutually adapt and lead to positive changes in the development of problem situations. </p><p>  The problem is that often social conflicts are open negative in nature, which leads to destabilization in relations, violates social community and harmonious relations in groups. </p><p>  <strong>Conflictology in sociology is</strong> looking for ways out of the negative consequences of conflicts of human interests in society, and also develops ways and methods to smooth out conflicts and translate them into a positive channel. </p>

    <p>  Conflicts affect such areas of society as the economy, the social sphere, national relations and many others.  In this regard, it became necessary to <strong>classify</strong> these social phenomena.  Such large groups were identified as personal conflict (within the personality), interpersonal (between two or more people), intergroup (between social groups with opposite interests), conflict of belonging (when an individual belongs to several competing groups), conflict with the external environment (between group and its social environment). </p>

    <p>  Social conflict can be divided into separate types that characterize them in terms of motives for the occurrence of these problematic contradictions. </p><p>  <em><strong>Confrontation</strong></em> is a confrontation in a closed, passive form.  As a rule, groups with opposing economic, political, and social interests participate in it. </p><p>  <em><strong>Rivalry</strong></em> is manifested in the form of a struggle for the recognition of certain personal achievements, creative abilities by a society or a social group.  Rivalry is aimed at achieving the best positions in society. </p><p>  <em><strong>Competition</strong></em> is a separate type of conflict relationship, the main goal of which is the motive for obtaining a profit or even a very real profit. </p><p>  In separate subgroups, the sociology of conflict distinguishes fights, debates, games, and some others. </p>
