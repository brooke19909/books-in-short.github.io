    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Hammamet has a long history.  It was founded more than five centuries ago.  The name of the resort from the Turkic language translates as "place for swimming."  Since ancient times, the city has been popular as a vacation spot, as evidenced by the ruins of baths, pitchforks of Roman citizens and other structures found by modern archaeologists.  Many celebrities rested in the city at different times: Maupassant, Flaubert, Churchill, Wilde. </p><h2>  Hammamet Attractions </h2><p>  Hammamet is a picturesque resort of Tunisia, which is interesting not only for its beaches, but also for its sights.  During the rest, you can allocate some time to explore the most interesting places of the town.  For example, it is worth visiting Ribat, Old Medina, the Spanish fortress of the 16th century.  In the medina you can visit the Hammamet Museum of History. </p><p>  The city has a marina port, which is the largest in northern Africa.  It is near him that a new Hammamet district begins called Yasmine-Hammamet. </p><p>  Tourists are interested in the house of George Sebastian, built surrounded by cypress trees.  The building has antique columns, a pool, Roman baths.  In the garden you can see the amphitheater, built back in the sixties.  It is equipped with a modern system of light and sound.  Every year in summer, an international art festival is held here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tour selection el mouradi beach 4 hammamet" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1518267.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Vacationers will be interested in the tourist complex "Medina-Mediterraniya", which is an open-air museum.  It was conceived and designed in a traditional Arabic style.  The complex is surrounded by a defensive wall, behind which is the inner part of the city.  It attracts numerous tourists with the products of local artisans, a good area for recreation and entertainment. </p><p>  In addition, from Hamamet they organize trips to the ruins of Carthage, to Tunisia and to the island of Cap Bon, to the Sahara. </p><h2>  Hammamet Attractions </h2><p>  Hammamet has the Carthageland theme park with many activities for children and adults.  The resort is known for several world-class golf clubs.  There is also a riding club, a zoo and an ice rink in the city. </p><p>  Despite the resort's conservatism, not a single guest will be bored in the city.  Fans of nightlife can visit the disco area, a ten-minute drive from Yasmine. </p><h2>  El Mouradi Beach 4 *, Hammamet: reviews </h2><p>  Summing up the conversation about the hotel, I want to discuss the reviews of tourists who had a rest in it.  El Muradi (Hammamet) has a very favorable location.  It is far from the hustle and bustle, on the coast itself.  The hotel will appeal to those guests who seek to find a quiet, relaxing holiday destination by the sea. </p><p>  Of course, the complex cannot be called chic, but it has quite decent rooms that are cleaned daily by maids (the quality of cleaning is good).  Towels are replaced as needed (usually every day).  In general, the apartments are clean and well maintained, with working equipment.  The furniture in the rooms is not very new, but in good condition. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="el mouradi beach 4 hammamet reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1518268.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  I would like to note that the reviews regarding the complex are quite contradictory.  Apparently, in order to understand how things really are, you just need to visit this hotel.  The hotel staff understands Russian, especially the reception staff, so you can always explain, there is no language barrier. </p><p>  The main restaurant serves a buffet.  Sometimes during dinner or lunch, queues form.  Drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) are delivered by waiters who do not always have time to do this.  In such cases, guests are advised to offer a tip to the restaurant employee.  This greatly simplifies further communication.  In general, the food is good, however, many dishes, as in all Muslim countries, are too spicy.  If you plan to relax with a child, then the choice of dishes for kids is not so great.  For example, from the side dishes you can take only mashed potatoes, pasta, as well as pastries.  But at the poolside bar, ice cream is distributed in the afternoon (6 varieties).  Such a treat will certainly appeal to young guests. </p><p>  In the daytime, tourists are entertained with animation programs.  You can take part in water aerobics classes, which are conducted by an incendiary animator.  Evening entertainment starts at 21.00, which is a bit late for children. </p><p>  The hotel has a small nice pool.  The paddling pool has mini-slides.  The entire territory of the complex is very well maintained, albeit small.  While relaxing at the hotel, you can take advantage of the opportunity and visit the spa to experience stunning rejuvenation and wellness sessions.  Their cost is not included in the stay, spa services are paid separately. </p><p>  The hotel has its own beach on the coast.  It is equipped with paid sunbeds with mattresses and umbrellas, and beach towels are issued free of charge (on deposit) at the reception.  There is a bar on the shore.  The sea and sand deserve all praise.  The entry into the water is shallow, great for children.  The sea is usually clean and clear.  True, sometimes after storms ashore carries ashore, but this is not so important. </p><p>  The hotel always has a local guide.  If you wish, you can book a tour and go on a trip.  In principle, the city can be viewed independently.  However, some tourists are advised to walk with companies for greater safety. </p><p>  The hotel does not have a very good Wi-Fi signal.  At the reception, you can use it for free, but it is slow.  But for the password in the room you have to pay. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="el mouradi beach" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1518269.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  If you decide to go on a vacation to Tunisia, and at present your main problem is selecting a tour, El Mouradi Beach 4 * (Hammamet) may be on your list of potential options for consideration.  However, it is worth remembering that the complex has its own advantages and disadvantages, so it will appeal to the picky tourists, for whom a beach holiday is important.  The hotel is away from nightlife, so people who like to hang out are unlikely to like it here.  But supporters of a relaxing holiday will surely be satisfied.  Tours to the hotel can sometimes be purchased at very competitive prices, so even having some drawbacks is excusable.  Do not forget that the complex is focused on budget holidays and, according to tourists, it is consistent with the ratio of "price-quality". </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Mouradi Beach 4 * (Hammamet) is a good hotel in one of the best resorts in Tunisia.  If you want to soak up the sun and plunge into the warm sea water, then you should choose this particular complex, since its indisputable advantage is its excellent location.  Far from every hotel boasts such close proximity to the sea. </p>
