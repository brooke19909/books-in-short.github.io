    <h2>  Who was this smartphone aimed at? </h2><p>  At the time of its release, the N73 was the best device on the Symbian software platform.  He had the most productive semiconductor chip and excellent technical specifications.  All this made it possible to run on this gadget any existing software that was compiled specifically for such devices.  Also, support for 3rd generation mobile networks allowed the large file sizes for those times to be downloaded to this smartphone very quickly.  All of the previously listed allowed to attribute this device to the premium segment of communicators in 2006.  That is, this ‚Äúsmart‚Äù phone was intended for the most demanding users.  Now this software platform is outdated.  As a result, software updates do not occur, and the phone has turned into a regular ‚Äúdialer‚Äù with data transfer support and two cameras installed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  <span>"Nokia N73"</span> could boast of such accessories and components: </p><ul><li><p>  Removable battery model VR-6M with a nominal capacity of 1100 mAh. </p></li><li><p>  AC-4 Charging Adapter from Nokia. </p></li><li><p>  Branded external speaker system HS-23. </p></li><li><p>  A compact disc with the installation version of specialized software for PC PC Suite from the Nokia development company. </p></li><li><p>  User's Manual. </p></li><li><p>  A booklet on the software for this platform. </p></li><li><p>  Company <span>warranty card.</span> </p></li><li><p>  Instructions for starting a quick operation of the device. </p></li></ul><p>  This list is missing an external drive and case.  It was necessary to immediately buy these two accessories in order to make the most of this ‚Äúsmart‚Äù phone.  The first of them allowed to increase the amount of internal memory by several times, and the second kept the initial state of the device. </p>

    <h2>  Design, usability and ergonomics </h2><p>  For the most part, the Nokia N73 case was made of plastic.  The upper part of the case was occupied by a regular display (unlike most current mobile devices, it was not touch!).  Under it were the <span>control buttons</span> on the Nokia N73.  The top row was occupied by two function buttons, the purpose of which changed depending on which application was open on the display, and a joystick.  The latter performed navigation functions and allowed to confirm the performed actions.  The second row consisted of buttons to start and end a call.  Below were the number keys, which were surrounded by additional function keys (for example, quick launch of the browser) around the perimeter.  Above the screen, in addition to the name of the cell phone model and the logo of the manufacturer, there was a speaker.  The front camera was located right there.  On the top of the gadget was a loud speaker.  On the opposite side of the device, all the wired interfaces of the device were displayed.  Here was the <span>POP-PORT port</span> for connecting an external speaker system and the familiar round socket for connecting a charging adapter to a smartphone.  On the right side of the communicator all control buttons are grouped.  This is the regulation of the sound level, this is the control of the camera, this is the blocking of the device.  On the back cover of the communicator was an unusual ‚Äúslider‚Äù that protected the main camera from possible damage.  It was behind this non-standard component that the peephole of the main camera was located.  A single LED was immediately displayed, which made it possible to get quite good photos even with a poor level of illumination. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  Only one computing module was implemented in the central processor unit "Nokia N73".  The characteristics of its technical specifications indicated that this is the only core based on the outdated ARM9 architecture.  Its clock frequency was equal to 220 MHz.  For current high-performance devices, these values ‚Äã‚Äãlook really modest.  But in 2006, such hardware specifications for the normal functioning of the Symbian software platform were quite enough.  Any application software on such a "filling" was launched without any problems at all.  Now this operating system is not supported by the manufacturer itself and is not developing.  It is impossible to install any other system software on this device.  Therefore, the owners of H73 will have to be content with what is already on the gadget. </p>

    <h2>  Communicator memory subsystem </h2><p>  The amount of RAM in this model of the communicator was equal to 64 MB.  And the capacity of the integrated data warehouse was equal to 42 MB.  As you can easily guess from the indicated values, this was clearly not enough for comfortable work on this device.  Therefore, it was mandatory to install an additional external drive in this smartphone.  A slot for installing mini-SD cards was present in the Nokia N73.  The characteristics of this group of drives indicated a maximum capacity of 2 GB.  It was such the largest amount of memory that could be inserted into the corresponding expansion slot of this mobile communicator. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The diagonal of the non-touch display in this mobile gadget was 2.36 inches.  Its resolution in height was 320 pixels, and in width - 240 pixels.  The pixel density on its surface was 325 ppi.  Even now, you can find entry-level smartphones that have fewer dots per inch.  So from this position, this display still continues to be relevant.  The number of displayed color shades was 262 thousand.  The screen matrix was made using the TFT technology.  Its main disadvantage is the distortion of colors when deviating from a right viewing angle.  But in 2006 there were no worthy alternatives to this matrix.  In any case, the "Nokia N73" screen, both from the position of parameters and from the position of quality, did not cause any complaints.  And some of its parameters, as noted earlier in the text, are even better now than some budget entry-level devices. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  A 3.2 megapixel sensor was on the main camera in the Nokia N73.  Photos taken with its use at that time had the best quality among similar devices.  Also, in the list of functions of this camera, one can distinguish autofocus technology (in 2006 it was a rarity), digital 4x zoom and LED backlight (even now not every device can be found in it).  All this in total even now allows you to get very good pictures on such a communicator.  This camera allowed recording video in 352x288 format.  By today's standards, this is a disgusting quality, but in 2006 something better could not be found.  There was also a <span>front camera</span> in " <strong></strong>  Nokia N73 ". The photos taken already with its use were of much worse quality. This is not surprising and it had a sensor element of only 0.3 megapixels. Its capabilities were enough only for video calls. And the video quality in this case was far from ideal. </p><h2>  Battery and device autonomy </h2><p>  The battery on the Nokia N73 with a nominal capacity of 1100 mAh made it possible to work in standby mode for 14 days on a single charge.  In reality, with an average load, one could count on 3-5 days.  With a greater load, the time was reduced to 2 days.  Well, with maximum savings on one charge, you could stretch even 7 days.  Therefore, from the standpoint of autonomy, ‚ÄúH73‚Äù on the backgrounds of current gadgets is beyond competition.  A key role was played by several factors at once, among which one can single out an energy-efficient processor, a small-sized display and a high degree of optimization of the software component of the communicator.  The only remark that can be noted in this regard is the lack of such an accessory as <span>an external battery</span> for the Nokia N73.  It would not be out of place during a long journey and would significantly increase the already considerable battery life of a mobile device. </p>

    <h2>  Communicator operating system </h2><p>  The most recent Nokia N73 firmware was based on the Symbian operating system with serial number 9.1.  Further updates to the system software did not occur.  There is a simple explanation for this: newer models of communicators with updated software appeared on the market.  It was on them that the manufacturer focused.  But even this, albeit an outdated version of system software, is enough to run almost any application software on this device.  It is impossible to change the operating system and thereby improve the functionality of the device.  Therefore, the owners of this smartphone model will have to be content with what is already available.  Separately, it should be noted that this operating system is no longer supported and is not updated by the manufacturer.  Unfortunately, this software platform has no future.  Although at one time (in 2006), the Finnish company and its operating system were legislators in the market for system software for mobile gadgets. </p><h2>  Application software </h2><p>  Initially, an impressive set of application software was installed on the Nokia N73.  There is a built-in browser that allows you to view most web portals even now.  If necessary, you can install the Opera Mini viewer.  Its main advantage is data compression when receiving and sending.  As a result, you can get significant traffic savings.  Also, an e-mail client is integrated into the smartphone.  You can connect any electronic mailbox to it and receive incoming correspondence from it.  Also, this software tool allows you, if necessary and with an established connection to the Global Web, to send an e-mail at any time.  For simple calculations on this device there is a calculator built into the OS with a basic set of functions.  If necessary, you can expand the functionality of the device by installing an additional of the same product, but based on Java software.  In principle, any software that is based on this software platform can theoretically function on this model of communicator.  The limitation in this case may be the size of the executable file, which may exceed the capacity of the integrated data and information storage, that is, its maximum size should not exceed 42 MB.  In reality, this value is even less: part of the memory is used by system processes.  But, as practice shows, for application software platform "Symbian" this size of 42 MB is enough. </p>

    <h2>  Health recovery </h2><p>  With certain malfunctions in the software system of this communicator, you can restore its performance.  To do this, you have to flash "Nokia N73" <strong> </strong>  again.  In this case, you must perform the following steps: </p><ul><li><p>  On a computer connected to the Internet, download the latest current firmware of this device.  It is immediately worth noting that this device is not supported on the official website of the Finnish manufacturer.  Therefore, you will have to use any other available information resource with this information. </p></li><li><p>  We install PC Suite from the bundled CD. </p></li><li><p>  We connect the smartphone to the computer using a specialized interface cord. </p></li><li><p>  We launch the specialized software package PC Suite, and with it we install the firmware on a mobile device. </p></li></ul><h2>  Ways to exchange data with the outside world and get data back </h2><p>  Smartphone "Nokia N73" <strong> </strong>  even by today's standards, it boasts an impressive list of ways to transmit information.  This list includes the following: </p><ul><li><p>  Infrared port - this method of transmitting and receiving information was originally intended for data exchange with similar mobile devices.  In fact, this is the earlier now very, very common "Bluetooth."  Current gadgets using this port can also control various household devices (such as televisions or satellite receivers).  But at that time no one thought about such an opportunity and, accordingly, did not develop such a program.  As a result, any communicator on the Symbian platform is deprived of such an opportunity as controlling household devices using the infrared port. </p></li><li><p>  The device had only one slot for installing SIM cards.  The device itself is equipped with transmitters that allow it to work only in cellular networks GSM (the second name is 2G) and UMTS (or 3G).  In the latter case, the maximum allowable speed is 384 Kbps. </p></li><li><p>  There is also in this ‚Äúsmart‚Äù Bluetooth phone.  Its version is 2.0.  This is a great way to send and receive small files (like photos). </p></li><li><p>  To connect to various electronic computers, the USB port was implemented in this device. </p></li><li><p>  To output an audio signal to a wired headset, a POP-PORT port is provided.  Alas, the usual headphones or speakers with a 3.5 mm audio jack can not be connected to such a gadget. </p></li></ul>

    <h2>  Communicator price </h2><p>  Phone "Nokia N73" in a new state, as you might guess, 10 years after the start of sales it is impossible to purchase.  You can buy a supported version of this gadget at various trading floors on the Global Web.  For example, on ebay.com you can become the owner of such a device in relatively good condition for $ 40.  But still, in this case, it is recommended to pay attention to offers of $ 60 and above.  In this case, the state of the device will be much better.  The second option for buying such a device is Chinese online shopping portals.  For example, on Aliexpress such a mobile device can be purchased for 3,500 rubles.  But in this case, you get a restored device in which the case is replaced and the memory is cleaned and optimized.  The last price indicated puts this flagship 10 years ago on a par with modern entry-level smartphones.  On the one hand, this price is too high.  But here the legendary Finnish quality in this case makes itself felt. </p><h2>  Owner reviews about the smart phone </h2><p>  Owners on the Nokia N73 have certain complaints.  Reviews highlight such of them: </p><ul><li><p>  <em>The relatively high cost of the device compared to competitors.</em>  On the other hand, all the quality solutions of this world famous Finnish manufacturer have never been available.  This is the case when you have to pay extra for a quality thing of a famous manufacturer.  Well, the fact that most of the smartphones of this model are still actively used by subscribers is another confirmation of this. </p></li><li><p>  <em>High grain screen.</em>  This remark is valid against the background of current devices.  But in 2006, the display at the "H73" was one of the best resolution from a position.  The same can be said about the matrix underlying the screen.  At that time, the TFT technology was advanced and made it possible to obtain the best quality displays of mobile devices. </p></li><li><p>  <em>Certain complaints are caused by the joystick.</em>  After 2-3 years of active operation (according to owners' reviews), you have to change it to a new one, since the old one stops working.  On the other hand, there is nothing to worry about - in any workshop, such a repair is not so difficult.  The cost of such an accessory is very modest.  Therefore, there is nothing terrible in this. </p></li></ul><p>  But the advantages of this model are much greater.  Phone "Nokia N73" even now in terms of functionality is not inferior to most modern entry-level mobile devices.  Yes, and his hardware stuffing at the time of release was advanced and ahead of the order of most competitors.  Another plus is a high degree of autonomy.  Even now, on a standard battery, such ‚Äúsmart‚Äù phones manage to stretch 12 hours on a single charge - and that‚Äôs all after 10 years of use!  Most modern gadgets like this certainly can not boast. </p>
