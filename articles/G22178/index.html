  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Where is the Dominican Republic: geographical location, description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Modern Russian tourists are increasingly planning their vacation, considering options located outside of Africa and Eurasia.  Many of our compatriots opt for Latin American countries in which they are friendly to Russian citizens. </p><p>  Friendly relations between our countries arose even during the revolution and the cold war.  Countries such as Venezuela, Cuba and the Dominican Republic hospitably open the borders for tourists from the Russian Federation, since almost all the barriers between our countries have disappeared over the years. </p><h2>  Dominican Republic - where is it located? </h2><p>  The Dominican Republic is located on the <span>island of Haiti</span> or Espanyola (Espa√±ola), which is included among many others in the Antilles archipelago.  The Dominican Republic and the Republic of Haiti territorially divide the island into two parts.  This is especially evident in the photo, where the Dominican Republic is located in the eastern part, and the Republic of Haiti is located in its western part.  <span>The capital of the Dominican Republic</span> is the beautiful city of Santo Domingo. </p><p>  The Antilles are located at the crossroads of seafaring from South America to the North, in the west of the Atlantic Ocean.  Not far from the island is Central America. </p><p>  On the island of Hispaniola, two metropolitan cities of two states coexist - Haiti and Dominican Republic.  The strait, called Mona, separates Hispaniola from Puerto Rico in the east, and in the west the Windward Strait lies between the Dominican Republic and Cuba. </p><p>  To understand where the Dominican Republic is located in, one should turn to history.  The island of Haiti received its name from Christopher Columbus, who discovered it in 1492 and named it Hispaniola.  Since then, the era of the conquest of America originates, and at the beginning of the 16th century the island was colonized by the Spaniards. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.promovacances.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beaches of the Dominican Republic" class="if uuid-2390830" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31801/2390830.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to the central territory - the islands of Haiti, the Dominican Republic also owns a group of small islands.  The most significant of them: </p><ul><li>  Catalina - off the southern coast of the island of Haiti; </li><li>  Saona - from its southeastern part; </li><li>  Cayo Levantado - near the north-eastern part of the island; </li><li>  Beata is on the southwestern side of Haiti. </li></ul><p>  Each of these islands has a completely unique nature, for which tourists who are looking for places with unique exotic are especially appreciated. </p><p>  The Dominican Republic is considered a mountainous state, and it contains the Cordillera-Central ridge, some of whose peaks have a height above sea level of more than 3 kilometers.  This explains such different climate conditions between the north and south coast of the island, namely, where the Dominican Republic is located.  And what kind of sea is it? </p><p>  Southern Haiti has a windy climate with little rainfall and is washed by the Caribbean Sea.  The Atlantic Ocean lies north of the island and the climate in northern Haiti is humid.  Therefore, on its coast you can swim in both cool and warm water, and this is a favorite vacation spot for devotees of kitesurfing and windsurfing. </p><p>  For a person new to geography, questions about the Dominican Republic - what kind of country they are in are not easy.  They know that this country is somewhere in Latin America, of course, many, but not everyone can show right away the specific territory occupied by the Dominican Republic.  And this is easily explained by the fact that in this region there are many small states, and getting confused in them is quite easy. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Despite the attractiveness of a visa-free regime, low food price tag, such a vacation for Russian citizens remains elite.  This is due to the high price of tickets, because the flight lasts more than 9 hours, and not everyone can withstand such a long journey even by car. </p><p>  Between Moscow and Haiti, where the Dominican state is located, the time difference is 8 hours, with Minsk - 7 hours, and between Kiev and Santo Domingo - 6 hours. </p><p>  The Republic of Dominican Republic is a visa-free country, so entry into its territory for citizens of Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine does not cause difficulties.  The only thing on the border will have to purchase a special visa newsletter Tarjeta del Tourista, the price of which is about $ 10, which allows you to stay in the country for one month. </p><p>  For citizens of other CIS countries, such as Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Georgia, Armenia, Belarus, Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, a visa is required. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.montraykreyol.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sights of the Dominican Republic" class="if uuid-2390817" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31801/2390817.jpg"></div><h2>  History of the Dominican Republic </h2><p>  In addition to Spanish colonization, Haiti has long attracted other European invader countries.  So, France after the bloody wars conquered the western part of the island, leaving Spain eastern. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Only at the beginning of the 19th century did the colonial milestone in the history of the Dominican Republic end.  This happened after a major uprising erupted on the island, the result of which was the expulsion of the European colonialists.  From then until today there has been a long struggle of the republic for independence from the United States of America.  Knowing the historical milestones of Haiti, you can understand where and in which country the Dominican Republic is located. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lonelyplanet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dominican Republic tours" class="if uuid-2390815" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31801/2390815.jpg"></div><h2>  Economy of the Dominican Republic </h2><p>  Dominican Republic is not a very wealthy state.  According to the data provided for 2009, the poverty level came close to 50%, and GDP amounted to $ 8,000 per year. </p><p>  Tourism and services are the main sources of income in the state.  They occupy about 68% of total GDP.  In second place is industry.  Among other things, the Dominican Republic produces ferronickel, gold and sugar.  Completes the list of agricultural income items.  It accounts for 11% of all revenues. </p><p>  The country has many state programs aimed at maintaining and developing tourism, so this industry is extremely important for the Dominican Republic.  In this regard, new hotels and hotels of various categories are constantly being built, in which prices from completely affordable to luxury categories prevail.  Despite the high prices, Dominican vacations remain one of the most amazing and tempting. </p><p>  Where is the Dominican Republic, and which ocean washes it?  Of course, it is worth mentioning the Caribbean, striking with its bright green waters and being the main attraction of the country.  Many people go a long way to Haiti in order to stand by the sea and at least temporarily get rid of heavy thoughts or oppressive problems.  The sea is surprisingly clear water, and in some places you can see its bottom up to three meters. </p><p>  The underwater world of the Caribbean, the huge variety of marine inhabitants, from the most beautiful algae and corals to the fish that delight in their color, cannot but surprise.  Therefore, among tourists engaged in diving, <span>Dominican beaches</span> do not cease to be very popular. </p><div class="photo" data-original="twitter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Haiti" class="if uuid-2390796" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31801/2390796.jpg"></div><h2>  What is the <span>currency in the Dominican Republic?</span> </h2><p>  The official circulation in the Dominican Republic has only the <span>Dominican peso</span> (DOP - international abbreviation).  However, in many small cities and settlements where there are no banks or exchange offices, it is better to have funds on bank cards so that you can pay. </p><p>  All, even small stores, accept Master Card, American Express, and Visa cards.  Of course, in the large cities of the Dominican Republic, where banks and money exchange points are located, everything is simpler and there are no problems either with paying for goods or with exchanging money. </p><p>  $ 1 is approximately equal to 16 pesos.  In local institutions, it is customary to pay either in dollars (which is not entirely legal) or with credit cards. </p><h2>  Popular Resorts Dominican Republic </h2><p>  Most resorts are located in the eastern half of the island: </p><ul><li>  Puerto Plata; </li><li>  Juan Dolio; </li><li>  La Romana </li><li>  Samana; </li><li>  Boca Chica; </li><li>  Punta Cana. </li></ul><p>  An interesting effect due to the coral reef acquired sand on the beach.

Going down the <span>ramp,</span> tourists see amazing landscapes, and barely stepping on the ground, they plunge into the atmosphere of goodwill and care where the Republic of Dominican Republic is located. </p><h2>  Language of the Dominican Republic </h2><p>  They speak in the Dominican Republic in Spanish.  It is also the only state language.  There are a lot of tourists and emigrants in the country.  Therefore, the second place is occupied by English.  A small group of people from Haiti speak the Creole dialect. </p><h2>  Religion of the Dominican Republic </h2><p>  In the Republic of Dominican Republic 95% of Christians, of which 88% are Catholics.  The rest of the population are Protestants.  This is due to the long Spanish colonization of the country. </p><p>  In border villages, voodoo traditions are not uncommon.  The Dominican Republic does not officially recognize this religion, but markets are littered with goods with voodoo symbols, which are very popular with tourists. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nytimes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="republic of dominican republic" class="if uuid-2390790" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31801/2390790.jpg"></div><h2>  Sights of the Dominican Republic </h2><p>  The Dominican Republic has a huge number of picturesque rivers, mountain and coastal landscapes.  Agencies offer Dominican Republic tours to such places, where there are also caves with stalactites, grottoes, Indian rock carvings, lakes and with amazing paintings created by nature itself. </p><p>  In the Dominican Republic you can see: </p><ul><li>  All kinds of parks, national reserves with endangered or rare species of trees and flowers. </li><li>  Mountains and ranges, separated by fertile and picturesque valleys. </li><li>  Many coastal islands where there are rainforests that have not been touched by a human hand. </li><li>  Animals in nature reserves and zoos. </li><li>  Plantations of chocolate tree and bananas, orange and pineapple groves. </li><li>  Caribbean Lake Enricillo, which is salty and has healing properties. </li><li>  The highest mountain in Espanyol is Peak Duarte, whose height is 3098 meters above sea level. </li></ul><h2>  When to relax in the Dominican Republic </h2><p>  The Dominican Republic has very warm weather.  Throughout the year, you can sunbathe and swim here.  There is even a ‚Äúdry‚Äù season - from November to April.  There is no rain at this time at all.  Therefore, if Thailand, Egypt and Goa are already tired, it makes sense to think about a trip to Haiti. </p><p>  Many people think that after April in Haiti it rains endlessly and the rainy season begins.  This is a bit wrong.  It rains, of course, but they end in half an hour after a maximum, and the sun shines again, and there is no trace of the puddles.  The resorts of the Dominican Republic have extremely comfortable conditions for tourists, and this makes Haiti an even more attractive place. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vantbefinfo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Haiti festival" class="if uuid-2390811" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31801/2390811.jpg"></div><h2>  Excursions in the Dominican Republic </h2><p>  The most popular excursions in Haiti among tourists are: </p><ul><li>  Engaged in fishing in the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean. </li><li>  Caribbean Festival. </li><li>  Travel to the Dominican outback. </li><li>  Helicopter ride. </li><li>  Manti Parks. </li><li>  Bavaro Tracers. </li></ul><p>  The cost of such excursions is in the range from 50 to 300 $ inclusive. </p><p>  Thus, the Dominican Republic attracts tourists with children, newlyweds, and noisy youth companies looking for outdoor activities.  A romantic trip to Haiti for two will be remembered for many years, and lovers of water and underwater sports will be delighted with their stay in the wonderful resorts of the earthly paradise, where the Dominican Republic is located. </p>
