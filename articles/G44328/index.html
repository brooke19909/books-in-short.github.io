How to start knitting elastic with knitting needles?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Who will not agree to put on a warm and soft knitted sweater in the cold season, turn into a beautiful scarf or wrap yourself in a magnificent shawl?  Indeed, even on world catwalks, knitted clothes are increasingly present.  And with such things, anyone who knows how to knit can please themselves and their loved ones.  Getting started may seem difficult, but with the right approach, the end result will really please you. </p><h2>  <span>How to knit</span> ?  Beginning of work </h2><p>  Nowadays, needlework makes it possible to significantly diversify your wardrobe, saving significant amounts of money.  But the most important thing is that you will be sure of the quality of your own made things, and this is important. </p><p>  To get started, you need to determine what thing you will knit.  The next step will be the selection of the pattern.  By the way, it should be borne in mind that some of them require more yarn than others.  For example, ‚Äúpigtails‚Äù or ‚Äúplaits‚Äù compress the knitted fabric somewhat, and to get the desired width, you will have to dial more loops.  Accordingly, the consumption of yarn will be greater. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to knit the beginning" class="if" height="311" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34853/868380.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  If the future thing will not be very tight knitting with an openwork pattern, then it is better for her to take thinner yarn.  For knitting warm winter clothes thick threads are suitable.  The labels often indicate the meter of yarn and which knitting needles are best for knitting.  For a women's sweater of size 38, knitted from fine yarn, you will need about 2200 m of thread, and if there are about 400 m of yarn in a 100-gram skein, you will need 6 skeins (it is better to take with a margin). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Preparatory stage </h2><p>  Where to start for beginners who know a little about how to knit?  The beginning, of course, will be in choosing the thing to be made.  If you have already decided what it is planned for, you will need to make its pattern.  If you are far from measurements, especially from building patterns, you can copy the details of a similar thing through a carbon copy. </p><p>  Before starting work, make sure that you choose the right style of clothing.  Each figure has its advantages and disadvantages, and well-chosen clothes can either emphasize the advantages or hide the disadvantages.  And it is also important to take into account the age of the future owner of the thing: for children and young people it is better to knit clothes in bright colors, for older adults they pick up shades more calmly. </p><h2>  How to calculate the number of loops? </h2><p>  In order for the future product to be the right size, you need to know how many loops you need to dial.  Anyone who knows how to knit can do this.  The beginning of the calculation is as follows: you need to dial about 20 loops and knit several rows with the pattern that will be used.  Next, measure the width of the resulting canvas.  Suppose you get a width of 9 cm. Now you need to divide 20 by 9, and multiply the result (in our case, 2.22) by the width of the future product.  To the result you need to add also edge loops. </p><h2>  Learning to knit a scarf </h2><p>  Which needlewoman did not start her work with knitting scarves?  This is the simplest product that does not require special knowledge.  Of course, you can knit scarves with the most intricate patterns, but for a start it is better to knit it with an elastic band.  Even beginners know how to start knitting <span>elastic with knitting needles</span> , and the number of loops can be calculated from the previous example. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  When knitting, try to make loops of the same size: this will ensure uniformity of the fabric.  If there are defects on the finished product, it must be covered with a damp towel and allowed to lie down until it dries completely. </p><p>  Before you start <span>knitting a scarf,</span> make sure that you have enough yarn to get the right length.  If the thread is not enough, you can add strips of yarn of other colors: it will look original. </p>

    <h2>  How to knit a sweater? </h2><p>  Before you start <span>knitting a sweater,</span> you need to build a pattern.  After that, it is worth deciding which pattern you will use, and practice its performance.  Note that the patterns in the pictures sometimes look completely different than when knitting, so making a sample does not hurt. </p><p>  Since often when knitting sweaters, elastic is used for decoration, the example should consist of elastic and the main pattern.  To take measurements, the elastic should be stretched a little, because it should fix the sweater, and not merge with the main part.  Sometimes it happens that the main canvas is wider than the elastic.  In this case, after knitting the gum, you will need to reduce a few loops before knitting the main pattern.  If the situation is the opposite, loops will need to be added. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to start knitting a sweater" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34853/868376.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Usually, a sweater is knitted from the bottom up, but there are other techniques, and most often they depend on the chosen pattern.  Since it is not so easy for a beginner to <span>knit a sweater</span> using unusual patterns, it is better to start knitting simpler products consisting of four parts: back, front and sleeves. </p><h2>  The subtleties of knitting sweaters </h2><p>  Those who have learned how to <span>knit sweaters</span> know how to start knitting a sweater.  But in the manufacture of these things there is one significant difference: in front of sweaters consists of two shelves.  When calculating the width of the front, you must take into account the size of the strip for the lock or buttons.  Also keep in mind that different patterns are used for decoration and for the main canvas.  Sometimes the height of the rows of the main canvas is slightly greater than the height of the rows of finishes, or vice versa.  If you notice such discrepancies, it is worth knitting additional rows of fabric, which is shorter, or finishing if it looks tight. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to start knitting a sweater" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34853/868375.jpg" width="598"></div>

    <p>  Typically, the pattern that fits in front of the sweatshirts differs from the pattern of the back and sleeves.  In this regard, it must be remembered that the calculations of the number of loops for the back of the sweater may not correspond to the number of loops needed to knit the front. </p><p>  If your future jacket will be fastened with buttons, do not forget to leave in the decoration for them the loops of the right size. </p><h2>  How to knit a shawl? </h2><p>  What woman would not like to replenish her wardrobe with a beautiful shawl?  It is so nice to put it on your shoulders and feel the pleasant warmth.  Better yet, have such a thing of their own manufacture. </p><p>  For beginner needlewomen it is sometimes unclear how to start knitting a shawl with knitting needles.  But there is no particular difficulty.  First you need to choose a suitable pattern and appropriate yarn so that the shawl is the necessary texture.  Knitting starts from the bottom corner.  Depending on the pattern, loops can be added in the middle of the product or on the sides.  Here only your preferences will play a role. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to start knitting a shawl" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34853/868334.jpg" width="500"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  The shawl should expand, so you should calculate how many loops you need to add so that the product matches the pattern.  You also need to make sure that the additions harmoniously fit into the main pattern. </p><p>  Learning to knit beautiful and original things is not difficult at all, the main thing is to show a little patience and zeal.  And the result of the efforts will be the grateful faces of loved ones, who are warmed by the things you have connected, or the admiring glances of friends when you appear in new and original clothes. </p>
