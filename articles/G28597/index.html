  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The largest organic matter in the cell</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>The chemical organization of the cell</span> involves the presence of various substances and compounds.  So, the presence of macro- and microelements, water, mineral salts has been established.  <span>Organic substances are also</span> contained in the cell <span>,</span> the largest of which determine its properties.  These compounds, in addition, affect a number of characteristics of the organism as a whole.  It should be noted that the chemical composition of the <span>plant cell</span> and animal is identical at the atomic level.  At the molecular level, there are some differences. </p><p>  Many <span>organic substances of a</span> cell are characterized by the fact that large molecules (macromolecules) are present in their composition.  As a rule, they contain repeating, similar in structure to low molecular weight compounds.  These compounds are covalently bonded and form monomers.  Monomers, in turn, form a molecule called polymer. </p><p>  The largest organic matter in a cell is fats, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and proteins. </p><p>  Squirrels </p><p>  They account for about ten to twenty percent.  These irregular polymers contain amino acids as monomers.  Proteins (in comparison with other compounds) are endowed with some significant features.  Firstly, these organic substances of the cell have a huge molecular weight.  So, for example, the molecular weight of muscle protein is 15 00000 kDa, and, for example, ethyl alcohol - 46. </p><p>  About twenty amino acids have been identified in the composition of protein polymers.  Each of them has its own structure, name, properties.  The amino acid molecule is composed of two parts.  One part is the same for everyone and includes an acid carboxyl group and an amino group.  The other part is different and is called the "radical". </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Proteins play the role of an energy source.  Inside the cell, these compounds break down to amino acids.  Some of them are used for protein synthesis, and the other part goes through a process of deep cleavage.  In the course of the latter, energy is released. </p><p>  Carbohydrates </p><p>  These <span>organic matter cells</span> contain hydrogen, carbon and oxygen.  All carbohydrates are divided into polysaccharides and monosaccharides.  A number of molecules of the latter combine with each other, releasing water.  Thus, a polysaccharide is formed. </p><p>  Carbohydrates are included in carriers of hereditary information - nucleic acids. </p><p>  Lipids </p><p>  This group includes fat-like substances and directly fats.  Lipids have a different structure.  However, all of them are endowed with common properties.  Lipids do not dissolve in water, while being readily soluble in chloroform, gasoline, ether and other organic solvents. </p><p>  Fats and fat-like compounds play a significant role.  The proportion of lipids from dry weight is 5-15%.  Moreover, in some cells their content reaches 90%.  Fat is present in all mammals in milk.  In dolphin females, for example, the proportion of fat in milk is about 40%. </p><p>  Nucleic acids </p><p>  The name of these compounds comes from the Latin word "nucleus" (core).  These substances were identified and isolated by Friedrich Miescher from nuclear cells.  In 1869, a Swiss biochemist isolated a compound that included phosphorus and nitrogen. </p><p>  <span>Nucleic acids</span> are high molecular weight compounds.  They ensure the conservation and transmission of genetic data in living organisms.  <span>These biopolymers are</span> formed from monomeric units, nucleotides, which are contained in large quantities.  Nucleotides determine the main properties of a living organism. </p><p>  DNA is a polymer molecule that consists of a huge number of monomers - deoxyribonucleotides.  RNA is a polymer.  A ribonucleotide acts as a monomer in it. </p>
