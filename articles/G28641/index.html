  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to sew a rag doll: patterns and manufacturing technology</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Rag dolls are loved by children of many countries.  These are warm and soft toys depicting people with whom you can play mother and daughter.  Such dolls bend perfectly and take any pose.  It is convenient to sleep with them in an embrace, to carry them with you in a backpack to kindergarten or elementary school. </p><h2>  Features of tailoring </h2><p>  In the article, we will consider how to sew a rag doll according to a pattern, what material to choose, and how to make out small facial features and fingers and toes.  Consider samples of sewing such handicrafts on a solid pattern, as well as prefabricated models from individual elements.  The sintepon in sheets is most often used as a filler, since natural cotton wool will get lumpy over time, and artificial cotton will be unpleasant to creak with each movement of the toy. </p><p>  Rag dolls on the pattern are sewn in several stages.  First, the parts of the product according to the cardboard template are transferred in small or simple pencil to the selected fabric, then each of them is cut along the contours indented for allowance for seams.  If a sheet synthetic winterizer is selected, then it is cut according to the same patterns, only the size of the pattern is reduced for free diligence.  If fibrous material similar to cotton wool is used, parts of the rag doll pattern are first sewn together, leaving a small hole in an inconspicuous place, and then the filler is pushed inside.  At the end, the remainder of the fabric is sutured with an internal suture. </p><h2>  One-piece baby doll pattern </h2><p>  Such a doll is made in full size of a newborn baby.  The cloth for the pattern of a rag doll is best taken either cotton or linen.  This toy will be easy to wash in a washing machine, and it will perfectly retain its shape and color.  On the large sheet of whatman paper, draw the contours of the whole doll - a round head, a wide neck (so that the head holds tight), two arms that go into a rounded body, and two legs with slightly bent knees, as newborn babies usually lie. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sewing rag dolls" class="if uuid-3168498" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3168498.jpg"></div><p>  Any schoolgirl will be able to draw such a pattern of a rag doll with her own hands.  It is not necessary to have special talents of the artist to depict parts of the human body.  For cutting, the pattern according to the template is transferred to a fabric folded in half.  When cutting two identical parts, be sure to step back 1 cm from the outer contours for seam allowance.  Fold both sides with the wrong sides out and sew all the edges with neat, even stitches. </p><p>  Leave the distance between the doll‚Äôs legs unstitched.  Through this hole, the pattern is turned on the front side and the doll is stuffed with syntepon.  In order for the filler to get into hard-to-reach places, for example, the ends of the arms and legs, use any stick.  When the doll has acquired the form necessary for the toy, the last centimeters are sewn up with an internal seam and the knot is tightened.  The main work is over.  You can decorate a rag doll in different ways: </p><ul><li>  sew on small details of applications from fabrics of other colors; </li><li>  embroider the contours of the eyes, mouth and nose with thread floss; </li><li>  to sew eyes-buttons, and to make a mouth from beads; </li><li>  draw facial features with markers. </li></ul><p>  You can not attach the hair to the baby, since newborns are often born with a small fluff on their heads.  If desired, you can make a head of yarn using a crochet hook. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Rag doll pattern with sizes </h2><p>  With your own hands, you can draw a pattern according to the following pattern.  The head has a diameter of 8 cm and is drawn using a compass.  Sew it directly to an even line of arms outstretched to the sides.  To draw them symmetrically, fold a sheet of paper in half. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern for sewing dolls" class="if uuid-3168517" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3168517.jpg"></div><p>  The drawing has only three sizes: the length from the tips of the fingers on one arm to the opposite side, the length from the shoulders to the heels of the legs and the width of the legs.  The contours of all the details are drawn around these basic lines.  When you expand the sheet, you get a baby figure.  Then proceed according to the scheme described above, only the head is collected separately, its interior is filled with a synthetic winterizer, and only then it is attached to the prepared torso. </p><h2>  Pattern felt dolls </h2><p>  The rag doll on the pattern is easy to sew from felt sheets.  This is a soft and warm material, which is sold in a large assortment in needlework stores and sewing accessories.  The figure below clearly shows how many details you need to cut out of fabric for sewing dolls.  As you can see, hair is also sewn from felt.  Separately cut bangs and ponytails. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rag doll pattern" class="if uuid-3168441" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3168441.jpg"></div><p>  Ears draw immediately on the pattern of the head from two sides.  Hands are cut separately, and legs are cut out with the torso.  Attach the upper limbs can be firmly sewn to the body.  Or you can make them mobile by fastening them with buttons.  Immediately given and pattern dresses with flowers on the hem. </p><h2>  Doll girl </h2><p>  Another version of the pattern of a felt doll in a dress can be seen below in the article.  The head of the toy is assembled from two identical parts.  Do not forget to fill the interior with synthetic winterizer or cotton.  On the front of the head immediately need to sew on the eyes.  To do this, use black small buttons.  So that they are slightly recessed in a soft filler, they are sewn, piercing through all layers of fabric.  Then the back of the head and a forelock with tails of black or brown felt are cut out and attached on top of the finished head, thereby covering the seams from the eye attachment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="girl doll" class="if uuid-3168462" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3168462.jpg"></div><p>  According to the patterns, the pattern of a rag doll is first outlined with chalk on a flesh-colored felt, and then cut to size.  The seams in this case are all external, with stitches over the edge of the fabric.  Select threads in tone of felt so that they merge with the general background of the fabric. </p><p>  Lastly, a flare down dress is attached.  You can choose any color and decorate it at your discretion. </p><h2>  Flannel toy </h2><p>  For sewing rag dolls, you can use old baby diapers.  Flannel is a soft material that is pleasant to the touch and easy to process.  How to make a pattern of such a doll, you already know.  For the foot pattern, draw the lower bend of the foot so that the doll can wear knitted socks or sew shoes from fabric.  Hair is made from yellow or orange yarn. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="flannel doll" class="if uuid-3168503" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3168503.jpg"></div><p>  First, the threads are pulled onto any base, for example, the back of a chair or a kitchen board.  Then, cuts are made at the edges with scissors and pigtails are braided.  In the center, the threads remain idle.  Visually identify the parting line and sew the hair with simple threads from the line of the forehead to the back of the head.  Facial features are easier to draw with colored markers or markers.  Over time and from washing, they can discolor, then you can draw a different expression on the doll. </p><h2>  Seated doll </h2><p>  Basically, they sew full-size rag dolls according to the whole pattern.  This greatly simplifies the process, but in order for the craft to sit on a bed or highchair, it must be seated, that is, the legs must be bent in the pelvic area. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a rag doll" class="if uuid-3168535" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3168535.jpg"></div><p>  The photo clearly shows how to achieve this.  Even a doll sewn in a single-piece pattern can be seated if the filler is divided into parts and stitches are sewn through the line between the body and legs. </p><h2>  Combining sewing techniques </h2><p>  Let's look at an interesting combination of cotton fabric with a felt hairstyle and pigtails twisted from threads of yarn on the sides of the head.  Such a combination of different materials emphasizes the uniqueness of the doll, hand-sewn according to a rather simple pattern.  Legs and hands can be left with semicircular ends, or you can sew floss thread with stitches on the contours of each finger to make a full palm. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="combination of sewing techniques" class="if uuid-3168483" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3168483.jpg"></div><p>  As you can see, using the contours of a toy drawn on a sheet of paper, you can create patterns of dolls of any shape and size.  There are solid-cut options, but there are prefabricated models from individual parts.  Be sure to use a filler to give the doll the necessary volume.  Try to do the craft yourself using old shirts or bedding.  The first samples are best done on one pattern, over time, moving to more complex samples.  Good luck </p>
