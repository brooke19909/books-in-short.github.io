    <p>  German Fegelein was born on 10.30.1906 in the city of Ansbach (Bavaria).  From childhood, he was engaged in horseback riding, working in his father's school, which was located in Munich.  He took part in many competitions as a rider. </p><p>  In the twenties of the twentieth century in Germany there was an economic crisis caused by failure in the First World War.  The riding school was forced to close, and Herman began to look for work.  He met Christian Weber, who was president of the Munich City Council.  The young man got a job as a groom to him.  Weber was one of the first representatives of the Nazi party, which at that time was only in its infancy.  Subsequently, he helped ensure that Fegelein joined the party and the SS. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1925, the young man entered the University of Munich, but left him after two semesters.  Before becoming a member of the NSDAP, German tried himself in several services: </p><ul><li>  Seventeenth Bavarian <span>Cavalry Regiment</span> ; </li><li>  Munich police. </li></ul><h2>  In the ranks of the SS </h2><p>  Fegelein German became a member of the NSDAP in 1932, and a year later received the certificate of representative of the SS.  Before the start of World War II, he served in various cavalry units.  At one time he was even the head of the SS riding school in Munich. </p><p>  For the Summer Olympic Games, held in 1936 in Berlin, he oversaw the preparation of tracks for equestrian competitions. </p>

    <p>  Herman Fegelein was married to Gretl, nee Brown.  She was the sister of Eva Brown.  The wedding took place in the summer of 1944.  A year later, their common daughter was born, whom her mother named Eva Barbara.  Father by this time was no longer alive.  Fegelein's daughter did not live to see her thirtieth birthday, committing suicide three days before the anniversary of the death of her own father. </p><h2>  Death </h2><p>  Herman Fegelein, whose photo has been preserved to this day, was in Hitler‚Äôs inner circle, when the Third Reich was on the verge of death.  In April 1945, an officer left the Imperial Chancellery without permission, heading to his home in Berlin.  The F√ºhrer sent for him SS members who immediately spotted the fugitive.  He was lying on his bed, dressed in civilian clothes. </p><p>  The fugitive, despite his requests and persuasion, was taken to the office.  There he was deprived of all ranks and put under arrest.  Two days later, the F√ºhrer found out about the more significant betrayal that occurred on the part of Himmler.  Unable to punish the traitor, Hitler became furious and ordered Fegeleyn to be brought to him. </p><p>  In anger, he ordered the fugitive to be shot, which was done by SS members on the night of April 28-29, 1945 in the courtyard of the office. </p>
