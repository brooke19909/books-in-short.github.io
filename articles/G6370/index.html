    <h2>  About base </h2><p>  The base "Grandfather's Farm" is located in the Astrakhan region.  To get to it, you need to remember three coordinates: drive 170 km above the city of Astrakhan and 250 km below the hero city of Volgograd, and then postpone 21 km to the city of Kharabali, and now you can see an island measuring 80 √ó 20 km, replete with numerous ilmeni (lowlands, in which water accumulates from the spill of rivers) and eriks - channels through which water from rivers flows into the lowlands.  It is from them after the spring flood that you can catch a large number of the most diverse fish. </p><p>  The recreation center "Grandfather's Farm" in the second half of the summer gives you the opportunity to please yourself with a ram, lump, roach and scavenger when fishing from the shore.  And do not go far, within 50 meters from the rented house there is access to a reservoir. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Opposite the base is the island of Chub, famous for its asps.  And how not to be a chub, when underwater pits are located nearby, in some places up to 30 meters deep? </p><p>  The base "Grandfather's Farm" in the Kharabalinsky district of Astrakhan has advantages in choosing a good fishing place.  After all, going down the Volga River, you must go at least 60 km before you meet other fishermen. </p><p>  Fishing is famous for the night from the shore.  Very often very good specimens of zander and bream come across.  But most importantly, there is the opportunity to catch the already become exotic sterlet.  As Bulgakov says about sterlet, ‚ÄúSterlet is in a saucepan, in pieces, laid out with crayfish necks and fresh caviar.‚Äù  But you can only dream about cooking this fish.  According to the rules, after her capture, a silver fish must be returned to the water world.  But you can dream? </p>

Additional accommodation is free of charge. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Rent a log house will be in 1450 rubles.  per day per person, but with the condition that all 3 places will be occupied. </p><p>  If only two are settled, the price may not change, but for this it will be necessary to pay one of the boats for the entire rest. </p><p>  Double rooms can be rented for 2100 rubles per room. </p><h2>  What is fed at the base? </h2><p>  Base "Grandfather's Farm" feeds its guests with dishes prepared according to recipes of Russian cuisine.  Three meals a day, baking of own production is served every evening.  Tea can be enjoyed at the buffet.  Sweet tea is served with tea. </p><p>  The pride of the cook is a unique triple ear and pilaf of a <span>fat tail sheep,</span> cooked in the traditional way - at the stake.  These dishes are included in the daily menu, they are prepared once a week and you do not need to pay extra for them.  Based on the preferences of the guests, the chef can prepare the selected dish from caught game or fish. </p><p>  Guests can choose how many times to eat food per day and, accordingly, just pay for it.  But according to the reviews of guests there, it is clear that almost everyone eats 3 times a day. </p><p>  The cost of three meals a day is 850 rubles.  For children under 6 years of age, payment for food is made with a 50% discount. </p><h2>  Who can be caught on land? </h2><p>  Base "Grandfather's Farm" offers to hunt on an island located nearby. </p><p>  Last year, in the <span>Astrakhan region,</span> the hunting season for waterfowl was opened at the end of September.  It was then that it was possible to begin the legal shooting of swamp-meadow and waterfowl inhabitants.  And in November it was already possible to begin hunting for steppe, field and fur animals.  On the last day of the year, hunting for the first group of animals was stopped, and a couple of months later, on February 29, the hunting season was officially closed. </p><p>  From waterfowl it was possible to shoot for several varieties of <span>ducks: gray,</span> mallard, diving and other species. </p><p>  From the steppe species of birds you can shoot at the goose, sandpiper, coot, coot, pheasant and woodcock.  In October, it is possible to shoot waterfowl up to 20 animals a day, and steppe ones - up to 5. A hare is issued on vouchers (a hare lives like this and does not know that he will die on a voucher!).  Wolves and jackals can be shot without restrictions. </p><p>  Six years ago there was a hunt, during which 25 wolves were caught.  Eight hunters participated in it, each with a gun.  But after the top, which was soon tamed, got to the base staff, the wolves were not shot. </p><p>  To take part in the hunt, you must send a copy of your hunting ticket in advance.  The price of waterfowl will be 800 rubles. </p>
