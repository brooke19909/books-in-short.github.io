And if the necessary applications can be reinstalled, then it is quite difficult to restore lost contacts.  Especially if there are more than a hundred of them. </p><p>  Of course, you can transfer contacts from Android to Android manually, but this process is rather laborious and unpleasant.  It is much more effective to attract third-party services, utilities and other tools to this enterprise. </p><p>  Let's try to figure out <span>how to transfer contacts from Android to Android</span> and make it as painless as possible for both the mobile gadget and the user himself.  Consider a number of available and simple methods for implementing this procedure.  So let's get started. </p><h2>  SIM card </h2><p>  One of the easiest, but at the same time time-consuming, ways to import contacts to Android is to copy the phone book to a SIM card.  You should immediately warn that there is a limit on the number of subscribers - no more than 200 numbers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to transfer contacts from android to android" class="if uuid-3207616" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3207616.jpg"></div><p>  To import contacts to Android, your old device must have a valid SIM card.  If there are any software or hardware restrictions on working with the phone book, then they need to be removed.  Permissions or restrictions are usually granted by third-party applications.  If they are not installed, then you can proceed with the import procedure. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How to transfer contacts to a SIM card: </p><ol><li>  Open the phone book and click on the option button (three-point icon / gear). </li><li>  The line ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù should appear in the drop-down list. </li><li>  Click on "Import / export contacts." </li><li>  After clicking on the ‚ÄúExport‚Äù button, select ‚ÄúIn SIM‚Äù. </li><li>  Wait for the process to complete. </li></ol><p>  Next, insert the SIM card into the new smartphone and perform the same actions.  The only difference is that instead of export you need to select the import of contacts to the SIM card.  We are waiting for the end of the procedure and check your phone book.  All numbers should appear there.  If there are more than 200 subscribers in your book, it is best to import contacts to Android using one of the methods described below. </p><h2>  SD card </h2><p>  For this procedure, we need any SD card.  Even the medium with the smallest amount of memory will fit - 512 MB or 1 GB.  Less are no longer being released.  Immediately it is worth checking the performance of the card on both devices.  If the external media felt great on the old phone, then it's not a fact that everything will be just as good on the new one. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to transfer contacts to a sim card" class="if uuid-3207617" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3207617.jpg"></div><p>  How to transfer contacts from Android to Android using an SD card: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  We go into the phone book and open the options section. </li><li>  Go to the "Settings". </li><li>  Click on ‚ÄúImport / Export Contacts‚Äù. </li><li>  By clicking on the ‚ÄúExport‚Äù key, we select the SD card as the receiver. </li><li>  We are waiting for the end of the procedure. </li></ol><p>  On external media, all contacts will be saved in a specific VCF format.  The file is located, as a rule, in the root directory of the SD card.  If there are many subscribers in the phone book, several archives can be created (_002, _003, etc.). </p><p>  To import contacts to Android, insert the SD card into a new phone and perform the same procedure, with the only difference being that we click on the Import icon instead of the Export button.  In this case, there are no restrictions on the number of subscribers, as was the case with the SIM card. </p><h2>  Bluetooth </h2><p>  You can also transfer contacts using the bluetooth protocol.  For this procedure, you will need to transfer all subscribers from the phone book to the memory of the old phone, if previously they were located only on a SIM card. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="transfer contacts from android to android" class="if uuid-3207618" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3207618.jpg"></div><p>  You must enable both mobile gadgets and establish a connection between them using the bluetooth protocol.  If you encounter any problems, you should pay attention to the option ‚ÄúVisibility for other devices‚Äù in the settings of wireless networks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Transfer contacts via bluetooth: </p><ol><li>  Open the phone book and select "Options". </li><li>  In the drop-down menu, click on the item "Send Contact". </li><li>  Select all (or necessary) contacts for transmission. </li><li>  We enter the password (variably) and agree with the start of the procedure. </li></ol><p>  The process of transmitting data via the bluetooth protocol is quite lengthy, so do not be surprised if your phone freezes for a while.  Especially when it comes to transferring a large number of contacts. </p><h2>  Google Account </h2><p>  Almost all firmware for Android gadgets are somehow tied to Google.  The services of this search engine can also be used to import contacts to a new device.  If there is no Google account, then you need to create one.  The best way would be to register a mailbox.  You can do this on the official website of the search engine. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="import contacts to sim card" class="if uuid-3207621" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3207621.jpg"></div><p>  Contact Transfer Process: </p><ol><li>  Go to the default settings of the Android platform on the old gadget. </li><li>  Open the item "Accounts". </li><li>  We find the current Google account and click on it. </li><li>  In the synchronization window that appears, move the switch to the active position opposite the line ‚ÄúContacts‚Äù. </li><li>  Click on ‚ÄúOptions‚Äù and after - on ‚ÄúSynchronization‚Äù. </li></ol><p>  Now on your new mobile gadget you need to log in to your Google account.  After some time, the phone book should be updated, and contacts from an old smartphone will appear in it.  It is also worth clarifying that this method only works with numbers stored in the phone‚Äôs memory. </p><h2>  3rd party applications </h2><p>  There are special programs for transferring contacts from Android to Android.  On Google Play there are a lot of such solutions.  But I would like to single out a few of the most sensible and problem-free options. </p><h2>  MOBILedit </h2><p>  The MobilEdit program has proven itself as a contact transfer on all platforms.  To transfer the phone book, you will need a personal computer and installed utility.  You can find it on the official website of the developer.  The program is installed in the normal mode, so there should not be any problems with the installation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fjhomeworkycso.msofficesupport.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mobiledit program" class="if uuid-3207622" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3207622.jpg"></div><p>  After starting the utility will offer to download the latest drivers for mobile gadgets.  To speed up this procedure, it is best to select your device model from the list provided.  After the update, a window should appear with a notification about the successful installation of drivers. </p><p>  You should immediately warn that the utility does not support the Russian language, so you will have to remember English lessons or look for amateur localizations on thematic forums.  There are quite a few of them, so there should not be any serious problems. </p><h2>  Export </h2><p>  The first step is to go to the ‚ÄúPhone‚Äù tab and select ‚ÄúConnection‚Äù (‚ÄúConnection‚Äù / ‚ÄúCommunication‚Äù, etc.).  In the pop-up window, click on PC Sync.  In some cases, there may be another name for the connection, and it depends on the manufacturer and model of the mobile gadget.  Next, you need to enable USB debugging on your smartphone or tablet: </p><ol><li>  Go to the default settings of the Android platform. </li><li>  We find the section "Developer Options". </li><li>  We put a beacon opposite the line "USB Debugging". </li></ol><p>  On some firmware, the procedure is slightly different: </p><ol><li>  Go to the "Settings". </li><li>  We go to the "System" section. </li><li>  Open the "Device Information" window. </li><li>  Click on the line "Build number". </li><li>  We activate the item "Debugging via USB". </li></ol><p>  Now on the personal computer in the program ‚ÄúMobyledit‚Äù on the panel, click on the item ‚ÄúExport‚Äù.  In the main window, you need to choose what exactly you want to copy: photos, videos, applications or, if applicable, contacts.  You must also specify the file format - CSV. </p><h2>  Import </h2><p>  Then we transfer the received archive to a new gadget.  It is best to copy the file to the root directory.  Next, turn off the old gadget and connect the new one.  In the program "Mobayledit" open the item "Import".  We indicate the previously copied file, click on OK and wait for the end of the procedure. </p><p>  The program is paid, but the developer has provided a trial weekly period.  During this time, you can properly familiarize yourself with the capabilities of the utility and decide on the purchase or abandonment of the product.  In any case, a week is enough to copy contacts. </p><h2>  Transfer contacts </h2><p>  This is an exceptional mobile application, and the participation of a personal computer for transferring contacts is not required.  The program, like "Mobyledit", runs without Russian-language localization, but the problem is solved by searching for crack on thematic forums and sites.  Judging by user reviews, localization as such is not necessary here, because it is quite difficult to get confused in the utility interface. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="transfer contacts using bluetooth" class="if uuid-3207620" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3207620.jpg"></div><p>  The application must be installed on both smartphones.  On the old phone, select all or some specific contacts and click on the "Save" button ("Export", "Transfer", etc.).  On the new device, you need to select the import source, that is, the old model and click on the ‚ÄúImport‚Äù item.  After a couple of minutes, all previously selected contacts will be on another gadget. </p><p>  One of the main distinguishing features of the application is its work with all popular platforms.  The utility transfers contacts from devices on the Android, Windows, Blackberry and iOS operating systems.  Moreover, in any direction and in unlimited quantities. </p><p>  The program goes in the free distribution (Free), but its free end on the 75th contact.  If you need to transfer more, you will have to pay a subscription in the region of 70 rubles. </p><h2>  Syncios iOS &amp; Android Manager Free </h2><p>  This is a completely free application designed to copy data from one mobile gadget to another.  The program works by means of a personal computer and in some ways is similar in functionality to "Mobyledit". </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.syncios.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to transfer contacts" class="if uuid-3207619" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3207619.jpg"></div><p>  Using the utility, you can import contacts from devices running Android and iOS operating systems in any direction.  In addition to phone numbers, the program allows you to copy photos, videos, calendars, music and other content. </p><p>  The utility interface is simple and intuitive.  There are special sections for exporting and importing data.  Getting lost in the menu is quite difficult, even despite the lack of Russian-language localization.  The only nuance that users sometimes complain about is the fastidiousness of software to mobile gadgets.  The program does not always correctly determine the model of the device, and at the same time there are some problems with both export and import. </p>
