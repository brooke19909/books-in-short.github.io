    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  Salerno province attracts tourists not so much with beaches, but with attractions.  Italy, like many European countries, has preserved beautiful architectural monuments on its territory.  We will talk about the seven most interesting sights of Salerno. </p><h2>  Via dei Mercanti </h2><p>  Walking around the city is better to start with its main street Via dei Mercanti.  The winding busy Kuptsov street was always crowded due to the numerous cafes, shops and shops located in the adjacent shopping district, where you can not only make the necessary purchases, but also find out the latest gossip and news from the city.  The name of this street is closely connected with the name of the Duke of Lombard, Areca II, who at the end of the 8th century turned his duchy into a principality.  By order and at the expense of Areca II, Salerno was decorated with numerous magnificent architectural monuments.  A considerable part of these masterpiece buildings has reached our times, most of them are located in the vicinity of Via dei Mercanti. </p><h2>  Cappella palatina </h2><p>  One of Salerno's most interesting and visited attractions is Cappella Palatina.  A visit to this interesting architectural masterpiece is included in absolutely all city sightseeing tour programs.  The Papal Chapel is another creation of the Dukes of the Lombards.  Areki II, wanting to perpetuate his name, gave the order to erect a chapel.  They laid the chapel on the site of the ancient Roman sanctuary, and for its construction it was decided to use the stones left on the ruins of the ancient temple.  The magnificent millennium frescoes decorating the chapel vaults have survived to this day. </p>

    <h2>  Cattedrale di salerno </h2><p>  Most of the medieval buildings that have survived to this day are religious buildings and castles.  Salerno <span>(Italy),</span> whose <span>sights</span> are cathedrals, castles and palaces, is no exception.  One of the business cards of the city is Cattedrale di Salerno di San Matteo, located in the central square, in the heart of the city.  The cathedral was built in the late 11th century in honor of the patron saint of the city - St. Matthew.  The cathedral was rebuilt several times, its interior decoration partially changed, but it always remained the main Roman Catholic church in the city of Salerno (Italy). </p><p>  Reviews of tourists describe this cathedral as one of the most beautiful buildings in the city.  Passing the wide stairs past the beautiful portico, made in the Islamic style of a colonnade and a classic fountain, through the magnificent bronze gates cast in Constantinople, we find ourselves in a church.  Inside the cathedral has three arches, between which are two stunning pulpits decorated with enamel and stained glass, and a mosaic of St.  Matthew </p><p>  The interior of the cathedral is also striking in its beauty and luxury.  The carved iconostasis, decorated with sparkling decorations, Easter candelabra, mosaic floors, Roman and medieval tombs, wooden seats preserved from the 16th century, marble fencing of the altar, decorated with fresco paintings - this is only part of what cathedral admires.  There is also a crypt with the remains of San Matteo and the grave of Pope Gregory 7, who consecrated this temple after its foundation. </p>

    <p>  Today, the cathedral also houses the main museum of the city.  It contains paintings, silver and marble sculptures created over the past millennium, the famous facade of the altar made of ivory, the documentation of the School of Medicine and many other equally interesting exhibits. </p><h2>  Gates of lions </h2><p>  Usually this attraction is seen in a complex with St. Matthew's Cathedral.  The gates of the lions crown the front wide staircase leading to the cathedral.  They are made in a unique architectural style, complemented by a Byzantine bronze door, cast in 1099 in Constantinople, on which two marble lions sit.  This is one of the small architectural gems of Salerno. </p><h2>  Areca Fortress (Castello di Arechi) </h2><p>  Located at an altitude of 263 meters above sea level in the vicinity of Salerno, this fortress is the main goal of travelers making sightseeing trips to the suburbs.  The fortress was built on the site of the Byzantine fortifications by the Duke of Areca II.  Thick walls, competent layout and good location turned it into a serious defensive structure Salerno.  Later, the Normans and Aragonese made significant changes to the building, further strengthening all the buildings, turning the citadel into an impregnable bastion. </p>

    <p>  This fortress was abandoned for a long time and fell into disrepair, but after restoration work that ended in 2001, it reopened the doors for visitors.  Now here is one of the museums in the city with a rich collection of ceramics, coins and weapons. </p><p>  Some Roman bridges have also survived to this day, thrown between the hills on which Salerno lies.  Many bridges are now being used for their intended purpose, which once again confirms the durability and reliability of buildings of Roman architecture. </p><h2>  Antique water pipe </h2><p>  In Salerno you can see another monument to the craftsmanship of ancient builders and engineers - the ancient water supply.  In ancient times, preserved fragments of it represented a single system by which the whole city was supplied with drinking water. </p>

    <p>  In the people, the openwork arches of the water supply system were called the Devil's Bridge, because, according to legend, this aqueduct was built in one night, and construction could be carried out in such a short time only with the help of dark forces.  Passing in the dark under the bridge is now considered a bad sign, which the inhabitants of Salerno (Italy) stubbornly believe in.  Photos of the aqueducts are filled with antique charm and the beauty of medieval stone "lace". </p><h2>  Garden of Minerva </h2><p>  Garden of Minerva is a beautiful old botanical garden, designed for students of a medical school in the Middle Ages.  Here were collected many different plants that were used for medicinal purposes.  In the 17th century, the nursery went into private ownership and for a long time did not have proper care.  At the end of World War II, the garden of Minerva was returned to the ownership of the city.  From 1991 to 2001, a large-scale reconstruction of fountains and canals was carried out here, and the garden was supplemented with rare plant species.  Now it is open for tourists to visit, there are guided tours among plantings with medicinal herbs and shrubs. </p><p>  The country's sunny pearl, the capital of Campania, a beautiful resort that has preserved medieval masterpieces of architecture on its lands, is Salerno (Italy).  Sights of this region invariably attract thousands of tourists from all over Europe in search of new knowledge and experiences. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Many people visit Salerno for its beauties and sights.
