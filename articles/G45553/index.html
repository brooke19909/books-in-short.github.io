  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to solve problems in physics</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Physics is a very entertaining and by no means a simple subject.  Studying the basic principles of this natural science, MI learns about how everything is arranged around.  In order to master the laws of physics, in addition to studying them and a large pile of formulas, you need the ability to solve problems - to apply knowledge in practice and show the ability to use them.  But, most of the students never achieve this goal.  What is the catch?  The main mistake of most students is in the wrong approaches to solving.  After all, it often happens that you seem to know what the condition is about, the basic laws and formulas, and the solution does not work out. </p><p>  There are special algorithms, techniques and techniques that need to be used in order to correctly solve problems. <noindex>  <span>Solving problems in physics of any complexity</span> </noindex>  begins with the correct execution of the conditions. </p><p>  First you need to carefully study the task itself, if there is a need, then you can re-read the condition more than once.  It is necessary to establish the main topic and the physical processes of the problem.  A well-written condition is already half the work, so do not neglect it.  Record all physical quantities with letter designations, and their value with a number.  You need to be careful, because often the data in the conditions are not given by number, but by word.  For example, the boiling point of water, but we know that it is equal to 1000C.  Do not forget about the units, be sure to enter them in your notes.  As a rule, most tasks are solved in the SI system, so you need to transfer the values ‚Äã‚Äãgiven to you to this system.  Also, for the solution, reference data may be needed, which you did not suspect at first (density, boiling point, etc.). </p><p>  After writing down all the data and competent execution of the conditions, you need to decide what you need to find in the problem and correctly designate this value.  Some tasks are simply impossible to solve without a drawing or drawing.  If, reading the condition, you can depict the processes graphically, then do not be lazy and be sure to do it.  Such a move can become your ‚Äúlifeline‚Äù, and, at first glance, things that are not clear to you during visual perception will seem very, very simple. </p><p>  To start the solution itself, you must write down the desired formula.  Problems can be solved by actions, or in a general form (derive one general formula and write down the solution).  To whom it is convenient.  If after recording the conditions you do not know where to start, then try to solve the problem from the end. </p><p>  After solving, be sure to check the answer.  To begin with, look at the consistency of the final result - does your mosquito fly at the speed of light and does the planet weigh less than a gram? </p></div></article>
