Its pilot-cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov piloted.  Throughout the flight, many design flaws were revealed.  A day after launch, the rescue system at the ship's descent during the descent of the device from orbit failed.  The spacecraft with the astronaut crashed to the ground.  With such a tragic incident, the path of the <span>spacecraft</span> began <span>,</span> which later became the space long-liver.

    <p>  The Soyuz is a three-stage launch vehicle (LV).  It was intended to launch the Soyuz manned spacecraft, the Cosmos automated spacecraft, into <span>orbit of the Earth</span> . </p><p>  The process of creating May 20, 1954 began with a decree on the development of an intercontinental <span>ballistic missile.</span>  The leaders of the development process were D.I. Kozlov and S.P. Korolev.  The basis for the new launch vehicle were Voskhod and R-7A.  Construction began in 1953. </p>

    <p>  To test all the characteristics in 1955, the construction of a testing ground began.  It was decided to create it in Kazakhstan at <span>the</span> Tyura-Tam <span>railway station</span> .  Today it is the famous Baikonur cosmodrome. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Only after the successful creation of the Vostok, Voskhod launch vehicle S.P.  Korolev began the development of a completely new area of ‚Äã‚Äãastronautics.  He began to create manned spacecraft (PC) with a household compartment on board.  The PC was supposed to be launched by the Soyuz rocket. </p><p>  We created it on the basis of the Voskhod launch vehicle.  The block of the third stage was subjected to significant modernization.  This made it possible to increase the energy characteristics of the apparatus. </p><h2>  Design </h2>

    <p>  The Soyuz rocket externally has distinctive features in the design.  It is easy to recognize by the four side blocks of a conical shape located on the first stage. </p><p>  The length depends on the type of PC, but it does not exceed the figure of 50.67 meters.  The initial mass should be less than 308 tons with a total fuel weight of 274 tons. </p><p>  Components: </p><ul><li>  Stage 1 includes four starting boosters; </li><li>  2nd is the central block "A"; </li><li>  3rd is block ‚ÄúB‚Äù; </li><li>  emergency rescue system; </li><li>  payload adapter; </li><li>  head fairing. </li></ul><p>  The Soyuz space rocket is capable of launching a load of up to 7.1 tons into orbit. </p><h2>  Fuel </h2><p>  All three stages of the launch vehicle use the same fuel.  They are reactive kerosene T-1.  The oxidizing agent is <span>liquid oxygen.</span>  It is not toxic, but highly flammable and explosive. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For the operation of auxiliary systems, the apparatus is charged with a small amount of <span>liquid nitrogen,</span> hydrogen peroxide. </p><h2>  PH modifications </h2><p>  The Soyuz rocket gave birth to its other modifications: </p><ul><li>  Soyuz-L - for mining the lunar cabin.  Its launches were carried out from the <span>Baikonur Cosmodrome</span> in 1970-1971. </li><li>  Soyuz-M - all launches were conducted from the Plesetsk cosmodrome in 1971-1976.  For the first time, the ship was put into orbit with its help, and then they began to use the Orion Zenit to launch reconnaissance satellites. </li><li>  "Soyuz-U" - is designed to launch into orbit many spacecraft (manned, cargo).  It differs from the basic design by more powerful engines of the 1st and 2nd stages.  To date, about 770 launches have been completed. </li><li>  "Soyuz-2" - a modification of type U. The project is called "Rus." </li><li>  Soyuz-ST is based on the Type 2 base. It provides commercial launches from the Kourou Cosmodrome. </li></ul><h2>  Launch history </h2><p>  From 1966 to 1976, 32 launches were made, of which 30 were successful.  The launch vehicle was first launched on November 28, 1966, as a result of which an unmanned ship was launched into orbit.  The last time the Soyuz rocket, the photo of which is presented, took off on 10/14/1976, launching a transport ship into orbit. </p>

    <p>  All launches were made from Baikonur.  For this, launch pads No. 1, No. 31 were used. </p><p>  The launch of the Soyuz rocket was marked by two disasters, the first of which took place on 12/14/1966.  Problems began in preparation for the launch, when the pyrozapal did not work on the side block.  Automation did not work, the rocket remained standing.  While fuel was draining, the emergency rescue system worked, which all this time was in working mode and monitored the condition of the ship.  The reason for the inclusion of the system was that the Earth during rotation changed the angle, and with it the rocket also replaced it.  The crew at this time stood at the foot of the launch vehicle. </p><p>  In the part of the rocket remaining on the ground, the coolant caught fire.  This led to subsequent explosions.  The bulk of the people managed to leave the territory.  Major Korostylev, who hid behind the wall and suffocated from smoke, died immediately.  On the second day, two soldiers died. </p><p>  The second disaster occurred on 04/05/1975.  On board the PC were V.G.  Lazarev and O.G.  Makarov.  They made the second flight into space.  Malfunctions began when the PC was put into orbit, the automation performed an emergency compartment.  At the same time, a height of 150 kilometers was gained. </p><p>  The ship hit the mountainside near the city of Gorno-Altaysk.  He rolled down the slope and miraculously caught on a tree that grew at the edge of the abyss.  The astronauts survived due to the fact that they did not fire a parachute.  The astronauts were evacuated by helicopter.  Their flight lasted 21 minutes 27 seconds. </p>
