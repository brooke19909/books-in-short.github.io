  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Dosimetric control devices: types, general characteristics, principle of operation</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If various nuclear disasters occur, such as an explosion or accident, then they are accompanied by the release of a significant amount of radioactive particles.  The latter pose a significant danger.  After all, even when split into atoms, they can emit a lethal or simply dangerous dose of radiation. </p><h2>  About the consequences </h2><p>  At the same time, depending on the duration of action and power, environmental contamination is intensified.  All living things that come under harmful effects earn radiation sickness.  It very often leads to death.  To determine the effect of radiation on the environment, dosimetric monitoring devices are used.  Thanks to them, you can determine the level and dose, penetration.  Dosimetric monitoring devices are used to monitor the state of the environment and obtain timely information about the sources of infection, as well as the magnitude of their potential threat. </p><h2>  About types of radiation </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.dosimetershop.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="portable dosimeter" class="if uuid-2762105" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/2762105.jpg"></div><p>  Radiation reconnaissance devices allow you to explore the terrain, objects, food, skin and clothing.  They allow you to identify <span>radiation background</span> and the degree of infection.  The most harmful to humans are gamma and beta rays.  Their specificity is as follows: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Beta rays.  They have an average ionizing effect.  It depends on the density of the propagation medium.  Their high danger is due to significant penetrating ability.  So, ordinary clothes cannot protect from them.  You must have a special suit or use shelter.  A relatively safe norm for this type of radiation is 0.2 ŒºSv / h. </li><li>  Gamma rays.  They pose a significant threat to the conduct of optimal life.  They have short waves, which is why a lot of destructive and penetrating energy is released.  Typically, a person may not feel their effects until they receive a lethal dose. </li></ul><h2>  About the purpose of the equipment </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.dosimetrybadge.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="professional and household dosimetric devices" class="if uuid-2762104" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/2762104.jpg"></div><p>  Given all of the above, it remains only to conclude that, depending on the target and the detected radiation, the following dosimetric monitoring devices are distinguished: </p><ol><li>  The simplest indicators and radiometers.  Used as a means of monitoring the terrain. </li><li>  Radiometers.  Necessary to determine the degree of infection. </li><li>  Dosimeters.  Needed to <span>control exposure,</span> as well as clarify the magnitude of the dose received. </li></ol><p>  These technical means can be designed both for professional services and for domestic needs.  People living in harsh areas can use the simplest instruments to check the environment and food for radioactivity.  Let's look at the mentioned equipment in more detail. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Dosimeters </h2><p>  These devices are used to determine the sum of all types of exposure, or to determine the dose rate received from gamma rays or with x-rays.  Their sensors are internal ionization chambers that are filled with gas.  In addition, there are scintillation and gas discharge counters.  These devices can be both stationary and portable.  In addition, individual and household sets are also distinguished. </p><p>  If we talk about the most famous representatives, it is necessary to recall the DP-5V - a field military dosimeter.  This is a portable device that allows you to work with beta and gamma radiation. </p><p>  But some individual options are also popular.  For example, the DP-22V complex.  It consists of 50 individual dosimeters, as well as a charger for them.  It is used at production facilities in which it is necessary to interact with <span>sources of radioactive radiation.</span>  They are also issued to people who have to work in dangerous areas.  One issued trimmed kit usually includes 5 dosimeters, as well as a charging device.  Although if it comes to civil defense institutions and small units, then a whole set of 50 pieces can be issued.  Usually, an individual dosimeter is placed in the pocket of outerwear.  Observation of the current value is carried out periodically. </p><h2>  Feature Comparison </h2><div class="photo" data-original="megadepot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="instruments for dosimetric control" class="if uuid-2762107" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/2762107.jpg"></div><p>  Instruments intended for dosimetric control differ in their characteristics.  That is, according to the operating range, size, transportation conditions.  To understand the topic in more detail, let's compare the characteristics of two different representatives.  The first will be the already mentioned DP-5V.  Despite the fact that this is a military model, it has become widespread and popular among the civilian population.  For example, the so-called "survivors" love him.  The second object of comparison is the DP-22V.  Well, let's get started: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td><p>  Feature \ Model </p></td><td><p>  5V </p></td><td><p>  22V </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Measurement limits </p></td><td><p>  0.05-200 mR / h-R / h </p></td><td><p>  0-50 X-ray per hour </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Weight </p></td><td><p>  35 gram </p></td><td><p>  3.2 kg </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Full set </p></td><td><p>  5.5 kg </p></td><td><p>  8.2 kg </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Operating temperature range </p></td><td><p>  -50 ... + 50 ¬∫ </p></td><td><p>  -40 ... + 50 ¬∫ </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  As you can see, a portable dosimeter is not always absolutely similar devices. </p><h2>  Indicators, radiometers and radiometers </h2><p>  The main interest for us in the framework of this article is dosimeters.  But if radiation reconnaissance devices were already affected, then it will not work to bypass them: </p><ol><li>  Indicators.  This is the simplest type of instrument that allows radiation reconnaissance and control.  They serve mainly to detect increased levels of radiation.  Their disadvantage is the fact that they provide indicative indications only.  In order to clarify the amount of radiation, it is necessary to use additional means.  Their detector is a gas discharge counter.  The most common options are IMD-21 and DP-64. </li><li>  X-ray meters.  These are already more complex devices.  These instruments are used to measure the received dose of x-ray or gamma radiation.  As sensors, gas-discharge elements or ionization chambers are used.  It all depends on the type of device.  They can function normally at temperatures ranging from 0 to +50 degrees Celsius.  The power source allows the use of x-ray meters up to 2.5 days.  An example is the DP-3B.  It allows radiation reconnaissance on various vehicles (water, land, air). </li><li>  Radiometers.  They are used to determine the magnitude of surface contamination with radioactive particles.  These devices allow you to study the background radiation in a wide variety of conditions and environments, such as gas, aerosol, liquid.  Distinguish between transistor, flexible, miniature and ultra-thin radiometers. </li></ol><p>  These are the radiation intelligence devices that exist. </p><h2>  How to work with them? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.equipcoservices.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dosimetric monitoring devices for the public" class="if uuid-2762391" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/2762391.jpg"></div><p>  To know what professional and household dosimetry devices exist is half the battle.  You must also be able to run them.  To qualitatively remove indicators, you need to properly operate the equipment.  It should be remembered that a strong shake or blow can adversely affect the values ‚Äã‚Äãobtained.  Also, errors in their operation are possible after prolonged exposure to direct sunlight, low temperatures or moisture on the case.  Therefore, make sure that the appliance is clean.  It is necessary to clean it from pollution and dust in a timely manner.  To do this, it is better to use clean oiled material. </p><p>  Attention!  After prolonged use in conditions of high radiation, after work it is necessary to carry out decontamination.  To do this, wipe the screen and the case of the device with wet swabs. </p><h2>  Features of operation and care </h2><p>  In between activities, you must turn off the device.  Also, excessive physical force should not be applied to rotating elements.  Check whether there is enough lubrication in the probe body.  Also, every two years it is necessary to do preventive adjustment of devices.  In this case, one should not forget about the graduation of the scales.  In the presence of severe failures, an unscheduled shipment for metrological operations can be carried out.  If the device is transported, it should be placed in a sealed case, which allows to provide the maximum level of protection against shock and shock.  Also do not forget to monitor the level of charge.  <span>Checking the working</span> condition is carried out on light. </p><h2>  What to choose? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="digitalgeigercounters.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="household radiation dosimeter" class="if uuid-2762106" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/2762106.jpg"></div><p>  Let's look at this issue from the point of view of the general population.  In favor of what is better to make your choice?  There are numerous dosimetric monitoring devices for the population, allowing to determine the radiation background.  They are intended for use in campaigns, in the field work of civilian specialists, and simply for lovers of pastime in the style of "post-apocalypse."  Such characters, perhaps, will make their choice in this vein: only a military dosimetric device! </p><p>  But if there is simply concern about a potentially unsafe object in the area, then something simpler is suitable, for example, an indicator with the possibility of an audible signal to increase the background radiation.  You can choose a home <span>radiation dosimeter,</span> either as a separate device, or complete with related equipment and other sensors that will allow you to more accurately assess the state of the environment.  In general, it depends on the goals set, available financial opportunities and a number of other individual factors. </p><h2>  Where are they used? </h2><p>  First of all, I recall the army and emergency services.  Dosimetric monitoring devices in some cases are extremely important.  They are usually used for training.  But all this is done in case of a dangerous situation when it is necessary to control the radioactive infection of people, material means, equipment, water, food.  Moreover, they perform the following tasks: </p><ol><li>  They confirm compliance with the established requirements of the current sanitary legislation from a radiation-hygienic position, and also identify hazards. </li><li>  Calculate current and predicted exposure levels for various objects. </li><li>  Provide background information for dose calculation, as well as appropriate decisions in the event of emergency exposure.  They also confirm the quality and effectiveness of the existing radiation protection of people. </li></ol><h2>  And it's all? </h2><p>  No, the data obtained is also used for: </p><ol><li>  Improvement of used, as well as the development of new technologies. </li><li>  Providing the public with information to understand the nature and extent of exposure. </li><li>  Epidemiological surveillance of affected people. </li></ol><h2>  A few words about the ionization and classification of devices </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.directindustry.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="radiation intelligence devices" class="if uuid-2762404" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/2762404.jpg"></div><p>  How, in fact, is radioactive radiation detected?  What is the principle of operation of the devices in question?  Their functionality is based on the ability of radiation to ionize the substance of the medium through which it propagates.  This leads to chemical and physical changes in the substance.  All of this is identified and recorded.  What are these changes?  Among the most frequent should be highlighted: </p><ol><li>  Change in electrical conductivity (solid materials, liquids, gases). </li><li>  Luminescence (luminescence) of individual substances. </li><li>  Change in color, color, resistance to electric current and transparency of some chemical solutions. </li><li>  Film exposure. </li></ol><p>  In accordance with the verification scheme, depending on the methodological purpose, the dosimeters are divided into working and reference.  The former are used to record and study ionizing radiation.  The second is necessary to verify the accuracy of the working devices.  Also, devices can be divided into groups depending on the type of interaction effect.  For example: scintillation, photographic, ionization.  Also distinguish stationary, portable and wearable devices.  They can be self-powered, connected to the network, and also do not require energy costs at all. </p><p>  You can still touch on the designation issues.  Up to three digits can be found on the detectors.  The first indicates the type of device, the second indicates the radiation being detected, and the third indicates the area of ‚Äã‚Äãapplication. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.sandipointe.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dosimetric control devices" class="if uuid-2762409" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/2762409.jpg"></div><p>  It should be noted that dosimetric control devices are not such a difficult thing as it might seem at first glance.  But to understand how a particular device works, it‚Äôs still necessary to strain your brains.  To do this, as a rule, just read the instructions that accompany the device.  If it is not understood, then re-read it again.  Did not help?  Then you need to turn to experienced people to explain how a particular device works. </p>
