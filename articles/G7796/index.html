With their help, in the old days it was possible to find out the future, look into the past of a person and see his fate.  In any deck there is a certain set of cards that does not change for many centuries.  Despite the fact that each of them has its own story, the joker is the most interesting.  This map especially captures lovers of secrets.  Since no one knows the true history of its occurrence.  The joker is a card that means a fool, a jester. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="joker joker" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43719/1399413.jpg" width="347"></div>

    <h2>  Etymology of the name </h2><p>  If we consider the word joker, the translation will accurately reflect the very meaning of the card.  In English, this noun denotes a joker or a merry fellow.  In Germany, when pronouncing this word, an association with the old game arises.  There is also an opinion that the origin of the name of this map can be found by looking at medieval records.  The joker first appeared there - a card as part of the famous Tarot deck.  Most often, the image was a funny jester or imp. </p><p>  Sometimes, of course, you can also meet the evil card of the joker, this indicates that this symbol did not always reflect good for the person who was guessed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="joker translation" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43719/1399454.jpg" width="323"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you take the standard French deck, then this image appears twice.  It happens that one or two of these cards are present in the set, although people are not used to it.  Oddly enough, but this name has migrated to other games.  For example, in the famous mahjong game, the joker is an additional game dice. </p><h2>  The image of the joker on the maps </h2><p>  Most often in the picture they draw a court jester with a cap on his head.  Since there are two such cards in the deck, they almost do not differ from each other.  On Tarot cards they are portrayed in the opposite mood: cheerful - gloomy.  In playing sets, jokers are of different colors, to match the suits present, that is, red and black.  In Australian Queen's Slipper cards, they decided to highlight this card, so that the local kookabur bird, also called the giant kingfisher, is drawn on the joker.  In general, it is believed that she was taken as an addition to the map, since the cry of this bird is very similar to human laughter.  Later they began to say that the joker is a bird that brings fun with it.  If we talk about the letter index of the joker, then this is usually J or the word Joker. </p><h2>  How the joker appeared </h2><p>  This name (Joker) is considered only a pronunciation error.  According to rumors, the Germans incorrectly repeated the word Juker for the British, which denoted a game that was popular in its time.  In the same form of entertainment, the first card appeared, which has a particularly high dignity in comparison with all the others.  It is sometimes said that the "joker" comes from the word "poker". </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Joker in esoteric </h2><p>  In the <span>version of the Tarot</span> that came to us from France, you can see that this card has not only existed unchanged for several centuries, but also has a very interesting meaning.  The presence of this card in the layout immediately indicates a certain rebellion, rebellion in fate.  Most likely, this is the case, because jesters were never so attached to anyone, they were not considered dependent, like servants or warriors. </p>

These people perfectly adapt to the situation, and therefore constantly win.  Do not underestimate this card, as it shows how strong are the capabilities of a person in whom others or even close people do not believe.

    <h2>  How to use the joker card </h2><p>  Depending on which card game is selected, you can find out if the joker is used there or not.  In some of them, it is a key link, which is simply impossible to replace.  Sometimes the presence of this card practically does not change the essence of the game.  In classic gambling entertainment, such as poker, there is an option with bonus games where there is a jester card.  A game called Joker's Wild has appeared in online slots, capable of providing a person with several types of jokers at once.  On the Internet portals there are many varieties of games where this map appears in one way or another. </p>

Most often, it enhances combinations precisely, so many people are waiting for his appearance throughout the game.  In rare cases, it happens that, on the contrary, it causes panic and horror among players.  This is found in games where you need to collect paired cards.  In this case, this card is left alone, which means it provides the player with a deliberate loss.  In all other entertainments, the Joker guarantees a good game, the constant presence of Madame Fortune.  Many experienced players specifically think about the joker, trying to mentally pull it into their hands.  And even though the jester card has long been used in games and esotericism, its origin remains a mystery.
