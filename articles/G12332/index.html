Why did this or that ruler do this, and not otherwise?  Why did this or that event happen, the influence of which is still felt in our life?  Scientists and archaeologists are not always able to give definitive and comprehensive answers to the above questions. </p><p>  One of these extraordinary original figures of world history is Charlemagne (the years of the reign of the ruler: 768-814).  What kind of man was this ruler?  What states did he govern and what was he able to achieve thanks to his reign?  We will talk about this in this article, as well as find out when the proclamation of Charlemagne by the Roman emperor took place and how this event affected the whole future history of mankind. </p>

    <p>  But first, of course, we will get acquainted with the king himself, his childhood, youth and youth. </p><h2>  Date of Birth </h2><p>  Before you know the year of the proclamation of Charlemagne as emperor, you should find out when this powerful man was born. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is noteworthy that historians still argue about the true date of his birth.  In the medieval historical work Petanian Annals, written by an anonymous author, it is mentioned that the Frankish king Karl was born in seven hundred and forty-seven AD, and a little later, his younger brother Karloman. </p><p>  In other, no less reliable sources, two other possible dates of the sovereign's birth are mentioned.  According to one report, he died in his seventieth year of life, while according to other sources, this happened two years later.  As you can see, historical and archaeological traditions regarding the birth of Charlemagne are contradictory.  However, it can be assumed that he was born between 742 and 747 years of our era. </p><h2>  Another riddle </h2><p>  The place of birth of the emperor remains unclear.  According to the calculations of many historians, it may be one of the German cities Aachen or Ingelheim, or the French French community of Fiercy. </p><h2>  Change of dynasties </h2><p>  Before considering in detail the moment of the proclamation of Charlemagne as emperor, let's learn a little about the childhood of the future ruler. </p><p>  It is not surprising, but he was not born into the family of the monarch.  How could this happen? </p><p>  The history of Charlemagne is rich in auspicious events and successful incidents.  The fact is that when he was just born, the country was ruled by a monarch from another royal dynasty, the Merovingian dynasty.  Karl's father, Pepin Korotky, served as mayor at the court of this emperor.  He and his wife, Bertrad Laonskaya, were actively engaged in the political affairs of the country and longed for the unification of neighboring kindred peoples. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The last of the Merovingian dynasty was a weak and weak-willed person.  He completely fell under the influence of his environment and carried out all the decisions of the senior mayordom.  In the end, Pepin Korotky entered into a treacherous alliance with the Pope, as a result of which the legal king was deprived of all rights and sent to the monastery, and the usurper received power and the royal diadem.  In gratitude from the new ruler, the Pope received rich lands in the very center of Italy. </p><h2>  Joyful childhood </h2><p>  How did this situation affect little Karl?  As a child, he, along with his younger brother, was publicly anointed for the kingdom in the abbey of Saint-Denis.  The father prepared the eldest son for emperors, took him on military campaigns and introduced him to state affairs.  The boy grew up a healthy, strong, inquisitive and active child, distinguished from many of his peers by a complaisant and peaceful character. </p>

    <p>  Fourteen years after the anointing of his sons to the kingdom, Pipin Korotky died, and the heirs, according to the will, divided the royal estates among themselves.  When did the proclamation of Charlemagne the emperor of Rome?  Read about it later. </p><h2>  The path to absolute power </h2><p>  Having divided the Frankish state, the brothers became rivals and competitors to each other.  The courtiers surrounding them constantly tried to embroil young people.  And the kings themselves weaved intrigues against each other, plotting to seize someone else's territory and become absolute rulers in the kingdom. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Once, when a rebellion arose among the Basques and Aquitans, Karl himself had to crush him without the help of his brother.  Fearing the conspiracy of Karloman and the Lombard king, Karl married his daughter and entered into an alliance with his son-in-law.  However, all the tricks turned out to be unnecessary, because after a couple of years Karloman suddenly died.  This death made it possible for Karl to seize his brother's possessions and proclaim himself a single Frankish king. </p>

    <p>  However, these are not all the events preceding the proclamation of Charlemagne as emperor of Rome. </p><h2>  Territorial extensions due to the Saxons </h2><p>  Beginning in 771, in the hands of the king were huge prosperous possessions.  The borders of the Frankish state included the lands of modern France, Belgium, Germany, Austria and even a small part of the Netherlands. </p><p>  However, Charlemagne was not content with this.  He decided to strengthen his territorial property by annexing several more small states to the kingdom.  Thus began the fierce predatory battles that went down in history under the many-sided name of the Saxon Wars. </p>

    <p>  It all started with the numerous skirmishes of the Frankish state with its ferocious and intolerant neighbors.  After it was decided to fight against them at the Worm Diet, the king personally led the army, invaded one of the largest cities in Saxony and destroyed its pagan shrine. </p><p>  Of course, the northern Germans were not going to give up their territory so easily, so the war with them was lengthy and bloody.  Beginning in 772 for more than thirty years, battles were fought between two powerful states.  The forces were almost equal, so victory often passed from one ruler to another.  Finally, having made an alliance against Saxony with its enemies (Bodrich Slavs), Charlemagne pacified the rebellious people and annexed vast rich territories.  In order to reconcile the Saxons with defeat, a decree was issued on the equality of Franks and Saxons in the face of law. </p><h2>  Conquering the Lombards </h2><p>  In the process of fighting the Saxon state, Charlemagne led military campaigns against the Lombard kingdom.  This was primarily due to the intrigues of his sovereign against the almighty Frankish ruler.  Deciding to replace the enemy, Karl went to war against his people.  According to historians, he was not given fierce opposition, which most likely helped the Pope. </p><p>  After the Lombard king surrendered and was forcibly tonsured a monk, the Frankish sovereign united territories such as Gaul and Italy.  With the support of the Pope, he became a full-fledged monarch of that locality. </p>

    <h2>  Affirmation of dominion </h2><p>  Gradually, the great Charles captured Bavaria and the Avar Kaganate, as well as some Slavic and Gallic lands. </p><p>  As you can see, the territory of the empire of Charlemagne was a rather impressive power, huge in area and number of inhabitants.  Holding so many conflicting nations and tribes in obedience was a very serious and difficult task.  Therefore, the internal policy pursued in the state of Charlemagne was focused on the prevention of all kinds of riots, riots and rebellions. </p>

    <p>  However, before talking about the powerful empire of this ruler, let's find out how Charles the Great was proclaimed emperor? </p><h2>  Coronation of Charlemagne </h2><p>  Judging by historical reports, this event was not marked by grandiose traditional ceremonies.  Why? </p><p>  The fact is that the coronation of Charlemagne occurred rather spontaneously and unexpectedly.  More precisely, this is how the emperor himself presented this matter. </p><p>  These are the events that preceded the wedding of the Frankish king to the Roman kingdom.  In the eight hundred year, the king went to Rome to solve the feud between the Pope and the nobility displeased with him.  He was in the Catholic capital for more than six months, when one day (this was the celebration of Christmas) during the ceremony, the Pope laid the imperial crown on Karl‚Äôs head.  Those present in the cathedral unanimously proclaimed the Frankish king as god-crowned emperor. </p>

    <p>  The sovereign himself, wanting to calm the court of Constantinople, pretended to be dissatisfied with the Pope‚Äôs self-willed act.  And yet he boldly entered into new powers, wanting to fully reunite the West and the East. </p><p>  So, we learned how the empire of Charlemagne appeared (the years of the reign of the sovereign as the Roman emperor - 800-814). </p><p>  Next, let's talk about what is remarkable for the policy of this emperor. </p><h2>  When did the empire of Charlemagne flourish? </h2><p>  It is difficult to answer this question briefly. </p><p>  As a wise ruler, Charlemagne took care of the invulnerability of his absolute power.  As you know, the less rebellions and uprisings in a state, the better ordinary people live in it. </p><p>  To prevent usurpation of the throne, the emperor uprooted the concept of "duchy."  From now on, the counts ruled the localities, and their power was adjusted and supervised in accordance with royal law. </p><p>  What other reforms were carried out by Karl the Great? </p><h2>  Other changes </h2><p>  Twice a year, a state assembly was held in the state, one of which allowed all free citizens of the empire.  Thanks to such transformations, the king first-hand learned about the needs and requirements of various territories of his great and powerful power. </p>

    <p>  The following reforms of Charlemagne related to economic changes in the state.  The wise and kind ruler paid great attention to the construction of cities and religious buildings.  For this, complex construction work was carried out to cut down forests, dry swamps, etc. </p><p>  Charles the Great assigned religion a large role in his empire.  Being on friendly terms with the Pope, the governor personally determined the highest spiritual ranks for trusted people, and also convened cathedrals and issued church decrees.  He spread Christianity throughout his empire and supported the clergy, for example, by defining tithes for him. </p><p>  In his innovations, the emperor drew attention to the spread of literacy.  Schools for ordinary people were arranged at churches and monasteries, and an academy was established in the palace to educate courtiers and their children.  Charlemagne also patronized many outstanding scholars and poets of the time. </p><p>  The signs listed above show when the empire of Charlemagne reached its peak.  What happened then? </p><h2>  The collapse of the great empire </h2><p>  Despite the labors of this talented and wise monarch, his power eventually lost its integrity and greatness.  This process took place gradually over several centuries.  What are the main reasons for the collapse of the great Roman Empire, which began with the death of its first and most powerful ruler? </p><p>  According to historians, the descendants of Charlemagne have discredited themselves as representatives of the authorities.  They no longer aroused respect or fear among the people. </p><p>  Moreover, as we learned from this article, the empire consisted of many peoples, different in mentality, customs and traditions.  It is practically impossible for such distinctive nations to be in complete unity and harmony with each other. </p><p>  The oppression of the peasantry is the third reason for the collapse of the Roman Empire, as it led to numerous uprisings, which could take advantage of the neighboring neighboring states. </p>
