As a result, each of the warring parties sought to regularly increase their own combat effectiveness by increasing the production of new modern aircraft, constantly updating them and improving them.  Engineers and scientists, many laboratories and research institutes, testing centers and design bureaus worked on this task.  Together, they created advanced military equipment.  It was a time of incredible development and progress in aircraft construction.  It is worth noting another fact.  At that time, the era of airplanes ended, the structure of which was based on piston engines. </p><h2>  Features of the development of military aviation </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.theschoolrun.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="World fighters 2" class="if uuid-3060001" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3060001.jpg"></div><p>  World War 2 fighters were fundamentally different from civilian aircraft in that during the Second World War their effectiveness was immediately established in practice.  If at other times aircraft designers and military specialists, placing a new order for one or another model of aircraft, were based on rather speculative ideas about the nature of the future model or could be guided by very limited experience in local conflicts, then in wartime the situation changed radically.  The practice of regular battles in the sky contributed to the rapid progress in aviation.  At the same time, it turned into a key criterion, which was taken into account when choosing future directions for the development and comparison of the quality of aircraft.  Each of the participants in the military conflict proceeded from personal experience in participating in hostilities.  Everything was taken into account: technological capabilities, the availability of resources, the level of development of our own aviation industry. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Most of the fighters of World War II were created by the Soviet Union, England, Germany, the USA and Japan.  They played a decisive role during the immediate armed struggle. </p><p>  Among the fighters there were many truly outstanding examples.  Of great interest in our time is the comparison of these machines, the comparison of scientific and engineering ideas used in their design.  Among the many varieties of aircraft that took part in air battles, there are representatives of different schools of aircraft construction.  Therefore, we immediately emphasize that it will be incredibly difficult to choose definitely the best fighters of World War 2. </p><p>  It is important to note that fighters were an important factor confirming air superiority during the battle with the enemy.  The result of military operations, including with the participation of other types of troops, mainly depended on their effectiveness.  It is for this reason that the class of technology considered in the article developed so quickly. </p><p>  The best fighters of World War 2 are considered to be the <span>Soviet</span> La-7 and Yak-3 aircraft, the American Mustang and North American R-51, the English Spitfire supermarine, the German Messerschmitt. </p><p>  Almost all of them appeared in 1943, and at the latest - at the beginning of 1944.  In these fighters of World War II, the experience of the warring powers already accumulated by then was reflected.  These aircraft became real symbols of aviation of their time. </p><h2>  Fighter Types </h2><p>  Now about how the fighters of World War II, which had the greatest influence on its course, differed from each other.  It is important to note the combat conditions in which they were created.  For example, the war in the East clearly demonstrated that a relatively low altitude is required of aviation if there is a front line on which the ground army is the main armed force. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Soviet-German confrontation demonstrated that the vast majority of air battles took place at an altitude of about four and a half kilometers, regardless of what was the maximum height that aircraft could climb.  Therefore, Soviet aircraft designers, improving engines and fighters, were required to take this into account. </p><p>  But the American Mustangs and English Spitfires could rise to great heights, as they counted on a different nature of military conflicts.  In addition, the Mustang also had a greater flight range, which was required to accompany heavy bombers.  Due to this, he was much heavier than the Spitfire, as well as other domestic and German fighters of World War II. </p><p>  Given that each state prepared combat vehicles for different conditions, the meaning of the question is lost, which of the vehicles is more efficient.  It becomes expedient to compare only the solution to key technical problems and the nuances in the design. </p><p>  Fundamentally, the German fighters differ, which were originally intended for battles on the Western and Eastern front. </p><p>  Now, in detail about what were the important differences between the best fighters of World War II.  This issue will be examined from all sides, including on the features of the technical ideology that was laid down by the designers during the design. </p><h2>  Spitfire </h2><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Spitfire fighter" class="if uuid-3060000" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3060000.jpg"></div><p>  In terms of the concept that was used in the creation, the most unusual are the American Mustang and the English <span>Spitfire XIV.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The English fighter of World War 2 was a truly outstanding combat vehicle.  It was he who managed to bring down the German fighter Me 262 in an air battle. </p><p>  The basis for the Spitfire aircraft was created in the UK a few years before the start of the war.  When designing, an attempt was made to combine incompatible things, as it seemed at that time.  This is maneuverability, high speed, which was then characteristic only of high-speed monoplane fighters, as well as maneuverability.  Basically, the goal was achieved. </p><p>  Like most other high-speed fighters, the Spitfire was a streamlined, monoplane monoplane.  Moreover, he had a large enough wing for its weight, which gave a large load to a single unit of surface. </p><p>  Of course, this approach could not be considered exceptional.  Japanese designers have already resorted to such a technological solution.  But the British went even further.  Due to the significant <span>aerodynamic drag of the</span> wing, which was very large in size, it was impossible to hope for a maximum flight speed.  And this indicator was one of the key for the fighters of that time. </p><p>  To reduce the resistance, thinner profiles were used.  For this, the wing was given an elliptical shape.  Such a technical solution made it possible to reduce aerodynamic drag in maneuvering modes and during flight at the highest possible altitudes. </p><p>  The British managed to create a truly outstanding combat aircraft, but this does not mean at all that it lacked any shortcomings.  Due to the small load that fell on the wing, it was inferior to most fighters of that time in terms of acceleration properties on a dive.  Much slower than almost all similar devices of that time, he responded to the actions of the crew during the roll. </p><p>  It should be recognized that all these shortcomings were not of a fundamental nature.  Military experts admit that, on the whole, it was one of the outstanding aircraft for battles in the sky, which in the present case demonstrated its excellent qualities. </p><h2>  "Mustang" </h2><div class="photo" data-original="nationalinterest.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mustang fighter" class="if uuid-3060004" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3060004.jpg"></div><p>  Among several variants of the <span>American</span> Mustang <span>aircraft</span> , models equipped with the English Merlin engine were the most popular.  Since 1944, it was they who ensured the safety of heavy US Air Force bombers from attacks by German fighters. </p><p>  Their main distinguishing feature in the field of aerodynamics was the laminar wing, which was first used in aircraft manufacturing.  Interestingly, experts argued a lot about the appropriateness of its use on fighters. </p><p>  Immediately at the end of the 1930s, great hopes were placed on such wings, since under certain conditions they had much lower aerodynamic drag.  However, the experience of their application on the ‚ÄúMustangs‚Äù diminished optimism.  It turned out that with direct use in battle, the wing becomes too ineffective.  The reason was that maximum accuracy was required in the design of profiling and meticulous surface finish to implement the laminar flow on such a wing. </p><p>  During the application of the protective coating, roughness occurred, which inevitably appeared at the beginning of mass production.  As a result, the effect of laminarization on the wing was significantly reduced.  As a result, laminar profiles were significantly worse than those used earlier, and this led to serious difficulties when it became necessary to present effective characteristics of takeoff and landing and maneuvering properties. </p><p>  At the same time, laminar profiles had the best speed characteristics.  When diving at significant altitudes, at which the speed of sound turned out to be lower than near the ground, the aircraft managed to achieve speeds at which features appeared that were characteristic of conditions close to the speed of sound.  It was possible to increase the critical speed of American fighters of World War 2 by reducing the thickness of the profile or by using faster profiles, which were laminar. </p><h2>  Appearance story </h2><p>  It is noteworthy that the Mustang was developed as soon as possible.  Initially, its customer was the UK government.  The first prototype made a test flight at the end of 1940.  Only 117 days have passed since the placement of the production order. </p><p>  Interestingly, in the spring of 1942, according to the results of tests by British testers, the altitude characteristics of the aircraft did not satisfy the experts.  But at the same time, they were so impressed with the speed at low altitudes and maneuverability that it was decided to conduct further consultations. </p><p>  During World War 2, US fighters patrolled the English Channel, stormed ground targets in northern France.  The first air battle took place over Dieppe in the summer of 1942. </p><p>  Since 1944, they began to be used as reconnaissance aircraft to cover long-range bombers who attacked German territory. </p><p>  The appearance of US fighters in World War II in the skies over Germany greatly worsened the situation for the anti-aircraft forces of the Third Reich.  The Germans found it difficult to fight with American fighters, which actually linked them with attacks during climb, takeoff, and attempts to intercept Allied bomber aircraft. </p><h2>  Soviet aviation </h2><div class="photo" data-original="waralbum.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Yak-3 fighters" class="if uuid-3060065" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3060065.jpg"></div><p>  The history of the creation of Soviet fighters of World War 2 was very unusual.  By and large, La-7 and Yak-3 aircraft became modifications of the LaGG-3 and Yak-1 models, developed back in 1940. </p><p>  By the end of the war, it was the Yak-3 that became the most popular fighter in the domestic air force.  For example, it was just on it that the French pilots of the Normandie-Niemen air regiment fought, who noted that this plane gives them complete superiority over the enemy. </p><p>  Large-scale processing of this model was undertaken in 1943 to improve air performance with a fairly small capacity of the plants themselves.  The determining factor in this project was the reduction in the weight of the combat vehicle, which was possible to do by reducing the wing area.  This affected the aerodynamic features.  This project of significant improvement of the aircraft was recognized as the most effective, since modern engines of sufficient power in the Soviet industry were not yet in serial production. </p><p>  It is interesting that this path in <span>aviation technology</span> was extremely extraordinary.  The standard way to improve the flight data system at that time was to improve aerodynamic performance without fundamentally changing the dimensions of the airframe itself.  The installation of more powerful motors was also practiced, which was accompanied by a significant increase in weight. </p><p>  The Yak-3 was much lighter than the Yak-1.  It had a smaller wing area and profile thickness, and also had outstanding aerodynamic properties.  At the same time, the power-to-weight ratio of the aircraft significantly increased, its acceleration characteristics, rate of climb, and vertical maneuverability improved.  At the same time, in terms of landing and take-off, horizontal maneuverability, unit load on the wing, practically no changes occurred.  During the war, the Yak-3 became one of the simplest combat aircraft in the field of piloting. </p><p>  It is worth recognizing that in tactical terms it was still inferior to vehicles that had more powerful weapons and the duration of a combat flight.  But at the same time, he supplemented them, realizing the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa high-speed, light and maneuverable machine for rapid air combat.  First of all, it was intended for battles with enemy fighters. </p><h2>  Baptism of fire </h2><p>  The success of World War II fighters in the USSR was talked about in the summer of 1944, when the Yak-3 passed a baptism of fire.  Pilots loved and appreciated him for the ease and simplicity of control. </p><p>  This fighter was maximally lightened, including due to the fact that its wooden elements were replaced with metal ones.  They also significantly reduced the fuel supply.  As a result, the Yak-3 has become one of the lightest fighters of World War II.  Almost five thousand models were produced in the USSR, of which more than four thousand were directly during the war. </p><p>  On most air combat vehicles, small-caliber automatic guns and Berezin machine guns were installed. </p><h2>  La 7 </h2><div class="photo" data-original="grafiq.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="La-7 fighter" class="if uuid-3059999" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3059999.jpg"></div><p>  Those who are interested in aviation and want to know something about World War 2 fighters will be interested in the story of the creation of another Soviet combat aircraft, the La-7.  First, on the basis of LaGG-3, which turned out to be frankly unsuccessful, La-5 was developed.  It compares favorably with the previous model only in a powerful propulsion system. </p><p>  In the future, it was decided to pay attention to aerodynamic improvement.  During the years 1942-1943, fighters of this type passed numerous tests at design bureaus.  Their main goal was to identify the main sources of aerodynamic losses, as well as to determine how to reduce aerodynamic drag. </p><p>  The important significance of this work was the alleged changes in designs that did not require significant alterations of the aircraft, changes in the production process and made it possible to mass-produce them. </p><p>  La-7 can rightfully be called one of the best high-altitude fighters of World War II.  He was distinguished by excellent maneuverability, high speed, as well as rate of climb.  Compared to other fighters, La-7s were very tenacious because they had an air-cooled engine.  And most fighters of that time could not boast of this. </p><h2>  German car </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ww2today.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Messerschmitt fighter" class="if uuid-3060002" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3060002.jpg"></div><p>  The German Messerschmitt fighter was designed in parallel with the Spitfire.  Like the English machine, he became a successful model of a military combat aircraft, which has come a long way in evolution.  More powerful engines were installed, <span>its aerodynamics, aerobatic and operational characteristics were</span> improved <span>.</span> </p><p>  It is believed that this particular aircraft was the most prominent representative of the maneuverable and light combat vehicle of the Hitler Air Force.  Almost throughout the Second World War, the Messerschmitts were recognized as the best examples of aircraft of their class. </p><h2>  Junkers </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.cgtrader.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Junkers fighter" class="if uuid-3060003" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3060003.jpg"></div><p>  The Junkers fighter was produced in several modifications, becoming a model of modern precision-guided weapons for its time.  Among the aircraft, which rose to relatively low altitudes and dive plumb, were German planes of World War II.  Tank destroyers - the so-called "Junkers". </p><p>  Due to the specific application in high load conditions, the machine was equipped with automatic brakes, which were used in case of loss of consciousness by the pilot to exit the peak. </p><p>  The Junkers used an additional psychological effect, including the Jericho Pipe during the attack.  That was the name of the special device that issued a terrible howl. </p>
