    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Botanical Garden Minsk" class="if" height="418" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7454/464361.jpg" width="600"></div>  We go to the <span>capital of Belarus</span> to visit the local botanical garden.  Minsk is a wonderful city in many respects - clean, well-groomed, comfortable.  Parks, squares, fresh green lawns, overgrown trees around residential buildings, alleys along the streets ... However, one of the main attractions of the city is precisely the botanical garden.  Minsk got the opportunity to open it even before World War II - in 1932.  Naturally, in severe cruelty and years of fascist occupation, the garden was badly damaged.  Therefore, during the restoration of the city, special attention was paid to the planting and cultivation of new plantings.  Thanks to the reconstruction, the territory of the arboretum expanded, and its collection was enriched.  While conducting excursions here, employees proudly emphasize that at present one of the largest in Europe is this botanical garden.  Minsk covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã348.84 km¬≤.  Of these, 153 hectares were assigned by the city administration to the reserve.  Residents of the capital advise guests to definitely visit this picturesque corner, not forgetting to grab a camera or camera.  Here they will meet with more than 9 thousand different plants, most of which are rare exotic species.  Luxurious flowerbeds, picturesque groups of trees, ponds with mirrored water and swimming beautiful swans, original statues and arbors - this is the central botanical garden.  Minsk is known not only in the CIS countries, but also in Europe for its unique arboretum.

Do not hurry!  First you need to find out if the botanical garden (Minsk) is open, its working hours and other organizational issues.  What can we tell you about this?  Excursions - collective and individual - in the arboretum begin on April 30 and end on October 31.  That is, it is open precisely in those months when the plants are most active: they are covered with greenery, bloom, fragrant, and bear fruit.  In late autumn, winter, and early spring, nature begins to rest, sleepy numbness.  And the "inhabitants" of the reserve are gaining strength in order to once again open up the hospitable embrace of their green kingdom with the onset of real heat.  The exception is the greenhouse - it is available at any time of the year.  The second important point about how the botanical garden functions (Minsk).  Opening hours: from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., from Tuesday to Sunday.  On Monday, the arboretum does not accept guests.

Firstly, these are the expositions in the central greenhouse under the general name ‚ÄúBotanical Garden: Minsk-2014‚Äù.  Near the pavilion is equipped with a real alpine slide.  Secondly, the limonaria, which grows, in addition to the usual, outlandish species of citrus.  A delightful sight is the ‚Äúisland‚Äù of blooming rhododendrons and another is the odorous <span>yellow iris.</span>  A special charm is given to the park by funny animals, sculptural figures of which suddenly appear in front of you from behind trees and bushes, near convenient benches.  And finally, the miracle swans living on the park lake!  A more complete picture of all the activities and attractions of the park gives the site of the Botanical Garden.  Minsk is waiting for guests!

The territory was carefully selected, because it was supposed to be an object of republican significance.  An area of ‚Äã‚Äã90 hectares in a pine forest was most suitable.  As already written, later its territory grew to 153 hectares.  In the 60s a lake was built here.  And in 1967 the park was equated with the research institute of the Academy of Sciences of Belarus and received the corresponding status.  Since then, the garden has been the most important state base for scientific research in the field of crop production.  On its territory there are several biological schools conducting experiments on plant breeding, survival of species in the Belarusian climate.  A special object, thanks to which the capital's botanical garden (Minsk) stands out, is a greenhouse.  Its opening took place in 2007.  Exotic plant species such as the Madagascar <span>bottle tree,</span> bamboos and eucalyptus trees, cacti and agaves, jasmine, magnolia, orange and coffee trees, cypresses and palm trees settled here.  The inhabitants of the tropics and subtropics feel very comfortable in the greenhouse and grow to the delight of scientists and tourists.

And as the exhibition halls are the geographical sectors into which the park is divided.  Walking along them, visitors to the arboretum can visit North America and Central Asia, join the nature of the Far East and Siberia, the Caucasus and Crimea.  The envoys of Southern and <span>Central Europe,</span> Australia and the Pamirs welcome their guests with their green palms to the guests of the botanical garden.  The exposition ‚ÄúCorners of Germany‚Äù will seem very informative to visitors.  It demonstrates what a typical German farm manor looks like.  A Belarusian garden plot adjoins it.

    <h2>  Kingdom of flowers </h2><p>  And another live exhibition invariably attracts visitors.  It is called "Flowers of the World."  500 varieties of tulips, 300 varieties of peonies, roses, lilies, hyacinths, lilacs and many other noble garden types of flowers delight anyone who sees this magnificence.  The exhibition is invariably replenished with new unique copies.  Soon another unique exhibition will open in the park - live butterflies. </p><p>  Welcome to the <span>Central Botanical Garden!</span> </p>
