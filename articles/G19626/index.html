This is the reason for this attitude to smartphones, tablets and other electronics from the Middle Kingdom. </p><p>  But few people noticed that in recent years, Chinese companies have significantly increased their share of presence in the global market.  Many mobile phones produced and developed in this country, now occupies one of the first places in the ranking of sales.  Some companies (for example Xiaomi) even prophesy industry leadership in the next 3-5 years. </p>

    <p>  The object of our review today is another Chinese smartphone that has several features.  He does not have a big name, is not advertised on all banners and banners and in general does not compete with the giants of the global smartphone industry.  However, this is an interesting phone that can satisfy the demands of the average user with interest.  We are talking about the THL 5000. We will try to present reviews of the phone, as well as its characteristics, in this article. </p><h2>  Who heard of THL? </h2><p>  Let's start with the manufacturer, which introduced the phone.  Surely many of us have not even heard that there is such a brand as THL (these three letters are deciphered, by the way, as Technology Happy Life).  This is not surprising, because the company has been present in the electronics market relatively recently - since 2008.  What is most interesting, until 2013, hardly anyone could hear about it outside of China, because it was from their homeland <span>that this concern</span> began its development.  By 2012, as noted on the official website, THL managed to open more than three hundred stores across the country.  Apparently, only after such success the company began its growth around the world. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now in electronics stores in our country you can find several models of devices from this manufacturer.  True, the THL 5000 smartphone is still the most famous. We will give reviews about it a bit further in the text, and now we will describe how the phone is trying to show on the market. </p><h2>  General Positioning Model 5000 </h2>

    <p>  The main "trick" of the phone lies in its name - "5000".  Of course, it carries a special meaning, because it is such a capacity that the device‚Äôs battery has.  Exactly 5000 mAh!  You ask, is it a lot or a little?  We answer: iPhone offer with a <span>battery capacity of</span> about 1800 mAh.  Even taking into account the fact that the equipment on the iOS operating system consumes less charge than Android, with a 5000-thousandth battery, a smartphone from THL obviously solves one of the main problems of devices on this OS - lack of charging, its too fast consumption. </p><p>  In addition to this feature, the phone has nothing to brag about.  Yes, it has an attractive design and a lot of advantages, however, both have been repeatedly implemented on other Chinese phones.  As for the battery, with it you can take your THL 5000 on a fairly long journey. Reviews indicate that a single charge lasts about 120 hours of music.  The manufacturer himself on the official website claims 40 hours of conversation, 10 - work with the mobile Internet, and 15 - watching video. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  These characteristics are provided so that you understand how hardy this phone is.  In the meantime, let's start with its general characteristics, for which we first unpack the box from under the device. </p><h2>  Open the box </h2>

    <p>  Holding a package with a phone in our hands, the first thing we pay attention to is the simplicity of its design.  It is made of strong, dense, but white cardboard, which actually has no design.  Thus, obviously, manufacturers make it clear that the most interesting is inside the package. </p><p>  So, open the box and take out the device.  It should be noted that the packaging itself is assembled quite high quality, due to which it is hardly possible to damage the phone during transportation.  This is a clear plus. </p><p>  The phone lies on top of the partition, lifting it, we find additional accessories.  Apparently, the developers of THL 5000 (customer reviews confirm this) make a thorough emphasis on a rich set of smartphones, with which you will not need to purchase anything extra.  Read on for what is meant. </p><h2>  Device Options </h2><p>  So what does THL offer everyone who buys a 5000 phone?  Firstly, this is the device itself.  The factory film for transportation is glued on its screen, which you probably have to peel off, since the view with it is not good enough.  Secondly, in the box with the device we find headphones.  They, of course, are original, made by order of the developer company, and therefore have the same logo as the smartphone.  The color of the headset is white and, apparently, you can not choose it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Thirdly, with the model in the kit, a set consisting of a <span>protective film</span> and two covers is also offered.  There is nothing special to say about the film, but the covers are a transparent bumper and a leather ‚Äúbook‚Äù.  Their quality, if evaluated on a 5-point scale, clearly does not exceed 3.5-4 points.  Although for the first time it‚Äôs completely fine. </p><p>  In addition to all of the above, in the box we also find a charger consisting of a cord and an adapter, as well as instructions. </p><h2>  Device display </h2><p>  From the review of the configuration, we turn to the first thing that catches your eye - the display of the phone.  According to the technical specifications, the screen on the THL 5000 phone (reviews of which are generally good) is a 5-inch sensor based on the IPS matrix.  Thanks to the pixel density of 441 ppi, the picture transfer on the phone is excellent.  The only negative point is that the image quality is not too good when viewed at an angle.  If you turn the phone, a color change will be noticeable depending on the review, which should not be. </p><p>  In order to protect them from scratches, manufacturers covered the THL 5000 model with <span>Gorilla Glass</span> 3 glass. Reviews indicate that this solution really helps, although most users do not refuse the film. </p><h2>  Technical stuffing </h2>

    <p>  The screen of any device is good, but the "heart" of the device is also important - its filling. </p><p>  According to the technical parameters, the THL 5000 smartphone works on the basis of the <span>Mediatek MT6592</span> Turbo processor. Owner reviews show that this equipment allows you to run any, even the most demanding, games like Real Racing 3 or Respawnables without delay.  These and many other applications work perfectly due to the high frequency of smartphone performance, equal to 2 GHz. </p><h2>  Smartphone camera </h2><p>  THL 5000 (user reviews confirm this) is equipped with two cameras with a resolution of 13 and 5 megapixels.  They, in turn, have various additions, such as automatic face recognition, focus, flash (on the main one).  The camera manufacturer (according to the technical documentation) is Sony. </p><p>  As the reviews of the owners testify to the THL 5000, the pictures come out quite clear, albeit with not too saturated colors.  Perhaps the device does not have good color rendering, due to which the pictures produce a somewhat unrealistic <span>white balance</span> and other tones.  However, you can put a solid four for the photos. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  In the issue of software installed on the model, there is nothing new and unexpected.  Android 4.2.2 KitKat is installed here, which is the most stable version of the 4th generation.  The manufacturer does not report whether the next version will be released.  If such an update happens, it will happen soon.  Therefore, users will have to be content with what they have.  Although, of course, KitKat proved to be a very good system. </p>

    <h2>  Features of THL 5000 </h2><p>  Among the additional features of THL 5000 (Black), the reviews highlight the availability of contactless data transfer (NFC), support for two SIM cards, as well as fairly good sound transmission (due to which the phone can be used as a small player). </p><p>  Of the shortcomings, it should be noted the lack of support for working in the format of LTE networks.  It turns out that your THL will not be able to accept <span>4G Internet,</span> it will have to be limited to slower 3G.  However, as the reviews show, this is not a problem for most users. </p>

    <h2>  Price position </h2><p>  Finally, another nice point about the 5000 is the price.  The smartphone is positioned as the average representative in its segment and costs about 11.5-12.5 thousand rubles.  Given this, we can conclude: in terms of its ratio of cost and capabilities, the phone can clearly be called competitive.  Moreover, it can easily bypass older versions of the flagships Samsung and Apple, which are even more expensive. </p><p>  Therefore, we can say with confidence that the 5000 model is a worthy candidate for purchase if you need a simple but functional smartphone for two SIM cards that can work on one charge for a fairly long time.  Features like stylish design and rich equipment in this case can be considered as a nice bonus. </p>
