    <h2>  Depreciation </h2><p>  Redemption of the value of fixed assets is carried out by transferring it to work, products or the provision of services.  When deducting depreciation amounts from the initial price for the entire period of operation, they receive the residual value.  Today, calculations can be carried out in three ways: </p><ol><li>  Linear.  In this case, the annual depreciation amount is determined based on the initial price and rate calculated taking into account the useful life of the facility. </li><li>  Reduced balance.  In this case, the residual <span>rate</span> at the beginning of the year and the <span>depreciation rate</span> calculated taking into account the useful life of the item are used. </li><li>  Write off by the sum of the numbers of years in accordance with the initial price and annual ratio.  The numerator contains the number of years remaining until the end of the operating period.  The denominator includes the sum of the number of years over the entire service life. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fixed asset transactions" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1214134.jpg" width="570"></div></li></ol><h2>  Object recovery </h2><p>  It can be carried out by simple and expanded reproduction.  The first is a major overhaul and replacement of the OS.  Enhanced reproduction is carried out in the form of new construction, modernization, technical re-equipment, reconstruction.  With simple recovery, the OS does not change its quantitative and qualitative characteristics.  In the case of expanded <span>reproduction, fixed assets are</span> filled with new content.  The cost of reconstruction and modernization may increase the initial price of the OS. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Retirement </h2><p>  It can occur in many ways: </p><ol><li>  Due to depreciation (physical / moral) or termination of use as intended. </li><li>  Upon sale. </li><li>  With a free transfer. </li><li>  Due to liquidation in emergency cases. </li><li>  When transferring to the authorized capital of other enterprises in the form of a contribution. </li></ol><p>  The value of objects that are disposed of or not used continuously should be deducted from the balance sheet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what relates to funds" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1214135.jpg" width="540"></div>

    <h2>  Ratios of fixed assets </h2><p>  To control the movement of the OS, certain indicators are used.  Among them: </p><ol><li>  Update rate.  It represents the value of objects newly introduced by the enterprise during a given period, divided by the price of fixed assets available at its completion. </li><li>  Coefficient of income.  It is calculated as the ratio of the value of received OS to the enterprise to the price of funds at the end of the period. </li><li>  Retirement rate.  It represents the value of funds debited from the enterprise during the year divided by the price of fixed assets available at the beginning of the period. </li><li>  Growth rate.  It is calculated as the amount of fixed assets growth divided by the value of funds by the beginning of the year. </li><li>  The intensity of the update.  He is found by dividing the value of retired fixed assets during the period by the price of funds received. </li><li>  Liquidation ratio.  It is calculated as the ratio of disposed funds during the year to the value of fixed assets at the beginning of the period. </li><li>  Replacement rate.  It is equal to the value of liquidated funds divided by the price of new OSs received. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fixed assets" class="if" height="221" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1214136.jpg" width="340"></div></li></ol><h2>  PBU </h2><p>  In accordance with the Accounting Rules, fixed assets include assets, if they: </p><ol><li>  They are used in the production of goods, the provision of services, performance of work or for managerial purposes. </li><li>  Operated for more than a year. </li><li>  They will be profitable to the enterprise in the future. </li><li>  Will not be implemented soon. </li></ol><p>  Fixed assets - capital for measures to radically improve the land (irrigation, drainage and other land reclamation works), investments in perennial crops are included in the account in the amount of expenses related to the areas taken into operation, regardless of the completion of the whole complex of actions.

At the same time, the initial price of funds increases.  Postings to fixed assets in such cases are as follows: </p><ul><li>  Db sc  01 cd  83; </li><li>  Db sc  83 cd  02. </li></ul><p>  In revaluation, thus, simultaneously with an increase in the initial price, the amount of depreciation charges increases.  According to the results of markdowns, respectively, the cost of the operating system decreases: </p><ul><li>  Db sc  83 cd  01. </li></ul><p>  Depreciation is also reduced: </p><ul><li>  Db sc  02 cd  83. </li></ul><p>  In case of insufficient additional capital to cover the markdowns, the difference in excess of the amount of previous revaluations is subject to write-off at the expense of own income.
