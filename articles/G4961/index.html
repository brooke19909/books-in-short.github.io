Of course, making such a large sum of money is almost impossible for an ordinary office worker or builder.  That is why the mortgage in St. Petersburg is in great demand among citizens. </p><p>  By and large, this program is a loan that is given to people to buy real estate.  Although the debt repayment period may be more than 20 years, the interest rate on the debt is usually almost half the cost of the apartment.  In addition, many organizations providing mortgage services in St. Petersburg require a down payment.  Such amounts are also very difficult to collect in a short time.  That is why, before taking a loan, it is recommended not only to study the real estate market, but also the services of banks. </p>

    <p>  In addition, mortgage lending with a lower interest rate (the amount of which will be much less than the market one) is becoming available to program participants. </p><p>  Funding for this program can be carried out both from the federal and local budgets.  In this case, an interest-free loan can be issued at all, provided that the down payment is 30% of the price of the apartment. </p><h2>  Military lending </h2><p>  In 2005, the government launched the Military Mortgage Program in St. Petersburg and other cities.  According to the innovation, the state provides people serving in the army with living space not in kind, but in money.  This means that a soldier can receive a subsidy in the amount of 1 million rubles and spend it on down payments on a mortgage or purchase low-cost housing for this amount. </p>

    <p>  In addition, the Military Mortgage in St. Petersburg involves the allocation of funds in the amount of 2.5 million rubles to repay loans.  These cases are considered in private.  The average amount of subsidies issued by the state is about 3-4 million rubles.  If a soldier wants to purchase housing at a higher cost, then he pays the rest on his own. </p><p>  However, it is worth considering the fact that this subsidy contains a number of amendments and exceptions.  Accordingly, not every person serving in the army can receive substantial financial assistance. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Almost everyone who has a permanent job can get a mortgage.  It all depends on the conditions of a particular credit institution.  Of course, it is best to apply for a loan at one of the state banks.  Only in this way guarantees will be given to the citizen.  Before buying an apartment for a mortgage, it is recommended to carefully study the real estate market and, if possible, consult with a lawyer.  If you approach the issue wisely, you can significantly reduce the cost of buying an apartment.  In addition, it is worthwhile to carefully study the list of subsidies offered by the state. </p>
