And not every vacationer is eager for the south.  Many more like sweet corners of nature, untouched by civilization, where the wind mysteriously rustles in the crowns of trees, carpets of grass spread under your feet, and forest pichubles chirp carelessly all day.  All this is offered by local <span>recreation centers.</span>  Lukomorye (Voronezh) is one of the best.  It should be noted that with this name in Russia there are several tourist sites.  In this article we will talk about “Lukomorye” near Voronezh. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lukomorye camp site Voronezh" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/981038.jpg" width="572"></div>

    <h2>  Location, how to get there </h2><p>  There is a wonderful land on Earth, where the calm <span>river Usmanka</span> slowly carries its waters to <span>the Voronezh</span> <span>river.</span>  Its shores are decorated with flower meadows covered with emerald green meadows and a majestic virgin forest.  In 2013, a fabulously attractive Lukomorye (Voronezh) appeared here - a camp site whose address is very simple: Voronezh region, Novousmansky district, Novaya Usman settlement, Novousmansky forestry facility, building No. 1. These places are truly unique, which contributes to the development of the tourism business.  “Solnechnaya Polyana”, “Usmanka”, “Egorkiny Gorki”, “Pearl of the Forest” - such recreation facilities exist here.  Lukomorye (Voronezh), located just 20 km from the city center, stands out among all its professional services and well-developed infrastructure.  You can get to the base by regular buses.  They depart from Voronezh and follow to the village of New Usman.  There are about 30 flights in this direction.  Travel time is from 15 to 30 minutes.  But it’s more convenient to get to the base by car.  Driving directions have two directions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  1. On the Moscow M4 highway, move to the turn to New Usman.  Call in the village, pass the center, then follow Lenin street to the intersection with Komsomol 20th anniversary street, on which turn right and go to the final destination. </p><p>  2. On the Tambov R193 highway, move to the village of Babyakovo, followed by a right turn to New Usman.  Further according to the above scheme. </p><h2>  Territory and infrastructure </h2><p>  Chalet Lukomorye (Voronezh) harmoniously blended into the forest.  On sunny glades and in the shade of “sorcerer's oaks”, as an addition to the creation of nature, wooden cottages, a hotel, a <span>summer house were located.</span>  Almost in the center of the base there are swimming pools surrounded by grassy lawn.  A little off is a large football field, and a little to the side - a beautiful square, decorated with flower beds. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lukomorye hostel Novaya Usman Voronezh" class="if" height="358" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/981039.jpg" width="571"></div>  There are several cozy gazebos for relaxing together or with a company.  In another wing of the territory are a restaurant, summer cafes, a guest yard.  The design “Lukomorye” (Novaya Usman, Voronezh) has a very pleasant design for the eyes.  A photo of one of her corners fully confirms this.  On the territory there is a lot of greenery, benches and a wooden swing for adults are installed, a fountain is equipped.  Near the forest is a summer house.  Vacationers in it wake up to sonorous bird trills.  The VIP cottage occupies a central place in the base, not far from the pools, the rest of the houses are lined up along the central alley.  The territory of the base is landscaped with asphalt and tiled paths.  Ample parking is paved.
