    <h2>  General information </h2><p>  The climate in the region of the Bayanaul Mountains is mostly continental.  This is due to the fact that this area is located in the very center of the Asian continent.  The average temperature in the winter period, as a rule, does not exceed the mark of -14 <sup>o</sup> C. In the summer, this territory stably holds +14 degrees.  Sometimes the temperature can rise above +30 <sup></sup> . Sandstorms are typical for <span>Pavlodar region.</span>  However, they do not reach the territory of the Bayanaul district.  In this area, strong winds are unusual. </p><h2>  Local nature </h2><p>  The highest point of Banaul is Mount Akbet.  Its height is more than a thousand meters.  Majestic mountain ranges can be seen already at the entrance to the village.  Mostly coniferous forests grow there.  The local nature can impress any traveler.  The tourist‚Äôs gaze opens with an amazing contrast: all the way he saw around only the steppe expanses, and then suddenly the most beautiful landscapes that Kazakhstan is so famous for appear before him. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Bayanaul, rest: path to the mountains </h2><p>  The road passes through the village and further leads upward.  It continues to the ecological post.  It is a small booth with a barrier.  In order to drive further, you need to pay.  About 350 tenge will be taken from each person.  Stopping at the post does not take much time from travelers.  Directions will be open immediately upon payment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bayanaul recreation area birch" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/468285.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Further road </h2><p>  After the ecological post is left behind, you need to go a little more upstairs.  The climb is not very steep.  During the journey you can admire the massive mountain boulders, which now and then flicker along the sides of the road.  There are also pine trees, which have rather unusual forms.  There are suggestions that this is due to the influence of the sun.  It, in turn, is much closer here than on the plain expanses.  A steep helical descent replaces the climb after about two hundred meters of the path.  He is famous for the whole Bayanaul serpentine.  From here, the traveler offers stunning views.  You can see the holiday homes, which are located on the shores of Lake Dzhasyby.  Small ripples above the water can be seen even from this site.  The lake itself is very clean and transparent.  On the sides of all this beauty are majestic mountains.  Many roads in Bayanaul are well paved.  In general, their quality is up to standard.
