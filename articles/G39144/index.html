    <p>  It should be noted that this settlement is actually the third largest city in the Russian Federation. </p><p>  Not everyone knows that not so long ago, namely in 2008, he celebrated his 285th anniversary. </p><p>  For almost 200 years, the city of Perm has been officially considered the capital of the Urals.  And its name comes from the Finno-Ugric word ‚ÄúPere Maa‚Äù or ‚ÄúParma‚Äù, which means ‚ÄúEarth behind the drag‚Äù or ‚ÄúFaraway Earth‚Äù. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Today, the village is deservedly considered the cultural capital of the Urals and Volga region.

We suggest considering several options. </p><h2>  Main destination - Gorky Park </h2>

    <p>  First of all, we note that this place can be considered the most popular in the city.  Its official opening took place a long time ago, back in 1804.  Throughout its existence, the park bore completely different names.  For example, it was originally called the Garden of the Public Assembly, a little later - Zagorodny Boulevard and the Red Garden. </p><p>  Now few people remember that even from the very beginning of the design of the city, the then governor of Perm proposed to allocate a special place for a birch alley and a canal designed to divert water.  Initially, it was located on the outskirts of the city, but very soon carriages began to pass along the alley and the townspeople strolled, which brought it great popularity. </p><p>  So where to go with the baby?  G. Perm offers a glimpse into <span>the Gorky Park.</span>  In truth, this is the most favorite place for walks for both residents and visitors. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  We proudly state that in order to restore the picturesque nature of the park, Perm residents spent a lot of their own efforts, not really counting on the help of the local administration. </p><p>  In 2013, a prehistoric virtual 3D oceanarium opened in the park.  It is a kind of maze consisting of eight video screens.  Visitors will be able to learn a lot of interesting things and experience impressive emotions while watching films about lyopleurodons, notosaurs, ceresiosaurs, megalodons and so on.  When entering the aquarium, people are given 3D glasses.  Moreover, all sizes are provided for even the smallest visitors. </p><h2>  Meet Live Butterflies </h2>

    <p>  Do not know where to go with children in Perm in the cold season?  Why not give yourself a piece of summer when you meet colorful and delicate insects? </p><p>  A unique and, one might say, unique collection of representatives of tropical flora and fauna in Perm's "Living Butterfly Park" is waiting for its visitors. </p><p>  The exciting world is full of colorful butterflies, tropical plants and bizarre reptiles.  The park is inhabited by individuals from Southeast Asia, Central and South America.  All this is a variety of butterflies, <span>fish, snakes,</span> iguanas, spiders, turtles and many, many other representatives of the fauna. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Thinking about where to go to Perm with an inquisitive pochumuchki?  Well, of course, at this exhibition.  On excursions that take 30-40 minutes each, visitors to the park are accompanied by experienced guides who will tell many interesting facts about the life of the local inhabitants.  The park gives its guests the opportunity to observe the entire life cycle of butterflies: here they come into the world from cocoons, first spread their wings, dry them and finally go on their first flight.  All these actions take place in the insectarium - a special glass flask located in the greenhouse. </p><p>  A special microclimate has been created in the Living Butterfly Park using special climate equipment working around the clock to provide conditions similar to natural conditions for a comfortable life for the inhabitants of the park.  Bright lighting, 80% air humidity and a temperature of about 30 ¬∞ C are supported here. </p><h2>  Who is waiting for us in the amazing Perm Zoo? </h2>

    <p>  A very intriguing place in Perm is a natural monument of all-Russian significance.  This majestic treasury of the middle Urals is called the <span>Kungur ice cave.</span>  This is a large geological monument, whose age is about 10-12 millennia.  Not so long ago, in 2001, an ice cave began to bear the status of a historical natural complex. </p><p>  The length of the underground passages in the cave is 5.7 km, and the largest grotto, the Geographers grotto, has a volume of 50 thousand square meters.  m </p><p>  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Kungur cave is 68 thousand square meters.  m, and today it has about 150 discovered by researchers organ pipes, almost 50 grottoes and 70 underground lakes. </p><p>  The cave has a separate entrance and exit, and equipped hiking trail stretches one and a half kilometers.  It should be noted that the average thickness of the roof over the cave is 65 m. </p><h2>  Joint boat trip <strong> </strong></h2><p>  Outside the window is summer, and you don‚Äôt know where to go with your child?  Perm offers to get a lot of pleasure and have a great time, going for a walk on the boat.  It leaves daily almost every hour, starting at 12:00.  A walk on the water, as a rule, lasts 90 minutes, and the minimum number of passengers for the flight is 15 people. </p><p>  On a modern boat there are two decks: an open upper and a closed lower.  During the walk, musical accompaniment is constantly conducted. </p><p>  Prices for a walk during the daytime, evening hours and holidays are different, and after 18:30, it is worth paying attention, there are no children's tickets at all. </p>
