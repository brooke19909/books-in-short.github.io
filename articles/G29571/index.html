    <p>  The natural increase in the population of Russia (as well as other countries) is formed from the difference between mortality and fertility.  Moreover, the number of births must exceed the number of deaths.  In Europe, this indicator has slight differences from the Russian Federation.  However, in European countries, mechanical population growth, including emigration, is very common.  In this regard, the number of inhabitants in most countries of <span>Western Europe is</span> increasing. </p><p>  Natural population growth can be established according to statistics.  This indicator is influenced by a large number of factors. </p><p>  So, for example, the nature of the socio-economic structure established in society, as well as the living conditions of citizens, affects the birth rate.  However, this relationship is not considered direct.  So, for example, when women begin to participate more actively in production and public life, the birth rate begins to decline, despite the increase in the material condition of the family.  This fact is one of the main reasons for which the number of children in the relatively wealthy families is the same, and sometimes less, than in the <span>less affluent.</span>  At the same time, an increase in income can stimulate an increase in fertility. </p><p>  It is also necessary to take into account the influence on the birth rate of religious and national traditions, as well as the degree to which they are preserved in society.  Equally important is the level of <span>middle age</span> at which they enter into marriage, the degree of strength of the foundations in the family, climatic features, the nature of settlement. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Of course, wars have a negative impact on natural population growth. </p><p>  The mortality rate is mainly associated with the level of well-being of citizens, with the degree of development of the health service and food culture in society. </p><p>  All the above reasons have a significant impact on the natural population growth, introducing large differences in the territorial distribution of people.  For example, <span>large families are</span> widespread in the North Caucasus and in some areas of the Volga region <span>.</span>  In these territories, a large natural population growth is recorded.  Moreover, in the areas of the Non-Chernozem region there is a high proportion of people in old age, which is associated with the outflow of youth.  In the territories of the Far East and Siberia over the past 50 years, the number has been increasing due to the influx of people from European regions.  This, in turn, contributes to an increase in natural growth. </p><p>  The number of citizens was one of the first to note scribe books.  Throughout the centuries-old history of Russia, changes in indicators have been associated mainly with numerous wars, crop failures, and epidemics.  The first census in the country was conducted in 1897.  As a result, it was found that in the Russian Empire, throughout the territory, 124.6 million people lived, of which sixty-seven and a half million - in Russia itself.  Over the years of the existence of the USSR, the number of citizens in the country increased by fifty-six million. </p><p>  According to experts, the number would increase even more if it were not for the impact of <span>demographic crises.</span>  So, during the revolutions, during the famine of 1933-34, repressions, during the Second World War, human losses amounted to tens of millions. </p><p>  In peacetime, the number of citizens born depends directly on the type of reproduction that has developed in the course of history.  The term "reproduction" refers to a change of generations.  Depending on the type, the process can be characterized by a certain level of mortality, birth rate, natural increase and other demographic indicators. </p>
