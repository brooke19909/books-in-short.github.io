After all, there were no problems receiving payment cards before.  What solutions can be expected?  What will help to find out about debt or the presence of unpaid property tax?  The best tips and tricks on this subject will be presented later.  The modern population is offered many ways to obtain information. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to see property tax for individuals" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1457066.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Due date </h2><p>  First you need to figure out what is the deadline for paying property tax on individuals.  Maybe citizens are afraid and panicked in vain because of a mess with payments?  The presence of debts few people are satisfied. </p><p>  The deadline for paying property tax for individuals in 2016 in Russia is until December 1, inclusive.  It is up to this point that the payment made is not a debt.  After that, interest will be charged, as well as problems with the tax authorities.  So you have to ask about the availability and size of property debts.  Actually, getting the indicated information is easier than it seems. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Waiting and new rules </h2><p>  Where to see <span>property tax for individuals?</span>  It has already been said that in 2016, new rules were adopted in Russia.  If you believe the innovations, then all citizens should come with special payments.  Usually they are sent out until November.  But no later than 30 days before the expiration of the debt. </p>

    <p>  So what are the changes?  A part of the population will reflect on the question posed, because receipts will not be received by mail.  The established rules now provide for the virtual distribution of paychecks.  Such documents will come to those who have registered on the portal "State Services".  This is where the information about the debts of the citizen will be stored. </p><p>  Accordingly, at first it‚Äôs worth remembering whether there is an account on the State Service, or just wait a bit.  You won‚Äôt need to calculate anything - all calculations are made by the tax authorities.  Therefore, a citizen will receive a payment with the exact amount of payment. </p><h2>  Debt Verification Methods </h2><p>  And now a little about where using the Internet it is proposed to find information on tax payments.  It is this technology that helps to solve the problem without any problems.  The main advantage of the proposed methods is the ability to instantly pay this or that debt.  Also, services often offer online payment. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>
