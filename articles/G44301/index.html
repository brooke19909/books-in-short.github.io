    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  This model is presented in a classic style.  The body is painted white.  On the front panel there is a hatch door and control buttons.  At the usual place is a box for detergents.  Next to it is a rotary knob, with which you can select a specific washing program.  No display.  The notification of the included modes is carried out by means of LED indicators.  Some owners were dissatisfied with the lack of a display, but during operation it became quite easy to get used to such a control panel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  BEKO WKB 61021 PTMA is a washing machine that has small dimensions.  With standard widths and heights (85 √ó 60 cm), the depth is only 45 cm. Such dimensions make it possible to integrate the appliance into a kitchen set or to place it in a small bathroom. </p><p>  Maximum load - 6 kg.  Great for a family of 4-5 people.  A hatch diameter of 30 cm is enough to load large items.  The drum installed in the device is made of stainless steel.  On its inner surface there are special ribs that help rotate the laundry.  For the tank, the developers chose a high-quality material, which includes polymer alloys.  Thanks to this decision, it turned out to reduce weight, but at the same time increase sound insulation.  The tank turned out to be durable and reliable, which is not at all afraid of the effects of hot water and detergents. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beko wkb 61021 ptma reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2230126.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Performance classes </h2><p>  Almost all buyers make high demands on household appliances according to the efficiency criterion.  In order to be able to save energy, it is necessary to choose equipment of class not lower than A. In this regard, BEKO WKB 61021 PTMA will satisfy the requirements, since it consumes only 0.17 kWh / kg during operation.  This indicator corresponds to class A +.  With this model, owners can also save water.  The consumption of this resource is 49 liters per wash cycle. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As for the main purpose, even at low temperatures, things with severe pollution can be washed perfectly.  And this is not at all surprising, since the efficiency class is A. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine beko wkb 61021 ptma instruction" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2230132.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Spin mode </h2><p>  Describing the characteristics of BEKO WKB 61021 PTMA, you can not keep silent about the spin.  Moreover, the owners are very flattering about this criterion.  Previously had to be limited to a maximum speed of 800 revolutions.  This was not always enough for a high-quality spin, especially if it was about jeans clothes.  In the described model, the manufacturer increased the speed of rotation of the drum to a rebound of 1000 revolutions.  Thanks to this, things get almost dry at the exit. </p><p>  Also in the reviews, the owners say that, if necessary, you can adjust the spin speed.  This is extremely important when washing delicate fabrics that can easily be damaged. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine beko wkb 61021 ptma" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2230125.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Talk about protection </h2><p>  BEKO WKB 61021 PTMA - a device with intelligent control.  In other words, it can be called a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù device.  Manufacturers have implemented several methods of protection.  Using a special sensor, the device independently controls the level of foam.  Also, the washing machine is programmed to monitor the balance of the drum.  If the weight of the laundry is uneven on one side, the appliance attempts to distribute the contents on its own. </p><p>  Also, developers provide protection against leaks.  If necessary, the device can be locked in order to restrict access to children or disabled people. </p><h2>  Features of the BEKO WKB 61021 PTMA washing machine </h2><p>  The instruction that is included in the kit describes in detail all automatic programs.  And therefore, in the article we will talk only about the main ones.  In the arsenal of the washing machine there are only 11 washing modes.  Which of them do users consider the most important?  Of course, those that not only wash away pollution, but also take care of things.  They include the following: </p><ul><li>  for wool; </li><li>  delicate fabrics; </li><li>  children's clothes. </li></ul><p>  Also, importantly, the owners have identified additional features.  It is about economical, fast (express) and prewash, as well as super rinse.  The latter regimen is ideal for people who are allergic.  It can also be used when washing down jackets, blankets.  The advantage of this mode is that rinsing is carried out not with cold, but with warm water, due to which the powder does not remain on things at all. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beko wkb 61021 ptma specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2230159.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The article examined not only the characteristics and capabilities of the washing machine, but also reviews on the BEKO WKB 61021 PTMA.  This device is suitable for those people who do not have the means to purchase more expensive copies.  Of course, they will have to sacrifice some functions, however, in general, the device perfectly copes with basic tasks.  It is worth noting that users rarely describe the disadvantages of this model, considering that all the shortcomings are fully justified by the low cost.  But one shortcoming still needs to be told.  Many owners are not comfortable with the noise level.  They noticed that the intake and discharge of water is very loud.  For those who do not have interior partitions in the house, such a nuance can be a real problem. </p>
