    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  This five-star hotel is located in the Egyptian resort of Marsa Alam, on the Red Sea.  The nearest airport is five kilometers from the hotel.  However, some tourists arrive here through Hurghada's air harbor, which is 210 kilometers away.  So if you do not want to spend a lot of time on the road to the hotel, then if possible choose a flight to Marsa Alam, and not to Hurghada.  In this case, you will save about two hours. </p>

    <h2>  Territory, location </h2><p>  As for the location of this hotel, it should be borne in mind that it is located at a distance from major cities.  Therefore, there is nowhere to go especially outside.  However, this is offset by the large, beautiful and green territory of the hotel complex.  By the way, the territory here is common for Port Ghalib Resort and two more hotels included in the same chain - Siva Port Ghalib and Palace Port Ghalib.  So there is always where to take a walk, have a good time and take beautiful photos to commemorate your vacation in Egypt. </p><h2>  the Internet </h2><p>  As a minus Port Ghalib Resort 5 *, some guests note the lack of Wi-Fi in the rooms.  So, wireless Internet access in the hotel can be used only in the lobby near the reception.  This service is free.  The connection speed here, according to our compatriots, is quite high.  If you want to always be able to be online, then experienced travelers are advised to purchase a SIM card of a local mobile operator with a prepaid Internet package.  It will cost about $ 15.  You can buy a card right at the airport after arrival, or in the city during a walk. </p><h2>  Check in, departure </h2><p>  Many tourists who have been to Egypt more than once know from their own experience that quite often hotel administrators at reception try to delay arrival time as much as possible, hinting that this process can be accelerated for an additional fee (about $ 20).  Moreover, this situation is typical for hotels of various categories, including five-star ones.  As for the ‚ÄúPort Galib Resort‚Äù, our compatriots here were pleasantly surprised by the lack of such an attitude on the part of the staff.  So, according to them, upon arrival they were offered to sit in comfortable chairs in the lobby next to the reception and refresh themselves with a cold drink.  Within 10-15 minutes, the administrator issued the guests an envelope in which there were bracelets, room keys and a memo for guests.  After that, the porter helped bring luggage to the apartment.  So no matter what time of day you would arrive at this hotel, you will not have any need to wait for the checkout time or pay for accelerated settlement. </p><p>  As for the day of departure, the occupied room should be vacated before 12 noon.  At the same time, you can extend your stay in the apartment for an additional fee or hand over the keys, leave your things in the luggage room and continue to relax while waiting for a transfer to the airport.  Indeed, until the last minute of their stay at the Port Galib Resort, guests have the right to use the entire infrastructure of the hotel. </p>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  This item was awarded by our compatriots extremely positive comments.  So, the food in Port Ghalib Resort 5 * (Marsa Alam, Egypt), according to guests, is organized at a very high level.  So, in order to be able to try new dishes every day, it is not even necessary to visit the √† la carte restaurants available at the hotel complex.  After all, the menu of the main restaurant of the hotel is very diverse and includes not only Egyptian, but also other cuisines.  Also, our compatriots can always find here familiar products and dishes.  In a word, nobody will be hungry here: neither children, nor dieting people, nor true gourmets.  The same applies to drinks (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic).  According to travelers, their choice in the Port Ghalib Resort bars is very diverse, and the quality is more than satisfactory. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Most tourists from different countries, as you know, come to Egypt, counting on a magnificent beach holiday on the shores of the picturesque Red Sea.  According to our compatriots, the Hotel Port Ghalib (Marsa Alam) in this regard will not disappoint its guests.  So, the beach of the hotel is very large and well equipped.  It can be used by guests of two neighboring hotels, but there is enough space for everyone here and always.  There are two piers on the beach, from where it is convenient to descend the stairs immediately to the depths.  You can also enter the sea from the shore.  However, in this case it is necessary to have special shoes, as you can injure yourself on corals.  Near the coast is a large and very picturesque coral reef, inhabited by a variety of marine life.  So, tourists note that in addition to a huge variety of fish, they happened to see a small shark, sea turtles, stingrays, moray eels, crabs and other amazing creatures here.  Therefore, when collecting a suitcase for a trip on vacation, do not forget to grab a mask for snorkeling and flippers.  But all swimming accessories can be purchased at the hotel.  One thing is for sure: every hotel guest will be satisfied. </p>
