Its founder in 1953 was an American engineer John Koss.  At first, the company was engaged in television receivers.  However, subsequently, Kossa gradually began to expand its products.  Today, it is one of America's leading specialist audio technology companies. </p><h2>  Hi-tech </h2><p>  Since the late 1960s, Koss Corporation has been actively engaged in the production of stereo headphones and a corresponding headset.  Since then, only the latest acoustic technologies have been used in production.  No wonder the Koss headphones are provided with an unlimited warranty.  This is not to be found in any other company in the world. <br><br>  The main principle that led the corporation to success and guaranteed its bright future is its commitment to the highest quality standards.  Thanks to this, the company's products will always be in demand, whether it is yesterday or tomorrow.  In addition, the company's engineers are constantly modifying the production technology of their <span>speakers.</span>  Therefore, with each new model, Koss headphones are becoming better and better.  This applies to the depth of sound, and the issuance of bass, and the overall design. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="koss headphones" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/693641.jpg" width="543"></div>  John Koss products have been widely used not only in the computer field, but also in medicine, education, mobile communications, and the transportation network.  It is noteworthy that Koss has signed contracts with many airlines in <span>North America.</span>  This fact allows us to largely determine the uniqueness of the brand.  In Russia, devices have become popular thanks to a promotional campaign by the Blade distributor.

    <h2>  Porta Pro Headphone Reviews </h2><p>  The main features of the model are high-quality sound, ease of use and relatively low weight.  Numerous reviews show that for a moderate amount the user receives a top-class device. <br><br>  The Koss Porta headphones are amazingly soundproof.  At maximum volume in a quiet room they are barely audible.  The opposite effect is also on the level.  Even in public transport for full sound, you do not need to give the <span>volume control</span> 100%.  In addition, the strengths of the model, the build quality and breathable foam pads, thanks to which the ears do not sweat, can be distinguished from the advantages of the model. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="headphones koss porta" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/693643.jpg" width="576"></div>  There are not many shortcomings, but, based on criticism, they are.  First of all, it is the rapid wear of ear pads and unpresentable packaging.

Even the bass is reproduced without problems.  At such a low price, the quality of the device is not satisfactory.  It is also worth highlighting the design of the headphones, which is comfortable.  After long wear, the ears do not hurt and do not blush.  Thus, The Plug are Koss headphones, reviews of which demonstrate the best value for money. <br><br>  Of the few disadvantages, a very thin wire can be noted, which is constantly confused.
