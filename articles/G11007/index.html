The fact is that in the past centuries, someone tried to conquer the stretch of land, which is now inhabited by the citizens of Tunisia, and many even succeeded.  So, in ancient times, the ancient city of Carthage, founded by the Phoenicians, flourished on this territory.  Then it was completely destroyed by the Roman conquerors.  Tunisia was long under French rule, until the Arabs took over government.  Long colonization left unique imprints in the cultural life of the country.  And in our time, almost every such "imprint" has become a popular sightseeing object. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="my hotel garden beach 3 tunisia monastir" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44221/2072041.jpg"></div>

The hotel rating based on reviews is quite high, however, tourists also noted negative aspects in the hotel‚Äôs work. </p><p>  In a positive way, tourists spoke about the work of the staff at the hotel.  Maids, waiters, and front desk workers are polite and courteous with guests.  This is very important for resort-type hotels, often the service is lame precisely because of the negligence of certain categories of employees. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel my hotel garden beach 3 tunisia" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44221/2072034.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Customers were also satisfied with how well located the hotel.  The beach is close, the territory is green, well-groomed, clean.  The animation is unobtrusive. </p><p>  But negative reviews were awarded the quality of food, variety at the buffet.  Also, customers were not too flattering about filling the rooms.  As a repair, the age of the hotel gives itself out: plumbing that has seen better times, poor soundproofing, shaky furniture, etc. </p>
