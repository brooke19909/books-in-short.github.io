This, for sure, will be interesting to graduates of medical universities.  And also to those who plan to go there.  There are professions in the world worthy of great respect.  One of these is the profession of a doctor.  It is these specialists who diagnose pathologies, recommend the necessary therapy, and carry out the required rehabilitation of patients.  Special representatives of this profession are surgeons.  They can by force through surgical interventions eliminate serious injuries and diseases.  Currently, surgery is a rapidly developing multifaceted medical field. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nurse.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="average salary of a plastic surgeon" class="if uuid-3164945" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3164945.jpg"></div><h2>  Plastic surgery </h2><p>  The most actively developing plastic surgery today.  It is worth noting that this direction was singled out as an independent region in the distant Renaissance.  It was at that time that plastic surgery began to be considered as a beauty surgery. </p><p>  How much plastic surgeons earn, graduates of medical institutions are interested.  These are highly qualified specialists who are able to correct appearance, eliminate acquired or congenital defects of the body and face, and relieve age-related changes.  The greatest relevance of achieving this area of ​​surgery was received in the period after the First World War.  At that time, soldiers with a crippled appearance began to massively seek surgical help to obtain an attractive appearance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In Russia, this area of ​​medicine began to develop only at the end of the 20th century.  But at present, plastic surgery is a promising medical field.  Young doctors are eager to get into this segment of medicine, since it is generally accepted that the salary of a plastic surgery specialist is very high. </p><h2>  Features of work, professional duties </h2><p>  But how much do plastic surgeons earn on average and what do you need to get the most?  Before you become such a doctor, you have to go a very difficult way.  First of all, you should graduate from a medical higher educational institution and get a specialty in “General Medicine”.  However, the presence of such a diploma does not yet give the university graduate the right to conduct operations. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.falten.wiki" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How much does a plastic surgeon in Russia earn?" class="if uuid-3164938" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3164938.jpg"></div><p>  To get it, the young specialist will have to work a year in the clinic to get practical skills in the specialty of plastic surgery, and then choose the area in which he will have to specialize.  In total, there are two areas of specialization: reconstructive and aesthetic.  How much a plastic surgeon in Russia earns depends on this. </p><p>  Doctors who specialize in the field of aesthetic surgery are engaged in the correction of imperfections that do not pose a threat to health.  They perform plastic surgery on the chest, abdomen, neck, lips, forehead, eyebrows, eyelids and other parts of the human body.  Surgeons practicing reconstructive surgery are engaged in the elimination of acquired and congenital defects in organs and tissues that affect the quality of human life. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Surgeon Responsibilities </h2><p>  Among the main responsibilities of a plastic surgeon are the following: </p><ol><li>  Consultation of patients on issues related to the possibility and consequences of surgical interventions, as well as regarding postoperative recovery. </li><li>  The appointment of a course of treatment, the organization of monitoring the patient’s health during the entire rehabilitation period. </li><li>  Analysis of the results of surgical interventions. </li><li>  Assessment of probable complications and negative consequences. </li></ol><p>  It should be noted that each specialist in the field of plastic surgery specializes in certain types of operations.  This reduces the likelihood of an adverse outcome to a minimum. </p><div class="photo" data-original="burmachannel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="plastic surgeon salary" class="if uuid-3164943" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3164943.jpg"></div><h2>  Plastic surgeon salary formation </h2><p>  Salary is formed from salary and various surcharges.  The value of the base part of wages is determined taking into account the qualification category of the specialist, the complexity, specialization of the surgical interventions that he carries out, the rate at which he works.  In addition, the salary depends on the nature of the medical institution and where it is located. </p><p>  In state-type clinics, any specialist in the field of surgery with the highest qualification category receives an official salary of 13 thousand rubles.  In private clinics specializing in plastic surgery, such specialists can guaranteedly receive a salary of 70-80 thousand rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The salary of a specialist is increased due to the continuity of medical experience.  For example, a specialist who has been practicing for three years will receive a bonus equal to 30% of the official salary.  In addition, every two next years they will bring the doctor an increase of 25% until the salary is doubled. </p><p>  There are also certain surcharges for surgical specialists if they introduce modern medical achievements into the work, perform urgent surgical interventions, and have a lot of workload. </p><h2>  Bonus accrual </h2><p>  For plastic surgeons, some bonuses are also provided: </p><ol><li>  Employment opportunity in combination. </li><li>  Getting preferential medical care (including for family members). </li><li>  The opportunity to undergo professional retraining and training at the expense of the employer. </li></ol><p>  Let's look at how much a plastic surgeon makes in Moscow and other cities of the Russian Federation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lavie-hair-aesthetic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How much does a plastic surgeon earn in Moscow" class="if uuid-3164936" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3164936.jpg"></div><h2>  What is the salary in Moscow and other Russian regions </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the position of a plastic surgeon today is desirable for many doctors.  It is generally accepted that salaries in the field of plastic surgery far exceed the income of dentists - recognized leaders in the field of medicine.  And how much do plastic surgeons earn in St. Petersburg? </p><p>  There are not so many vacant places in this field of medicine.  For example, in Moscow or St. Petersburg, approximately 10-15 vacancies remain open.  Many employers are reluctant to indicate the income level of a plastic surgeon in recruitment advertisements.  As a rule, the column “salary” contains a mark “by agreement”.  But on the job market there are offers in the range of 70-400 thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wandererrecords.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much earns" class="if uuid-3164947" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3164947.jpg"></div><h2>  Price Analysis </h2><p>  An analysis of the price lists of the best plastic clinics in Moscow allows us to conclude that the cost of various operations remains quite high, even if discounts apply to them.  For example, reconstruction of post-traumatic defects will cost about 220 thousand rubles, breast augmentation - about 120 thousand rubles, rhinoplasty - about 100 thousand rubles.  If we take into account that at present the number of patients who want to improve their appearance through surgical intervention is constantly increasing, then, accordingly, the average salary of plastic surgeons who are actively practicing operations can reach 500 thousand rubles or more. </p><p>  Market analysis results show that in other Russian regions the need for plastic surgery specialists is about 15-17 vacancies.  Such specialists are required in clinics of Rostov-on-Don, Tyumen, Novosibirsk, Voronezh, Crimea. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dermacaremedical.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much does a plastic surgeon earn per month" class="if uuid-3164934" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3164934.jpg"></div><p>  The highest paid vacancies in Voronezh clinics are 50-60 thousand rubles.  The smallest salary (from 15 thousand rubles) is offered to plastic surgeons in Rostov-on-Don. </p><p>  That is, the average salary of a plastic surgeon in Russia ranges from 85-100 thousand rubles.  These indicators are pretty much higher than the salaries of specialists in other areas of medicine, as well as the average salaries in the whole country.  But you can immigrate, therefore, you need to know how much a plastic surgeon earns per month in other countries. </p><h2>  Surgeons' salaries in other countries </h2><p>  Plastic surgery has become widespread in South Korea.  In this regard, plastic surgeons are the most paid specialists, and their salaries are the highest in the world - 2.9-3.2 million rubles.  Specialists from America receive about 40-50 thousand dollars a month, which is equivalent to 2.5-3 million rubles.  Plastic surgeons in Germany receive about 0.8-1.2 million rubles. </p><h2>  Retirement benefits </h2><p>  Any plastic surgeon in Russia can retire when his professional experience reaches 25 years.  The average pension of plastic surgeons is 12.5-25 thousand rubles.  It depends on the length of service of a particular specialist, his insurance contributions to the PF. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.idosclinic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How much do plastic surgeons earn in St. Petersburg" class="if uuid-3164939" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3164939.jpg"></div><p>  It should be noted that many highly qualified specialists in the field of plastic surgery practice even after reaching retirement age.
