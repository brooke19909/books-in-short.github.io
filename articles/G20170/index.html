What is "Zubatovism" in history?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the history of the development of the social-democratic movement in Russia, “Zubatovism” played a very important role.  What it is?  How did she appear?  How long did it last?  These are the three main issues that influenced the further development of revolutionary sentiments in the then monarchical state. </p><p>  The very concept of “Zubatovism” is briefly defined as the action of the tsarist regime in relation to the labor issue that arose in <span>Russia at the beginning of the 20th century.</span>  It was aimed at distracting the vast masses of people from the political struggle against monarchical power and transforming this movement into making only economic demands on the government.  Where did “Zubatovism” come from, what is it and what are its premises?  You can learn about this from our article. </p><h2>  Definition </h2><p>  First of all, you need to understand the concept itself.  So, “Zubatovism” is a kind of struggle against tsarism in 1901-1903.  Strange as it may seem, the initiator was the head of the security department of the city of Moscow, S. V. Zubatov, with the support of official authorities. </p><p>  In addition, “Zubatovism” is a provocative attempt by the government of tsarist Russia to distract people from the revolutionary struggle against autocratic politics.  They tried to drag the people into artificially created monarchist workers' organizations. </p><p>  Also, “Zubatovism” is a special form of struggle by which the Russian Empire tried to suppress the ever-increasing influence of the Social Democrats on the working class. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Detection </h2><p>  At the very beginning of the twentieth century, the head of the security department of the city of Moscow was a certain <span>Zubatov Sergey Vasilievich.</span>  It was thanks to him that many of the revolutionary organizations existing at that time were discovered and destroyed.  In 1896, <span>security</span> officers discovered one of the first societies of a social democratic type, called the "Moscow Workers' Union", which was created by combining several political circles. </p>

    <p>  As a result of interrogations of the arrested conspirators, Zubatov first encountered one unusual phenomenon.  The fact is that all detainees could be divided into two groups.  One included revolutionary intellectuals, and the other included ordinary workers.  They all saw what was happening around them in different ways.  So, the intelligentsia realized why they were brought to justice.  But the workers could not figure out what exactly they were accused of.  They did not see the political motive in their actions. </p><h2>  The beginning of the social democratic movement </h2><p>  To understand everything Zubatov helped special literature.  We can say that at this moment he first discovered the existence of a social democratic movement.  He found that, starting in the 1890s, many organizations began to adopt the principles of German conspirators. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The German Social Democrats were able to combine the political components of the revolution with the economic needs of the workers.  Their doctrine consisted in the fact that they can achieve the fulfillment of their requirements only through the social revolution.  They conducted skillful propaganda in the work environment.  The goal of the Social Democrats was to attract as many people as possible into the ranks of the urban proletariat, who would later turn into a powerful revolutionary army. </p><h2>  The idea of ​​Zubatov </h2><p>  After studying the special literature and realizing the danger that the <span>principles of social democracy are</span> fraught <span>with, the</span> head of the security department realized the main thing: nothing can be achieved with repressive measures alone.  Zubatov was sure that this movement would only be exhausted if the main component, the working class, was removed.  And in order to achieve this goal, it was necessary for the current government to go over to the side of the people and support their struggle for <span>economic interests.</span> </p>

Trepov.  It described in some detail a program of measures to improve the situation of workers.

He liked the idea of ​​Zubatov, and he gave permission to conduct explanatory classes for workers. </p><h2>  Essence of the idea </h2><p>  While interrogations of the detainees were carried out, Zubatov tried to prove that the government in itself is not an enemy for them, that even with a monarchical system, one can achieve the satisfaction of all one's economic requirements.  But for this it is necessary to clarify the difference between the revolutionary and labor movements.  If in the first case there are ideological interests, then in the second, money is the goal. </p>

    <p>  Such an explanation of Zubatov was successful.  Convinced by his words, people began to campaign in their midst, and after some time the first petition came for the creation of a workers' society. </p><h2>  Key Points </h2><p>  Thus, the Russian Empire began to struggle with the Social Democratic organizations on its territory by a method that later became known as “Zubatovism”.  It can be summarized in a few paragraphs. </p><p>  ● Replacing revolutionary with evolutionary doctrine.  If the first involves an armed overthrow of power, the second does not accept violence in any of its forms or forms. </p><p>  ● Propaganda of all the advantages of autocracy related to social relations.  The main criterion was that the monarchy itself is prone to justice, all violent actions are alien to it. </p><p>  ● A firm belief that self-activity completely ends where the rights of the authorities come into force, that is, going beyond this line is unacceptable self-will.  All changes in the country should come from the government and exclusively through it. </p><p>  ● Clarification of the difference between revolutionary and professional movements.  The first deals with the violent reform of all classes, and the second only with its vital interests. </p>

    <h2>  Movement development </h2><p>  In the spring of 1901, with the permission of Chief Police Officer Trepov, a group of Moscow activists created the "Society for the mutual assistance of mechanical workers."  Zubatov provided them with special brochures.  They talked about the professional labor movement. </p><p>  In addition, in the same year in Moscow began to hold lectures for the people, which were very popular.  All meetings were held under the supervision of agents Zubatov, who were aware of all the events taking place in the city. </p>

    <p>  At this time, a special Council of workers was created, which received complaints from people, and also defended their interests in cases of any attempts of harassment by manufacturers.  Thus, Trepov and Zubatov supported the Council.  In addition, they also put pressure on manufacturers.  The result of their work was a strike organized at the silk factory, which lasted for a whole month. </p><p>  Such a stunning success of the Society, which defends the interests of workers, began to acquire truly legendary features.  After that, the Zubatov movement made it impossible for any social democratic propaganda to exist in Moscow. </p><h2>  Liquidation </h2><p>  Initially, the activities of the Society were very successful, many workers attended these meetings.  But by 1902, the Social Democrats understood the danger posed by the Zubatov movement.  They rumored that the Society is just a police trap, created for the sole purpose of identifying individuals who are dissatisfied with the monarchical system.  Workers who collaborated with Zubatov received the status of enemies, and “Zubatovism” received the definition of “provocation”. </p><p>  The propaganda of the Social Democrats proved to be very effective, and the new Society was discredited.  Now the professors refused to give lectures at the meetings, as they were warned that if they agreed, they would be nailed to the pillory. </p>

    <p>  In the spring of 1903, mass strikes began in the south of the country, accompanied by political demonstrations.  The influence of the Social Democrats began to rapidly strengthen.  In the summer of the same year, a wave of demonstrations reached Odessa.  The “Zubatovites” took part in the unrest. </p><p>  Against the backdrop of ever-increasing strikes and dissatisfaction of the manufacturers with the interference of the authorities in their relations with the workers, the government decided to abandon its policies.  As a result of this, in the summer of 1903 all Zubatov organizations ceased to exist.  The <span>initiator of this</span> movement was suspended from work and soon sent into exile. </p><p>  So what is “zubatovschina” in history?  <span>This is the policy of the</span> so-called police socialism.  Its main goal was to undermine the working-class political movement by creating legal organizations fighting only to achieve economic preferences.  And, in addition, “Zubatovschina” is just an ostentatious protection of people under the strict control of police and authorities. </p>
