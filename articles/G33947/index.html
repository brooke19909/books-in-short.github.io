It is a city of sun, fun and relaxation.  The climate on this stretch of coast is a mix of continental and highland.  For more than half a year the sun shines here, and from late March to late October you can sunbathe on the beach, but for the right bathing temperature the sea warms up only by mid-May and lasts until mid-autumn.  There is no that sweltering humidity that is observed in other Black Sea resorts, for example, in Tuapse, Lazarevsky, Loo or Sochi.  Every year during the beach season, about 4 million tourists choose Gelendzhik as a vacation spot.  Hotels by the sea or on the slopes of the mountains surrounding the city are always ready to receive and accommodate everyone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gelendzhik hotels by the sea" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1351772.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Rest in Gelendzhik </h2><p>  In this city you will feel a special flavor, which is created due to the sun's heat, bright colors and various vegetation: juniper and pine groves, Lebanese cedars, the oldest and largest of which grows in the courtyard of the summer house of the Russian writer Korolenko.  Here you can also find rare <span>Pitsunda pines,</span> oaks and hornbeams, boxwood and laurel bushes.  The city and its surroundings are shrouded in an incredible, slightly bitter and brackish aroma.  This is noteworthy Gelendzhik.  Hotels by the sea will allow tourists to admire the beautiful scenery of the bay, in which you can see the white sails of yachts gliding along the azure water, and with luck, the ups and downs of dolphins that live off the coast.  They say that the air here is able to heal and gives a lot of positive emotions and good mood.  That is why the <span>inhabitants of Gelendzhik are</span> so kind and hospitable.  They are determined to ensure that all guests of the city are satisfied with their rest and remember for a long time the time spent here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gelendzhik hotels by the sea with pool [" class="if" height="235" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1351768.jpg" width="312"></div>

Fans of lazy relaxation can also come to Gelendzhik.  Hotels by the sea with a swimming pool are an ideal place for those who come here to enjoy plenty of peace and the southern sun.  The city has a dolphinarium, several beautiful water parks, one of which is the largest on the entire Black Sea coast, a wonderful amusement park for both adults and children.  By the way, he is practically in no way inferior to Disneyland.  There is also a cable car that allows you to enjoy the bird's eye view of the surroundings of the city and the safari park.  Wine lovers can go for a tasting in the cellar of the winery and try local wines to the sounds of the violin. </p><h2>  Natural beauty </h2><p>  Picnic lovers can go on excursions to the numerous waterfalls located on <span>the Zhane River</span> and form natural fonts, where you can swim, relax under the murmur of mountain streams and the sound of falling water.  In the suburbs there is <span>Mirror Lake,</span> where you can fish, ride catamarans or boats, sunbathe, comfortably sitting on the trestle beds and sunbeds, in a word, get a real relaxation, and return to Gelendzhik in the evening.  Hotels by the sea in the evenings offer tourists a wonderful view of the quay glistening from the light of lanterns and silver water, illuminated by a bright southern moon and pink lights.  Believe me, the picture is simply amazing and worthy of the brush of a landscape painter. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Where to stay? </h2><p>  <span>Gelendzhik</span> can offer many options for accommodation <span>: hotels by the sea, mini-hotels</span> and guesthouses.  This sea town is located in a rather large bay in the form of a horseshoe.  Buildings - private houses, <span>motels, boarding houses,</span> hotels and hotels - are located in the form of an amphitheater.  Row after row they descend to the water.  Of course, many of the tourists want to relax closer to the beach, and therefore the prices of coastal hotels are much higher than those at the foot of the mountains. </p>

    <h2>  Guest house "Hut of the Cossack‚Äù </h2><p>  The city is rich in guesthouses, but they are mainly located not on the first beach line.  However, the guest house ‚ÄúHut of the Cossack‚Äù (Gelendzhik) is one of the few that are located on the waterfront, right by the water.  It has access to its own sandy beach.  Around the guest house there are many entertainment facilities, as well as a supermarket and pharmacy.  In the immediate vicinity there is a water park "Dolphin" with sea water.  If you absolutely want to stay within walking distance from the beach, then the best place for this is the guest house ‚ÄúHut of the Cossack‚Äù (Gelendzhik, Revolutionary St., 14).  Here is the cafe of the same name, in which guests, as a rule, eat once or several times a day. </p><h2>  Hotel "Alexandria" </h2><p>  This hotel is also a good option for a holiday in Gelendzhik.  It is also located near the water, on the central promenade, at Schmidt Street, 1. Nevertheless, it is quite quiet and calm here.  The hotel also has its own beach, which outsiders can use only for a fee.  Hotel Alexandria offers the following services to tourists: a parking lot, a medium-sized outdoor pool, a sauna with a tiny pool, open 24 hours a day, a summer bar, a buffet where guests are provided with breakfast, a restaurant, etc. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel alexandria" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29489/1351872.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel Magnolia (Gelendzhik) </h2><p>  Another great offer for beach lovers.  This mini-hotel accommodates only 10 comfortable rooms of the standard category and is located at: Primorsky Boulevard, 15. However, they are all very spacious and furnished with modern furniture of beautiful design.  In a word, if you like comfort, as well as magnificent sea landscapes, then choose the Magnolia Hotel.  Gelendzhik, of course, has more comfortable and larger hotels, but this ‚Äúsmall car‚Äù has a special flavor.  There is no swimming pool on the territory of Magnolia, but guests can always use the water area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Cruise Hotel.  The cost of rooms in all of the above hotels starts from 2800 rubles.  This means that they do not belong to the economy class, but you cannot call them expensive either. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel magnolia gelendzhik" class="if" height="317" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1351774.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Other offers </h2><p>  Visit Gelendzhik: budget hotels by the sea are waiting for you.  As you can see, the prices in this resort city are not so sky-high as in Sochi, however, on the waterfront, near the beach, it is very rare to find cheap housing.  Nevertheless, we found a number of hotels, guesthouses and mini-hotels that can offer tourists rooms from 1000 rubles.  Here is some of them: </p>
