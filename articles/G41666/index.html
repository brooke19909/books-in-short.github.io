Should I go there at the end of summer?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A country that allows us to feel the unity of nature and man, where there is no noise, fuss, but there is a developed infrastructure, is Sri Lanka.  In August, the resort is especially beautiful for many reasons.  Firstly, night precipitation can be traced here, which allows you to slightly compensate for the heat of the day.  Secondly, the prices of tours are significantly reduced due to the fact that officially this month is not considered a season.  And thirdly, at this time, decent waves rise on many beaches, which allows you to surf.  Well, now about this and much more in more detail. </p><h2>  Three main reasons to travel in late summer </h2><p>  What is it that Sri Lanka in August attracts so many travelers and why is it worth going there at this time of year?  The first reason is undoubtedly amazing <span>tropical fruits,</span> in particular rambutans.  By the end of summer, they ripen here, become more sweet and tasty than at any other time.  They are littered with all markets and shops, and at the same time prices are very low.  The second is the opportunity to go on a tour of the local jungle.  The air temperature is relatively low, so you can explore the local architectural and natural attractions.  Among them are a Buddhist temple, the ruins of the ancient city of Anuradhapura, an ancient settlement on Mount Sigiriya, as well as many other treasures.  Well, the third reason is water sports.  Many resorts in Sri Lanka open a surfing season in August.  You will be able to take part in this action (if you have experience), or just watch a stunning sight. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sri Lanka in August" class="if" height="265" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/558249.jpg" width="555"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Climatic conditions </h2><p>  Consider what else is so attractive for tourists to Sri Lanka in August.  The weather here during this period is, of course, not for everybody, but every year more and more such fans gather.  There are days when the thermometer column drops below the 27 degree mark.  Such periods are optimal for excursions and inspection of local memorial sites.  On other days, the temperature rises to 32-34 degrees Celsius.  It is clear that such conditions are a typical tropical paradise.  We must have time to buy enough and sunbathe.  The sea temperature throughout the month keeps much more stable, as a rule, within 26-29 degrees.  Therefore, regardless of whether the sun is shining brightly or sometimes hiding behind the clouds, you can swim, enjoy the sea and summer warmth and feel complete harmony with nature. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sri Lanka in August weather" class="if" height="180" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/558248.jpg" width="600"></div>

It doesn‚Äôt matter whether you are an amateur, a professional in this sport, or you have never stood on the board at all.  At each of the resorts of Sri Lanka there are instructors who will teach any person not only to keep on the wave, but also to get real pleasure from what is happening.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Another very interesting entertainment </h2><p>  Surprisingly, despite the winds, a sharp change in humidity and air temperature, Sri Lanka in August is one of the best places for diving.  The ocean in this area has a striking landscape, which is characterized by exquisite underwater flora and fauna.  Immersed in salty waters at various depths, you can meet the most unprecedented and rare marine cloisters.  By the way, the local coral reefs are not just very beautiful.  They also form unique underwater passages, caves, in many of which you can swim and enjoy the amazing tropical nature.  It is definitely worth doing this with an instructor.  In Sri Lanka, nature is just as dangerous as it is beautiful.  Therefore, always be careful, do not swim too far and deep, and always monitor the health of the instruments. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sri lanka vacation in august" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/558246.jpg" width="600"></div>
