In the modern municipality, the ancient antiquity and the high-tech present are wonderfully intertwined and connected together. </p><h2>  Contrasts of Ages </h2>

    <p>  Take at least the remains of the walls of the imperial baths, which literally crowd the pompous facade of the main railway station of the metropolis.  The station was built in the middle of the 20th century, and the baths functioned during the reign of Diocletian. </p><p>  Behind the Coliseum, which fascinates with its grandeur and silence, motorcycles and cars sweep with a roar and whistle.  And in the place where the stadium was located in ancient times, today city boys are playing with a din and screaming, chasing a soccer ball. </p><p>  That is why Rome is called the eternal city according to history and philosophy.  After all, there are more than enough such contrasts here.  The old capital continues to live, but already in the guise of a vibrant metropolis.  This does not bother him today, but, on the contrary, brings a bit of authentic flavor to his life. </p><h2>  Dawn hours </h2>

    <p>  The Italian morning wakes up to the measured chime of church bells, which is heard from everywhere.  There are hundreds of cathedrals in Rome.  Half an hour later, they are joined by lonely cars and single passers-by, hurrying about their business.  The eternal city of Rome and its inhabitants wake up today to the cacophony of car horns, the noise of unfamiliar dialects and the spicy aroma of coffee. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first pedestrians on the pavements were janitors and cleaners.

    <p>  They say that time erases everything, but here it is forgotten.  And this is one of the reasons why Rome was called in ancient times the eternal city.  On its streets and squares are captured all the eras that are forever inscribed in the historical annals.  Antique ruins in it alternate with luxurious palazzos erected during the Renaissance.  The elaborate baroque palaces and ensembles replace bulky buildings built at the very beginning of the 20th century. </p><p>  So, for example, the monument to Emanuel II, erected on the central square by our contemporaries, is adjacent to the architectural composition of the Capitol. </p><p>  Trying to match the master Michelangelo, Italian architects not only did not surpass the legend, but on the contrary, once again emphasized his genius.  The monument to the ruler who united the country came out too bulky and massive.  Against its background, the palace buildings of Capitol Hill look elegant and miniature. </p><p>  The special visual effect of the scale of the ensemble of Michelangelo was achieved not due to the physical dimensions of his brainchild, but thanks to a well-thought-out layout.  If you look at the composition from a bird's eye view, it will become obvious that all the elements form a trapezium, the basis of which is the Senator Complex.  Isn't it amazing?  That is why Rome is called the eternal city! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Realities and contradictions </h2>

    <p>  Located in the center of Capitol Square, a monument to Marcus Aurelius attracts enthusiastic looks.  Due to the special terrain, it is located on a hill, which is complemented by a platform.  Nearby extends and the current municipality, under the windows of which protesters gather against unfair housing policies.  Many of them pitch tents and spend weeks on stone pavements.  Is the question of why Rome, the eternal city, still open? </p><p>  To properly see the Roman Forum, you should go around the Senatorial complex.  At one time, he played the role of the main square, on which the citizens of Ancient Rome crowded.  Political speeches were held at it, long-time acquaintances met, brisk trade was conducted.  To this day, residents of the modern municipality have a genuine pride in looking at the basilica and temples surrounding the Forum, arches and statues. </p><h2>  At the source </h2><p>  The quarters, extending down from Capitol Hill, represent a vast territory on which to this day one can feel the breath of ancient eras.  It is full of ruins of columns, generously decorated with intricate plaster ligature and balusters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The outlines of the porticoes and thick walls are immediately visible.  Many of them in the eternal city of Rome are almost destroyed, but there are those that still have not lost their original appearance.  It is a triumphal arch, the construction date of which dates back to the III century BC.  It was erected in honor of the numerous victorious campaigns of <span>Septimius Severus.</span> </p><h2>  Hills and hills </h2>

    <p>  The colonnade of the Troyan forum also looks relatively good.  It symbolizes the unconditional victory of the Romans over the rebellious Dacians.  Its height reaches forty meters.  It consists of eighteen blocks, each of which is made of snow-white marble.  All together they are united by a massive stone belt decorated with frescoes.  These paintings illustrate the life of people of those times.  The urn with the ashes of Troyan is stored at the foot of the colonnade; it is decorated with a statue of the Apostle Peter. </p><p>  Palatine Hill is another attraction of Rome.  On its elevation are the ruins of therms and palace complexes, which once belonged to the reigning persons.  The best painters and masters of mosaic were invited to decorate their interior.  Some of the ruins that are in this part of the metropolis have yet to be studied by historians and archaeologists.  That is why Rome is an eternal city and will remain so forever. </p><h2>  Rome in figures and facts </h2>

    <p>  The fifties of the VIII century BC are considered the founding date of the ancient settlement.  The first buildings appeared on the left bank of the full <span>river Tiber.</span>  Despite its status, this settlement cannot be considered the oldest in the world.  In fact, the eternal city of Rome is a youth, when compared with the municipalities that emerged in the Middle East. </p><p>  The birthday of the metropolis is <span>April 21.</span>  On this date are the most magnificent festivities.  The authorities arrange gladiatorial battles, hold stylized processions and parades.  A colorful salute completes the celebration. </p><p>  The eternal city of Rome is unique not only due to ancient architecture.  He is the only metropolis on Earth in whose territory an independent state is located.  The Vatican is a typical monarchy, which has all the necessary regalia: flag, coat of arms, anthem.  There is a regular army, an academy, a radio station and a television tower.  It operates its own railway line. </p><p>  The Vatican has the largest church in the world.  This is the basilica of St. Peter.  Its height is approximately 140 meters, and its capacity is 60 thousand believers.  Carlo Maderno, Michelangelo and Raphael had a hand in her erection. </p><h2>  Revived story </h2>

    <p>  The true name of the Coliseum is the Flavian Amphitheater.  The current name, adopted in Rome, the eternal city, he owes his colossal character.  After all, the word "coliseum" in translation from Latin means "giant".  The height of the walls of the structure reaches 50 meters, and the total length is 524. The ingenious layout of the building allows you to simultaneously accommodate up to fifty thousand visitors who can leave its walls in just five minutes. </p><p>  Currently, tourists and residents can visit the Colosseum by buying a ticket at the box office of the museum.  In the old days, admission was free.  The first musician who was allowed to perform in the ancient arena was the former Beatles soloist.  Four hundred counter-frames were sold at his concert. </p><p>  In mid-December, the eternal city of Rome and its inhabitants were immersed in a festival dedicated to the god of fertility.  This was one of the most important events in the life of the townspeople.  Saturnalia took several days and was famous for the fact that slaves received albeit short, but long-awaited rest.  In addition, they were allowed to the master table.  And they also had the opportunity to shamelessly criticize their owners. </p><h2>  Non-tourist Rome </h2>

    <p>  To the ignorant tourist, the eternal city of Rome is able to present a whole series of surprises that can be at least unpleasant.  Luring travelers with impeccable decor and the splendor of the ancient era, he leads the entangled guests to the modern Pakistani outskirts. </p><p>  Like any major municipality, the metropolis consists of two parts.  One is his advertising cover.  This is Rome, walks in the eternal city, which are usually described on the pages of booklets.  Its philistine side is by no means so attractive.  Only a few kilometers are required by the polished streets in order to turn into dirty and forgotten favelas by God. </p><p>  Variegated souvenir shops seem to be replaced with shabby fruit stalls and grocery stores as if by magic.  Behind the carved turrets of the basilica, he hides painted graffiti bridges, broken sidewalks, gypsy areas and local madmen.  And let the romantics call Rome the eternal city, yet it is a very poor European metropolis. </p><p>  In fairness, it is worth noting that the local carabinieri know their work.  It takes them only a few minutes to eliminate the next alien from the "dark" side of the non-tourist outskirts. </p>
