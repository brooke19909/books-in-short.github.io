Aztec core activities</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The occupations of the Aztecs, a civilization that left many mysteries and secrets, were very diverse.  There is a lot of evidence of the existence of this people, which has come down to us through jewelry and weapons, pottery and weaving.  What did the Aztecs do, what was most important to them?  Let's try to find the answers in this article. </p><h2>  Aztecs: a brief historical background </h2><p>  Among the most <span>ancient civilizations of the</span> American continent there are three: Incas, Mayans and Aztecs.  Many of the knowledge about which Mayan, Aztec and Inca occupations were the most popular, unfortunately lost.  But still there are many archaeological finds that help solve some of the mysteries of the ancient inhabitants of planet Earth. </p>

    <p>  Civilization totaled about 60 thousand people, and this people, without false modesty, could be proud of themselves.  The Aztecs needed only 2 centuries to turn from an ordinary tribe of nomads into formidable warriors who ruled the territory of the Valley of Mexico City. </p><p>  Hence, historians conclude that the most important occupation of this people was military craft.  In addition, it is known that this people was highly educated.  Studied and practiced: medicine, astronomy, music, the history of laws and religion.  The art of housekeeping and various crafts were at a high level.  Consider all these Aztec classes in order. </p><h2>  Military craft </h2><p>  These people loved to fight.  The military craft was very well developed, so it is not surprising that the Aztecs were famous as conquerors of new lands.  During the existence of this civilization, the territory of the nationality has been greatly expanded due to constant wars and the conquest of new territories. </p>

Accordingly, the conquered tribes automatically turned into slaves.  This served as a result of the fact that among the Aztecs many wealthy slave owners appeared, whom the thirst for profit forced to conquer new lands.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Household </h2><p>  Aztec classes concerned various spheres of life.  The basis of the economy was agriculture. </p><p>  Archaeologists discovered the <span>tools of the ancient</span> farmers: sticks with pointed and extended ends.  The second option is the prototype of a modern shovel. </p><p>  It is known that these people knew how to irrigate and fertilize the soil.  Among various crops, preference was given to corn, pumpkin, beans, pepper and zucchini.  The Aztecs went down in history as the people who first began to cultivate cocoa beans and tomatoes.  They cultivated tobacco. </p><p>  Also, the main occupations of the Aztecs included the cultivation of several types of cotton. </p><p>  Among the features of their agriculture, the presence of floating gardens should be noted.  All due to the fact that the city of Tenochtitlan itself was on the island.  A limited amount of land led to the emergence of vegetable gardens afloat.  These gardens were built on rafts attached to piles driven into the ground with fertile land. </p><h2>  Hunting and fishing </h2><p>  Occupations of the Aztec population included hunting and fishing.  This people did not have a tradition of keeping pets.  The only <span>domesticated animals</span> were dogs, sometimes they were eaten. </p>

    <p>  Stocks of meat replenished during the hunt.  Hunters obtained food with the help of a bow and arrows, throwing darts were widely used, and special traps on animals were also in use. </p><p>  Hunter prey could be: rabbits, deer and wild birds. </p><p>  The peoples living on the shores of the lakes were successfully engaged in fishing. </p><h2>  Culture </h2><p>  The culture of this people was at the highest level.  It should be noted that for the male population, schooling was a compulsory occupation.  There were two types of schools: for rich and poor.  Schools of the first kind trained future priests, military leaders and dignitaries.  Boys from simple families learned to be farmers, warriors and artisans. </p><p>  Science, literature, philosophy and astronomy are the main occupations of the inhabitants.  Aztec <strong> </strong>  revered as a highly developed civilization. </p><p>  These people developed a star map of the sky.  The Aztec calendar is widely known, which, taking into account the location and movement of celestial stars, served to satisfy the needs of agriculture. </p>

    <p>  Unfortunately, during the conquest of this territory by the Spaniards, many samples of culture and art were destroyed.  Yet archaeologists have recently discovered buildings that give us the opportunity to gain knowledge about how developed the Aztecs were in the field of architecture. </p><p>  One of the attractions is the temple in Malinalco, which was completely carved from a holistic rock.  Archaeologists say that in addition to the stone tools of labor, this people did not have others.  Imagine how much effort it took to build this temple. </p><p>  The main Temple of Temple Major was discovered by archaeologists altogether by accident.  This happened in the 80s of the last century during an earthquake.  This find made it possible to see figures of gods carved from stone, as well as ceramic and jewelry.  It should be noted that the Aztecs practiced human sacrifices to their gods.  The handles of the sacrificial knives were decorated with a mosaic pattern of turquoise and fragments of shells. </p><p>  Thanks to these findings, we can accurately determine how the Aztecs lived, whose occupations were distinguished by their diversity and a highly developed culture. </p><h2>  End of story </h2><p>  This civilization has not been completely solved.  All due to the fact that the cultural heritage of the Aztecs was partially destroyed during the conquests.  Having reached cultural heights, the Aztec people could not survive and preserve for history most of their achievements.  On the ruins of the Aztec capital, a new city grew - Mexico City, which went down in history as the center of the colonial possessions of new conquerors from Europe. </p>
