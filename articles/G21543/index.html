To see the sights of Kotor is best from the historical center of the so-called Old Town, surrounded by ancient walls, cliffs and moats. </p><h2>  Montenegro - the pearl of the Mediterranean </h2><p>  Montenegro is a small but very beautiful state in the southern part of the <span>Adriatic Sea.</span>  This country is rightly called the pearl of the Mediterranean, thanks to its exquisite natural beauty, glorious beaches, crystal lakes and magnificent mountains.  This is a land of contrasts where you can relax and swim in the blue sea or go skiing from the slopes of the magnificent Durmitor Mountain. </p>

    <p>  The rich historical, architectural and cultural heritage, a huge variety of landscapes and attractions make this country a very attractive place for travel and an unforgettable vacation.  The coast of Montenegro offers a lot of interesting routes.  72 km of sandy beaches along which are well-preserved ancient cities.  This is one of the most beautiful countries, once visited which I want to return here again.  Cities of Montenegro will not leave indifferent even the most sophisticated tourists. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Medieval bastions </h2><p>  The city of Kotor today is one of the best-preserved medieval settlements on the Mediterranean coast.  The largest and most impressive are the bastions surrounding the city.  They are about 5 km long and 10 m wide.  Some of them have been fully preserved and can rightfully be called unique examples of fortress architecture in Europe. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The construction began in the 9th century.  The bastions have 3 doors through which for many centuries people entered and exited the city.

    <h2>  Perast - one of the most beautiful and strange places in the bay of Kotor </h2><p>  Perast is considered the quietest city in Kotor.  Its narrow streets and numerous, but mostly abandoned, palaces testify to the former wealth of its inhabitants, who once led a luxurious life here.  Perast used to be a city of sailors and was known even outside Montenegro.  There are 16 preserved palaces that represent 12 fraternities (clans). </p>

    <p>  Previously, here you could see ladies walking in the streets, wealthy sailors, girls in love, hundreds of <span>sailing boats</span> huddled in the bays <span>.</span>  Perast is currently a semi-abandoned place with a population of about 360 citizens.  However, this does not mean that it is completely boring here, in the summer various holidays are held, among them the traditional Fasinada - a ritual procession of barges.  Due to the lack of a beach area, the coast of Perast is not suitable for beach tourism. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Virgin Island on the reef </h2><p>  The Island of the Virgin is considered one of the two beautiful islands in the Bay of Kotor.  It is also called the island of the dead captains.  According to legend, one French soldier, shooting from a cannon in the direction of Perast, got into the house of his beloved and killed her.  This story served as the motive for the creation of the masterpiece ‚ÄúIsland of the Dead‚Äù by a Swiss master named Becklin. </p>

    <p>  If you believe the stories, the island was built artificially by one sailor from Perast (Old Kotor).  Some time later, according to legend, one fisherman after a shipwreck near the island found an icon of the Holy Virgin with Christ, the survivors vowed to build a church.  And they kept their promise: the temple was erected in 1630.  To save the island, it was necessary to bring and stack stones; this tradition is still alive.  The holiday dedicated to her was called Fasinada, it is held every year in the evening of July 22. </p>

    <h2>  Maritime Museum </h2><p>  Describing the sights of Kotor, it is impossible not to mention the Maritime Museum, which is located on the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Boka Kotor Fleet.  Marine business in this city began to develop in the Middle Ages, there was a real brotherhood of sailors.  Memories of those bygone days and years, of the successes of the famous Kotor sailors, artists, shipbuilders, artisans, government officials and diplomats, mediators between the West and the East are today stored in the Maritime Museum. </p><p>  Here you can see portraits of famous captains, models of old galleys and sailing boats, navigation instruments, maps, prints, watercolors depicting coastal cities and other valuable exhibits.  The museum has six bronze reliefs that reflect the most important events and personalities from the turbulent history of Kotor.  There is also an ethnographic collection testifying to the golden age of Kotor, which lasted throughout the XVI - XVIII centuries.  Near the entrance to the medieval palace, where the maritime museum is located, two small cannons are exhibited, they are a symbol of the confrontation between local sailors and pirates. </p>
