    <p>  This hotel complex was built in 1998 in the first line of the Makadi Bay Bay of Hurghada.  From the airport to it is only twenty-five kilometers.  The advantage of this hotel is to ensure a good rest from the city rush and crowds.  The local animation is unobtrusive.  This is a solid family-run hotel complex that offers a comfortable economy class vacation.  It is quite large, with 480 rooms.  The main highlight of the hotel is one of the best beaches in Hurghada. </p><h2>  Low prices with excellent service </h2><p>  It is nice to realize that a wonderful vacation in Egypt is possible at very attractive prices.  Especially in winter.  We provide relevant information.  In January 2016, for those who wish to relax, significant discounts in the region of 43% for the purchase of tours at Royal Azur Resort 5 * apply.  The price of a room for 6 nights (respectively, 7 days) in January 2016 is actually $ 483 against $ 826 of the average annual cost. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Such a significant discount is due to the climatic features of this month in Egypt.  January and February are considered the coldest months, but not for residents of the middle zone!  Judge for yourself: a 5-hour flight, and the Red Sea with a water temperature of 21 degrees Celsius is at the service of tourists. </p><p>  At this time, in Egypt, the hamsin wind (translated into Russian - ‚Äúfifty‚Äù) blows from the desert, making it difficult for tourists to relax.  Every year he carries with him the air of the Sahara for exactly fifty days.  Vacationers in Egypt in the winter because of this are practically unable to travel long distances.  The hot sandy wind, often turning into storms, turns motor transport trips into hell.  The finest sand penetrates not only the interior of the car, but also (inexplicably) through the double-glazed windows.  So, the January or February desire of a tourist to examine the pyramids of Giza or the burial place of Luxor becomes practically irrelevant. </p><p>  However, the resort where the <span>Royal Azur Resort 5 *</span> hotel is located <span>,</span> Hurghada (Makadi), is protected from the wind by the mountains.  This is the best place in Egypt in January - February, and also very worthy at other times of the year.  If vacationers are going to enjoy a sea holiday and get acquainted with the unique underwater world of the Red Sea, then the choice of hotel will not disappoint them. </p><h2>  Makadi Bay Village </h2><p>  The village itself is purely resort, it is composed exclusively of hotel infrastructures.  Formally, it belongs to Hurghada, but in fact it has its own resort system. </p><p>  Here (Egypt, Makadi) there are no Egyptian apartment buildings nearby.  In addition to tourists - only the staff of hotel complexes.  The largest of these associations is called Madinat Makadi.  It consists of chain hotels: French Iberotel, Italian Sol Y Mar and German Jaz. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

Comments made by vacationers on duty at the reception are eliminated almost immediately.  Here, at the reception, you can rent a car, sign up for an interesting tour.  Among the employees of the hotel complex Azur Royal Resort there are Russian-speaking. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In the neighborhood there are such compact comfortable landscaped areas of the Stela and Club Azur hotels.  But their beaches are inferior to Royal Resort in terms of convenience. </p><h2>  Hotel buildings </h2><p>  At the Azur Royal Resort hotel complex there are three two- / three-story residential buildings.  They are located in such a way that they resemble the letter U, turned by the open part to the sea lagoon.  For new arrivals, it is preferable to choose a newer building with the numbers "2 + 1" (it is most remote from the sea).  In two other buildings, located closer to the beach, smaller rooms: double and single. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="royal azur resort 5 hurghada makadi bay" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1061451.jpg" width="550"></div>

Also, you do not need to pay for sun loungers, mattresses, sun umbrellas. </p><p>  Particularly noteworthy is the artificial equipment in the water area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe lagoon beach: after the tide, the water is left ankle-deep (as usual in the Red Sea), on the contrary, the depth is quite decent and suitable for swimming. </p><p>  Royal Azur Resort (Makadi Bay) has a diving and windsurfing school, where qualified trainers teach inexperienced tourists the art of diving into the vibrant underwater world of the Red Sea.  Beginners for $ 120 can take several lessons to acquire the necessary skills. </p><p>  The coral world of the unique sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãEgypt is unusually rich and bright.  It has more than a thousand species of fish and one and a half hundred species of coral.  To see a variety of colored fish (angel, parrot, butterfly, zebrosome), it is not necessary to even plunge into the water.  They can be observed from the pier.  However, acquaintance with the underwater world cannot be familiar: for vacationers, there are few but clear prohibitions, which are patiently reminded by the staff serving the beach.  In particular, it is strictly forbidden to swim at night, as well as touch the underwater inhabitants - among them there are also very dangerous ones (moray eels, <span>electric stingrays,</span> sea ‚Äã‚Äãurchins, <span>lionfish, stone fish.)</span> </p><h2>  Pools </h2><p>  On the territory of the described hotel there are cozy recreation areas, three swimming pools are equipped here.  They are beautifully cascaded.  In one of them, the water is heated.  Another is filled with sea water.  There is a wonderful relaxation area equipped with sun loungers and umbrellas.  It is decorated with neat and amazingly trimmed topiary plants. </p><p>  From twelve o'clock in the afternoon in the pool area there is a buffet where you can eat fresh pastries, sweets, sandwiches, ice cream on comfortable tables under umbrellas.  The assortment includes low alcohol and non-alcoholic drinks. </p><p>  Among vacationers there is always a certain group that prefers the pool area to the rest on the sea.  These are fans of physical education classes (trainers-animators work with them).  For them, the in-house championships in volleyball, basketball, water polo are organically replaced by rest in the lounge area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe pools. </p><p>  Also prefer a zone of pools, sheltered from direct sunlight by umbrellas, lovers of passive relaxation (communication, board games, reading and periodic light snacks with low-school drinks). </p><h2>  Trips to Hurghada </h2><p>  In order to diversify the vacation, vacationers of the resort (Egypt, Makadi) periodically visit the 90-thousandth Hurghada, which is the center of the Red Sea province. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="royal azur resort makadi bay" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1061448.jpg" width="337"></div>  Its main attractions are located in the old part of the city, which is called Dahar.  Among the most interesting places are the <span>Coptic church, the</span> mosque of Abdulhasan Elshazi, the eastern market.  Here, closer to the port, is located the entertainment center "New Marina".
