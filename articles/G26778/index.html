    <p>  Surprisingly for four <span>stars, the</span> Beldiano <span>Hotel</span> (Kemer) demonstrates a regular and high-quality children's animation program.  Parents are satisfied, because they have the opportunity to rest and relax when children aged 4-12 are under the supervision of animators of the mini-club.  There is a playground for them.  Adult business people, while relaxing, can participate online in business events with office equipment from the hotel conference room. </p><p>  Hotel "Beldiano" (Kemer) offers vacationers excursions for every taste.  From the proposed ‚Äúexcursion menu‚Äù we recommend that you definitely choose a one-day automobile Demre-Mira-Kekova.  Bring a camera and bathing accessories with you.  You will see famous sights and even shrines, ride a yacht, and in the evening you will be in your room.  The modern city of Demre is located approximately where in ancient times the walls of the city of Peace rose.  The excursion program includes the church of <span>St. Nicholas the</span> Ugodnik.  Once there was the country of Lycia, and it was in this church that the bishop of the World personally sent services, now revered by the Orthodox Church, Saint Nicholas.  The Church of Nikolai Ugodnik was reconstructed in the 19th century at the initiative of the Russian Tsar.  Kekova Bay will surprise you with an idyllic sea, which you may never have seen. </p><p>  In the neighboring village of Kirish, you can watch in the evening a curious natural phenomenon: <span>Mount Takhtaly,</span> illuminated from the inside by underground flashes. </p><p>  The conclusion is that the Hotel Beldiano (Kemer) guarantees a quality economy-class guesthouse.  In addition, it is suitable for families with children. </p>
