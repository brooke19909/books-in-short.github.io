Often without even wondering how much they are needed.  Many people were faced with a situation where money left their accounts.  Then they long and hard figured out why.  Having been in such a situation, I really want to know how to disable all Beeline services. </p>

But for some reason, mobile operators often forget about this.  Beeline connects all services in test mode for free, which notifies the SMS subscriber.

      <p></p>
    <p>  Services are connected for a certain period of time, usually for two weeks or a month, then the client is offered to disconnect them by typing a specific code.  This is also notified to the subscriber in the first SMS.  No more notifications.  Naturally, during this period in the bustle, a person simply forgets that you need to disable test services.  And he learns that he has some services after the money is withdrawn from the account.  He is very surprised at this, begins to contact the operator, to find out how it happened.  But Beeline politely but firmly announces: "You are to blame, you were warned, they told you, but you are so inattentive, there's nothing to be done."  They will be dejected for the sake of <span>view, they</span> turn off the <span>services</span> , but they still will not return the money.  This is the whole trick.  Not surprisingly, after this, a person begins to think about how to disable all Beeline services.  And no longer use any services. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

Through this number you get to your personal account.  And if you go to the Beeline website, you can also manage the connected services from there.  This method is good for people versed in the Internet and various phone applications, in a word, technically advanced.  Then you can actively control the appearance and deactivation of various services.  In this case, there is no need to think about how to disable all Beeline services. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  There remains another part of the subscribers who are not technically advanced, what should they do?  You can call the service center at 0611 and request that they disconnect all connected services.  Before the employee of the center does this, it will be necessary to prove that the real owner of the SIM card is calling.  To do this, several questions are asked, the answers to which only the owner of the registered number knows.  After that, the employee will fulfill the request.  By the way, there is one pleasant moment in this method: in the meantime, you can say everything you think about Beeline and the services offered.  Telephone calls in the centers are recorded. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="connected Beeline services" class="if" height="373" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11516/49610.jpg" width="500"></div>  So the opinion with a high degree of probability will reach the head.  They also turn off services by dialing * 111 # and going to the first menu item.  But here you cannot be 100% sure that you yourself will do everything right.

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  There is another answer to the question of how to disable all Beeline services - contact the nearest service center.  And there, in direct contact with a consultant, resolve all issues.  At the same time, you can put a ban on connecting services without personal consent for the future.  They are obliged to do this, if they refuse, they can threaten a claim to Rospotrebnadzor.  Such a horror story works flawlessly. </p>
