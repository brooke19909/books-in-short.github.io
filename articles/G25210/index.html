The famous Orthodox church is located in the central point of the city.  The date of its foundation is 1684.  It was at this time that Prince Repin decided to build a church on the territory of his own estate.  Later, the temple, as well as the territory of the estate, passed into the possession of the Yusupov clan.  To this day, tombs of nobles from this family name have been preserved here.
