Julius Mikhailov is the pseudonym under which he worked.  A boy was born in Moscow on February 23 in 1936, three years before the outbreak of war.  Julia's father was Korean Kim Chersan, a translator by profession, and her mother was a Russian girl Nina Vsesvyatskaya.  The childhood of the child was not easy, because only two years after the birth of his son, the head of the family was shot and his mother sent to exile.  Little is known about how Julius lived all these years.  In addition to him, there was a sister in the family, and both of them, after the arrest of their mother, were sent to their grandparents in the Kaluga region.  Then he spent several years with aunts in Turkmenistan, until 1945, when his mother returned from exile.  But Julius was able to return to Moscow only in 1954.

He learned to play the guitar and began to create wonderful musical compositions.  All the while Julius worked as a teacher, he directed with his students many different scenes with musical accompaniment, which can be safely considered as musicals.

This is what caused the appearance of the pseudonym.  At the same age, Julia's life changed, he got married.  Julia's wife was Irina Yakir, the daughter of the famous human rights activist Peter Yakir, whose fate was similar to that of the poet‚Äôs parents.  Peter was arrested when he was only fourteen years old, and he was released into the wild as an adult man at thirty-two years old. </p><p>  In the 60s, Julius, along with his father-in-law, participated in many actions and movements in defense of rights, as a result of which Julius lost the opportunity to teach.  The school administration did not forgive him for participating in such actions.  Since then, Julius lives and works as a free poet and composer. </p><h2>  Creation </h2>

In the early 60s, he began to give concerts in the Moscow region and he was immediately ranked among the talents of Russia.  In 1968, his work began in the theater and cinema.  He began to compose songs for films and plays.

    <p>  Since Kim was a dissident, he was known under the pseudonym in film and theater.  At that time, the name of Julius Mikhailov could often be seen in the credits of films.  The stage performances of his songs during his teaching career were excellent.  And in the heyday of his work, his talent simply conquered people.  His songs were sung by millions of people, and this was a tacit confirmation of success. </p><p>  Working in the field of theater and cinema, Kim became less involved in human rights affairs.  He went deeper into creativity.  The turning point was the time when he began to write his own plays.  The work Noah and His Sons was released in 1985, and Julius played a major role in it.  It was during this period of his life that Kim stopped using his pseudonym, and also released a CD with songs under his real name.  Later there was a record with his works.  Until now, this talented person continues to write wonderful scripts.  He lives not only in Moscow.  He often travels to Jerusalem and spends a lot of time there. </p><h2>  Cinema </h2><p>  Julius Mikhailov, whose biography is considered here, made a huge contribution to the creation of many films.  After all, it was his songs that sounded in such famous films as: </p><ul><li>  Bumbarash </li><li>  "Secret City"; </li><li>  "12 chairs"; </li><li>  "About Little Red Riding Hood"; </li><li>  "Mustached Nanny"; </li><li>  ‚ÄúAn ordinary miracle‚Äù; </li><li>  "Matching the hussar"; </li><li>  "Dulsineya Tobos"; </li><li>  "The house that Swift built"; </li><li>  "Peppy Longstocking"; </li><li>  "Love Formula"; </li><li>  "After the rain on Thursday"; </li><li>  ‚ÄúA man from the Capuchin Boulevard‚Äù; </li><li>  "Dog's heart"; </li><li>  "Kill the dragon" and many others. </li></ul><p>  The list of films in which the songs of the composer and poet Julius Kim sounded, includes fifty titles.  And in the films ‚ÄúAfter the rain on Thursday‚Äù and ‚ÄúOne, two - grief does not matter!‚Äù  he was not only a songwriter, but also wrote scripts for films. </p><h2>  Achievements </h2>
