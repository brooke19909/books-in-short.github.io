    <h2>  General information about the village </h2><p>  As already mentioned, Myskhako is a small cottage village, which belongs to the Novorossiysk region of the Krasnodar Territory.  Private houses prevail here.  The coast has just begun to be built up, but today the population is eight thousand people.  Many come here to relax and rent cottages for a certain period.  But someone buys these cottages to use as a summer residence or rent to vacationers and earn money on it. </p><p>  Of course, the village is famous not only for its beautiful views.  The pride of this village is a <span>winery.</span>  Vineyards have appeared here since ancient times.  They were planted in 1869.  This happened almost immediately after the accession of this area to the Russian Empire.  The wine produced at this plant is named after this place.  Myskhako is produced here - wine, reviews of which are heard on all beaches and in all restaurants of the coast.  Since not only local vacationers, but also those tourists who live on the same coast can enjoy its pleasant taste. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you still cannot decide where to go, feel free to go to Myskhako.  Here you can enjoy stunning nature, swim in the transparent sea, sunbathe on clean and low-filled beaches.  And the highlight of your holiday will be wine, which is produced at a local factory.  Not a single vacationer has yet brought reviews from the village of Myskhako that would not have attracted his friends and acquaintances. </p>

    <h2>  Leisure </h2><p>  If you read reviews about Myskhako that say that this is a village, don‚Äôt think that there‚Äôs nothing to do here.  Young people can easily get to the city to visit a nightclub or other entertainment venue.  Tourists with children can also find something to their liking in the city, for example, a cinema.  The highlight of the program is, of course, the winery.  Here you can learn not only the history of the creation of the plant and the technology for the preparation and storage of wine, but also taste all the varieties of the drink that it produces.  Every tourist should consider it his duty to visit this place. </p><p>  If you love outdoor activities, then feel free to go on excursions to Mount Koldun or Cape Myskhako.  Here you can hear many interesting legends and stories and enjoy the beautiful views.  If you manage to climb higher, then you are lucky to admire not only Novorossiysk, but also Kabardinka. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Those who do not go on holiday during the swimming season can attend the young grape festival, which takes place in November.  This is another exciting sight and the opportunity to taste the young wine, which in a few years will change its taste.  Perhaps this will be an occasion to re-visit this place. </p><p>  Even without all kinds of excursions and entertainment, you can spend time with benefit for yourself.  The incredible nature, the cleanest sea and the complete absence of city bustle and noise - what else does a tired tourist need on vacation. </p>

    <h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  First of all, Myskhako is the sea, the reviews of which are the most positive, but to get into the water, you need to go through the beach.  Local beaches can be divided into three zones.  The first is the central beach, which is covered with pebbles.  Here you can find a variety of water activities and other services for tourists.  The entrance to the sea here is very convenient, so the majority of tourists converge on this beach.  This creates some inconvenience, since the length is only 350 meters.  The central beach belongs to the eastern part of the cape. </p><p>  Followed by wild beaches.  Fewer people gather here, so the sea is much cleaner and calmer, and on the beach you can quickly find a suitable place.  They are also pebbled, but there are places where the sea meets the mountain, and the coast is more rocky and steep.  Such places are very fond of extreme sportsmen who like to jump from rocks.  Although this is a rather dangerous pleasure. </p><p>  The third zone is small beaches that are located in the settlement area and are practically not equipped. </p>

    <h2>  Winery "Myskhako" </h2><p>  This is one of the main attractions of Novorossiysk.  A visit to the winery is included in the route of many excursions that are held here.  Once here, you can enjoy the open views of the plant and its vineyards, the fruits of which are used to make local wine.  This plant is considered one of the oldest and largest in the region. </p><p>  Then the tour continues in the cellars, where the wines are stored with many years of aging.  Such always cost a lot of money.  This factory even produces <span>ice wine,</span> which most likely not everyone has heard of.  It is made from grapes that are frozen right on the vine.  The best wine of this kind can be tasted only by Canadian producers. </p><p>  The tour ends with a tasting.  Tourists are offered several types of wines for tasting, you can buy them for your own collection.  An interesting fact is that at this plant they make wines that are delivered to the Kremlin.  And the president of the Russian Federation himself prefers a drink that is produced at the Myskhako winery. </p><p>  Based on this, it can be concluded that the main souvenir brought from Myskhako will be a bottle of your favorite drink from the largest winery in the region. </p>
