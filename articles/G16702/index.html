    <p>  Since January 2011, new rules for <span>calculating maternity</span> leave have entered into force.  As practice shows, this is often not beneficial for women.  What does a woman need to know in order to receive maternity in the most favorable amount for herself?  If your wages have recently decreased significantly, for example, in connection with the transition to easy labor, then the new rules will be optimal for you.  Since <span>wages</span> are <span>calculated</span> for maternity for the last two years of work and are divided into 730 calendar days.  Thus, the average daily earnings are calculated, which is then multiplied by the number of vacation days. </p><p>  In normal delivery 140 days are taken into account for payment.  If the delivery took place with complications or surgical intervention, the number of paid days increases to 156 days.  At the birth of several children at the same time, maternity leave shall be paid in the amount of 194 days. </p><p>  The accountant of the company knows <span>how to calculate maternity</span> leave, but he is not required to calculate it in several existing ways, for the benefit of you.  Therefore, you must write the application yourself and indicate that the calculation should be done in two ways, or according to the old method.  Only in this case, you will receive more maternity pay.  And every woman needs to know this, so that later there will be no misunderstanding. </p><p>  The money is accrued after a ten-day period from the submission of the application and the provision of all necessary documents.  They charge money immediately for the entire period of maternity leave, it does not depend on the date of birth. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is important for every woman to know that when calculating income over the past two years, only those accruals from which social contributions were deducted are taken into account.  If a woman has been on parental leave for the past two years and hasn‚Äôt earned money, it is important for her to know how to calculate maternity leave in her case.  She needs to indicate in the application that the calculation should be made for the previous two years of her work, preceding the vacation. </p><p>  If a woman changed her place of work during this time, then she must provide a certificate from her previous work on <span>average earnings.</span>  If there is no certificate, you can make a corresponding request to the Pension Fund in order to calculate maternity leave.  Calculation is done taking into account the <span>minimum wage,</span> and after receiving a certificate from the pension fund, recalculate. </p><p>  Maternity workers who are not working in 2011 are not paid, with the exception of those who have lost their jobs in connection with the liquidation of the enterprise, or are studying on a paid or free basis in an educational institution.  They make payments from the federal budget.  How to calculate maternity in this case?  For this, the minimum wage is taken into account (4430 rubles) * 24 months / 730 days. </p><p>  A dismissed employee from 2011 has the right to maternity leave within a month after the date of dismissal. </p><p>  Accountants should be aware that salaries are taken for women who are on maternity leave. </p><p>  It must be remembered that it is important not only to know how to calculate maternity, but also not to make mistakes.  Always take into account the maximum level of average daily earnings equal to 1136.99 rubles.  If in the calculations it turns out higher, then it is necessary to take only this amount as a basis. </p><p>  And in conclusion, let us dwell on previous calculations of how to calculate maternity.  To do this, take into account all income for the past year, from which social contributions were taken and divided by the number of calendar days, minus vacation pay and sick leave.  Premiums in income are required. </p><p>  Every woman needs to know the rules for calculating maternity leave and always remember that you can receive payment for maternity leave within six months after the end of the sick leave. </p>
