At first glance, this is a nice device.  However, those who understand the topic remember the competition between the 610th and 710th models perfectly.  Moreover, the first clearly lost an unequal fight.  I remember that the price gap between the two devices was not so big, but the older model could offer users, of course, a more productive hardware stuffing. </p><h2>  Introduction </h2>

    <p>  It was then that the Finnish manufacturer decided to create another budget solution for the corresponding segment of mobile devices.  It was the <span>Nokia Lumia</span> 510 phone, the characteristics of which we will consider today.  By creating this device, the company managed to reduce competition between the 610th and 710th models, and to turn the attention of potential buyers to a new product on the market.  Initially, at the development stage, the Windows 7 operating system appeared on board the device.  A little later, version 7.8 was released, which was received by the owners of the device with a bang, because it was very similar to the next one - ‚ÄúWindows 8‚Äù. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is strange that some users ask how to change the date in the Nokia Lumia 510, reviews of which we will provide at the end of the article.  This is easy enough to do.  You just need to go to the device menu, find the item with the settings and go to the appropriate tab.  There you can set automatic date and time adjustment by the time zone of the SIM card. </p><h2>  Shortcomings </h2>

    <p>  Of course, there are drawbacks.  For example, more expensive models have a more impressive list of innovations than the subject of our review today.  However, this unit, which entered the smartphone market, was the first device that they began to deliver to mobile phone stores with the preinstalled Windows 7.8 operating system.  Of course, it was naive to expect a miracle.  The hardware filling of the device did not justify its price, as did the productivity. </p><h2>  In general and in general </h2>

    <p>  The cost of a smartphone based on the Windows 7.8 operating system is currently about 7-8 thousand rubles.  What does the user receive in exchange for this money?  And he gets a not-so-productive processor operating at a clock frequency of 800 megahertz, a main camera with a resolution of 5 megapixels, and 256 megabytes of RAM.  A little less than 4 GB is available for storing user data.  To put it mildly, the proposal can be called at least modest for such money.  Probably the effect is simply on the brand, and that's all. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Equipment </h2>

    <p>  What can we find inside the package when we open it?  Here is the smartphone itself, as well as a charger for it.  There is a stereo headset of medium quality, cable type MicroUSB - USB 2.0.  The delivery set is modest, and the entire composition ends with documentation.  It includes a warranty card, drawn up in a mobile phone store or other store where the device was purchased, as well as a brief user guide for using the smartphone.  By the way, many users ask questions of this type: ‚ÄúI have a Nokia Lumia 510 phone. How do I connect my device to a computer?‚Äù  The answer is very simple.  To do this, you need to use the wire that is included in the package, namely a cable like MicroUSB - USB 2.0. </p><p>  Actually, this is part of the answer to the question of <span>how to flash Nokia</span> Lumia 510. For this, you also need a wire to synchronize with a personal computer or laptop.  However, we will not manage with one cable at the same time.  Need firmware for the device.  You can find it on the official website of the company, in the appropriate section.  After that, we install special software to install the firmware, connect the device and do everything according to the instructions. </p><h2>  Design </h2>

    <p>  In general, there are certain features that are similar to the ‚ÄúNokia Lumiya 710‚Äù, and the 610th, and 510th models.  From the first subject of our today's review, I borrowed the shape of the back cover.  But from the second - the block on which the touch keys are located.  Sometimes it seems that this is not ‚ÄúNokia‚Äù at all.  It would be quite difficult to find out the creation of a Finnish manufacturing company without a logo printed on the front.  However, just look at it (which, in principle, is logical), as well as on the convex sides of the smartphone, and everything immediately falls into place.  It immediately becomes clear that before our eyes is nothing but the device of the Nokia company. </p><h2>  Dimensions </h2>

    <p>  In all three planes, the dimensions of the smartphone have the following indicators.  Height is 120.7, width - 64.9, and thickness - 11.5 millimeters.  The mass of the device does not exceed 129 grams.  Let's try to compare the phone with its predecessor, which suffered from fierce internal competition.  Its height was 119, width - <span>62, and</span> thickness - 12 millimeters.  Weight - no more than 133 grams.  If we additionally take into account the fact that the last device is similar to the 710th model, then we can say the following: all three devices have almost the same size. </p><p>  It remains only to add that the body is ergonomically designed.  Conveniently located and buttons to control the device.  It turned out that the subject of our review today is a little ‚Äúpot-bellied‚Äù, with sides protruding to the sides, but there is nothing particularly terrible in this.  The phone in the hand feels reliable, mainly due to its mass.  It is not the easiest, but, perhaps, this was not expected from him. </p><h2>  Build quality </h2>

    <p>  There are no claims to the model in this regard and cannot be.  The Finnish manufacturer knows the price of quality.  In the course of repeated tests and tests, no backlash or creaks were detected.  The case is made of plastic, as expected. </p><h2>  Color schemes </h2><p>  For some reason, in most cases, a yellow model is chosen for tests.  In this situation, you can see that among other devices in terms of their appearance, the device sharply begins to stand out.  It kind of hints to potential buyers that it has an original design that other manufacturers do not have.  Perhaps the yellow color can be called youth colors.  Currently, the device is available in smartphones in such designs as black, red, white and blue. </p><h2>  Front Panel </h2><p>  The front screen is surrounded around the entire perimeter by a black frame.  It is quite wide, you should be aware of this.  Due to the fact that the sides protrude in some way, the display surface will not touch the table.  The owners of the device can verify this themselves by turning it with the screen down and laying it on a horizontal surface.  Thoughtful engineering and design solution. </p><p>  Here is the earpiece.  On the side there is <span>a proximity sensor.</span>  The phone, thanks to the presence of <span>a light sensor,</span> can independently adjust the screen brightness.  There is no front camera on the front panel. </p><p>  Below is a block that consists of touch keys.  There are three of them in total.  For those who are just starting their acquaintance with the Lumiya line, special notations are applied. </p><h2>  Owner reviews </h2><p>  You can frankly complain about the quality of voice communications.  Reviews note the lack of proper volume margin.  You have to either wind it to the maximum, or firmly press the device to your ear.  The vibrating alert is not always felt through the pockets; it is not very intense in strength.  The same volume and voice call. </p><p>  When using the device leaves mixed feelings.  Probably because for the price at which the device is sold, you expect more or less adequate technical specifications.  And we, in the case of this smartphone model, do not encounter this, unfortunately.  According to reviews, the camera does not differ in special quality, the front camera is generally absent.  A small amount of long-term memory creates certain problems for phone owners.  Operational is also small, the processor is not very productive.  In general, here the ratio "price - quality" demonstrates clearly not the best indicator. </p>
