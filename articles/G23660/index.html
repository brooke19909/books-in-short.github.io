    <h2>  Bissell 17132 </h2><p>  A vertical hand-held vacuum cleaner with an aquafilter that allows you to clean quickly and efficiently.  Unlike the above models, the case is much lighter.  A long cord (7.5 m) allows you to make free movements around the room. </p><p>  There is a rotary mechanism on the <span>electric brush</span> .  To make it convenient to clean in poorly lit corners, the manufacturer took care of the backlight. </p><p>  The vacuum cleaner is very easy to care for.  After cleaning, it is not difficult to disassemble and clean the brush. </p><p>  Hard surfaces, such as laminate or parquet, are easily washed with this device.  However, it does not leave stains and collects water well. </p><p>  The technical design works with a power consumption of 560 watts, while it has no adjustment. </p><p>  The downside is that the brush cannot be advanced under the bed or bedside table due to the small angle of inclination.  Also, the vacuum cleaner is noisy and carries out high-quality cleaning only on flat surfaces. </p>

    <h2>  Vacuum cleaner recommendations </h2><p>  Since the instructions of the Bissell washing vacuum cleaner are attached to each model individually, we will use some user tips. </p><p>  After the next wet cleaning, all parts of the vacuum cleaner intended for regular care must be washed and laid out on a dry cloth. </p><p>  It is no coincidence that the Bissel washing vacuum cleaner is endowed with various functions.  It turns out that before carrying out wet cleaning, it is necessary to collect dust in a classical way.  Two-stage cleaning allows you to better wash away dirt and maintain perfect cleanliness in the house. </p><p>  Carpet products should be washed by gently moving the brush.  Otherwise, the dirt will erode on the surface and it will be difficult to collect. </p><p>  Before dry cleaning, pour water about 2.5-3 cm. </p><p>  For wet cleaning, use a special shampoo for a Bissell washing vacuum cleaner.  Other detergents are best avoided. </p><p>  It is important to carefully study the instructions for a particular model and follow it.  This approach will ensure that the cleaning equipment in your home remains a reliable and durable assistant. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  For those who have managed to adapt to universal technology, Bissell vacuum cleaners provide useful services.  They are indispensable household items when washing upholstered furniture. </p><p>  In negative reviews there is information that using a vertical vacuum cleaner, it is impossible to wash the skirting board.  Some do not like the fragile and overall designs of large devices and their cost.  The price of a Bissell washing vacuum cleaner varies from 29 990 to 40 938 rubles.  It is annoying to people that after each cleaning you need to clean filters and tanks.  The suction power of structures equipped with filters is not very strong. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  After reviewing the reviews for Bissell washing vacuums, we can conclude that they are too different.  And this is not surprising, because we must admit that the models are very different from each other.  When choosing a vacuum cleaner, it is important to consider your living conditions.  Since many models are designed for rooms with a large quadrature, it will be inconvenient to use them in small rooms.  For small apartments without carpet coverings, models with a vertical configuration are more suitable.  With the right household appliances for cleaning, cleaning your home will be a joy. </p>
