And the reviews left about Club Hotel Turan Prince World only confirm this fact. </p><p>  Guests note a lot of nuances.  Most often, positive comments relate to the following points: </p><p>  1. Settlement.  Prompt and immediate.  They try to quickly register, even if guests arrived earlier than expected (check-in from 14:00), but only if there are free rooms of the reserved category.  Are the apartments busy yet?  They will offer to stay in a rest room, have a snack and a drink. </p><p>  2. The beach.  The sea is very clean, and the entrance to the water is pleasant, gentle.  There are always free deck chairs, umbrellas, mattresses. </p><p>  3. The staff (Russian-speaking!).  Everyone notes the friendliness and friendliness of the people working at the hotel.  The rooms are cleaned daily and efficiently, constantly changing linens and towels.  If necessary - and on demand will be replaced.  The restaurants have excellent service, the waiters are real professionals who also manage to ask if visitors like everything. </p><p>  4. Bars and restaurants.  The assortment is so diverse that some did not even have time to try all, even after two weeks of stay.  Tables burst with delicacies - everyone will find a sophistication that will appeal to him. </p><p>  5. Infrastructure.  The hotel in the literal sense of the word has everything - starting with a library, renting bicycles and cars, ending with an exchange office and apartments for people with disabilities. </p><p>  In general, the advantages of this complex are really countless.  Needless to say, a truly 5-star level.  So if you want to spend your vacation brightly and unforgettably, enjoying the high quality service, you should go here. </p>
