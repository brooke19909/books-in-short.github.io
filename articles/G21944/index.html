  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Norwegian patterns - no barriers for knitting</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The first jacquard patterns were connected in Norway in the 18th century, and their name came from the name of the inventor.  The Norwegian ornament is carried out by front smooth with the help of multi-colored threads.  Norwegian or jacquard technique is called knitting with threads of two or more colors for one row.  Very often, traditional Norwegian knitting patterns are used, made in a two-color way.  These ornaments are produced by the <span>front surface,</span> while a non-working thread during knitting freely penetrates along the wrong side of the product. </p><p>  To create Norwegian patterns, special schemes are used in which different thread colors have their own symbol.  Each such sign defines 1 cell and corresponds to 1 loop.  Work in which Norwegian patterns are used for knitting is carried out in the forward and reverse direction.  In the scheme, front rows are read from right to left, and back rows are read from left to right. </p><p>  When working in a circular fashion, the diagram must be read from right to left.  Creating northern patterns, knitting using colored threads is carried out in a certain sequence, while holding the threads with the finger of the left hand.  The French method has a more strict division: the thread with the main color is located in the left hand, and the opposite is held by the right hand. </p><p>  Norwegian or jacquard ornaments are usually knitted with front stitch.  In order to get even edges, the edge loops are knitted with two threads, which are currently in operation, when made on straight knitting needles.  Their tension should be made evenly, for this you should use a special knitting thimble, which is put on the index left finger. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thanks to this device, colored threads are arranged in the required sequence and do not twist.  To get even edges when working with knitting needles, the <span>edge loops</span> must be knitted with an active thread.  To get the Norwegian patterns, several balls are used for knitting, the threads of which can be mixed up.  Confusion can be avoided by correctly turning the product over.  To do this, when creating the front rows, the work is turned over to itself, with the wrong ones - from itself.  This technique, which allows creating Norwegian knitting patterns, makes it possible to use different types of yarn in one product.  The main condition: the thickness of all threads should be the same. </p><p>  In the process of work in the same row, multi-colored threads are used, which are carried out from one drawing to another on the wrong side.  It should be remembered that these broaches should not tighten the working canvas, while violating elasticity, tightening and distorting the pattern.  Another feature of the Norwegian patterns is that when working with four or more thick threads, they must be crossed among themselves.  Because a person will cling to these broaches when taking off or putting on a finished thing.  The execution of patterns, as already mentioned, is performed according to counting schemes, in which each cell means a loop, and each sign means color. </p><p>  The richness of the Norwegian patterns is simply unlimited.  Motifs from figures, decorative borders, northern patterns and ornaments appear from multi-colored loops of the front surface. </p><p>  Thanks to the skill of the person making the knitting, <span>winter patterns</span> acquire the fullness of shapes and colors.  For example, the knitting pattern of Norwegian stars is very charming: this pattern will not leave anyone indifferent.  In general, absolutely all Norwegian patterns are not only unique, but also very elegant.  They are endless in their variety and quantity. </p><p>  Norwegian ornaments are fundamentally different from jacquard stars, but their patterns are also very attractive for execution.  And all these things are quite simple to realize.  It is only necessary to master the technique of knitting Norwegian patterns. </p>
