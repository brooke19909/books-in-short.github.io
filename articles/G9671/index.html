The maximum concentration of rented apartments and hotels is located in the northern part of the city, but this is difficult to consider a disadvantage, since the settlement is small, and the distance to its center can be overcome on foot. </p><h2>  Rest without worries </h2><p>  In the city center there are two hotels where you can feel at home.  Here they will warm, feed and solve all problems: they will remove the stain on the coat, and they will call taxis, and they will do everything for maximum convenience.  This, of course, ‚ÄúPark Inn Radisson‚Äù and ‚ÄúTagil‚Äù. </p>

    <p>  If a visit to the city is planned together with a family, then there is nothing better than a rented apartment.  This is a great alternative to such an option as the hotels of Nizhny Tagil.  There will be complete freedom in everything, and the size of these ‚Äúrooms‚Äù is much larger, as well as the opportunity to cook their own meals and invite friends to visit. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Economical options </h2><p>  For travelers who have a budget and simpler requests, there are 17 more other offers of B&amp;B hotels - ‚Äúbed and breakfast‚Äù, without any frills, but also clean. </p><p>  The most popular, according to reviews, options: Metallurg, Lesnaya, Northern Ural and Sportivnaya.  Each hotel in Nizhny Tagil has its own characteristics, pros and cons (where without them?), But, based on the conditions, you can choose exactly the institution that is right for you. </p><h2>  Hotel "North Ural" </h2><p>  In the city, this institution is more simply known as the Ural Hotel.  Nizhny Tagil, in addition to industry, is also famous for its recreational and sports facilities, so many hotels, hostels and hotels are located in their territories. </p>

    <p>  The Northern Ural is part of the Ural Medical and Rehabilitation Center.  Therefore, there is free parking, 24-hour security, access to the gym and, of course, the Internet.  Reviews about the ‚ÄúUrals‚Äù are only positive, because it is new, with a simple but high-quality repair, and it has everything you need for life. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The peculiarity of the Ural Hotel is the equipment of the entire territory and individual rooms for people with disabilities.  Hence the opportunity to order food with a drink right in the room.  But for those who like to get their own food, there is a cafe in the treatment center.  A walk to it must be taken along the garden alley, and this will distract from everyday problems. </p><h2>  Hotel Metallurg </h2><p>  Metallurg is a separate page in the history of Nizhny Tagil.  In it all the former pomp of the city.  The building itself is a ‚Äústalinka‚Äù with beautiful stucco and tall ceilings. </p>

    <p>  According to reviews, the hotel knew better times.  But according to the latest data, the repair is completed, and everything became much more accurate, more comfortable.  Therefore, the hotel "Metallurg" is waiting for tourists. </p><p>  Breakfast should be noted as a separate item: firstly, they are included in the price of the stay, and secondly, despite the simplicity, they are satisfying, which is an indisputable advantage for travelers for business purposes, since they need strength for the whole day. </p><p>  Hotel Metallurg is located in the northern part of the city, but not as far from the center as it might seem at first glance.  Therefore, absolute access to all the benefits, such as pizzerias, cafes and shops, is provided. </p><p>  In addition, the staff has a positive reputation and many times won the favor with its usual responsiveness and courtesy.  Therefore, if you need to know something, you can not be afraid and go directly to the hotel staff: they are always friendly and courteous, they will help. </p><h2>  Hotel "Forest" </h2><p>  It is further from the city center than the previously described options (20 km).  But Lesnaya is not the most peaceful hotel.  The thing is that most corporate events, family and city celebrations take place here. </p>

    <p>  The scale allows you to create a vast territory, and fabulousness brings that the hotel is located in the forest. </p><p>  The Lesnaya Hotel (Nizhny Tagil) has won four stars, and this corresponds to a decent set of services and their level.  As provided for in hotels of this type, a transfer to Lesnaya can be arranged from anywhere in the city, and vice versa. </p><p>  All rooms have high level amenities.  This is a place where you can relax in silence and have plenty of fun. </p><h2>  Hotel Sportivnaya </h2><p>  Not far from the sports complex were bought two residential blocks of flats remote from each other.  They are refitted and rooms are organized for athletes who come to the competition.  For this reason, the hotels got the names ‚ÄúSportivnaya-1‚Äù and ‚ÄúSportivnaya-2‚Äù.  Everyone is welcome here, but the level of service is minimal, and staying is more like living in apartments than in a hotel. </p><p>  Guests of Nizhny Tagil noted the advantage of "Sportivnaya" the presence of a constant and uninterrupted Internet.  Often this is precisely the factor that is the main one when choosing a hotel, because for a fee, mini-hotels and hostels do not offer Internet access at this level. </p><p>  The hotel consists of 60 and 70 rooms (in each part) with different footage and number of beds. </p>

    <p>  The only condition to which you must be prepared is the closing of the hotel at 11 p.m. on the deadbolt.  Therefore, before the specified time, you must definitely return to your room. </p><h2>  The choice is up to the tourist </h2><p>  We examined several completely different types of places of residence.  The choice is wide, and, making it, you can focus on your desires and financial capabilities. </p><p>  Of course, these are not all options, and there are other hotels in the city.  But these hotels of Nizhny Tagil are most often visited by tourists, there are a lot of positive reviews about them on the Web. </p><p>  Watch, ask the price and come to Nizhny Tagil for industrial romance.  Have a nice rest! </p>
