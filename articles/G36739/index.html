On all sides it is surrounded by numerous lakes.  By popularity, the city is second only to the capital - Helsinki.  But there are no less excursion routes.  What to see in Tampere (Finland)?  In our article we will talk about the most interesting places in the city. </p><h2>  Nature Park </h2><p>  The oldest attraction of Tampere is the highest coastal hill in the world - Pyyunikin Harju.  Its length reaches 200 kilometers and a height of 80 km.  In ancient times, there was a glacier at this place, the height of which in some places reached several kilometers.  Now at this place there is a natural park called Pyyuniki, on the territory of which there is a cafe and an observation tower.  On the rocky cliffs, you can see the mark reached by Lake Ankulus 9 thousand years ago.  Many sightseeing tours of the city begin in the park, which can be safely called an outstanding landmark of Tampere. </p><h2>  Natural beauty </h2><p>  Tampere (Finland) is located between two lakes - Pyh√§j√§rvi and Nisiy√§rvi, which were formed during the ice age.  Due to the rise of land, some of the rivers could not flow, as before, towards the Gulf of Finland, so they turned back, filling all the lowlands with water.  It so happened that the whole region is surrounded by numerous lakes.  Beautiful reservoirs give guests and residents the opportunity to ride a yacht, a motor ship and go fishing. </p><h2>  City Hall </h2><p>  Another historical landmark of Tampere is the Town Hall building, towering above the central square.  The Renaissance building was erected instead of the old wooden one in 1890.  It is traditionally located in Finland for the city administration.  The interiors of the building are very beautiful and at the same time restrained. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tampere Finland Attractions" class="if uuid-2848342" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2848342.jpg"></div><p>  Sometimes events are held in the halls of the town hall, and on Independence Day local residents gather here to hear the festive speech of the city leadership. </p><h2>  Nyasilinna Palace </h2><p>  Among the attractions of Tampere (photos are given in the article) there is another outstanding building, built in 1898 on the outskirts of the city.
