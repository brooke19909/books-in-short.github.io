    <p>  Every woman knows that it is difficult to compare sensations after carrying out spa procedures with anything.  Therefore, to get real relaxation, we recommend that you visit the SPA treatment center, as well as a sauna, bathhouse, jacuzzi or Turkish hammam.  Perhaps you need to improve your back health?  For this, you can contact the professionals in the massage room.  If you are going to relax in Turkey in the hot summer, you should know that such procedures help to cope with the load on the body much easier in the process of acclimatization. </p><p>  Every day after dark, the hotel invites artists and musicians to conduct entertainment for all hotel guests.  Everyone can continue the party until the morning, organizing discos by the pool, where with the backlight turned on in complete darkness, a special ultra-romantic atmosphere is created. </p><h2>  Active leisure and sports </h2><p>  Everyone's day of rest is completely different.  Sometimes, tourists arriving at the resort begin to realize all the opportunities for recreation provided to them, unfortunately, only a couple of days before departure.  Others, on the contrary, take a hyperactive start, and spend the last couple of days as a five-year-old child tired of sweets.  One way or another, many plan to return again and spend the next vacation in a 5 * Ganita Holiday Club 5 * hotel.  Reviews testify to this. </p><p>  If you like active events or are determined to try your skills in various sports, there is a whole list of such entertainments at your service, namely: an open area for fitness and aerobics, for lovers of the traditional ball game, three areas are equipped (football, basketball, volleyball) , there is also a gym, two tennis courts, tables for billiards and ping-pong, the ability to rent a <span>water scooter</span> or boat. </p><p>  Not all of these services are free, but you must admit that ten days in this mode can greatly strengthen immunity, as well as improve psycho-emotional health. </p>

    <h2>  Free hotel service </h2><p>  The number of free services at the hotel primarily indicates the level to which the 5 * Ganita Holiday Club 5 * hotel corresponds.  The reviews that we studied before writing this review help to study all the nuances of relaxation in this place and make some useful conclusions.  Some services, of course, should be free, which, unfortunately, is often not enough even in expensive hotels (for example, umbrellas, sun loungers and towels for relaxing on the beach). </p><p>  So that tourists can feel like real guests, their vacation should not stop if they forget their wallet in the room.
