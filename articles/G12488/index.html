  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Teams on "Tele2": list, description of teams</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Tele2 is a popular mobile operator.  Its services are used by more than 40 million people.  For the convenience of customers, much has been created: a personal account on the official website, a mobile application, a support service.  Tele2 has teams (USSD-requests) created to receive some services and quick answers to questions of interest. </p><h2>  Balance check and connection of the promised payment </h2><p>  The most frequently performed action by subscribers of any mobile operators is a balance check.  On the “Tele2” SIM card, you can find out the amount on the account using the command * 105 #. </p><p>  When there is not enough money on the balance sheet, you can use the Promised Payment service.  It allows you to get money in debt for a short time.  The amount of the “Promised Payment” is determined by the expenses of the client.  The more actively he uses communication services, the more he can get.  In Moscow and the Moscow Region, for example, Tele2 provides its subscribers with 50 rubles.  for 3 days, 100 rubles.  for 3 days, 200 rubles.  for 5 days and 300 rubles.  for 7 days.  The available amount can be found using * 122 # - the catchy Tele2 command.  The “promised payment” can be connected by sending a USSD request * 122 * 1 #. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kdssearch.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Promised Payment: Connection Team" class="if uuid-3212960" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/3212960.jpg"></div><h2>  "Promised Payment +" </h2><p>  Some subscribers after entering * 122 # receive a message with an offer to use the service "Promised payment +".  If such an offer arrives, it means that the regular service is not available.  The Promised Payment + has the following conditions: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  available amount from 10 to 500 rubles .; </li><li>  the size of the commission is from 10 to 250 rubles .; </li><li>  the amount of money is provided only when the service "Prohibition of money transfers" is disabled. </li></ul><p>  To activate the function "Promised payment +" the mobile operator "Tele2" did not provide a command.  The only way to activate the service is to send the “+” sign in the message to the short number 315. </p><h2>  Information on tariff and package balances </h2><p>  Periodically, all subscribers of mobile operators are faced with the need to find out the name and main parameters of the current tariff.  The command on Tele2 to get this information is * 107 #.  After sending this request, a notification is displayed on the screen that the application has been accepted, the response will be sent in an SMS message.  Quite quickly, Tele2 subscribers are sent information of interest - the name of the tariff plan, the size of the subscription fee, the size of the packages included in the tariff. </p><p>  To check the remaining packets, the command * 155 * 0 # is provided.  The rest of the packet with Internet traffic is checked by a very similar USSD request - * 155 * 00 #.  These two teams are very useful and convenient, because they allow you to monitor costs, learn about the exhaustion of any package in time.  If, for example, Internet traffic ends, then you can connect additional megabytes or gigabytes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="growthaddict.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Basic USSD-requests &quot;Tele2&quot;" class="if uuid-3212961" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/3212961.jpg"></div><h2>  “Beacon” and “Friend's Help” </h2><p>  When there are no package minutes and money left on the phone balance, you can take advantage of the opportunities at zero.  The mobile operator “Tele2” has two services - “Beacon” and “Help of a friend”. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  “Beacon” is a service with which you can ask another subscriber to call back.  The request comes in the form of an SMS message.  In order to send the “Beacon”, you need to dial the command “Tele2” on the phone - * 118 * [number of the desired subscriber] #.  The Mayachka has several features: </p><ul><li>  You can send a request to call back to any Russian mobile number; </li><li>  the service is not always available only when less than 5 rubles remain on the balance; </li><li>  the number of “beacons” is limited (no more than 5 requests can be sent per day, and no more than 60 per month); </li><li>  the service is free. </li></ul><p>  “Friend's help” is a service that allows you to make calls at the expense of the interlocutor.  This service is included in all tariff plans.  There is no subscription fee.  To make a call at the expense of the interlocutor, you need to dial the command * 140 * 7xxxxxxxxxx #, where 7xxxxxxxxxx is the number of the called subscriber.  Cash is deducted only when the called subscriber receives the call.  In this case, money is debited from the account of the interlocutor.  For the caller, the call is free.  It is also important to remember several other features of the “Help a Friend” service: </p><ul><li>  it can be used only in the home region when making calls to other subscribers in the same region; </li><li>  for corporate clients, the service is not available; </li><li>  the service is unavailable in cases where the called subscriber does not have money on the balance sheet or when the called subscriber is in roaming, unavailable or busy. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="ng.shouldianswer.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="&quot;Beacon&quot; from &quot;Tele2&quot;: team" class="if uuid-3212967" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/3212967.jpg"></div><h2>  Check and cancel paid subscriptions </h2><p>  The appearance on the number of paid subscriptions connected without the knowledge of the owner of the phone is a fairly common situation.  Due to the carelessness of subscribers who click on different advertisements and banners when using the Internet, it’s possible to automatically connect subscriptions that cause a lot of problems, because because of them the phone balance just melts - usually about 50 rubles are written off daily (sometimes less, and sometimes more). </p><p>  Mobile operators do not have the right to block promotions for content companies that provide content services to users.  There are many people who consciously connect subscriptions.  For owners who are negatively related to subscriptions, the Tele2 mobile operator recommends that they independently monitor the options that appear on the number.  To check the connected paid subscriptions, the command * 189 # was specially created.  After sending it, a message with a list of connected content services comes to the number.  To disable unwanted subscriptions, there is a special command on Tele2 - * 931 #. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nauruzovo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Team to verify subscriptions" class="if uuid-3212958" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/3212958.jpg"></div><h2>  Call spam protection </h2><p>  To protect subscribers from unwanted calls, Tele2 created a special paid service called Black List.  A monthly fee is charged.  Additionally, a small fee is paid when adding a new number to the black list. </p><p>  A whole list of teams has been created for the service.  On "Tele2", it is connected using the USSD request * 220 * 1 #.  Other teams provided for this service: </p><ul><li>  * 220 * 0 # - disable the black list; </li><li>  * 220 # - check the status of the service; </li><li>  * 220 * 1 * [subscriber number] # - add a specific number to the black list (the number is indicated starting with the number "8"); </li><li>  * 220 * 0 * [subscriber number] # - delete a number from the black list. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.wdgpublichealth.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Call spam protection" class="if uuid-3212963" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/3212963.jpg"></div><p>  So, we examined the main USSD requests.  All of them greatly facilitate the use of communication services.  Additional commands “Tele2” can be found on the official website of the mobile operator. </p>
