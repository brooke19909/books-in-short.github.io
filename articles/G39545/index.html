    <h2>  Reality </h2><p>  Now people are wondering how to withdraw money from Steam.  Suppose that you replenish the balance, and here is a discount on the selected game.  Naturally, after your transaction, you will still have some "extra" <span>money</span> in your account <span>.</span>  If you no longer plan to "go broke", then I would like to get the rest back.  But how to do that? </p><p>  By default, this is not possible.  And will not be.  If you are thinking about how to withdraw money from Steam, you will have to stock up on time, nerves and energy.  After all, we now will need to look for the so-called "workarounds."  Fortunately, they are.  This is not a full refund.  Rather, a trick that you can use.  Let’s get to know how to transfer money from “Steam”, let’s say, to your electronic wallet. </p><h2>  Resale </h2><p>  Our first option is costly in itself.  Both in time and money spent.  Now we will talk with you about such a thing as the resale of game items in online toys.  If you are not afraid, then we can move on.  Otherwise, you can see what other methods exist. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to withdraw money from steam" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/780491.jpg"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Our method is based on the purchase of game items on the Steam trading platform with their subsequent sale.  Many users will gladly buy them from you.  The main thing is to know what and for which toy to purchase.  This particular method will help you figure out how to withdraw money from Steam. </p><p>  If you don’t really want to understand the rating of modern toys, then it is best to give preference to “Dota” and “Counter Strike”.  Buy a variety of items, and then put them up for sale on the Steam trading floors.  Each game has its own.  So, after some time, you will return the funds to your electronic wallet. </p><p>  This method has its drawbacks.  For example, your losses for trading.  They can reach 20-40% of the total sales.  Not the best outcome.  But when there is no more way out, then it will do.  And if you also understand games whose subjects you trade in, then it’s generally wonderful.  Then you know for sure that now users are literally ready to “tear off with their hands”.  <span>True, this is</span> not a particularly fast option.  There are more interesting tricks that we will discuss now. </p><h2>  Output system </h2><p>  How to withdraw money from "Steam"?  For example, you can use a specialized withdrawal system.  It is called the "Flea marketer."  True, we hasten to upset you - the minimum amount for withdrawal is 700 rubles.  Plus, you will be charged a large commission.  Approximately 35% of the total.  If these numbers do not scare you, then let's see what we need. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="you can withdraw money from Steam" class="if" height="347" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/780490.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Contact the hosting staff using Skype.  There they will explain what needs to be done.  The whole task is to buy certain games and give them to a specific user.  In the note to the letter you should indicate your account (name).  After checking the data, you will be transferred funds to any electronic wallet. </p><p>  Honestly, if you’re thinking how to withdraw money from Steam, it’s best <span>not to use</span> this option.  Firstly, the commission is huge, and secondly, you can stumble upon scammers.  So let's now look at the last way that might help. </p><h2>  Sell ​​gifts </h2><p>  If you think about how to withdraw money from “Steam”, then you can very well start reselling the purchased games.  For example, agree with a friend that you will give him a game, and he will pay you real (or electronic) money for this. </p><p>  This option is especially relevant after the sale.  On them you can buy goods in "Steam" for "pennies", and then resell them for a great price.  So "get enough", and "wash your money." </p><p>  It is preferable to “give” toys to well-known people.  Or, for example, do this only after paying for the "service provided".  A great option that will suit all outgoing and friendly users. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to transfer money from Steam" class="if" height="303" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/780489.jpg" width="600"></div>

          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  And now a little about the prices.  If you decide to resell some kind of toy, then it is most preferable to put the price tag lower than the game is currently in “Steam”, but also slightly higher than you purchased it.  So you can not only return the funds, but also get some interest "on top".  Now you know how to withdraw money from Steam. </p>
