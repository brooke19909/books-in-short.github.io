  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to choose the tablet diagonal?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A tablet is a multimedia device, one of the subspecies of a computer.  Its distinguishing feature is the screen, which occupies almost the entire area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe gadget.  He is also an input device.  For this reason, when choosing a tablet, most attention is paid to the display, namely, to its size.  It reflects such a value as the diagonal.  Traditionally, it is measured in inches. </p><p>  <span>Tablet computers are</span> produced by many campaigns around the world, and each of them has its own view on what should be the optimal diagonal of the tablet.  This gives rise to a large number of models of different sizes.  What then gadget to choose for yourself?  The answer to this question depends on the purpose for which the device is purchased.  There are several standard diagonals that manufacturers most often adhere to. </p><h2>  7 inch diagonal </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iPad mini 4" class="if uuid-2667869" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100094/2667869.jpg"></div><p>  The aspect ratio is 10 x 16. These are the smallest tablets that can be found on the market (only 18 centimeters).  This can be an advantage if you often need to take your gadget with you.  It fits easily in your pocket and is lightweight.  Such a tablet is well suited for games, as fingers reach all areas of the screen.  The disadvantage is that because of the small display it is inconvenient to work on it.  In addition, if you want to print text, the keyboard will occupy almost the entire screen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Examples of such tablets: iPad mini 4, <span>Xiaomi MiPad</span> 2, Samsung Galaxy Tab A. </p><h2>  8 inch diagonal </h2><div class="photo" data-original="images.fonearena.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lenovo Tab 4" class="if uuid-2667875" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100094/2667875.jpg"></div><p>  The aspect ratio is 3 x 4. Such a tablet is not much larger than a seven-inch one, so it has similar advantages: lightness and portability.  It is easy to carry, often it even fits in your pocket.  Its display is more square, which makes it easier to work with documents and use the browser.  But for the same reason, watching a movie on such a device is not very pleasant, since black bars appear on the top and bottom of the screen.  Many consider this format to be the middle ground between large ten-inch and small seven-inch models. </p><p>  Examples of such tablets: Digma Plane 8540E, Lenovo Tab 4, Huawei Mediapad T3. </p><h2>  Diagonal 9.7 inches </h2><div class="photo" data-original="blog.bestbuy.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S3" class="if uuid-2667879" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100094/2667879.jpg"></div><p>  The aspect ratio is 3 x 4. It is already a tablet with a large screen.  It is adapted for typing in two hands and allows you to work comfortably in various programs.  But such a gadget usually has a lot of weight and it is inconvenient to use it on weight.  Under such tablets, there are covers, stands, so that they can be freely placed on a horizontal surface. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Examples of such <span>tablets: Samsung Galaxy Tab S3,</span> iPad. </p><h2>  Diagonal 10.1 inches </h2><div class="photo" data-original="thegadgetflow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Huawei MediaPad M2" class="if uuid-2667885" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100094/2667885.jpg"></div><p>  The aspect ratio is 10 x 16. This is also a tablet with a large screen (25 centimeters).  Due to its format, ideal for watching movies.  The image occupies the entire screen without black bars.  A wide display with high resolution allows you to fully enjoy high-quality image.  But such tablets have a problem similar to the seven-inch ones: the on-screen keyboard in a horizontal position is very inconvenient.  You have to work with it when the device is located vertically. </p><p>  Examples of tablets with a diagonal of 10.1: Lenovo Yoga Book, Huawei MediaPad M2, Samsung Galaxy Tab A. </p><h2>  Custom tablet diagonals </h2><p>  Each tablet manufacturer is trying to make their products individual in order to attract interest from a potential buyer.  Often this is expressed in the fact that models with unusual <span>diagonals of displays</span> appear on the market <span>.</span>  For example, 8.9 inches.  But more interesting are tablets larger than 10 ‚Ä≥.  The most common type is 12.9 inches.  The flagship of such diagonals is the Apple iPad Pro.  The cost of such devices is, of course, high, but it justifies itself.  Such a large size allows you to install a more powerful filling, increasing productivity.  iPad Pro was originally created to replace full-fledged computers, but because of its operating system (iOS) and its high price, it could not gain wide popularity. </p><div class="photo" data-original="andro4all.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Toshiba TT301" class="if uuid-2667888" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100094/2667888.jpg"></div><p>  The appearance on the market of a tablet with a diagonal of 12.9 ‚Ä≥ surprised users.  But this is not the limit.  In 2017, Toshiba introduced a device with a diagonal of a 24-inch tablet.  This is more than most budget computer monitors.  Such a device is equipped with multi-touch interface, which allows you to recognize more than ten touches at the same time.  This will be useful if two people use this tablet at once.  Additionally, its operating system supports the function of launching two applications at once simultaneously with a split screen in half.  Pretty competent solution for such a diagonal. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="S8esb7Hr5wI" data-url="https://youtu.be/S8esb7Hr5wI" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/6/3/6/2/6362.jpg"></div><p>  What is the best diagonal of the tablet?  If you need a device for watching movies, then you should pay attention to tablets with an aspect ratio of 10 x 16. The size should be chosen based on the need for portability, an acceptable budget.  It is worth considering that the larger the display, the higher the cost.  For working with applications and documents, tablets with a large diagonal and an aspect ratio of 3 x 4 are suitable. It is most convenient to play on small devices with a diagonal of 7 or 8 inches.  If the tablet does not require high mobility, and you are not limited by the budget, then you should pay attention to gadgets with an ultra-high diagonal, for example 12.9 inches. </p>
