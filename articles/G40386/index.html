And if the drivers still manage to ride, then putting the car in the parking lot or just stopping near the store is already a difficult task requiring a good eye and speed of decision making.  Just to alleviate this problem, parking sensors are designed for cars.  Today we will talk about them in more detail. </p><h2>  What is it needed for </h2><p>  Parktronic, or parking radar, is used to alert the driver that his car has driven too close to another car or obstacle.  The device is quite simple, but very useful in situations with limited visibility and in cramped places.  In addition, modern cars, due to the fact that almost all of them are front-wheel drive, have a long front overhang and a sloping hood, which is often not visible from the driver's seat. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="install parking sensors on a car" class="if" height="223" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1637316.jpg" width="499"></div>  In addition, for the sake of design refinement, the rear window is made small in size, especially in sedans (the edge of the trunk is not visible there).  All this creates discomfort and the need to "estimate" the distance to the foreign object "by eye".  Sometimes this does not always end successfully.  As a result, scratches from close contacts appear on the bumpers.

They generate ultrasonic waves and receive their reflections. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="install parking sensors on cars price" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1637312.jpg" width="600"></div>  From the return time of the reflected signal, the device determines the distance to the obstacle.  Most modern cars are still equipped with this simple device at the factory.  But you can install it on any old cars.  The only question is to find out what parking sensors are for cars.

    <h2>  Kinds </h2><p>  The system consists of several sensors, a switching unit and an information panel.  Sensors can be located on the front and / or rear bumper - in the most problematic, sought-after areas mentioned above.  Sensors for each zone can be from two to four.  Two pieces that are located in the corners - the most economical and cheapest option. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to choose parking sensors for cars" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1637313.jpg" width="600"></div>  But in the center, a <span>blind zone</span> forms <span>,</span> which is not controlled in any way.  There is a risk of crashing into, say, a pipe sticking low out of the ground.  Three sensors on the bumper are already a more reliable solution.  But the best option is four elements at an equal distance from each other.  Thus, the entire bumper area is fully controlled.  According to owners, such a system is the most common and convenient.

Structurally, it is a box with a screen on which the car and sensors located on the bumpers are symbolically depicted, depending on the configuration.  In addition to the characters on the screen, an additional <span>sound signal</span> can be used <span>.</span>  Thus, there are three types of alerts: </p><ul><li>  Sound. </li><li>  Optical </li><li>  Character. </li></ul><p>  The first view is the simplest.  If there is an obstacle in the range of the radar (from 2.5 m to 25 cm), an intermittent signal starts to sound.  As the obstacle (or vehicle) approaches, the signal begins to increase.  With close proximity to the bumper, the sound becomes continuous.  Using such a system, it is convenient to park by ear, but if there is a problem with hearing or loud music is playing, then the benefits of parking sensors are significantly reduced. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="types of parking sensors for cars" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1637314.jpg" width="600"></div>  The next system is optical.  It is a strip of LEDs of different colors, from green to red, in accordance with the proximity of the object.  These lanes are located on the right and left of the information screen and correspond to the location of obstacles on the respective sides of the vehicle.  Digital display - a screen on which numbers are displayed - the distance in meters to the object.  The numbers are often duplicated by sound indications and LED strips.  The system has the ability to include various options.  In some situations, digital display is not too necessary, or, conversely, when driving in a traffic jam, it is advisable to turn off the sound warning, otherwise the parking sensors will constantly beep.  Owner reviews indicate that all three systems are equally convenient and the comfort of use often depends on driving experience.

    <h2>  Models </h2><p>  The types of parking sensors for cars are very diverse, but they are all divided into different groups, which should be mentioned: </p><ul><li>  The first group consists of parking sensors for a car, the indicators of which are built into the rear-view mirror and are strips of columns of horizontal dashes of different colors.  They will light up one by one as the car approaches the obstacle. </li><li>  The second, more advanced option is parking sensors, combined with a rear view camera.  For such a model, the information display is a digital screen on which a picture is displayed from a camera located at the back (and sometimes - in front).  Unfortunately, the camera lens can get dirty in bad weather, which will not happen with ordinary sensors - they are not afraid of such weather changes. </li><li>  The most modern models of parking sensors have not point, but tape sensors.  Such sensors are very easy to install and do not stand out so much on the bumper, so they are becoming more widespread. </li></ul><p>  Modern parking sensors for cars are often equipped with additional features.  Usually they carry redundant and unnecessary information (clock, compass).  When choosing a suitable parking sensors model, it is better to focus on the model with maximum functionality and ease of use. </p><h2>  What to look for </h2><p>  Before choosing parking sensors for a car, you should pay attention to the area that it will serve. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="installation of parking sensors on a car in Moscow" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1637315.jpg" width="432"></div>  Often the values ‚Äã‚Äãfor the front and back differ.  It is also necessary to check the compliance of the temperature and humidity conditions with the forthcoming operation.  The sensors themselves installed in the bumper of the car must have the same color, in extreme cases - the same shade, so as not to stand out much from the appearance of the car.  The information screen should organically fit into the interior and be in harmony with it.  Ideally, it looks like a full-time, factory part.  Now on sale there are a great many models, and it is not difficult to choose the right instance.

    <h2>  Installation </h2><p>  Currently, installing parking sensors on a car is a fairly common service in specialized service centers.  The work is not too complicated and is mainly associated with pulling wires from the sensors to the switching unit and the information screen. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="parking sensors for cars" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1637318.jpg" width="600"></div>  Holes for sensors are also drilled in the bumpers.  If you <span>install parking sensors</span> on a car, the price will greatly depend on the installation kit, as well as on the type and size of the car.  The kit may include both the element itself and the ‚Äúsophisticated‚Äù system with one or two cameras and a screen.  <span>Installing parking sensors</span> on a car in Moscow will cost from 2500 to 4000 rubles for the simplest option with four sensors at the back.  For the option with a camera you will have to pay 5-8 thousand rubles.

    <h2>  Self-assembly </h2><p>  Of course, you can save and install parking sensors on the car yourself (in the instructions everything is described in sufficient detail).  However, this work is connected with the dismantling-assembly of the cabin, and often - and the removal of the bumper.  In addition, to connect the device you will need to crash into the on-board electrical system. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="installation of parking sensors on a car" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1637317.jpg" width="600"></div>  Therefore, before starting work, it is advisable to estimate your skills.
