Reviews of tourists, sea, prices</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  After the Olympics, Sochi became famous throughout the world and became the most popular and prestigious resort in the Krasnodar Territory.  Of course, this city was previously quite large and developed.  But the acquired status of the Olympic capital had a positive effect on infrastructure development and street improvement.  According to vacationers, there are too many people here during the tourist season, and the prices are unreasonably high.  So maybe it's worth organizing your vacation in the fall?  What features does a vacation in September in Sochi have, and what you need to know before buying tickets for this resort? </p><h2>  Pros of autumn holidays at sea </h2>

This is the Russian tradition of summer holidays, and there are few chances to buy a ticket for bad weather.  But, nevertheless, a vacation in September in Sochi will be no less successful and enjoyable.  One of the main advantages of autumn leave is the reduction in prices.  Already from mid-August housing, tours and other entertainment are noticeably cheaper.  At the same time, vacationers are becoming less than in the middle of the season.  This means that on the beach you don‚Äôt have to win your place in the sun, it will be much easier to get acquainted with local attractions, and there will be no high competition in the search for comfortable housing.  Moreover, the weather in Sochi in September is still warm, which means that you will have time to fully enjoy all the traditional resort activities.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Resort climate and weather forecast for early fall </h2><p>  Sochi is the southernmost city in Russia.  It is located in the subtropical climate zone, the sun shines here at least 300 days a year.  There is no pronounced rainy season; winters are mild and warm.  The weather in Sochi in September usually pleases vacationers, but tourists who often visit this resort recommend planning a vacation in the middle and second half of the month.  However, even if during your stay at sea you are taken aback by the weather, do not be discouraged - the rains are usually short-lived, and winds and storms at sea are year-round, but also do not last too long. </p><h2>  Is it possible to swim in the sea? </h2>

The water temperature in Sochi in September is still quite suitable for swimming.  Of course, you should go to the beach only on sunny sunny days.  Usually during the entire first month of autumn the sea does not have time to cool.  The standard indicator for this period is 21-24 degrees.  What is interesting, <span>the water temperature in Sochi</span> in September is higher than in the middle of summer, for example?  in July.  The total length of the resort along the coastline is about 150 kilometers.  These are the beaches of Sochi and the surrounding villages included in its area.  Among them there are well-maintained, and almost wild recreation areas.  You can even choose the type of beach - in this area there are both pebble and sandy areas on the coast.  In the middle of the day, the air temperature is 22-30 degrees, which means that there will be no reason to refuse to swim.

In September, in the Krasnodar Territory, for a nominal fee, you can buy ripe watermelons, melons, grapes, figs, apples and pears.  There is always plenty of fruit here, and often the owners of private housing offer completely free refreshments from their own garden.  If you go to the sea in Sochi in September, do not forget to try the local young wine or even go on a thematic tour and get acquainted with the technology of its production in detail.  In addition, treats made from nuts, dried fruits and honey are considered traditional for local cuisine. </p><h2>  We choose housing </h2>

You can pre-book a hotel room and be sure that you will be met at the station and immediately settled.  An alternative option - through the Internet to find an option to offer housing for rent from individuals.  However, you will not stay on the street, even if you decide to look for housing upon arrival.  From early morning until mid-night, locals wait for visitors at the city station with a proposal to rent a room or room.  This is a feature of resort towns.  Almost everyone rents housing here, since tourism is one of the most developed sectors of the economy.

    <p>  The cost of living depends on the type of rental property, its proximity to the sea and related conditions.  Usually you can rent a room from a private trader for about 300-400 rubles per day, a hotel room costs from 900 rubles.  Be sure to find out in advance at what distance from the beach the selected hotel is located, what amenities are in the room. </p><h2>  Food and infrastructure </h2>

Some hotels offer tours to Sochi in September on an all-inclusive basis with two or three meals a day.  Other hotels have a cafe with them, where each guest can order any menu items.  There are many catering establishments in the city itself.  Pleased with the variety of their formats and prices.  These are elite restaurants, and unpretentious cafes on the promenade, and establishments offering quick snacks and drinks.  It remains only to choose the wallet to your taste.  If you rent a room from a private person, you can always try to arrange a meal or use the kitchen for self-cooking.

    <h2>  Tours and attractions </h2><p>  If the time of rest in Sochi is September, the prices for various excursions will pleasantly surprise you.  In the city itself, it is interesting to visit chic parks and an arboretum.  In the vicinity of the city you can see ancient dolmens and waterfalls.  But still, many travel to Sochi, first of all, in order to see the city in its new guise and to evaluate with its own eyes the scale and grandeur of the Olympic venues.  These attractions are available today for sightseeing, they are guided tours. </p><p>  Very popular among tourists are trips and hiking in the mountains.  Rest in September in Sochi allows you to visit as many attractions as possible and not feel discomfort due to the heat.  One-day excursions to neighboring settlements are also interesting.

At this time, even the smallest children can go to the Black Sea without fear.  It is not without reason that many trips to Sochi in September were initially oriented toward family vacations.  The weather of the velvet season is very pleasant, and acclimatization is fast and usually without obvious manifestations.  The resort is no longer as noisy and crowded as in the summer.  The cost of living is reduced, you can easily find a hotel room that is best equipped to stay with children.  Many hotels also offer discounts on bookings for large family rooms or free accommodation for toddlers.  Under all these conditions, you still have time to show the child the sea and can spend a lot of time on the beach without risking a sunstroke.

Vacationers in Sochi in early autumn notice that even though it is warm and sunny during the day, it is already quite cool in the evenings and nights.  This is not a reason to refuse a trip, but a few warm things should be put in a suitcase.  There are really fewer visitors on the beach and near the main attractions than in the middle of the season.  Do not think that you will be able to sit on the seashore in complete solitude, but you will not have to lie at arm's length from strangers while sunbathing.

    <p>  Has a rest in Sochi in September, reviews and negative.  Some argue that the weather was just disgusting, and most of the holidays had to hide from the rain.  Well, unfortunately, even official forecasts do not always come true.  But if your vacation is overshadowed by bad weather, feel free to go on excursions, choosing sights that are far away from the rainy city.  If you believe the reviews of tourists, renting a house in Sochi in September is very simple.  In the low season, offers exceed demand, and you can choose, bargain, and not agree to the first available option. </p><p>  In conclusion, I want to say that with the advent of autumn, the atmosphere in the resort itself changes.  The rhythm of life becomes calmer, the noise calms down a bit, according to many, the velvet season in Sochi is ideal for walking, reflection and contemplation. </p>
