It passes through the valleys of the Podkumok and Mara rivers flowing into the Kuban, and leads from the Kavminvod to Karachaevsk.  This place is popular among lovers of active winter recreation, as well as those who like to retire to the mountains among the picturesque landscapes.  And it‚Äôs not necessary to be a fan of skiing or be good at skiing in order to relax here, as in these places of Karachay-Cherkessia everyone will find something to do for themselves. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Gumashi Pass is by far the most stunning place in the Caucasus.  The path runs through a narrow ribbon and is fenced on all sides by mountains, as well as ridges of rocks with incredible contours.  When you climb the Gumbashi pass with each kilometer, its landscapes become more mysterious and more beautiful.  The last meters of the route look like a serpentine, and at the end of the journey, all visitors expect something fabulous.  At an altitude of 2145 meters above sea level, amazing panoramas and stunning paintings of the Main <span>Caucasus Range,</span> as well as an unforgettable view of <span>Mount Elbrus.</span> </p>

Therefore, a little later, from the city of Kislovodsk, a tourist route No. 43 was laid that led to the village of Teberda.  At that time, this section of the road passed along a <span>dirt road.</span>  In the thirties, a new road was laid here, which already has 85 km of asphalt pavement.

The average annual air temperature here is approximately equal to +5 degrees Celsius.  In July, the thermometer rises to a maximum of +16 heat.  The Gumbashi pass in winter does not differ in severe frosts, since in January there is about +4. </p><p>  In general, the weather in these places is wonderful.  The winter period lasts four months, and the first snow may fall already in mid-November.  Should I expect any surprises from Gumbashi?  The pass (skiing, by the way, is considered one of the most favorite types of leisure here) is famous for its mild and stable climatic conditions, so you can‚Äôt worry about the vagaries of nature.  Until the beginning of April, snow constantly lies on Gumbashi and the bright sun shines.  With the arrival of heat, you can see a lot of people with tents and bicycles.  But do not forget that surprises can occur in the form of heavy rain, so you need to be prepared for such weather. </p>

    <h2>  Winter activities </h2><p>  In addition to excursions, it is wonderful to relax with the whole family or with friends.  Gumbashi Pass on its slopes has a wonderful tourist base.  It is built for all fans of active, family and individual recreation.  The infrastructure of this place is well developed for a comfortable stay of tourists. </p><p>  What can you do at Gumbashi?  The pass ( <span>skiing</span> here, again, wonderful) can offer guests quite a few types of outdoor activities.  But let's start with the classics.  Special rental points for ski equipment, sledges and snowmobiles are organized here, so you don‚Äôt have to take skis and snowboards with you on vacation, and <span>ski tows</span> also work <span>.</span> </p><p>  Base descents have varying difficulty.  There is a separate ski run for beginner athletes and young children, and there are also slopes with a length of three hundred to one and a half thousand meters.  There is a cozy cafe on the territory of Mary, where tourists can enjoy a variety of Caucasian dishes and drink delicious tea infused with mountain herbs.  This camp site carries out such day trips to the pass every weekend. </p><p>  There are also several other travel agencies offering a skiing program that is not aimed at beginners.  With such a trip, skiers can consolidate existing skills and improve their technique, thereby mastering more difficult trails.  In this case, travel agencies offer accommodation at the base for nine days and sightseeing tours of the pass sites. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Those who are fortunate enough to visit the Gumbashi Pass say that these are simply amazing places and they have never seen anything like it in their life.  According to many tourists, this is one of the most beautiful roads throughout Russia. </p><p>  People are struck by the fact that the mountains here are not bare, and on their slopes there are trees that make them seem green and incredibly fluffy.  Desertedly, you will hardly find cars, which creates the feeling of some magical place, lost among alpine meadows.  If you move from the Upper Mary, you can notice an unusual optical illusion. </p><p>  You go and go for half an hour, about thirty kilometers seem to be behind, but all the time it seems that the road goes under a strong slope down.  The mountains around are getting higher and higher to the sky, so the traveler thinks that he is falling down.  When a person begins to worry, at this very time he emerges to the very top of the pass with stunning panoramic views.  Undoubtedly, this must be seen with my own eyes. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  If Moscow is the starting point, it will be possible to get to Kislovodsk by train or fly to the Caucasian Mineral Waters by plane, and from there to the Gumbashi Pass.  How to get to this place will tell any local.  But the best thing is not to make an independent trip there, but to take excursions provided by various travel agencies. </p>

Therefore, at least once in a lifetime it is worth visiting the slopes of Gumbashi.
