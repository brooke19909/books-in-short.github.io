They accommodate guests quickly enough.  The hotel complex is positioning itself on the market as <span>a family-</span> type <span>hotel</span> .  It opened in 2008, and its last reconstruction took place in 2013.  Based on its distance from the sea, it is classified as a 3rd-line hotel.  The distance from it to the beach is about one and a half kilometers.  However, this slight inconvenience is successfully overcome due to well-built logistics.  Hourly vacationers drive to the beach bus. </p>

    <h2>  Territory and architecture of the hotel </h2><p>  The hotel area - 20 thousand m <sup>2</sup> - is quite sufficient for an active family vacation.  There are three (!) Swimming pools for adults and two for children.  Sunbeds enough for everyone at any time of the day.  (Not all hotel complexes can boast of the last circumstance.) From the point of view of architecture, the building of the Maya Melissa Garden 4 * hotel itself is of interest.  Despite the standard wall material - reinforced concrete, the designers have maintained the modern modern style.  The original six-story building with three facades (one of which is the main one) has an individual characteristic exterior.  However, designers have not only worked out the exterior, but also the functionality of the rooms.  And yet, the culmination of its architecture is the main facade.  The original color scheme (decorative <span>frontal plane</span> with emerald tint) individualizes the building and makes it recognizable. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotel rooms </h2>

    <p>  Maya Melissa Garden 4 * hotel offers its guests 210 rooms.  Among them, the most so-called standard (195 rooms).  Their area is approximately 26 m <sup>2</sup> .  The remaining 15 rooms are family, two-room.  Rooms are cleaned daily by hotel staff.  Towels and bed linen are changed twice a week. </p><p>  Standard room with a balcony and a bathroom.  It is furnished with two beds (double and single), a table, several chairs.  From household appliances in the rooms there is a refrigerator, air conditioning, TV.  There is a small kitchen room with the ability to make tea, coffee, warm food.  It also has a small dining table with chairs.  Paid in their room, spa guests use a safe and minibar.  The rooms are quite compact, but not small.  Moreover, the family bathroom is equipped with a jacuzzi. </p><p>  A pleasant moment for guests of the Maya Melissa Garden 4 * hotel is the interior design of their rooms, which is made really professionally.  The rooms are well-repaired and the floor is decorated with a stylish laminate that imitates beech.  Designer furniture.  This is clearly felt in how proportionately it is selected relative to the living space of the hotel rooms. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  By the way, we point out a drawback: hotel guests note the unstable operation of hotel Wi-Fi.  The latter circumstance is associated with a twofold overload of its capacity for servicing users (in fact, 700, instead of the optimal number - 300). </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  How do vacationers qualify the hotel?  Of course, positively.  Holidays in it, indeed, are in demand.  It is significant that there are reviews indicating intentions to come here for the next holiday season.  The quality of the basic resort services provided by the hotel complex is noted.  To summarize the total customer ratings on the Internet.  They boil down to the fact that the Maya Melissa Garden 4 * hotel receives a solid good rating.  Reviews about the quality of the holidays spent in it receive a score of "excellent".  And the resort team, working at the hotel, is a priori awarded with a "diploma with honors". </p><p>  Let's try to tell in more detail about what, in fact, the practice of organizing the rest of holidaymakers is evidenced by such reviews.  The analysis of reviews shows the quality of basic hotel services: a sandy beach, large, equipped with inventory;  sufficient pools for relaxation of all guests;  the food is delicious, but its assortment is clearly smaller than in luxury six-star hotels.  That is, holidaymakers clearly confirm the qualification of a family-type hotel with moderate rates. </p><p>  It is significant that the quality of Maya Melissa Garden 4 * services was not exaggerated on advertising tourist sites.  (Customer reviews indicate that they provide objective information in their advertising.) </p><p>  Staying in a hotel complex is truly healing in nature.  General therapeutic procedures provided by a professional are highly appreciated.  We are talking about a Turkish bath, included (which saves money) in the all incusive system, and about a sauna.  The qualifications of massage therapists are also adequately evaluated.  Resorts respond positively about the really modern Maya Melissa Garden 4 * gym.  Reviews of women are well characterized by the beauty salon available at the hotel. </p><h2>  Beach </h2>

    <p>  The sandy beach of the hotel is really good.  It is quite spacious (its length is 300 meters).  This is the best beach in the vicinity, so vacationers from the nearest five-star hotels also come to it.  However, space and equipment (referring to sun loungers, mattresses, umbrellas) are enough for everyone. </p><p>  Entering the water is convenient even for children, gentle.  First sand, then a strip of pebbles, then sand again.  By the way, on the Maya Melissa <span>Garden Hotel 4 *</span> beach mini-discos are held.  However, at the request of vacationers (it‚Äôs really more convenient), they are transferred to the territory of the hotel itself. </p><p>  The beach can be reached in 5 minutes by a special bus running hourly.  Many vacationers in the evening prefer to walk.  The road takes less than half an hour and passes in the forest zone.  Wonderful pine-eucalyptus air is a kind of bonus for such a walk. </p><p>  There is a bar on the beach.  Drinks for hotel guests - according to the <span>all inclusive</span> system <span>.</span>  From 12-00, food is also sold in the bar (that is, you can have a snack, but for a fee).  However, by this lunch time, most tourists return to the hotel to dine at the restaurant.  And the children, respectively, tend to return because of the Maya Melissa <span>Garden Hotel 4 *</span> slides <span>.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Pools </h2><p>  You must admit that it‚Äôs quite rare in popular hotels that a vacationer, no matter what time he wants to swim in the pool, can always find a free trestle bed.  For this hotel, this is the norm.  Sun beds are arranged in advance and in abundance.  Vacationers in the hotel, therefore, are initially located where they are comfortable and stay in a comfortable environment. </p><p>  Many children spend the whole day in the pool and by the pool and enjoy riding a waterslide.  However, not only children ride on a roller coaster.  At the disposal of adults are two such structures. </p><p>  One of the three adult pools is indoor.  Guests of the hotel have free daily access to the Turkish hammam.  Alternating it with swimming in the Maya Melissa Garden 4 * pool (Belek), they achieve the maximum therapeutic effect. </p><p>  For lovers of physical education, the hotel has a free modern gym. </p><p>  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãoutdoor pools there is a buffet all-inclusive.  From 12-00 you can have a bite to eat in it, and after 16-00 the freshest and wonderful donuts with apricot jam are baked in the buffet.  This dish is popular, especially among children. </p><h2>  Animation </h2>

    <p>  It remains a mystery how the administration of the Maya Melissa Garden 4 * hotel (Turkey) was able to create such a creative team of animators.  Reviews of the hotel almost any vacationer certainly mention with respect to any of the animators!  This cannot be an accident. </p><p>  Thanks to the animators, the measured, calm life of a family hotel acquires new colors and dynamics.  They know all the hotel guests and are constantly in contact with them.  Willingly advise.  Separate animations are held daily for children and adults.  Adult animation takes place in the afternoon (game) and in the evening (hotel guests practically do not miss the last).  The latter is not surprising: in the evening the animators generally ‚Äúgive all the best‚Äù, playing on the territory of Maya Melissa Garden 4 * (Belek) a real show with music and a disco. </p><p>  Children's animation is arranged only in the evening. </p><p>  Unobtrusively, fun and easy, the animators manage to attract vacationers to an active holiday: aerobics, volleyball, water polo.  (The latter is recommended more: volleyball, of course, is interesting, but injures your knees.) Also, animators constantly hold various boring contests. </p><p>  People were not ignored.  Many of them during their holidays seemed to have thrown themselves off from 10-15 years old: they were fond of darts, tennis, backgammon, chess, checkers. </p><p>  Most likely, it would be correct to say that the Maya Melissa Garden 4 * family hotel is famous for its animation. </p><h2>  Catering </h2><p>  Catering at the hotel exceeds the level of four-star hotels in the organization and quality of food preparation.  We will make a reservation right away that here you will not find assorted seafood on the table or cooked meat of seven kinds, as is found in six-star hotels.  Why?  And you compare the price of the six-star tour and the popular four-star tour, and this will immediately put all the missing points over i. </p><p>  The main buffet restaurant is located on the ground floor of the Maya Melissa Garden <span>4 *</span> hotel <span>(Belek</span> Center).  Restaurant "by appointment" - on the sixth.  During the rest, once a hotel guest can use the all inclusive system for dinner in the top restaurant (la carte). </p><p>  Hotel guests have a standard meal time.  Breakfast - from 7 <sup>00</sup> to 11 <sup>30</sup> , lunch - from 13 <sup>00</sup> to 15 <sup>30</sup> , dinner - from 19 <sup>00</sup> to 22 <sup>00</sup> .  In the evening, grilled meat and fish are prepared on the territory by the pools. </p>

    <h2>  Buffet Products </h2><p>  Indeed, the assortment of meat and fish dishes prepared from chicken and turkey, as well as fish such as mackerel and horse mackerel, has 10-12 items.  Also, holidaymakers are treated with soy meat.  A positive point is the presence in the lunch and dinner menu of several types of cheese such as cheese.  By breakfast, guests at the Maya Melissa Garden 4 * hotel (Turkey) have the opportunity to taste various sausages and sausages. </p><p>  Beef for dinner is on Wednesdays when animators start a holiday - hotel day. </p><p>  For breakfast, dairy products are present in the buffet, including milk and kefir.  Appetizing various muesli. </p><p>  As is customary in Turkish cuisine, there are a dozen or two vegetable dishes on the lunch and dinner menu.  The skill of the cooks who cook them should be recognized.  It is worth trying them all. </p><p>  A lot of delicious pastries: all kinds of buns, bagels, cakes, tartlets.  It‚Äôs impossible to try everything.  From sweets, as they say, just eyes run up.  Fruits are also in the assortment: oranges, plums, watermelon, melons, apples. </p><p>  Summing up our modest presentation on nutrition at Maya Melissa Garden 4 B, we note that it is tasty, healthy, nutritious. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2>

    <p>  Of course, having arrived on the land of Turkey, it would be extremely frivolous to spend the whole vacation under an umbrella by the pool, overly carried away by passive rest.  Tourists who think that the opportunity to go to historical relics will be offered at an economical price are deeply mistaken.  It should be noted that interesting, entertaining, exciting excursions come at a price in Turkey.  Moreover, hotel managers who actively offer them from hotels (this is a common practice) openly speculate with them, earning 100% of the actual cost of the excursion on the trust of their guests. </p><p>  Therefore, many tourists from the very beginning plan their budget, sharing the funds that will be paid for the tour, and the money for which tours will be bought.  It is possible to pre-purchase them on the Internet.  You should choose the site of a travel agency serving tourists in the area where the hotel is located, and order for yourself those who are interested. </p><p>  Typically, tourists who are guests of the Star and Crescent Land, plan several excursions to historical relics and (or) natural phenomena.  The rich history of Asia Minor (as Turkey was once called) and its unique nature are indeed of particular interest to travelers. </p><p>  Sometimes nature and history merge here together, as happened in Pamukkale (Cotton Castle).  The cascade of unique travertine snow-white mini-pools is filled with healing mineral water.  It is noteworthy that this ancient object was converted and adapted as a dispensary by the ancient Romans.  They chained a geyser in stone and arranged in the largest pool, named after Cleopatra in terms.  Unfortunately, the earthquake was ruthless to marble columns and porticoes.  However, modern tourists can still take warm mineral baths here and see the fragments of ancient columns. </p><p>  Nature and man-made architecture merged together in Cappadocia, glorious both for its unique rocks and underground churches of the first Christians.  Uniquely preserved Ich-Kale fortress will introduce you to the history of Byzantium. </p><p>  It will be interesting for children to visit the discovery park, water park.  Well, adults will be happy to visit the eastern bazaar of Alanya and the famous jewelry shops. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Maya Melissa Garden 4 * hotel has good potential for further development.  A photo of its main building and pools demonstrates both promising architecture and thoughtful landscape design.  Already today it occupies its niche in the system of the hostel of Antalya.  This is a family-run hotel with economy-class prices and good basic services of a classic class.  Perhaps this explains its popularity and the endless flow of tourists.  The fact that the hotel will continue to expand, possibly due to the construction of cottages, is beyond doubt.  The hotel's beach and its pools today can serve the flow of tourists, one and a half times higher than the one that exists today. </p><p>  The hotel complex has its own know-how in customer service: stunning animation and maintaining a friendly style of communication with spa guests.  The industriousness of staff who keep the building and grounds in perfect condition every day is also respected.  As a wish, I would like to invite the staff of this worthy hotel not to stop there and to further develop their business. </p>
