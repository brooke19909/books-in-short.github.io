    <p>  Many go to China with the goal of improving their health.  Chinese medicine is recognized as one of the best in the world.  You can go through various procedures in the numerous medical centers located near the Baohong Hotel 5 (Hainan).  To save money, you can call your local city hospital and request treatment.  The doctor will come directly to the hotel, put needles, massage and prescribe herbs.  In medical centers, such procedures are several times more expensive. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Sanya is rich in attractions.  However, do not trust all the guides.  Upon arrival, tourists are immediately lured to a sightseeing tour of the island, but it is better to refuse it.  As a rule, they will not show you anything except factories where you spend a lot of money on completely unnecessary goods.  You can explore the city yourself by choosing the desired route.  The hotel can offer several sightseeing tours.  They cost less than if ordered from a tour operator. </p><p>  Vacationers greatly praise the park with the fancy name "The deer turned its head."  This picturesque place is great for those who love beautiful photos.  Trips to various factories, attendance at tea ceremonies and other similar events, as a rule, end with extortion of money.  Such goods can be bought in stores several times cheaper. </p><p>  Be sure to visit the island of monkeys and thermal springs.  It offers vacationers 36 pools with radon waters.  It is believed that thermal springs can heal any disease.  Having been in China, do not miss this opportunity. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the hotel does not have a pool.  But you can visit the spa and beauty center. </p><p>  In the evening, head to the night club.  Similar institutions are famous for the island of Hainan.  Baohong Hotel is located in the heart of city entertainment.  Restaurants, bars, clubs - all within walking distance.  Some establishments can be visited free of charge.  Food and cocktails are relatively cheap.  The restaurants serve huge portions, you can safely order one for two.  By the way, the local food service is adequately adapted for European tourists. </p><h2>  General impressions </h2><p>  The hotel is ideal for active people.  All services are provided at the highest level for a fairly low price.  In the ranking of Sanya hotels, the Sanya Jinjiang Baohong Hotel complex occupies a leading position and is the most popular destination. </p><p>  Among the shortcomings can be noted the lack of a private pool (guests have to use the services of neighboring hotels), a huge number of noisy Chinese and the lack of balconies in some rooms.  An indisputable plus is the location of the hotel in the entertainment center of the city.  Great beach is just 5 minutes walk.  All kinds of health centers are located nearby, for the sake of which many go to Hainan.  The island is built up very quickly.  Every year there are new interesting places to visit, but the Baohong Hotel remains the unchanged leader among hotel complexes in its price category. </p>
