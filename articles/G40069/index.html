This article will tell you how to make a Christmas tree from pasta. </p><h2>  Materials for the manufacture of volumetric figures <strong> </strong></h2><p>  Since you can make a Christmas tree from pasta in several ways, you first need to consider the option of a miniature tree on a stand.  For crafts, you can use smooth “feathers” with an oblique cut, ribbed “feathers”, “bows”, “curls” and even “horns”. </p>

    <p>  You will also need a dense sheet of cardboard, celluloid or plastic, glue and paint.  To make the pasta tree steady on the plane, you will also need a stand for the figure.  It should be heavy enough and with a good diameter, because light support cannot firmly hold a symbolic tree. </p><h2>  DIY color scheme </h2><p>  <span>The New Year,</span> so it has become customary, is considered a childhood holiday.  Although adults are happy to celebrate it.  The belief that miracles in the world have a place lives in every person, regardless of age.  And therefore this holiday is so connected with a fairy tale that people themselves like to turn into wizards and wizards on this day. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Do not limit your imagination by making Christmas decorations, gifts for loved ones, congratulations.  And let all this be creative, unlike everyday reality.  And even a homemade Christmas tree made of pasta can be of various colors.  Traditionally used green paint.

    <p>  As a detail emphasizing stylization, you can use a bright or carved “star” on top of a tree or “top”, which is also made from pasta.  For example, a pasta tree, the photo of which is presented here, is not only made of "bows", painted with blue paint, it is also decorated with "toys". </p><h2>  Tightly spaced twigs </h2><p>  To make the tree beautiful, you should work extremely carefully.  A fluffy beauty is made by gluing pasta “butt” one side by side with the other.  A do-it-yourself Christmas tree made from pasta is best if you arrange them in a checkerboard pattern so that there are no gaps.  After completing this type of work, the figure is painted using a spray can. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If a Christmas tree is made from pasta, the craft will be more creative when using two colors during painting.  For example, taking “feathers” for work, you can “drop” paint of contrasting color inside each part.  You can paint all the details in advance in different colors, then the craft will become even more fabulous and interesting. </p>

    <p>  Start pasting pasta from the bottom edge, gradually rising up.  Difficulty in performing this type of work appears if the master uses not “feathers”, but other types of products that do not have an oblique cut.  After all, here you need to make sure that the angle of inclination of all the "branches" is the same. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  When the tree of <span>pasta</span> has acquired the desired shape, the workpiece is set on a stand.  If it is difficult to find a suitable option, you can even use an ordinary faceted glass, putting it upside down.  It is quite stable, its visible part can be decorated under <span>a tree trunk with</span> brown paper or acrylic paints, and lay a layer of cotton wool around, imitating a snowdrift.  So that the cone with the tree itself does not swing and does not roll on its side, the corners of the bottom can be smeared with plasticine or glue, then the craft will firmly stand where it is placed. </p><p>  After painting the figures, it is dried and, if desired, decorated with garlands of foil or luminous electric flashlights. </p><h2>  Original Christmas tree with balls </h2><p>  You can do the craftsmanship using not only imitation of “twigs” during gluing.  If between the pasta to fix on the "trunk" small Christmas tree decorations or bright fruits, as well as solid berries, such as mountain ash, then the tree will initially look decorated. </p>

    <p>  It should be borne in mind that when using fruit or berries, a Christmas tree made with pasta from one's own hands will last a short time.  After all, "toys" can deteriorate or dry.  But with glued toys, it will last more than one year. </p><h2>  Fancy Pasta </h2><p>  Since the article "Christmas tree made of pasta" does not have to be as naturalistic and close to the real look of a coniferous tree, a wide field of activity is open for the wizard’s imagination.  Using a variety of colors when staining, you can make quite creative products. </p>

    <p>  To do this, you need to take a dense sheet of any material and draw an outline of the spruce on it.  Using the algorithm for performing a three-dimensional figure, the master glues pasta not roundly in a cone, but in rows on a plane. </p><p>  The use of small Christmas toys, coloring the tree in a variety of colors - all of these methods are also appropriate here.  Even a “striped” tree with tinsel in the aisles may very well turn out to be very wonderful. </p><p>  You can perform a Christmas tree not on a sheet, but by cutting a tree along the contour.  If pasta is glued on both sides of the template, and a loop is sewn on top, then such a New Year symbol can be hung on a wall, chandelier or window.  This option is great for decorating wall newspapers.  You can also the technique of making a half-volume Christmas tree for the manufacture of decoration toys. </p><h2>  Christmas tree with decorations near the house - and all of the pasta! </h2><p>  Many people are fond of crafts from this accessible material.  Whatever they make of pasta!  Craftsmen make houses and towers from long spaghetti, wonderful fences are made from noodles.  Wells such as "crane", benches and sheds - everything can be folded from this material, fastening the "logs" with glue or dough.  For ease of manufacture, empty dairy bags and various boxes are successfully used as a frame for buildings.  The master will only need to paste over the surfaces of the frames with "horns" and "feathers", decorate the "cornices" of houses and shops with carvings made again from pasta. </p><p>  If you hide everything around and the stand itself, on which the layout of this creative courtyard is installed, you get a <span>voluminous picture of</span> "Winter Day in the Village".  You can even make a slide for riding children, and put sledges nearby.  And you can also build the fabulous <span>sleigh of Santa Claus,</span> who, I think, just came to visit the owners and present them with their gifts. </p><p>  And in the courtyard near the house, of course, you need to put a beautiful fabulous Christmas tree decorated with the same unusual "pasta" toys.  And it will turn out not just a symbol of the New Year, but a whole landscape in winter.  And how to make a Christmas tree from pasta, which choice to make, depends on the skills of the wizard’s imagination. </p><p>  If you want to make a layout for Christmas, then silver angels will be extremely appropriate here.  It is unlikely that anyone will remain indifferent to a sort of beauty!  And this craft can even be presented as a gift. </p>
