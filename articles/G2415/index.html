    <h2>  Why do customers not submit a statement of income? </h2><p>  Unfortunately, at present, many people when applying for a loan from a bank are faced with the problem of the inability to submit a certificate of income from their place of work.  Or the official income of the client indicated in the certificate is so low that it will not allow him to receive the necessary amount.  This is due to the fact that Russian citizens work more and more informally, and official wages are much less than what the employee actually receives.  Now more and more people get paid in the so-called envelopes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, if you have official employment and can give the bank a statement of income, albeit with low rates, then we advise you to do it.  So you show the bank that your work is official.  If it is impossible to provide a certificate, we recommend that you submit a copy of the work book to the bank, since it is much more difficult to take out a loan without a certificate of income and official employment.  As a rule, up to one hundred thousand rubles are issued to the unemployed; they cannot count on a large amount. </p>

    <h2>  Bank loan </h2><p>  Can I get a loan from a bank without proof of income?  The answer is yes.  Most banks in their list of banking products have loans without income statements.  As a rule, the amount of such loans is small, but the client can spend them as he wishes, since banks do not control the targeted use of borrowed funds. </p><p>  The potential borrower has the maximum chance of getting borrowed funds under such a program if he has an open deposit with the bank that he applied for a loan, or if he had positive cooperation with him in the past on closed loans.  It is not possible to get a loan with bad credit history in banking institutions.  They try to cooperate only with bona fide borrowers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Where can I get a loan without proof of income?  Almost all banks, even state-owned ones, have in their arsenal a similar type of lending.  Your task is to study all the conditions for them and choose the most optimal for you. </p><p>  If the borrower needs a large amount, but also without providing a statement of income, then you can offer the bank collateral in the form of liquid property or a guarantee of third parties.  With the existing collateral, the bank is ready to issue a substantial amount of borrowed funds. </p><h2>  Credit card </h2><p>  Another way to take a loan without guarantors and income statements is to issue a credit card.  Its main advantage is that the bank decides to issue a card based on the information specified by the client in the application.  This means that virtually everyone can count on obtaining such a loan - a student, a pensioner, and any citizen without official employment.  The main thing is that they are suitable for age and have a residence permit in Russia. </p><p>  Consider the disadvantages of this type of lending: </p><ol><li>  Banks usually issue a small amount on the card.  However, if a person has shown his conscientious fulfillment of obligations under it, the bank may decide to increase the limit on the card. </li><li>  Overpriced.  Due to the increased interest rates, the banking institution is trying to reduce the risk of non-repayment by the borrower of credit funds. </li><li>  The presence of a commission for withdrawing cash on the card. </li></ol>

Almost all banking institutions offer a similar banking service.  These include large financial institutions such as Sberbank, Alfabank and VTB24. </p><p>  It is now possible to get a credit card not only at bank branches, but also on their official website, without leaving home.  It is just necessary to fill out the questionnaire online and wait for a decision from the banking specialists.  If the decision is positive, you will receive further instructions from the specialists for obtaining the treasured card. </p><p>  Among citizens of the Russian Federation, credit cards from Tinkoff Bank are especially popular.  The decision on extradition is made by the bank in a very short time - literally in a couple of minutes.  You can receive money on the card in the amount of up to three hundred thousand rubles, while there is a fee for servicing the card and a commission for withdrawing cash about three percent of the amount received in cash. </p><p>  The second most popular card is from Renaissance Credit Bank.  The application here is considered within fifteen minutes, the maximum amount that can be spent is also three hundred thousand rubles.  There is also a cashing fee and an annual card maintenance fee.  The interest rate on it is up to 40% per annum, but an interest-free period for using money is provided. </p>

    <p>  In addition to the products reviewed by the above banks, there are also institutions that, although less popular with the residents of Russia, still often turn to them: </p><ul><li>  "Russian standard"; </li><li>  MDM Bank; </li><li>  Bank "Vanguard"; </li><li>  Alfa Bank and others. </li></ul><h2>  Microloans </h2><p>  You can get a loan without income statement in microfinance organizations.  As a rule, only a passport is needed to apply for it, in rare cases, you may need another document, for example, a driver‚Äôs license.  You should not count on a large amount here.  In addition, such organizations set rather tight deadlines for debt repayment and simply huge interest rates. </p><h2>  Private loans </h2><p>  Another way to get a loan without income statement is to get a loan from a private person.  What are the conditions of this lender?  The same as microfinance organizations - a small amount, short maturities and predatory interest rates.  In addition, there is a danger of running into scammers, for whom people with financial problems are excellent ‚Äúbooty‚Äù. </p><p>  In this regard, approach the choice of a private loan with particular seriousness.  To begin with, it will be good if you talk in relevant forums with people who have already used these services, and their cooperation with private lenders has been successful. </p>

    <p>  Please note that real lenders will not require any payment until the conclusion of the loan agreement and receipt of borrowed funds.  If you are faced with a situation in which the lender asks you to pay in advance a month in advance in order to verify your decency and solvency, then do not hesitate, you are dealing with a fraudster. </p><p>  We recommend that you show it to your lawyer before signing a loan agreement in order to avoid misunderstandings in the future.  It will be better if the signing of the contract and the transfer of money will occur in the presence of a notary. </p><h2>  Credit in the store </h2><p>  To be precise, the store can only provide by installments, since it does not have a license to carry out credit operations.  If you want to buy household or digital appliances, but there is not enough money, then you do not have to apply to the bank for a loan.  Today, many stores can offer their customers installments.  To apply for installments, you only need a passport. </p><h2>  Important </h2><p>  Remember, never fake an income statement or work record.  Because <span>the bank security service</span> will reveal your fraud easily.  They have the opportunity to make a request to the tax service, which will provide all the information about your contributions to the budget. </p>
