    <p>  <em>Service.</em>  Despite the limited list of services, the vast majority of vacationers were satisfied with the service.  The rooms are clean, clean linen, helpful staff. <br></p><p>  <em>The atmosphere of the hotel.</em>  The furniture in the rooms (judging by the reviews) is not of the highest quality - among the shortcomings were the lack of a door on the cabinets, a shower pouring in half the rooms, insufficient pressure of water at one time or another. <br></p><p>  <em>Nutrition.</em>  Despite the low cost of food, tourists are satisfied with the cuisine.  According to reviews of Agonda Holiday Home 2, there are French, Indian and other restaurants in the area. <br></p><p>  <em>The beach</em> .  The beach is just what hundreds of tourists come here every year.  According to reviews, a beach holiday is special.  The water is clean, the beach is sandy.  The only thing worth paying attention to is the strong current, so you should not sail long distances from the coast. </p><p>  Who can I recommend a hotel in India Agonda Holiday Home 2 in South Goa?  First of all, it is suitable for those who appreciate a quiet secluded vacation in picturesque places.  Fans of beach vacations will not remain indifferent - the sea and sand here are first-class.
