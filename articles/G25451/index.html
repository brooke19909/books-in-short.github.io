How to collect "Fifteen"?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Developing logic games are not only relaxation and entertainment.  Puzzles are aimed at the <span>development of logical thinking.</span>  There are a huge number of educational board and computer games.  Among the well-known and popular can be called an ageless puzzle called "Fifteen." </p><h2>  Game History </h2><p>  At first glance, a simple puzzle has a rich history that dates back to the distant one thousand eight hundred and seventy-fourth year.  Its creator was American Noah Palmer Chapman.  An ordinary postmaster, who lived in a small town in New York State, came up with a puzzle consisting of sixteen square numbers.  All the squares needed to be arranged in four in a row. </p>

    <p>  In this case, the sum of the numbers in each of them should have been thirty-four.  The son of the postmaster Frank Chapman improved the game and changed its rules.  The puzzle quickly gained popularity around the world, retaining it to this day. </p><h2>  Rules of the game </h2><p>  A fascinating and rather complex <span>logical task</span> will be interesting for both children and adults.  Fifteen is a board game consisting of a square box filled with a set of chips. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to assemble tag patterns" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11768/431913.jpg" width="400"></div>  They are numbered from one to fifteen and are arranged in a box in random order.  This leaves space for their movement.  The task of the whole game is to get a consecutive <span>series of numbers</span> by moving the chips <span>.</span>  They should line up in numbers in ascending order.  At first glance, it is easy and simple.  But one should not rush to conclusions.  This task is not so simple as it seems at first glance.  In some cases, it has no solution.

"Fifteen" 2x2 perfectly help to capture the essence of the game.  This version provides a square box in which there are three chips with numbers from one to three.  On the playing field they are placed in random order.  They should be ordered by arranging in a row: 1, 2, 3. In order to solve the puzzle, you should not randomly move the chips.  It is necessary to logically calculate how to assemble the "Fifteen". </p><p>  The scheme of the playing field consists of four positions.  Three of them are occupied by chips.  The fourth is empty, it is designed to be moved.  At the end of the game, the top positions are occupied by the numbers 1 and 2. In the bottom row is the three.  We start the game.  Suppose, in our simple version, the top row has a triple and a unit.  And under the three from the bottom there is a deuce, to the right of which there is a reserve space for moving.  We shift it to an empty place.  The three drops down to the vacant seat.  Next, the unit moves to the left corner.  Behind her, the deuce moves up. </p><p>  As a result of simple actions, the puzzle is solved.  We complicate the task a bit.  In option 3x3 how to collect "Fifteen? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to collect tag instruction" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11768/432015.jpg" width="600"></div>  The diagram shows the sequence of moves.  Now we can move on to the more complex version of Fifteen.

We complicate the task somewhat.  Let's try to figure out how to assemble 4x4 Fifteen.  This classic version of the game has a box in which there are fifteen chips with numbers from one to fifteen.  There is also a reserve blank space for moving them.  The principle of solving the puzzle is the same as in the simple version.  All numbers are arranged in random order.  It is necessary to arrange them in ascending order of number. </p><h2>  Description of the game.  Chips move order </h2><p>  Let's try to imagine how to collect "Fifteen".  The <span>logic puzzle</span> scheme consists in the sequential movement of chips.  Suppose that the numbers on the playing field are in the following order: </p><ul><li>  1st line - 8, 15, 2, 11; </li><li>  2nd line - 4, backup space, 10, 9; </li><li>  3rd line - 12, 5, 1, 6; </li><li>  4th line - 3, 14, 7, 13. </li></ul><p>  First, collect the first row of numbers from one to four at the top of the box.  It is not difficult to build it.  After several moves of the chips, the playing field has the following form: </p><ul><li>  1st line - 1, 2, 3, 11; </li><li>  2nd line - 15, 10, reserve place, 4; </li><li>  3rd line - 5, 8, 6, 9; </li><li>  4th line - 14, 12, 7, 13. </li></ul><p>  In order to set the four in the right place, we shift the ten and fifteen clockwise by one position.  Next, all the numbers of the first row counterclockwise.  Move the unit down.  And the rest of the chips are shifted one position to the left.  Now lower the chip at number eleven down.  And we build the numbers of the first row in the correct sequence.  In a similar way, we restore the second row. </p><p>  To do this, all the main movements occur in the third row.  After restoring the correct sequence of the second row, the playing field will have the following form: </p><ul><li>  1st line - 1, 2, 3, 4; </li><li>  2nd line - 5, 6, 7, 8; </li><li>  3rd line - reserve cell, 14, 10, 11; </li><li>  4th line - 12, 15, 13, 9. </li></ul><p>  There is very little left to complete the puzzle.  We proceed to the arrangement of chips in the third row.  For this, first of all, the starting numbers of the last two rows are moved to their places.  Chips 9 and 13 are fixed and no longer moved.  This position has the following form: </p><ul><li>  1st line - 1, 2, 3, 4; </li><li>  2nd line - 5, 6, 7, 8; </li><li>  3rd line - 9, reserve space, 15, 11; </li><li>  4th line - 13, 14, 12, 10. </li></ul><p>  On the playing field there are six cells in which five chips are placed.  In order to restore the correct order of numbers, it is necessary that numbers 12 and 15 take their places.  This can be achieved by several movements.  After that, the correct combination of numbers will be achieved. </p>

    <p>  After losing this logic diagram, you will get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow to assemble the "Fifteen".  The game sequence instruction can be used for a wide variety of digital combinations.  The principle of arrangement and movement of numbers is preserved. </p><h2>  Analogs of digital "Fifteen" </h2><p>  A fun logical game based on moving chips with numbers that are arranged in a certain sequence.  Based on the principles of this game, no less entertaining puzzles have been created in which numbers are replaced by drawings.  The picture is cut into separate fragments.  The goal of such a logical game is to assemble the original image into a single whole.  Unlike the Digital Fifteen, it always has a solution. </p>
