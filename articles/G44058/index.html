But if before professionals were mainly involved in providing musical accompaniment outdoors, today this direction is fully accessible to ordinary enthusiasts.  And this is not about compact mobile speakers for individual listening, but about full-fledged speakers.  However, full-length street acoustics do not exclude the ideas of minimalism, facilitating the processes of physical handling of the structure. </p>

    <h2>  Features of street acoustics </h2><p>  Features all-weather audio systems due to the conditions of their use.  They are used outdoors - it can be platforms, garden plots, parks, house adjoining territories, recreation areas, etc. Accordingly, the music column for the street must have appropriate protection against possible damage, and universal fastening means that will allow you to securely fix construction without reliable supports. </p><p>  The developers pay most attention to the protective qualities, focusing on the IP security index.  Its value reflects the class of protection of the device from certain influences.  For example, IP54 indicates that the column can counteract moisture, dirt, dust, and even small physical impacts.  At the same time, acoustics for outdoor events are mainly produced in compact cases.  To maintain an optimum level of strength, engineers use composite materials with integrated <span>swivel brackets.</span>  This decision, however, is associated not only with the desire to improve the safety of the speakers, but also with ergonomic considerations.  The composite is a lightweight material that facilitates the transportation of the kit, for example, from home to the park area. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Main characteristics </h2><p>  The emphasis in such models is on wide coverage by sound waves, so the developers are trying to make the ‚Äústuffing‚Äù more powerful.  However, this does not negate the relevance of low-power speakers - the general range of power potential can be represented in the range of 10-400 watts.  Rarely all-weather outdoor speakers do without an amplifier.  Typically, low impedance devices of 8-16 ohms are used.  As for the frequency range, the lower level is in the range of 60-70 Hz, and the upper one can reach 30,000 Hz.  In terms of size, the standard for the speakers is the format of 3.5 or 6.5 inches.  Of course, there are deviations from this size, which demonstrate 0.75-inch tweeters and large-format blocks of 10-12 inches. </p>

    <h2>  Varieties of systems </h2><p>  Basically, all-weather acoustics vary in form factor.  There are many variations on the performance of such equipment on the market.  Conventionally, all representatives of the segment can be divided into three groups - portable models, full-fledged classic speakers and horn street systems.  Portable speakers practically do not require creating special conditions in terms of installation - a small device can simply be put on the lawn and enjoy sound in a tight circle.  Full-format street acoustics is a set of speakers and a subwoofer that can provide the atmosphere of a concert venue.  This option is suitable for parties and celebrations in the open air and with a large number of participants.  Horn systems and loudspeakers in their performance and technical capabilities are similar to previous acoustics, but have structural features.  Firstly, the optimized design allows you to more efficiently disperse sound waves in open space, and secondly, such systems have more opportunities for reliable installation on the street. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Landscape Speakers </h2><p>  In a sense, such systems can relate to street all-weather speakers, but they have several fundamental features.  Firstly, such devices are called landscape for the reason that their design and external stylistic performance are organically included in the garden composition.  That is, in fact, this is an object of garden design, only with acoustic filling.  Secondly, it so happened that a music column for a landscape-type street provides higher sound quality.  Although the bulk of the kits are carried out according to the same principles as standard Hi-Fi speakers, manufacturers are trying to endow them with high-quality components.  Otherwise, such systems are fully consistent with all-weather models, this applies to protective qualities and ergonomic devices. </p>

    <h2>  All-Terrain Model </h2><p>  One of the options for a very successful portable street acoustics, which organically combines lightness, compactness and security.  This option will not work if you plan to arrange a quiet evening event in the gazebo.  The developers of All-Terrain oriented the system to operation in harsh conditions away from home, where there is a risk of falling under heavy rain, getting dirty in the mud and at the same time hitting the case.  Especially for such cases, a waterproof coating and reliable fastening mechanisms are provided for a backpack and a bicycle.  There is also a Bluetooth module that allows you to stream music from a remote source wirelessly.  But unfortunately, this street active acoustics is designed for only one listener.  For a campaign in the company you have to take something more serious.  The small size of the device caused serious limitations on power, so All-Terrain should be considered as a personal device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Model Bose Free Space 51 </h2><p>  This solution can be called if not the most, then one of the most practical from the point of view of street use.  It should be noted right away that the system has a rather extravagant appearance.  Designers sought to bring the style of equipment closer to the garden setting, but they overdid it, which is why a set of many scares off their appearance.  The speakers look utilitarian, boring and even depressing. </p>

    <p>  But this set is not intended for the function of garden decoration.  Its components can be hidden right in the ground, which contributes to the design.  The main advantages of the system are manifested in operational qualities.  In practice, the Bose outdoor speaker system shows a balanced 360-degree sound distribution around the circumference.  The speaker optimally copes with both bass and soft midrange processing. </p><h2>  Models from JBL </h2><p>  JBL is famous for its portable speakers, but it is difficult to attribute them to a full-fledged all-weather solution.  Those who want to provide the local area with a high-quality sound source should take a closer look at the loudspeaker family.  In particular, CSS-H15 and H30 modifications are positioned precisely as all-weather horns.  They are distinguished by a wide coverage area and a high class of external protection.  To this it is worth adding that the all-weather acoustics JBL CSS is made of high-strength plastic, and stainless brackets are provided for fastening in the kit. </p>

    <p>  The power of the device is modest (25-30 W), but it will be enough to service a small personal plot.  The kit also includes a transformer, thanks to which you can protect the speaker from network fluctuations. </p><h2>  Model Polk Atrium </h2><p>  When considering this system, it is worth immediately separating two evaluation parameters - for the appearance and sound quality.  As for the first quality, it can be expressed as a characteristic of stealth, and this is very important for street acoustics.  Two compact 3.5-inch speakers and an inch speaker are responsible for the sound.  This configuration allows you to provide sound, both small and large areas, depending on the location.  But that is not all.  The speakers are complemented by a 10-inch subwoofer, which in turn is disguised as a flower pot.  That is, this is clearly street acoustics with a hint of landscape design.  And if the two speakers quite well provide high and medium frequencies, then a subwoofer with 200 watts of bass can cover large spaces with low and deep sound.  Among the features of this complex is the fact that the system uses the earth's surface as a conductor, transmitting acoustic sound through mini-vibrations. </p>

    <h2>  Acoustic Location </h2><p>  According to experts, the most beneficial stereo effect will be achieved if the speakers are located near the house.  The optimal relative positioning of the speakers implies maintaining a distance of 3-4 m. Usually in open areas, a feeling of unlimited sound coverage is created, which is why users tend to move the speakers apart.  But in this case, street acoustics will not add either to power or to sound purity, since with a large distance only one of the channels will be perceived. </p><p>  Not bad from the point of view of sound quality and a very practical solution may be to install speakers under the eaves.  In this case, it will be possible to reliably protect the structure from direct exposure to precipitation.  In addition, in this position, all-weather outdoor acoustics can remain stationary without regular and troublesome uninstallation. </p><h2>  Connection Nuances </h2><p>  It is recommended to use installation two-wire or four-wire wires, which contain lines for the left and right channels.  For a distance of up to 25 m, it is worth using a 16-gauge cable, and it is advisable to serve a 60-meter span with a 14-gauge circuit.  Next, the issue with the gasket is solved.  Many people use underground lines for this, but this option has serious disadvantages - from damage by rodents to an accidental cut of the cable with a shovel.  Therefore, it is better to use an external open gasket with high-quality wire protection.  It will also be useful if street <span>active speakers</span> are supplemented with an amplifier.  For example, a 70-volt model can support several speakers at once. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Even organizing a indoor music program often brings a lot of trouble, let alone preparing for similar events outside the home.  Proper selection of a suitable system in accordance with specific needs will initially remove a lot of problems.  For example, all-weather acoustics JBL is quite suitable as a variant of a stationary horn sound source in one permanent place near the house.  Atrium modification should be used both as an element of landscape design, and as good musical equipment on the site.  And if you need a universal hiking option, then the All-Terrain model will pay off. </p>
