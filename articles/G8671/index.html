    <h2>  History of creation </h2><p>  Metro station "Ul.  Podbelsky ‚Äùwas built relatively recently - in 1990, at the turn of the collapse of the Soviet Union and the division of the Union republics into separate, independent states.  However, even in the face of economic problems and financial shortages, the Moscow Metro continued to develop and expand in order to meet the needs of the growing metropolis in transport links between residential areas and the historic center. </p><p>  The opening took place on August 1, 1990.  On the same day, another station was solemnly opened - Cherkizovskaya, which is located next to the Ul.  Podbelsky. "  These two stations took on huge passenger traffic, since this area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city suffered from a shortage of public transport for a long time.  Since then, the metro station "Ul.  Podbelsky ‚Äù, and now‚Äú Rokossovsky Boulevard ‚Äùregularly carries passengers to work and home. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Architecture </h2><p>  The external and internal decoration of the station is quite modest compared to many other metro stations, which the city of Moscow has.  "St.  Podbelsky ‚Äùis decorated with white marble and dark granite.  There are no busts or monuments at the station.  She is quite strict and ascetic in design decisions.  The track walls are decorated with a geometric pattern of <span>metal stripes.</span> </p><p>  Two vestibules are open at the station - north and south.  More than 50,000 people use it daily. </p><p>  This station is shallow - the depth is only 8 meters.  The construction was carried out according to a standard project, and precast concrete was taken as the basis. </p><p>  On the platform are two rows of 26 columns.  They give the rather strict decoration of the station so much harmony and orderliness. </p>

    <h2>  Name history </h2><p>  The station was named after the prominent statesman and party leader Vadim Podbelsky, who at the beginning of the 20th century worked as the People's Commissar of Posts and Telegraphs of the RSFSR, and subsequently oversaw the construction of the <span>Shukhov Tower</span> on Shabolovka.  Near the station was located the same street.  Podbelsky, however, just two years after its opening, the street was renamed Ivanteyevskaya, and the geographical location of the name was lost. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the process of city development, at different times, projects appeared to rename the station: "North-East", "Ivanteevskaya" - but not one of them was accepted.  In the second decade of the 21st century, the question arose again about the new name of the station, which would more closely correspond to its new environment.  And <span>on July 8,</span> 2014 the station "st.  Podbelsky ‚Äùcontinued its work under a new name -‚Äú Rokossovsky Boulevard ‚Äù.  The boulevard of the same name, however, is located quite far from the lobby - about 500 meters.  This fact caused some criticism, since there were other variants of names that were rejected by a special commission. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Podbelsky Street" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39080/1204164.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Infrastructure around the station </h2><p>  Quite extensive infrastructure is established in the metro area "st.  Podbelsky. "  There are hotels and hostels here, although they are few.  Basically, they are closer to the ring stations.  But if you need to settle in this area, then such opportunities exist.  For example, you can comfortably get into the Hotel Hospitable House or the Usadba Hotel, which are located near this metro station.  The closest hostel is Cozy House. </p><p>  <span>Izmailovsky Park</span> is located in comparative proximity <span>,</span> in which locals like to walk.  A little further are the All-Russian Exhibition Center (VVC) and the <span>Ostankino TV tower.</span> </p><p>  A football stadium Lokomotiv was built near this point. </p><p>  Half a kilometer from the metro station is the picturesque Marshal Rokossovsky Boulevard, where a monument is erected for him, and modern artists created graffiti with a portrait of the marshal on the front wall of the house 27/20. </p><p>  Not far on the street  Fighting is located quite young, but promising "Theater 31", where you can see the game of talented actors in the original productions. </p><p>  Connoisseurs of the cultural life of the capital are well acquainted with the Harlequin Theater under the direction of Sergei Melkonyan.  For more than 40 years, this theater has been pleasing its viewers with a wonderful game and a wonderful selection of repertoire. </p><p>  As in any <span>sleeping area,</span> there are many small grocery stores, several shopping centers, as well as enterprises providing services to the population: beauty salons, cafes, bars, restaurants and entertainment centers. </p>

    <h2>  Current state </h2><p>  In addition to replacing the name, no more large-scale restoration or design work was done to change the appearance of the station.  It remains a fairly simple, functional station, the main task of which was and is to connect the peripheral areas of the capital with other parts of the city.  However, it is worth noting that she copes with her role remarkably.  Metro management monitors its general condition and appearance.  Since it was built not so long ago, the outer cladding has not yet had time to become so old or out of order that it took work to eliminate the shortcomings. </p><h2>  Development prospects </h2><p>  When designing the station "Ul.  Podbelsky ‚Äùit was assumed that in the foreseeable future it will become part of the Big Ring Line connecting the end stations of the metro lines.  But later it was decided to abandon this plan.  Despite this, the ever-growing city still requires the creation of new interchange hubs, but the Rokossovsky Boulevard metro station is not included in these plans.  Nevertheless, the station plays a large role in the work and development of the Eastern administrative district of the capital. </p>
