  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sales tax</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sales tax involves a type of taxation in which collection is made directly from consumers through the price of the goods.  Calculation of the amount of tax is carried out using the interest rate on the cost of the proposed goods or services.  Of course, as with any rule, there are exceptions, and in the aggregate of all manufactured products there is a special list that is not subject to sales tax. </p><p>  The current legislation of the country clearly establishes the rules for its accrual.  Two possible options are distinguished: either the sales tax is included in the price of the goods directly by its manufacturer before distribution through the distribution channels, or collection is made at the place of sale of the products, directly by the seller.  But, in any case, the consumer pays it to the manufacturer, and the latter, in turn, is obliged to transfer the required amount to the appropriate budget fund. </p><p>  If a third party participates in the purchase and sale transaction, that is, the buyer is not the final consumer, but purchases the goods for the purpose of their further sale on favorable terms for themselves, it is necessary to provide a so-called resale certificate.  It enables the buyer not to pay sales tax, and subsequently include it in the cost of purchased products. </p><p>  At the same time, according to legislative norms, a payer is a legal entity, that is, enterprises, organizations and institutions, as well as their branch branches.  <span>The tax rate is</span> determined solely by authorized state bodies and is legally fixed.  As a rule, the maximum <span>interest rate</span> can reach 5%. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The object subject to taxation is understood as the totality of goods released, services rendered, work performed.  Settlement can be done using cash, as well as in non-cash form through the distribution of credit cards and payment tools such as a check, payment order, etc.  When carrying out barter transactions, that is, when one product can be exchanged for another in equivalent, this tax is taken into account. </p><p>  If we talk about income derived from real estate transactions, then in this case, the interest rate and accrual rules are slightly different.  The tax on the sale of property implies the existence of certain benefits for persons selling their own real estate for the first time, since they are completely exempt from payments.  But in the subsequent transaction of the sale of property, the payer must provide the state with full tax deductions.  If the cost, for example of an apartment, is not more than one million rubles, then the tax is also not levied. </p><p>  If the payer is interested in the question, what <span>tax on the sale of the apartment</span> he will have to pay, then the cost of the property should be estimated.  This is because the rate is differentiated, which means that it depends on the amount of income received.  There is such a thing as a <span>tax deduction.</span>  If the cost of housing does not exceed two million rubles, the taxpayer has the right to receive a deduction from the amount of tax paid.  As a rule, the deduction is calculated based on a 13% rate.  The right to receive it is granted to the payer only once. </p><p>  Despite the quite tangible flow of funds to the budget, sales tax is replaced <span>by value added tax.</span>  Over 140 countries of the world community have already made such a decision.  Nevertheless, the Americans in this regard remained conservatives and still apply the sales tax.  Most economists argue that this position is irrational, as it does not have a positive effect on the economy. </p>
