A vivid example of such a policy is the Akenori 1080X registrar.  A more modest past version with the prefix Pro was liked by many motorists, but we will see how things are with the new Japanese brand. </p>

    <p>  So, the subject of today's review - Akenori 1080 X - a recorder with navigation, camera detection system, 6-lens optics and much more.  We will understand what is a good or bad model, taking into account the opinions of specialists in this field and the reviews of the owners of the gadget. </p><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  The Akenori 1080X recorder is packed in a nice box made of cardboard.  On the front side of the package you can see the image of the device itself and its most remarkable characteristics.  The description of the Akenori 1080 X on the front and end parts looks more than detailed, so there should be no problems when analyzing the device in stores.  That is, the information is enough to make a meaningful purchase.  Despite the Japanese origin (development of the gadget), the inscription "Made in China" (assembly) is flaunted on the box. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Inside you will see: </p><ul><li>  the device itself Akenori 1080 X; </li><li>  instruction manual and warranty card; </li><li>  charger for a regular cigarette lighter; </li><li>  external SD card for 16 GB; </li><li>  a couple of 3M stickers; </li><li>  software disc. </li></ul><p>  We should also mention a competent manual and a spacious memory card.  Judging by the reviews of the owners on the Akenori 1080 X, a good half of users found the instructions understandable, and most importantly - useful, that is, not for show, as is the case with other similar devices.  The volume of the SD card is enough to store data, so there‚Äôs no need to additionally buy another media. </p><h2>  Installation </h2><p>  Mounting the gadget is very simple: we fix it on the windshield and connect the power from the cigarette lighter.  Any motorist will deal with this.  Judging by the reviews on the Akenori 1080 X, the owners were especially pleased with the long three-meter cable for installation.  It can be easily carried along the glass perimeter and brought out somewhere in the glove compartment. </p>

    <p>  The mounting bracket itself, as it were, is built into the body and is a rocker with two clamps, so the adjustment here is provided only in the "up and down" position.  If such installation does not suit you, then you can separately buy the more familiar version on a vacuum suction cup, since such holders are completely universal.  The gadget is removed from the bracket almost instantly with a flick of the wrist, and only the holder remains on the glass. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The dimensions of the device are quite impressive for this kind of technology - 9.5x6.3x6 mm.  Some hidden installations are not provided, that is, it is understood that the driver will use the recorder constantly. </p><p>  The body material has both a glossy and matte structure.  Moreover, the inserts are made quite competently: where the user touches with his fingers - a matte finish, and the deaf parts are glossy.  The design is not overloaded with an abundance of functional elements: the mini-USB and mini-HDMI ports are on the right, and the shutdown button is located on the right, which overlaps the SD card tray when the device is turned on. </p>

    <p>  The front part turned out to be very pretty and stylish.  The original camera eye and the accompanying design of the lens inspire respect and do not give something ordinary.  Below you can see the speaker grill and a slot for the microphone.  In general, with regard to appearance, users leave completely positive comments in their reviews: beautiful, ergonomic and tasteful. </p><h2>  Control </h2><p>  Akenori 1080X has only four functional controls.  The buttons are located below the screen and have clear contextual prompts, so you can deal with them even without the help of the operating instructions. </p><p>  Between the buttons and the screen there is an LED indicator that indicates the shooting (red) or the absence thereof (green).  This is a fairly competent decision, because considering a small icon on the display is not always convenient, but here we have a separate element. </p><p>  As for the branches of the menu and the interface as a whole, everything is fine here: intuitive transitions, large letters and without any wilds. </p><h2>  Video </h2><p>  The 1.3-inch Akenori 1080X sensor has a resolution of 3.5 megapixels and very good viewing angles (130‚Å∞).  The Ambarella processor of the A5S series and six enlightened lenses from the Pentax complement it, which means there will be no problems with high-quality recording, regardless of weather conditions or time of day. </p>

    <p>  Field tests have shown that the quality of the footage is at the proper height: the numbers of the cars in front read quietly at a distance of 10 meters and no artifacts were noticed.  Night shooting does not have such rosy indicators, but there were also no critical flaws like noise and "stars" from the side lights.  Judging by user reviews, the only fly in the ointment is white balance, where the image gives off a little yellowness. </p><h2>  GPS </h2><p>  Maps for the navigator are updated by Navteq, which is one of the controlled structures of the Nokia brand.  The list includes Russia, Ukraine and the Baltic states.  For some reason Belarus was ignored, to which a good half of users who have to be in those places reacted far from flattering reviews. </p><p>  The gadget does not have a detector, so the GPS navigator focuses on updating the databases, where speed control systems are displayed to warn the driver about cameras and radars.  You can also configure the "tweeter", which will help keep the desired speed threshold and not violate traffic rules. </p><h2>  FCWS and LDWS </h2><p>  The first system (Front Collision Warning Systems) warns the driver about maintaining a distance.  It is extremely useful in traffic jams and in front of traffic lights (change from green to yellow).  A sharp drop in speed of the vehicle in front and a reduction in distance will be immediately noticed, and the driver will receive an appropriate signal. </p>

    <p>  The system performed well at speeds above 60 km / h, but with a lower threshold there are frequent false alarms.  Therefore, on highways and in the usual city traffic, the function will become an indispensable assistant to prevent accidents.  Heavy rain and heavy snowfall reduce the efficiency of the system, but not by much (more false positives). </p><p>  Lane departure warning system (LDWS) helps the driver navigate the markings, that is, a collision with a lane or a shift of a car in an adjacent row will be noticed by the registrar with the corresponding signal.  Falling asleep behind the wheel and finding yourself in a cuvette is more than a real threat to the driver, and this system just copes with this. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  Model Akenori 1080X is called a portable integrated security system for vehicles.  Which, in principle, we observe in this review.  It will greatly simplify the life of the driver and warn him against most of the dangers on the road. </p><p>  He pays for his price, and this is about 7000 rubles, with interest.  The gadget does not have any critical problems, and user reviews on the trading floors are mostly positive.  In its price segment - this is one of the best options, so the device can be recommended to anyone. </p>
