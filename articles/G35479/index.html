This model is quite popular among average buyers.  Many people think that this phone is not very good.  But only in practice everything turns out wrong.  In most cases, everyone is happy with the capabilities of the smartphone.  And, of course, such buyers leave positive reviews about Explay X Tremer.  But why?  Each smartphone has its pros and cons, disadvantages and advantages.  And to understand this issue, we will help you with the characteristics of the device.  Let us begin as soon as possible with you to study our today's question. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="explay x tremer" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/972209.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Weight and dimensions </h2><p>  The first important characteristic is the size of the device.  And, of course, its weight.  Smartphone Explay X Tremer has not the highest performance in this regard.  But to call this phone compact is difficult.  Especially when you consider the thickness of the device. </p><p>  The thing is that our current model is 114 millimeters long, 74.4 wide and 1 centimeter thick.  This device cannot be called thin.  And this affects the popularity of <span>Explay X</span> Tremer.  In addition, the smartphone weighs quite a lot - as much as 153 grams.  Yes, there are lighter models, but now there are very few of them.  However, this does not interfere with the comfortable use of the phone during work or conversation.  For example, it will be convenient to hold it even for a child (or a girl with small hands). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Next, pay attention to the display of the device.  It plays an important role.  Especially if you plan to actively use the Explay X Tremer smartphone outdoors in any weather.  For example, one of the advantages of the model is the rather large display size (5 inches diagonally).  This is enough to comfortably play and surf the Internet.  Reading and watching movies on such a screen is also nice. </p><p>  In addition, the display is protected by a special glass.  It does not allow you to quickly scratch and beat.  Plus, the color rendering of the device is at its best - it is able to show 16 million colors.  Resolution is at a decent level - 1280 by 720 pixels.  The average for this kind of phone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="explay x tremer specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/972208.jpg"></div>

          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <p></p>
    <p>  We must not forget that even in sunny weather the image on the Explay X Tremer display will be the best.  All this thanks to the new technologies that were used to create the device.  In the rain you can not be afraid of moisture.  Of course, substituting a screen for rain is not worth it.  But the <span>protective glass</span> for some time protects the display from moisture.  Just wipe it with a cloth and all problems will be resolved. </p><h2>  System </h2><p>  It is also worth paying attention to such an item as the operating system.  Many users are ready to abandon the newest smartphone if this moment is overlooked.  I don‚Äôt really want to suffer later with updating or reinstalling / flashing.  Fortunately, in this regard, Explay X Tremer gets far from the worst reviews. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After all, the operating system here is quite new, but known and familiar to everyone.  It's about Android.  In our case, it will be possible to use version 4.2 of the "Jelly Bean" assembly.  A fairly functional system that allows you to configure the phone in almost all plans.  It is very convenient.  Plus, you don‚Äôt have to look for settings for the Explay X Tremer Motiv.  They will be initially installed so as to ensure maximum system performance.  It pleases many buyers. </p><p>  In addition, for the version of "Android 4.2" there are many different interesting games and applications.  So, you will not have problems with mobile content.  If necessary, you can easily and simply update the system to the latest version.  But it‚Äôs best to limit yourself to Android 4.4. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="explay x tremer battery" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/972207.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  CPU </h2><p>  The processor is also a pretty important part.  He is responsible to a greater extent for the operability of the phone.  Fortunately, Explay X Tremer gets pretty good reviews in this regard.  The processor in the model is quad-core.  And with a clock frequency of 1.2 GHz.  For a gaming smartphone is not enough.  But if you take into account the version of the operating system, then everything is within reason. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Yes, recently 4-core processors began to become obsolete.  And they do not do very well with their tasks.  But not at the "Explay".  This smartphone has excellent quality and power.  Just what all modern owners need.  With this processor, you can run quite a lot of new games and applications.  But just not very much.  At the same time you can "activate" about 3 windows.  This is due to the fact that the system will not be harmed.  More precisely, its performance and speed. </p><h2>  RAM </h2><p>  The next point that should not be overlooked is RAM.  She is also responsible for the speed of the phone.  And in our case, it is not so much.  But for the characteristics of the smartphone, the Explay X Tremer is more than enough.  RAM here is only 1 GB.  If we compare this indicator with analogues, then smartphones with 2-3 GB are considered more popular and successful.  Sometimes you can even find models with 4 gigabytes of memory. </p><p>  Nevertheless, as many buyers assure, this amount is enough for the normal operation of the device.  The phone responds to commands quickly, it loads, too.  In addition, running games on such a smartphone is also possible.  Especially if you decide not to update the operating system.  So, do not abandon the model, seeing only 1 GB of RAM.  Remember that this is not a real gaming smartphone.  If you want to find an entertainment device for the sake of it, it would be better to look at another model.  There are a lot of options now. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone explay x tremer" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/972206.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Built place </h2><p>  For customers, the place that can be allotted for data storage is also important.  After all, no one wants to have a good smartphone with a small memory.  Unfortunately, in our case the way it is.  And in this regard, Explay X Tremer specifications are extremely low.  As a result, reviews regarding the space on the phone are not the best. </p><p>  By purchasing this smartphone, you can count on only 4 GB of free space.  By today's standards, this is not enough.  Plus, it is worth taking into account the fact that approximately 1 GB goes to the operating system and phone resources.  So, only 3 GB will remain.  In principle, you can do with such a space.  But then you have to shrink in the matter of installed games, programs and videos and photos left on the phone.  This is not particularly attractive to buyers.  But to refuse like this right away from the model is not worth it.  A shortage of space can be resolved. </p><h2>  Map </h2><p>  For example, in Explay X Tremer it is possible to connect an additional memory card.  This feature is available only in some modern phones.  Many manufacturers began to abandon it.  And it does not please customers. </p><p>  But in "Express" you can connect MicroSD.  With all this, the maximum available capacity is 64 GB.  If desired, you can try to attach 128 GB, but this is not recommended.  According to buyers, you will begin to have problems with the phone after such a step.  In addition, it is advisable not to fill the entire map with data.  Leave a few gigabytes free.  Users often complain that with an abundance of stored information, problems with the operation of mobile devices begin.  And in our case there can be no exceptions.  So it‚Äôs better to be safe again.  Caution has not disturbed anyone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="explay x tremer phone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/972205.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The camera is another point that may affect the decision to purchase the ‚ÄúX-Tremere Express‚Äù.  To begin with, this model has only one camera.  While most smartphones have a rear option - on the front of the device.  This is not critical, but many are unpleasant to buy such an imperfect smartphone.  Selfies and video calling will be a problem for you. </p><p>  Plus, the quality of the rear camera is not very good.  Only 8 megapixels.  And this is in the presence of autofocus, as well as face recognition technology and smiles.  There is also a flash.  True, the photos are pretty good.  And there is the possibility of shooting video in HD.  This is enough for many.  If you are not hoping for a super camera that will have incredible features, then you can pay attention to Explay.  A pretty good option for a budget phone. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  Battery Explay X Tremer is not happy.  It seems to be powerful and high-quality, but in practice everything turns out quite wrong.  Buyers claim that there is nothing special about the battery.  It discharges quickly, although it has a large capacity of 2,000 mAh.  In addition, you have to recharge your smartphone often and for a long time. </p><p>  In standby mode, such a model can last about 3 weeks, with inactive use - 15-16 days, and if you do not release the device from your hands, you can only rely on 48 hours without recharging.  Very uncomfortable and impractical.  Nevertheless, if you learn to follow the smartphone, you will always stay in touch. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="explay x tremer touchscreen replacement" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/972204.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Price and equipment </h2><p>  Reviews about our phone improve when customers find out the cost of the device.  It is quite low - only 8,000 rubles.  A great choice for a budget smartphone, for which you can work and play.  So, if you don‚Äôt want to spend money just like that, then try to purchase the ‚ÄúX-Tremere Express‚Äù.  Maybe you will like this option. </p><p>  An important role is played by the device equipment.  The kit includes: a charger for Explay X Tremer, an instruction manual, a battery, a warranty card, a sticker on the screen, and a headset.  Sometimes you can also find a keychain or case.  But usually these things need to be bought separately.  In principle, this configuration suits buyers. </p><h2>  About repair </h2><p>  Naturally, any smartphone needs to be repaired from time to time.  And this fact leaves a huge imprint on the reputation of the device and the manufacturer as a whole.  What do Explay X Tremer owners most often complain about?  <span>Replacing the touchscreen as</span> well as the battery are the most common problems.  According to the owners, in order not to run into trouble, you will have to use your smartphone extremely carefully.  Almost dust off him.  True, sometimes a good case saves a situation. </p><p>  It may also often require flashing the operating system or repairing the speakers of the smartphone.  Such cases are not frequent.  So, for them you can not worry too much.  The main rule of handling Explay is to be careful all the time.  In this case, the quality of the device will only please you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="explay x tremer reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/972203.jpg"></div>

    <p>  So, is it worth buying an Explay X Tremer phone?  In general, everyone should decide for himself.  But we can advise you to pay attention to the model of parents of schoolchildren - with such a budget solution, you do not have to constantly worry about the fact that the child will play different games instead of learning.  In addition, the phone is perfect for work. </p>
