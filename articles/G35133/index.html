About 100 thousand people live in it.  Despite its small size, Maribor plays a large role in the economy of the republic.  Due to climatic conditions, it is a major tourist center of the country.  The city is located in the north-eastern region of the republic, which is called Lower Styria.  The Drava River flows through its territory, and Maribor (Slovenia) itself is surrounded by the Pohorje massifs. </p><h2>  Historical information </h2><p>  During the Early Middle Ages, Marburg Castle was built on one of the hills on the banks of the Drava.  The first information about him is found in documents dated 1164.  Gradually around the castle a market appeared, which was called Maribor.  People settled next to it, in 1254 Marburg receives the status of a city, and the surrounding area becomes a county.  Further development of Maribor occurred due to the strengthening of the Habsburg dynasty in Styria in 1278.  At that time, the city was at the crossroads of trade routes, so it turned into a large craft and trade center. </p>

    <p>  In the XV ‚Äì XVII centuries Maribor (Slovenia) survived the siege and attack of the Turks several times.  To protect against the enemy, three more castles and fortress walls with watchtowers were built in the city.

After the First World War, Austria claimed these lands, but the Slovenian patriots were the first to seize power in the city.  During World War II, he was captured by German troops.

    <p>  Near the house grows a vine, which is 400-450 years old.  It is listed in the Guinness Book of Records and is considered the pride of the inhabitants of Maribor.  Each year, the vine gives a harvest, from which about 100 bottles of unique wine are obtained, distinguished by their taste, but the wine is not available to ordinary buyers.  The full collection goes to the first persons of the country, and the vine itself is protected by the state. </p><p>  Residents of the city consider it their duty to cut dry twigs on the vine.  Every year, at the beginning of October and in November for the feast of St. Martin, specialists do pruning of the vineyard. </p><h2>  To Slovenia to a ski resort </h2><p>  Seven kilometers from Maribor are the mountainsides of Pohorje.  In winter, the mountain slopes are covered with a stable snow cover, and Maribor (Slovenia), the photo confirms this, turns into a ski resort.  Developed infrastructure, safe mountainsides and good climatic conditions have contributed to the fact that annually in Maribor Pohorje passes the stages of the World Cup in skiing.  Thanks to this, the city received the status of an alpine resort. </p>
