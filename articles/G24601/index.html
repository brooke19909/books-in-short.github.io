The settlement belongs to the Moldovan rural district.  The settlement is located 35 kilometers from the Black Sea and 42 km from the central part of Sochi.  As of 2010, about 1000 people lived in the village.  There are two places of interest in the area. </p><h2>  Temple </h2><p>  At the first turn to the left from the tunnel, if you move from Adler to Krasnaya Polyana, an Orthodox church is located.  In this place there is no noise and din, there are no crowded beaches, restaurants and cafes.  In this place you forget about the hustle and bustle, because the Trinity-St George‚Äôs Diocesan Monastery is located here.  In Golitsyno (Sochi), this is a female monastery. </p>

    <h2>  Appearance story </h2><p>  In 1999, Mother Superior Anastasia opened the doors of the temple.  The modern monastery is the successor to the Holy Trinity Monastery, which was abolished in the Soviet Union. </p><p>  An interesting fact is that even on the highway from Adler to Krasnaya Polyana, the Monastery stop is still preserved.  But in this place there was not even the foundation of any structure.  Especially the monastery.  However, previously there was a man‚Äôs monastery, which remained exclusively in the memory of local residents. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Even the president came to the convent in Golitsyno (Sochi) in 2013.  The arrival was at Christmas, nuns and parishioners met him with the head of the country. </p><p>  Earlier on the territory of the convent there was a recreation center of small sizes, the owner of which was the owner of a factory of reinforced concrete products, located nearby.  But he failed to organize a business on vacation, the territory was empty.  It seems that there is no historical ‚Äúbackground‚Äù in this place.  Why did you organize a temple here?  At the same time, as locals say, these places are almost ‚Äúprayed for,‚Äù and the convent is the successor to the holy man‚Äôs monastery, which has always existed in these places.  Indeed, during the reign of Soviet power, these places were damaged, bells were removed, and holy relics were removed.  This "wave" did not go around the surroundings of Sochi.  But even when the Soviet government left, pilgrims and believers came to these places constantly.  Some monks even lived in secret monasteries, which were located near the closed monastery. </p>

    <h2>  Modernity </h2><p>  Today, the convent in Golitsyno (Sochi) is a spiritual place and preserved missionary traditions with a modest decoration and hospitality of the Orthodox Slavs. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The architect of the building is Fedor Afuksenidi.  The highlight of the temple is a cathedral of heavenly color, named in honor of St. Huara of the Great Martyr.  It was this man who was a Roman warrior who never hid his Christian views and accepted a martyrdom for this.  Therefore, all people who want health for their offspring and pray for the repose of the deceased, who have passed away of their own free will, turn to <span>Saint Ouar</span> . </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Golitsyno Sochi Monastery" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2163952.jpg"></div>  Counties </h2><p>  On the territory of the monastery in Golitsyno (Sochi) there is the Vladimir Church of the Icon of the Mother of God.  There is a font in it, where a baptismal ceremony is held.  This font is located on the banks of the Psaho River. </p><p>  On the second floor of the church there is a shrine of the monastery - part of the relics of St. Nicholas, as well as the Belts of the Virgin and the fathers of the Kiev Pechersk. </p><p>  On the territory of the monastery there is a bell tower and a chapel "Satisfy my sorrows."  There is an iconostasis and stained glass windows, a wedding church.  Pilgrims and travelers come here to get rid of bad thoughts.  On the lands of the monastery there is a holy spring where hydrogen sulfide water flows.  Not far from the source is a beautiful arbor. </p><p>  The nuns of the temple in Golitsyno (Sochi) run their own farm, there are greenhouses with vegetables, their own bakery and livestock.  Constant construction is underway on the territory - the complex is constantly developing. </p>

    <h2>  Canyon </h2><p>  The village of Golitsyno (Sochi) is famous not only for the temple complex, but also for the <span>canyon of the Psakho River.</span>  This place is the most interesting recreational place of the resort.  The district has unique groves and caves of the karst period.  It is believed that in this place were parking primitive people. </p><p>  On the way, the first stop for all tourists is an observation deck overlooking the Mzymty valley and the Akhshtyrskaya gorge, in which there are many slopes covered with forests and boxwood.  It was in it that the primitive parking of people was found.  Tourists will be surprised by the untouched nature and frequently encountered limestone cliffs with relic plants.  And these are boxwoods, yews and mozhaniki. </p><p>  The gorge is conditionally divided into Wet and Dry canyons.  In the Wet Canyon there is a very narrow mouth of the river - from 0.5 to 10 meters. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The end of the tourist route, behind the sign "End of the recreational facility", begins the Dry Canyon, formed as a result of an earthquake.  The high walls of the limestone formations are revealed here, and the bottom of the canyon itself was once covered by an ancient ocean called Tethys. </p><p>  There are only two ways to get here: </p><ul><li>  on foot; </li><li>  on an SUV. </li></ul><p>  In an ordinary passenger car, it is not recommended to go here.  To the entrance of the canyon - yes, but not to the canyon itself.  A dirt road leads there, mostly washed after heavy rains and with fords.  If you get to the Kamenka-2 stop by car or bus, it is better to walk about 40 minutes, enjoying the surrounding beauties, and get into the canyon. </p>
