And so I want to know as much as possible about the personalities who left their noticeable mark in history.  Everyone knows about the character and deeds of outstanding people from books.  The features of the appearance of the leaders of mankind, who have become famous in different areas, are captured in ancient paintings, prints and frescoes.  As they are represented by our contemporaries, residents of past centuries, covered in legends, can be seen in the cinema.  How do the images of historical characters of reality correspond?  It is not always possible to judge this.  However, today there are many new methods that allow you to get closer to unraveling the mystery of what the legendary figures of the past represented in reality. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.greece-is.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What are the historical characters" class="if uuid-2706561" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53750/2706561.jpg"></div><h2>  Alexander the Great </h2><p>  This man, who glorified himself with great deeds in the 4th century BC and died extremely young, was the legendary commander and creator of a world power.  Alexander was a member of the Argead dynasty, which ruled Macedonia from its very foundation.  But after accession to the throne, he managed to turn a weak kingdom through an aggressive warrior and waging brilliant battles into a huge empire. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Alexander of Macedon among other famous historical characters stood out for his striving for primacy and frantic temperament, but these character traits were combined in him with the extraordinary mind of a prudent politician.  His completely unexpected death, which occurred in June 323 BC, seemed very suspicious to contemporaries and descendants.  And for a long time she could only guess about the reasons for it.  The consequence of the suddenness of the tragedy was that Alexander did not have time to appoint an heir.  And the unfolding after this struggle for power led to the collapse of the great empire he created. </p><h2>  Modern investigation </h2><p>  The secrets of the personality and the actions of historical characters attract our contemporaries, and therefore the mysterious death of the commander, impressive in his exploits, attracted the attention of London detective John Mane.  To investigate the tragedy of bygone millennia, he drew the best specialists from their Scotland Yard.  Among them were leading forensic scientists, forensic doctors, experts in the field of psychiatry and toxicology. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.biography.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Historical Characters: Names" class="if uuid-2706577" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53750/2706577.jpg"></div><p>  Over the past centuries, many versions of events have been put forward.  Often sounded assumptions about Alexander's poisoning.  And the motives for such speculation were understandable.  This strong, outstanding in all respects personality of the enemies was enough. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Detective Conclusion </h2><p>  What historical characters were involved in the crime? </p><p>  It was assumed that it was committed on political grounds.  But some put forward the version that the blame for all the binges in which Alexander often fell in the last months before his death, mourning for the dead lover Hephaestion (there were rumors that the great commander was homosexual). </p><p>  But John Greave, in making his conclusions and making convincing arguments, argued that there was a simple accident.  And he ruined Alexander the Great by his impatient, immoderate disposition.  It was like this, he wanted to recover as soon as possible after a grand revel and abused the medicinal drug.  And he was killed by white hellebore - a medicinal plant, which in certain doses is deadly poison. </p><h2>  Tutankhamun </h2><p>  Among the most famous names of historical characters, Tutankhamun is also remembered - a young pharaoh who ruled in Ancient Egypt in the 14th century BC.  He himself died, according to some historical information, nineteen years old.  Having gained power as a child, he reigned for only 9 years, and did not have time to leave a noticeable trace in the history of his country.  But still, the boy-pharaoh is widely known, and his name has thundered for centuries thanks to his famous tomb. </p><p>  This tomb is located near Thebes in the so-called "Valley of the Kings."  Opening it after many millennia was an impressive event of the XX century.  A little later, legends spread about the ‚Äúcurse of the pharaohs,‚Äù a kind of punishment that supposedly befell the discoverers of this tomb.  Thanks to mystical superstitions, Tutankhamun took a prominent place among other historical characters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mirror.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Famous historical character" class="if uuid-2706710" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53750/2706710.jpg"></div><p>  What the young pharaoh looked like, scientists examined his mummy through a topographer.  DNA testing was also carried out.  A significant role in creating a portrait of Tutankhamun was played by anthropologists. </p><h2>  Cardinal Richelieu </h2><p>  From early childhood, everyone is familiar with the wonderful novel ‚ÄúThe Three Musketeers,‚Äù which came out of the pen of the great creator of historical works, <span>Alexander Dumas.</span>  One of the brightest heroes of the book is Cardinal Richelieu.  In the novel, he appears to the reader as a vicious and vengeful schemer, sending out his spies everywhere.  However, the Red Cardinal, as he is also called, belongs to the number of literary and historical characters, being both at the same time.  What was his image in reality and is the hero of the novel similar to his prototype? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Literary and historical characters" class="if uuid-2706842" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53750/2706842.jpg"></div><p>  In fact, he was a truly smart and talented politician who did extremely much for France.  Since childhood, he was in poor health.  And since he could not play with his peers, he was engaged in reading books.  The descendants did not have to guess what he looked like.  Many sculptures and portraits of Cardinal Richelieu created by his contemporaries have survived. </p><h2>  Peter I </h2><p>  Another bright personality among historical characters, in the portraits of which, taken during his lifetime, there was no shortage.  By the way, enough documentaries and novels have been written about Peter I, and feature films have been shot about his deeds. </p><p>  He became famous as the first All-Russian Emperor, a prominent representative of the great Romanov dynasty, an outstanding reformer and a talented statesman.  However, among contemporaries and historians there were many people who sharply criticized his policy.  He was accused of tyranny, violence against his own people, the ruthless eradication of any dissent. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wicourseworkatck.duos.me" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Historical and literary characters" class="if uuid-2707145" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53750/2707145.jpg"></div><p>  The death of this outstanding person, which occurred in January 1725, also has many dark spots.  All his papers after his death mysteriously disappeared, and the testament, where he appoints the receiver, the dying emperor did not have time to do.  Although many claimed that it did exist, it was hidden or destroyed. </p><h2>  Catherine II </h2><p>  Among the historical <span>characters of women</span> , Catherine II should be especially distinguished.  They said about her that she had gone to many tricks in order to succeed, and did not miss a single chance in this field. </p><p>  Many secrets are connected with the personality of this Russian empress, including enough stories are known about her many love affairs, as well as her quirks in such matters.  Often they gossiped about the origin of Catherine.  It was not clear: was her official father legal? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thoughtco.com" data-author=": Robert Wilde, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Historical characters of a woman" class="if uuid-2707155" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53750/2707155.jpg"></div><p>  Born Princess Fike from her earliest childhood had a freedom-loving and bold disposition.  When she married the heir to the Russian throne, her husband Pyotr Fedorovich showed no interest in her.  But Catherine showed perseverance and achieved the love of her environment, which helped her in the end to become empress, removing her unfaithful husband from her path.  It is known that in addition to Paul, the legitimate son, Anna, who died in infancy, she also had secondary children: son Alexei Bobrinsky and daughter Elizabeth. </p><p>  The empress loved Russia, but not everyone in this country treated her with love.  There is evidence that the life of Catherine more than once could end in tragedy, and the courtiers plotted her intrigues. </p>
