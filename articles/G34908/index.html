    <h2>  Mobile device positioning </h2><p>  This smartphone is aimed at a niche of products average in speed and price.  This positioning is indicated by the CPU model, which belongs to the Qualcomm 6XX series of chips.  The initial level of this manufacturer is occupied by chips of the 2XX and 4XX series, and the premium segment is the lot of the 8XX CPU series.  Well and between them the 6XX series of central processors harmoniously fits.  Moreover, both in terms of speed and the price of final products.  It is in this category that the hero of this review falls.  It works better than some last year‚Äôs flagships, but inferior to the latest premium gadgets (that is, released this year).  A strong half of humanity is Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Pro (32Gb) Black.  He will perfectly present his owner in the eyes of others and indicate his special status.  In turn, Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Pro (32Gb) Gold and White are intended for the needs of a female audience.  They will look much better in female tender and fragile hands. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Gadget </h2><p>  Very modest equipment for a device of this level, and even from such a renowned manufacturer, this smartphone.  It includes: </p><ul><li><p>  The device itself with a non-removable battery installed in it.  The case of the device itself is non-separable.  The only element that can be removed and reinstalled is a slot for an external drive or cards of mobile operators. </p></li><li><p>  A clip for removing a slot for two SIM cards or a SIM card and an external drive. </p></li><li><p>  Interface cord.  With the help of such an accessory, a device is connected, for example, to a computer.  In this case, it can be used as an external drive (that is, as a regular and well-known flash drive), a webcam, or even a multimedia player for playing video or music.  The second possible use is charging the battery. </p></li><li><p>  Charger with 2A current input and 5V voltage.  Its output power should be enough to fully charge the battery in 2-3 hours. </p></li><li><p>  Instruction manual for the mobile gadget and warranty card.  Moreover, in the international version of the smartphone it will be in several languages, and in Chinese localization - only in the local language. </p></li></ul><p>  Even the entry-level stereo headsets are not in the original configuration of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Pro (32Gb) mid-range mobile device.  The manual and warranty card are the basic documentation, but most manufacturers supplement this list with advertising leaflets with a list of possible additional accessories.  There is also no protective film for the front touch panel in Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Pro (32Gb).  Case also have to buy separately.  The delivery package for this smart phone is really modest.  But this insignificant disadvantage is compensated by a number of advantages, which will be described in detail later. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Design solutions </h2><p>  Almost all the possible area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe front panel of the device is occupied by the excellent large touch screen display with a very solid diagonal of 5.5 ‚Äù.  At the bottom of the screen is a three-button gadget control panel.  From above, as expected, a small and round hole for the sensor element of the front camera, the windows of the sensors and the earpiece are displayed.  The other control buttons are located on the right side of the device.  One of them is responsible for blocking the phone, and the other two - for regulating the volume level.  On the upper edge of the device are: a microphone to suppress various third-party noises that occur during a conversation, a typical, standard 3.5 mm audio port and an infrared eye.  From the opposite edge on the bottom end of the gadget are displayed: a miniature round hole for the main microphone and a universal port of the MicroUSB format version 2.0.  On the left edge of the smartphone is a slot for installing two SIM cards or a combination of a SIM card and a memory card.  On the back cover are displayed: the main camera, its single LED for backlighting and a scanner for checking the fingerprints of the owner of the device (in this regard, this gadget is very similar to previous generations of flagship devices from LG).  A very practical solution is to put the scanner sensor on the back cover.  Also here at the very bottom is a loud speaker.  The case is made of sheet metal (respectively, it is non-separable) and can be made in one of three color options: white, black and gold.  The most practical due to the imperceptibility of possible damage and dirt on a dark background of the case is considered Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Pro (32Gb) Black.  In turn, the white version of the gadget is aimed at a female audience, which he certainly should like.  But Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Pro (32Gb) Gold is exclusive and is extremely rare. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  The Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Pro (32Gb) smartphone is based on the Snapdragon 650 central processor developed by Qualqomm.  Its distinctive feature is two-cluster architecture.  That is, it consists of two types of modules.  The first of them is designed to perform complex, resource-intensive tasks and includes only 2 cores, capable of overclocking to 2.5 GHz if necessary, and the second consists of 4 computing cores, the maximum possible frequency value of which is limited to 1.8 GHz. </p>

    <h2>  Gadget Graphics </h2><p>  Smartphone Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Pro (32Gb) is equipped with a video accelerator.  Like the central processor, this semiconductor solution was developed by Qualqomm.  His model is Adreno 510. Of course, he does not pretend to be a top-end solution, but he is far from last in the list of graphic solutions of an average price level.  Its clock frequency is 624 MHz, and it is great for displaying a bright and saturated picture on the display.  Among other important features of this solution, one can single out full support for such a software component as DirectX 12.1.  The level of computational performance of this graphics accelerator allows it to cope with any task at the moment without any problems. </p><h2>  Device screen </h2><p>  One of the main advantages of this model is the display.  Its diagonal is solid even by today's standards 5.5 ".  Resolution, in turn, is 1080 pixels.  It should also be noted that a high-quality IPS matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãthe basis of the gadget Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Pro (32Gb).  Reviews highlight the excellent quality and impeccable color rendition of the image displayed on the display.  The density of dots in this case is 400 ppi, it is certainly impossible to consider a single pixel on this mobile device without special devices.  Well, viewing angles, as expected, are almost 180 <sup>0</sup> .  Also, the image itself is not distorted.  On this screen, it‚Äôs a pleasure to watch movies and TV shows.  And playing on a mobile device with such a large diagonal will be as convenient as possible. </p><h2>  Memory.  Opportunities for expanding the storage system of information and data </h2><p>  Phone Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Pro (32Gb), as it is easy to understand from the name, has a capacity of 32 GB of internal data and information storage.  Some of them are pre-installed software and system software.  But the remaining part of the internal drive will be enough for installing applications, as well as for storing personal user files.  The Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Pro (32Gb) is equipped with a second hybrid SIM card slot.  That is, if necessary, you can refuse the services of a second, backup, mobile operator and use this "hybrid" slot to install an external memory card in relation to the device.  You can also synchronize this device with any cloud service for storing personal information and store the most valuable and important data there.  This will avoid their loss in case of breakage or theft of the gadget.  The amount of RAM in this smartphone is 3 GB.  The user, in turn, can count on a little more than 2 GB when starting application software.  This is enough to simultaneously run about 10 undemanding tasks or several resource-intensive applications. </p>

    <h2>  Device cameras </h2><p>  Very, very high-quality main camera, which is installed in Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Pro (32Gb).  A review of the technical parameters of this component indicates that it is based on a 16 megapixel sensor.  There is a LED backlight for taking photos in low light conditions and autofocus.  The quality of the photo is pretty good.  This device can record video, and its quality is excellent for a mid-range device.  The front camera of this gadget is based on a very good sensor by today's standards of 5 megapixels in Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Pro 32Gb.  Reviews indicate that it is great for both selfies and video calls. </p><h2>  Autonomy of the mobile device.  Battery capacity </h2><p>  The situation with the battery life in Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Pro (32Gb) is also quite good.  A review of the technical plan parameters for this mobile device indicates the presence of a built-in non-removable 4000 mAh battery.  Taking into account the processor solution used in the gadget, the large-sized display and its resolution, we get up to 3-4 days of the device‚Äôs operation at a mediocre level of use without recharging.  In the case of maximum use of the device, one charge of the built-in battery should last for 1.5 days.  You can increase the degree of autonomy of the device using optimization software, which unused software will be unloaded from memory.  You can also buy an external Power Bank and connect it to your phone as the battery runs out.  If you take such a device with a capacity of about 10,000 mAh, you can even count on a very, very active use of the device for 4 days. </p><h2>  List of interfaces </h2><p>  The list of interfaces in Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Pro (32Gb) is very expanded.  Features indicate support for the following information transfer methods: </p><ul><li><p>  This device can be successfully registered in almost any cellular network today.  It supports GSM networks (2G technology, ranges B2, B3, including B8), WCDMA (aka 3G, ranges B8, B5, B2 and even B1) and, of course, LTE / 4G (FDD-LTE technology, ranges B1, B3 and B7).  Moreover, both SIM cards in this case can function in such cellular networks.  In the presence of the first type of cellular networks, the speed of the transmitted data can range from several tens to five hundred kilobits per second, the second - tens of megabits per second and the third - hundreds of megabits per second. </p></li><li><p>  Also, this smartphone supports all currently existing modifications of Wi-Fi technology.  Starting from the outdated version of ‚Äúa‚Äù and ending with the relatively recently introduced ‚Äúac‚Äù - all such wireless networks are supported by this ‚Äúsmart‚Äù phone.  The most common modification to this data transfer method is ‚Äún‚Äù.  Its maximum speed is limited to 300 Mbps.  If you use a more recent version of Wi ‚Äì Fi, then you can get a higher speed.  But while such devices are extremely rare, and this is the exception rather than the rule.  But the transition to this wireless standard is still gradually coming. </p></li><li><p>  The developers did not forget about the "Bluetooth".  Its version is 4.1.  Using this transmitter, you can output sound to wireless speakers or share small files with similar devices. </p></li><li><p>  To perform navigation functions, the device has <span>a GPS module.</span>  It can successfully work both with the American system of the same name, and with the domestic GLONASS.  Also, to determine the location of the gadget, it implements A-GPS technology.  In this case, connection to the global web is required, and navigation is performed on the mobile communication towers. </p></li><li><p>  Another gadget feature is the presence of an <span>infrared port.</span>  Previously, small files could be transferred through it.  But now his main task is to replace the remote control and issue commands to various household devices (for example, a TV or satellite TV receiver).  But for the full work of the gadget in this mode, it is necessary to install additional application software on it. </p></li><li><p>  To organize a wired connection to a computer and to charge the built-in non-removable battery, this device is equipped with a MicroUSB format port. </p></li><li><p>  Another wired interface is a 3.5 mm audio port. </p></li></ul>

    <h2>  Price </h2><p>  You can buy in online stores or electronics supermarkets Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Pro (32Gb).  The price in a similar situation will be in the range from 10,500 to 13,500 rubles.  But there is another way.  You can try to save money and buy the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Pro (32Gb) gadget at international trading floors in China.  The price in this situation will be lower and will be 8000-9000 rubles.  But still, in this case it‚Äôs better not to save money and take a finished device with international firmware already, than then try to install the same version of software on this gadget.  As experience shows, it is not so simple to replace Chinese software with international one.  If this operation is performed incorrectly, such a device can be completely disabled.  And the smartphone itself, as noted earlier, is not so cheap, so experimenting is recommended only as a last resort.  Moreover, it is not so difficult to get a version of the gadget on a domestic counter with an international version of the OS.  Well, the price difference between Chinese and domestic stores is not so significant. </p><h2>  Smartphone Chips </h2><p> Most manufacturers seek to equip their mid-range mobile devices with various useful options that will increase the attractiveness of the gadget in the eyes of a potential buyer.  Xiomi is not far behind in this regard.  The first and most important feature of this device is the presence of a scanner that ensures the security of information on the gadget using fingerprint recognition.  Until recently, such an important option was present only in models of the premium segment.  Now it is more and more often found already in the middle niche.  And one of the first gadgets in this class with such an important option is precisely the hero of this review.  The location of this sensor is exactly the same as that of the flagships of LG: on the back cover.  Repeatedly, users have pointed out the convenience of such a design solution.  That is why the Chinese engineers decided, apparently, to position the sensor window in this way.  Another ‚Äútrick‚Äù of this cell phone is the metal case.  It is not collapsible, but the quality of its assembly is really not satisfactory.  Such a case is resistant to damage and will last a very, very long time.  The only drawback of this approach is the inconvenience of repair.  But when buying a new phone, the potential owner thinks about this last of all.  And the quality of the products of this Chinese company is excellent, and problems with the operation of equipment, as a rule, do not arise. </p>
