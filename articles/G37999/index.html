    <p>  Pedagogical research is a search for ways and means of improving the pedagogical process.  Such ways and <span>methods of cognition</span> are the methods of pedagogical research.  With their help, it is possible to obtain information about a particular subject under study, conduct its analysis and processing, and then include it in the system of known knowledge. </p><p>  <strong>Classification of methods of pedagogical research</strong> </p><p>  <span>Pedagogical</span> research <span>methods are</span> classified in several ways.  So for the <span>purpose of the study, there</span> are: </p><p>  ¬∑ Theoretical <span>methods: modeling</span> and causal analysis methods, comparative historical analysis. </p><p>  ¬∑ Practical methods: conversation, questioning, observation, experiment. </p><p>  Depending on the sources of information, methods of pedagogical research are divided into methods of studying theoretical sources and methods of analysis of the existing pedagogical process.  According to the methods of processing the analysis of certain data, such methods as the analysis method and the method of quantitative processing of material are distinguished. </p><p>  <strong>Some methods of pedagogical research</strong> </p><p>  <strong>1.</strong> <strong>Observation</strong> as a method of pedagogical research is the most accessible and widespread.  By observation is meant a pre-prepared and organized perception of a process, phenomenon or object in natural conditions.  It should be noted that <span>scientific research is</span> somewhat different from the so-called everyday.  First, in scientific observation, specific tasks are set, observation schemes are developed, objects are distinguished.  Secondly, the results obtained must be recorded.  Thirdly, the received data is necessarily processed.  One can talk about the high efficiency of observation if it is systematic, versatile, lengthy, massive, and objective.  Since observation does not reveal the inner side of pedagogical research, they apply it only at the initial stage of research, in conjunction with other methods. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>2.</strong> <strong>The study of experience is</strong> one of the most ancient methods of pedagogical research.  In a broad sense, the study of experience implies organized <span>cognitive activity,</span> which is aimed at establishing historical links between teaching and upbringing, as well as isolating a stable common in educational systems.  Thanks to this method, an analysis of ways to solve problems is carried out, and a balanced conclusion is drawn on the need to use these solutions in new historical conditions. </p><p>  <strong>3.</strong> <strong>The study of products of student creativity,</strong> such as classroom and homework, essays, reports, essays, as well as the results of technical and aesthetic creativity.  A similar method is widely used, for example, it is used in assessing the individual characteristics of students, their inclinations, interests and attitudes to various duties and matters.  The organization of pedagogical research by this method also requires careful planning, as well as preparation for skillful use with other methods. </p><p>  <strong>4.</strong> <strong>Conversations,</strong> dialogues, discussions - this is what helps to identify the relationships of people, their intentions, feelings, attitudes and assessments in relation to a particular phenomenon.  Pedagogical conversation has features: it is characterized by pre-thoughtful attempts by the researcher to penetrate into the inner world of the researched, as well as to identify the reason for the appearance of a particular act. </p><p>  <strong>5.</strong> <strong>An experiment is</strong> a kind of observation, only in this case the experimenter observes the process that he himself systematically carries out.  So, a pedagogical experiment can be conducted with a group of students, a school, or immediately with several schools.  How reliable the experiment will turn out depends largely on compliance with all its conditions. </p><p>  <strong>6.</strong> <strong>Testing</strong> is one of the most popular methods of pedagogical research.  It is a focused and uniform examination of all subjects, which should be carried out under strictly controlled conditions.  Testing from other research methods is distinguished by accessibility, accuracy, simplicity and the possibility of automation. </p><p>  <strong>7.</strong> <strong>Questioning - a</strong> massive collection of material that is carried out through pre-designed questionnaires, the so-called questionnaires.  The questionnaire is based on the assumption that the person being questioned will honestly answer the questions in the questionnaire.  However, as statistics show, in practice, such expectations are justified by only half, which dramatically undermines the credibility of the questionnaire as an objective method of obtaining data. </p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
