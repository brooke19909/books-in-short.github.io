  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Conquering the Universe: Flight to the Moon</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The universe has long been interested in humanity.  And, of course, that the most cherished goal of people was the moon, which is visible to every inhabitant of the Earth. </p><p>  The fact that the flight to the moon for the first time in history was committed by the Americans is known to all.  Outrunning the USSR, the Apollon 11 landed on a <span>celestial body</span> called the Moon.  <span>The first person</span> whose foot stepped onto the surface of the luminary was Neil Armstrong, and another American astronaut, the <span>spaceship</span> pilot, <span>Edwin Aldrin</span> , followed <span>.</span>  The ship's captain and his pilot stayed on the lunar surface for about two and a half hours, examined it, collected about 23 kg of <span>moonstones</span> and returned to the ship.  Naturally, the flag that the American crew set on the moon, not only excited the hearts of millions of Americans, but also enraged all the Soviet scientists who worked to ensure that their first flight to the moon was carried out by them, because the so-called "moon race" between the USA and the USSR lasted for many years.  We will tell you more about it a little later. </p><p>  <span>Why did you stop flying to the moon?</span>  A question that worries millions of people on the planet.  There are thousands of versions and thoughts on this subject.  The most incredible of them is that the last time people flew to the moon, <span>flying saucers</span> came close to them <span>,</span> which opened warning fire, which meant "no more foot here!".  This fact is allegedly confirmed by the fact that in 2002 a certain British hacker Harry Mackinon hacked the Pentagon and NASA bases, having found many reports there about why they stopped flying to the moon.  According to some sources, these reports were made secretly in the US Congress and are not on the list of official texts.  This version is similar to the screenplay of a Hollywood alien movie.  However, in fact, all this is an invention of human imagination, and the reason lies in a completely different way. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What is this secret that suddenly stopped flying?  Has mankind really found out almost everything about the moon, and now it has become an uninteresting object of study for science?  Not at all. </p><p>  Space is not just an unknown distance, but also a territory that forced two powerful earthly powers to fight among themselves.  This territory of political bickering and battles of the USA and the USSR has always attracted attention, and the countries mentioned did not spare either money or effort to overtake each other. </p><p>  Usually, the USSR remained the leader in space technology, but the first flight to the moon, made by Apollo 11, was a real blow to the Union.  Of course, the Soviet Republic was aware that not only did it lay claim to the first moon landing - both Soviet and American rockets tried to reach the moon and take pictures.  And the ship "Probe" belonging to the SS was the first to successfully complete this mission.  And America, in turn, spent millions of dollars to fly.  The first tests of Apollo even cost the crew‚Äôs life, three astronauts died.  After the victory over the USSR, the USA almost lost interest in exploring the lunar surface. </p><p>  "Lunar race" ended with the victory of the Americans.  Of course, a year later, Soviet scientists sent their famous lunar rover to the moon, which brought much more useful information to the earth than the expedition of American astronauts.  However, after that, the Americans decided not to take any more risks, because the money spent would not pay off.  The collapse of the Soviet Union became a logical point in the lunar race, because competition lost its meaning. </p><p>  Will the moon flight ever again be carried out?  Not at all, in the research plans of some countries there are still projects for the flight to the sun, so it is impossible to say with accuracy that a fat point has been put in this matter. </p>
