People visiting this city are changing their worldview, mentality, life.  Pattaya makes you rethink values, take a different look at your existence.  Someone decides to quit their job and start doing business here, someone generally leaves everything and moves here for permanent residence.  In this city, everyone feels that he is living for real.  Pattaya is an eternal summer and the uninterrupted atmosphere of the holiday.  Here it seems that one must live only for pleasure.  There is definitely no second such place on the planet, so people who once visited Pattaya return again and again to this vibrant, shocking and vibrant city, spread out on the eastern shore of the <span>Gulf of Thailand,</span> 165 kilometers from the capital of Thailand - Bangkok. </p>

Translated, Thailand is a "free country", and the freest city in this country is, of course, Pattaya.  Excursions to interesting places, dancing until the morning on the famous "debauchery street" - Volkin Street, beach holidays under palm trees, shopping, unusual food - all this can be found in this paradise.  We will tell you about the attractions that are definitely worth visiting in the article. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Thailand.  Pattaya.  Excursions </h2><p>  You should think about the excursion program even before you arrive in the city.  Pattaya offers a variety of excursions, they can be ordered from your tour operator or at any street agency.  And travel agencies are found at every step, and prices are much cheaper than hotel guides.  “Coconut Travel”, “Sasha Tour”, “Mango Travel”, “Dolphin Tour”, “Pattaya Tour” - you can safely order excursions in any of these agencies.  A sightseeing tour of the city is usually provided by tour operators for free.  If this is your first time in Thailand, be sure to take this opportunity.  So, what excursions to visit in Pattaya? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thailand pattaya excursions" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10809/386960.jpg?1399019511246" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Kwai River </h2><p>  Of course, a trip to the Kwai River is the most popular excursion among tourists.  Here they say: "If you have not been to Kwai, then you have not been to Thailand."  And indeed it is.  Visiting any other places will not allow you to see the country in all its unpredictable diversity.  The trip is designed for two days and often includes a historical component. </p><h2>  1. Ayutthaya </h2><p>  You will visit the ancient capital of Siam, destroyed by the Burmese people, Ayutthaya, which even in ruins is an amazing sight.  The ancient city is included in the list of <span>UNESCO World Heritage</span> Sites, it is a real <span>open-air museum,</span> where dense green forests surround Khmer-style temples made of unbaked brick.  Here you will feel all the energy of the city that was once the most powerful in Southeast Asia.  But Ayutthaya is only a small part of all the interesting things that a trip to Kwai is preparing for you. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  2. True Thailand </h2><p>  You will visit a stepped waterfall called “Erawan”, swim in vests on the river, spend the night in a comfortable hotel on the water, shop at the floating market in Damnoeng Saduak, watch how the great masters of the royal teak factory skillfully carve out the most complicated patterns.  This is Thailand in all its glory!  When buying tours in Pattaya (prices and programs at different agencies may vary), clarify all points of interest in advance: ask what to take with you, what time you will be taken from the hotel and when you will be brought back, whether you will have to pay extra for something.  So you protect yourself from various surprises.  The cost of a trip to the Kwai River is 2300-3500 baht. </p><h2>  Historic Bangkok </h2><p>  If Thailand (Pattaya) became the object of your vacation, excursions to Bangkok are simply unacceptable to be ignored.  Programs are offered a variety of.  History buffs will love the trip to the holy places of the capital, the main of which is the Royal Palace.  Even the most callous person the charm of Thai architecture will not leave indifferent.  You will take a boat trip to one of the temples along the canals of the Chao Phraya River, during which feed the fish with bread.  Thais believe that in the process of feeding animals, human karma is cleared.  And since you will feed fish near the temple, the effect will double! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tours in pattaya reviews" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10809/386963.jpg?1399019882318" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The next point on the route is Wat Po - the monastery of the Reclining Buddha.  The <span>Buddha statue</span> itself <span>,</span> measuring 46x15 meters, is located in one of the buildings of the complex.  There is also a higher school of Thai massage, which has collected ancient murals with all kinds of educational materials relating to the acupuncture points of our body. </p><p>  After visiting Wat Po, you will head for the tallest building in Bangkok called Bayok Sky.  Here, at an altitude of eighty-four floors, you will find a stunning view of the capital of Thailand - one of the largest cities in Southeast Asia. </p><h2>  Real bangkok </h2><p>  Not everyone who comes to rest in a resort such as Pattaya, tours of historical places are interesting.  Want to see the real Thailand?  Yes, the Royal Palace is one of the symbols of Bangkok, but this shrine is unlikely to reflect the true face of the city.  Not many manage to see the "real" capital.  However, for every taste there are excursions in Pattaya.  Reviews on the tourist program aimed at demonstrating all the facets of bustling and incredible Bangkok are simply enthusiastic!  You will visit only those places that ordinary tourists bypass: ride in tram boats, try local food, take a walk around Chinatown, sweep over the roofs of houses in the ground metro, take a look at “little India” in the city center, walk a lot and consider the contradictory life of the metropolis from the inside.  Only in this way will you be able to experience the truly tradition and life of the Thai people, look in a completely different way at Thailand and the City of Angels themselves. </p>

    <h2>  Nong Nooch Park </h2><p>  After the Kwai River, this is perhaps the second most popular excursion that tourists purchase in Pattaya.  The Nong Nooch Tropical Garden, listed in the Guinness Book of Records, is located seventeen kilometers from the resort.  The park has a vast territory of 240 hectares, so to get around it entirely, you will need to spend the whole day.  More than two thousand people visit Nong Nooch daily.  Here you can admire the gardens of cacti, aquatic plants, stones and even pots.  You can often hear how the park is called the “Orchid Garden”;  here, indeed, there is a plantation of these wonderful flowers, however, it is only a small part of the entire territory.  The decoration of Nong Nooch, of course, is a huge collection of palm trees, numbering more than a thousand species and continuing to replenish.  This is the largest collection of plants in the world in one place.  Also here you will see baobab - the famous African tree, the largest coconut in the world and even the local Stonehenge.  The cost of excursions in Pattaya to "Nong Nooch" is the same for all agencies and is 500 baht. </p>

    <h2>  Transvestite show </h2><p>  Without a doubt, the most sought-after excursion that does not require leaving the city limits is a visit to a transvestite show.  In Pattaya, there are two of them - Alcazar and Tiffany.  It should immediately be clarified that transvestites in the conventional sense, that is, men dressed as women, you will not see.  They performed here when similar shows were just in their infancy.  Now transgender people are participating in the performances - men who feel like women and have partially or fully turned into them thanks to hormones and <span>gender reassignment surgery.</span>  Many in vain believe that such representations are debauchery.  Do not confuse them with sex shows, which in Pattaya are also represented a lot.  In fact, “Alcazar” and “Tiffany” are a musical theatrical cabaret with special effects and chic decorations, luxurious costumes, dances and music.  And certainly among the real gullies you will not see such beauties as here!  You can go to shows even with children, they will not see anything vicious.  The price varies from 500 to 900 baht, depending on the chosen places. </p>
