Moreover, a distinctive <span>feature of the psychology of</span> management is that the object of its study is concentrated on the organized activities of people.  This activity is understood not only as a joint work, but as a union of people on the basis of common interests, values, sympathies, goals in one group that obeys the rules and norms of this organization. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  People in this group work together according to specific economic, technological, legal, organizational and corporate requirements.  The norms of the organization imply special psychological relations in the collective between its individual members - managerial relations. </p><p>  Management relations coordinate the joint <span>activities of people,</span> making it logical and organized, which helps to achieve higher production results.  <strong>Management psychology</strong> considers each individual employee as an element of a social group, only within the framework of which one can understand his behavior. </p><p>  In management psychology, it is not the issue of the employee‚Äôs suitability for the chosen profession that is relevant, but the problem of the employee‚Äôs matching with the organization in which he works or wants to work.  Therefore, the object of this discipline is not just the relations between people in a team, but the relations of people within the framework of their belonging to a certain organization, that is, in such conditions when people's actions are prescribed and obey the general order.  Part of management psychology is the psychology of negotiations, which significantly helps to improve relations between employees of the enterprise. </p><p>  The object of management psychology is people who are financially and legally involved in an organization whose activities are aimed at achieving corporate useful goals. </p><p>  In the field of trade, the relations between people and in the team are investigated and coordinated by the psychology of trading.  This discipline studies the emotional, psychological state of traders during trading, analyzes how consciously they think and correctly make decisions. </p><p>  The most urgent psychological problems for the organization are the following: increasing the competence of managers at all levels, increasing the effectiveness of training and retraining of senior staff, the search for human resources of an organization, the selection of managerial personnel for an enterprise, and the improvement of the psychological atmosphere within the organization‚Äôs team. </p>
