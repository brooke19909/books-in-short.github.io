    <h2>  Geography </h2><p>  Chelyabinsk is conveniently located east of the Ural Mountains.  He is the southern neighbor of Yekaterinburg, the distance to which is about 200 km.  The area is recognized by geologists and geographers as the conditional border of Western Siberia and the Urals.  The Leningradsky Bridge is the connecting link between the "Ural" and "Siberian" banks <span>of the Miass River,</span> which is the main waterway of Chelyabinsk. </p><p>  The city of Chelyabinsk on the map of Russia, intended for motorists, is highlighted by the Meridian highway passing through a residential area, part of which is the recognized border of Siberia and the Urals.  The south-western and northern neighbor of the city is Sosnovsky district, in the east it borders on the satellite city of Kopeisk.  In the north-east of Chelyabinsk - Krasnoarmeysky district. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the urban area is a major donor of drinking water - the Shershnevskoe reservoir.  In the vicinity stretch picturesque clear lakes: First, Smolino, Sineglazovo.  On the territory of Chelyabinsk there are several small streams carrying their waters to Miass.  Among them are Chernushka, Igumenka, Chikinka, Kolupaevka. </p><p>  Chelyabinsk stands on a terrain with hilly terrain in the west, which is gradually changing and to the east, closer to the city of Miass, turns into hollows with lakes and swamps.  Both banks of the river are covered with frequent shrubs. </p><p>  The location of Chelyabinsk on a map of Russia indicates the presence of the city in the zone of the Yekaterinburg time zone.  Regarding Moscow time, there is a constant bias denoted by MSK + 2. </p><h2>  origin of name </h2><p>  At the moment, scientists have no consensus on the origins of the name of the city.  A popular version is that, on the site of modern Chelyabinsk, there was a settlement based in the tract of Chelebi, which in Turkic means ‚Äúeducated prince‚Äù.  There is a version among old-timers that the city owes its name to the fortress, which stood in the hollow, a large shallow pit, which translates into Bashkir as ‚ÄúSilbeke‚Äù.  Later an alternative version appeared that before the birth of Chelyabinsk, the Tatar village of Selyaba was in this place.  There is a theory of the emergence of a toponym from the name of the river, because that's exactly the way among the Turkic peoples it was customary to name their estates. </p>

    <h2>  History </h2><p>  When did Chelyabinsk arise and where is it located?  This city appeared on the map of Russia in 1736 thanks to the decision of Colonel Tevkelev to lay a fortress on the site of the Bashkir settlement of Chelyaba.  The consent of the owner of the land - Bashkir Tarkhan Shaimov was obtained, which ultimately contributed to the release of the Bashkirs from taxes.  The status of the city was assigned to Chelyabinsk after half a century - in 1787. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Until the end of the 18th century, Chelyabinsk was a calm county town, in which events of a global scale rarely occurred.  At this time, placer gold mining started on the Miass River.  And with the official opening of the gold mine, the "gold rush" swept the edge.  The first half of the 19th century was characterized by the intensive development and establishment of trade and crafts.  In just a few years, thanks to the construction of the <span>Trans-Siberian Railway, the</span> city ‚Äã‚Äãhas taken a leading position in the Urals in the sale of oil, bread, tea, meat. </p><p>  Over a century, <span>the population</span> has increased significantly and by 1917 amounted to about 70 thousand inhabitants.  The territory of Chelyabinsk has grown by a third.  Near the railway station, new villages appeared.  A female gymnasium, a spiritual and real school, a trading school were opened.  The Railway Assembly Club and the People‚Äôs House began to work.  Agencies, trade offices, branches of foreign companies actively conducted their activities. </p><p>  In the Soviet period, Chelyabinsk became a large industrial and industrial center.  In the 90s of the last century, the city experienced a difficult financial crisis.  Many enterprises went bankrupt, workers were not paid wages, unemployment increased, and social programs were not sufficiently funded. </p><h2>  Modernity </h2><p>  The reforms carried out have yielded results: enterprises in the industrial sector began to work actively, budget revenues increased, and incomes of citizens began to increase.  Many factories and combines presented their products on the world market.  Reconstruction of roads and construction of modern transport highways has started. </p>
