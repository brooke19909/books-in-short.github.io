And this is not surprising: there are excellent climatic conditions, low prices for accommodation in hotels, quite good service.  People who prefer a measured beach vacation come here, so they buy all-inclusive tours, those attracted by the Red Sea with its many coral reefs, as well as travelers who combine relaxation with sightseeing.  And there are a lot of them in Egypt, as you know. </p><div class="photo" data-original="jungle-aqua-park.hotelshurghada.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Guests are welcomed in the spacious lobby." class="if uuid-2294562" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2294562.jpg"></div><p>  The Russians have long been chosen by local resorts, including Hurghada, which is considered the oldest tourist center.  It is located on the west coast of the Red Sea, five hundred kilometers from the capital.  It is believed that it was from this city that <span>tourism</span> began to develop <span>in Egypt</span> , which became so popular among our compatriots <span>.</span>  Vacationers mostly come to Hurghada with their children.  This is due to the fact that local hotels offer a fairly developed infrastructure for small tourists.  In addition, on this part of the coast, children can safely swim in the sea, and their parents can not worry that children will injure their feet on corals. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Overview </h2><p>  For those who come to Egypt not only to swim and sunbathe on the beach, but to see local <span>attractions, Hurghada</span> is perfect.
