    <p>  Tourists from Russia speak warmly about the staff of Sol Marina Palace 4 * (Nessebar).  From their comments it follows that all the staff here are pleasant and friendly people.  Moreover, many note that the staff really like what they do, so all the smiles of employees are sincere and not fake.  In addition, all employees do their job well.  In addition, our compatriots here, as in most other hotels in Bulgaria, do not have communication problems, since our languages ‚Äã‚Äãare very similar. </p><h2>  Opinion of tourists about the beach and entertainment </h2><p>  Our compatriots also liked the beaches around the hotel.  You can reach them in just a few minutes.  Since the beaches are municipal property, the use of sunbeds and umbrellas is chargeable.  However, you can comfortably sit on a sand towel brought with you a little away from the sun loungers.  Nobody will take money from you for this. </p><p>  If for some reason you do not want to go to the beach, then you will have the opportunity to have a good time at the hotel.  So, here there is a magnificent pool with a self-service bar.  Relaxing in a warm little water with a glass of your favorite drink in your hand, you can enjoy magnificent views of the sea and the old town of Nessebar. </p><p>  As for animation, then in Sol Marina Palace 4 * it is practically absent.  This is due to the fact that the main contingent of vacationers is families with children of different ages and older people.  If you want noisy entertainment, then feel free to go to the center of Nessebar.  There are discos, bars and night clubs at your service. </p>
