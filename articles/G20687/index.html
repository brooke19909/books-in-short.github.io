    <p>  According to reviews, the following advantages of living at the Krystal hotel (Prague 6) can be distinguished.  3 * stars he really deserves. </p><ol><li>  Convenient location.  Although the hotel is not in the center, all the necessary places can be easily reached.  There is a tram stop nearby.  Transport runs regularly every 5 minutes.  Even if you plan to spend only a week in Prague, it is advantageous to purchase a monthly ticket.  In just 20 minutes from the hotel you can reach the main attractions.  You can walk to the wonderful Divoka Sharka Nature Reserve.  Every tourist must definitely look here.  The nature of these places is amazing.  Majestic cliffs, unique trees and murmuring streams - all this is fabulous Prague.  Hotel Krystal 3 * is located near all this beauty.  There is a vegetarian restaurant in the park.  Nearby is the McDonald's, which works even at night.  Also very close are the most popular sights of Prague: Golden Lane, Prague Castle, St. Nicholas Cathedral and Strahov Monastery.  The area in which the hotel is located is considered the most prestigious in all of Prague.  Here you can see many luxurious private mansions, government buildings and beautiful old buildings.  In addition, Prague-6 is the most environmentally friendly area.  Due to the fact that there are many recreational areas, the air is even healing. </li><li>  Good facilities in the rooms.  Those who travel often will immediately notice the huge room key instead of a compact plastic card.  Perhaps this will be the only inconvenience, since the key will have to be handed over at the reception each time.  This may remind some of the old Soviet times.  But when you get into the hotel room Krystal 3 * Standard (Prague), everything does not seem so gloomy anymore.  You can open windows to eliminate odor.  There is a balcony with a fairly good view.  The rooms are spacious and clean.  Towels are changed every day, bed linen - after three days.  Toiletries include liquid soap and shampoo.  There is also a working refrigerator and a small TV.  The room has many wardrobes and various shelves, there is also a table and chairs, they can be put on the balcony and admire the beauties that night travelers discover in Prague.  Prague Krystal 3 * is an ideal hotel for a budget holiday.  Some may think that they got back to the USSR.  Here you can really find objects of the Soviet past.  Particularly surprising is the telephone, which today can only be seen in older people in apartments.  But there‚Äôs still no need to use it, and pleasant memories even improve your mood.  The furniture in some rooms is really not new, but it‚Äôs even better.  Now, such a quality, as it was before, is rare.  All shelves are made of durable material, solid beds and stable chairs.  Mattresses may seem uncomfortable at first, especially for those who are used to sleeping on orthopedic beds.  But you can quickly get used to it.  After long walks, this option will be ideal for a quiet sleep. </li><li>  Decent food.  For such a level, the hotels are fed quite well here.  Breakfast is included.  In the morning, several types of cheese are served, various meat slices, salads, pate, dairy products, juices, teas and even hot dishes.  For sweets - homemade cakes, fruits and jams.  Even in France, not all hotels of this level are so fed. </li><li>  Service.  Reception open around the clock.  Settled instantly, evicted, by the way, is also very fast.  Just need to hand over the keys.  The staff speaks several languages.  At the first call, they are ready to come to the rescue and fulfill any request of the client.  The staff is very friendly and welcoming. </li><li>  The Internet.  When checking in, they issue a Wi-Fi password.  Conveniently located in the lobby, you can immerse yourself in the World Wide Web.  In the rooms, unfortunately, the Internet does not catch. </li></ol><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Some cons are also available: </p><ol><li>  <span>The interior of the Soviet</span> era.  Old furniture, some accessories may even fall apart before your eyes.  Rooms may have an unpleasant odor. </li><li>  Inconvenient mattresses. </li><li>  Few outlets.  It is not possible to turn on the TV and refrigerator at the same time. </li><li>  Good audibility in the rooms.  The walls are made of fiberboard, so everything that happens in the corridor or in neighboring rooms is remarkably audible. </li><li>  The smell of dampness in the bathroom.  There is no shower.  Instead of it - a simple shower with a tray.  Due to the constant humidity, an extremely unpleasant odor is formed.  The hood may not work well. </li><li>  The cleaning leaves much to be desired.  Some rooms forget to clean. </li><li>  The staff is wary of Russian tourists. </li><li>  Monotonous breakfasts. </li><li>  Blankets can have an unpleasant smell. </li><li>  Laid towels. </li><li>  Seldom change bed linen. </li><li>  No toiletries. </li><li>  No promised internet in rooms. </li></ol><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  If we analyze all the reviews about Krystal 3 * (Prague), then we can conclude that this is a good place to relax with the whole family, there is everything you need.  It‚Äôs not even necessary to leave the hotel to have a meal or a haircut.  The administration can order a return ticket and even provide a person as an escort.  Rest in such a cozy place will really succeed, and a person who has arrived in a foreign country will not feel discomfort.  Moreover, Prague is not a place where you should spend all your time in a hotel.  There is where to go, what to see and what to spend money on.  Hotel Krystal 3 * (Prague) is famous for its low prices, but the quality is not particularly affected.  There are minor flaws that can be corrected if desired.  The staff always makes contact with customers and tries to do everything in their power. </p><p>  Opinions differ regarding the nutrition of tourists.  Someone is quite enough of the offered dishes, and someone complains about the lack of variety.  The quality of the rooms is also in question.  Perhaps it all depends on the change of staff.  Some rooms are cleaned regularly, while other apartments remain dirty. </p><p>  But the value of Prague hospitality is different.  Such an atmosphere reigns here that you can completely close your eyes to all the shortcomings and simply enjoy the beauty of this ancient European city.  For business travelers, the Krystal 3 * hotel (Prague) will also be an excellent refuge.  I am glad that the hotel is loyal to guests with children and pets.  Even on vacation, you can not part with those who are very dear to you. </p>
