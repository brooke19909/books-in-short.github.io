    <h2>  Registration of sovereignty </h2><p>  First of all, let's find out how the independent development of the Russian Federation began. </p><p>  In the late 80s, it became clear that the Union republics no longer want to be together.  In Russia, there were also people who believed that some republics with less developed economies were ballast for the country. </p><p>  In May 1990, Boris N. Yeltsin became the head of the Parliament of the RSFSR.  A few weeks later, on June 12, the Parliament adopted the Declaration of Sovereignty of Russia. </p>

    <p>  At the very end of 1991, between the leaders of the three Soviet republics, including Russia, agreements were reached on the <span>collapse of the USSR</span> and the creation of an interstate association of the CIS.  And on December 26, 1991, the USSR legally ceased to exist. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since then, Russia is a sovereign state.  Loss of it promised or gain?  On the one hand, a great country collapsed, which in economic and political terms occupied one of the leading places in the world.  On the other hand, in many respects the achievements of this state were based on the command and administrative system and the repressive mechanism, which ultimately showed their inefficiency.  But the Russian Federation was a young country that was built on the principles of a democratic society. </p><h2>  October putsch </h2><p>  Before Russia gained sovereignty, new political upheavals awaited it.  Dissatisfaction with the reformist policies of Boris Yeltsin grew both among the people and among politicians of the highest rank.  As a result, in October 1993, this state of affairs turned into an armed confrontation between supporters of the president of Russia and his opponents, led by vice-president Rutsky and chairman of the parliament Khasbulatov. </p>

    <p>  Yeltsin‚Äôs opponents were defeated.  True, the president won the victory at a high price: more than 150 people were killed, several hundred were injured.  The consequence of these events was the dissolution of the Supreme Council, which was replaced by the State Duma, the abolition of the post of vice president, and most importantly, the adoption of the new Constitution of the country. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Once again, it was proved that Russia is a sovereign state.  Losses and gains from these events are difficult to compare.  On the one hand, they led to the death of more than one and a half hundred people, on the other, they allowed the country to finally break with the Soviet past and continue building a new Russia. </p><h2>  War in Chechnya </h2><p>  One of the most tragic pages in the recent history of our country is the armed conflict in Chechnya.  It began in 1991, when Dzhokhar Dudaev seized power in the republic through a military coup. </p>

    <p>  <span>The Russian government</span> had to agree to militants signed in 1996 in Khasavyurt.  These agreements provided for the formation of a virtually independent state - the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. </p><p>  Nevertheless, the conflict at that time could not be completely resolved.  Provocations by militants occurred after 1996.  In 1999, the counter-terrorist operation began, which was popularly called the <span>Second</span> <span>Chechen War.</span>  As a result, until 2009, Chechnya was almost completely cleared of gangs, and their leaders were eliminated.  The restoration of the republic, destroyed during a long war, began. </p><p>  The ability to defend its territorial integrity has proved that Russia is a sovereign state.  The losses and gains of this war are not comparable.  A lot of soldiers died, defending the integrity of their homeland.  In addition, one of the constituent entities of the federation actually temporarily left its composition.  But most importantly, they managed to extinguish the hotbed of war, and returned the republic to the fold of the Russian Federation.  Now Chechnya is one of the most prosperous regions of Russia. </p><h2>  Default </h2><p>  Not only the war and political upheavals marked the 90s for Russia, but also economic instability.  One of its most pronounced manifestations was the 1998 default.  Then, due to a number of unfavorable internal and external economic factors (falling oil prices, the Asian financial crisis), Russia was forced to suspend the payment of obligations on loan bonds, which in fact put it in a state of technical default.  This led to a sharp depreciation of the ruble and to the resignation of the current government at that time. </p><p>  At the same time, it should be noted that default, paradoxically as it seemed, contributed to the recovery of the country's economy as a whole.  In the 2000s, its sharp rise began, and in the second half of the decade, the Russian Federation managed to pay off almost completely its debts and achieve unprecedented economic heights since the collapse of the USSR. </p><p>  So Russia won or lost due to default?  The Russian Federation is a sovereign state.  The gains and losses that it has are the result of a government policy chosen by the people.  In this case, the declaration of default itself, of course, was a severe blow to the financial condition of both the country and ordinary citizens.  But in the long run, this decision contributed to strengthening the economic achievements of the state. </p><h2>  Yeltsin's resignation </h2><p>  Of course, Russia is a sovereign <span>federal state.</span>  And in many ways this is the merit of its first president, Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin.  A big surprise was his resignation from his high post at the end of 1999 for health reasons. </p>

    <p>  Did Russia, a sovereign state, win or lose from this?  Losses and gains promised the resignation of Yeltsin.  Of course, when a person who has done so much to form the state institutions of the country themselves leaves his post, this is rather sad.  But we must remember that the team of President Yeltsin was replaced by an even more effective team of President Putin, which allowed Russia to achieve unprecedented economic growth. </p><h2>  Joining of Crimea </h2><p>  One of the most sensitive issues in the recent history of Russia is the accession of Crimea in 2014 as a subject of the federation.  How justified was this step? </p>

    <p>  On the one hand, having annexed Crimea, Russia ran into a number of significant economic sanctions by Western countries, and also entered into a serious conflict with its closest neighbor - Ukraine.  But at the same time, the territory of Russia became larger, uninterrupted access to the Navy bases in Sevastopol was provided, and, most importantly, the desire of the people of Crimea was realized. </p><h2>  Achievements or Losses? </h2><p>  So, we tried to study the topic "Russia - a sovereign state: gains and losses."  The history of the country knew a lot of both the first and second.  But what was more?  It is rather difficult to answer this question, if at all possible, because the reverse side of the coin for each loss is achievement, and for any gain, loss. </p><p>  The main task for any state is not to stray from the chosen course. </p>
