Of course, the main purpose of the covers is to protect the device from mechanical influences - bumps, drops, scratches, chips, as well as dust.

They can be in the form of a book, a notebook, a purse.  The material for their manufacture is also very diverse - leather, silicone, shockproof plastic. </p><p>  Their configuration is fully consistent with the phone and has all the necessary openings for keys, connectors and buttons. </p><h2>  Feature of modern Lenovo phones - Lenovo Loucher branded shell </h2><p>  The main menu greets the user with large and colorful icons that are located in several slots.  It has convenient flipping.  Icons on the desktop are shown in three-dimensional format. </p><p>  Using a special menu, you can arrange the location of the icons using several filters, go to the extensive menu "Settings". </p><p>  In the locked state, the shell will show a large clock, just below which are four small icons decorated in the form of tulips and designed to unlock.
