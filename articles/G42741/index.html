  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Several popular ways to withdraw money with Webmoney</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Those who have been engaged in a particular <span>electronic business</span> for quite some time have long found for themselves the best way to withdraw money from Webmoney.  For those who are only going to try their luck in Internet activities, but do not know how to cash out <span>electronic currency</span> in the future <span>,</span> several recommendations will be very useful.  In fact, there is nothing complicated about this.  All that you wish to have for this is a bank plastic card.  But this is not necessary, since there are ways to cash without a card.  But first things first. </p><p>  So, you started working on the Internet, opened a wallet in the <span>payment system</span> and already received the first money on it.  Now to hold her in my hands, right?  There are several ways to cash Webmoney.  One of them is the exchange of your electronic funds for real with dealers or in exchange offices.  They are in almost every city.  Their list can be found on the Webmoney website, in the "More" tab.  When you click on it, a menu will appear in front of you, in which you need to select the "Output" option.  On the page that opens, among the most popular withdrawal methods, select "Exchange offices and dealers."  In this section, click on the type of currency you need to exchange, and a list of countries and regions will open in front of you.  Select the one you need and see if your city is in the list that appears.  If there is, then next to you will see a link to the address of the exchange office.  If your city is missing, then this method of withdrawing money from Webmoney does not suit you, you need another. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Try to transfer funds to a <span>bank card.</span>  See which banks the system works by clicking on the currency you need in the ‚ÄúBank card‚Äù section.  If your city has one of these banks, you can draw up a card with them and attach it to the system, following the instructions.  Earned funds will arrive instantly as soon as you withdraw Webmoney to the card.  If you have a Visa card issued by any other bank, it can also be linked to Webmoney, but the money, in this case, will go a little longer - from one to three days.  But then you will avoid the bank commission.  The commission of the system itself is 0.8% of the withdrawn amount, so take this into account when cashing funds in this way. </p><p>  Another option on how to withdraw money from Webmoney may be an online service that allows you to withdraw any electronic currency to a ruble card (for example, Obmenov.com and others).  A list of banks with which such a system works can be found by visiting its website.  In addition, such services allow you to withdraw funds from other payment systems at a fairly favorable rate.  Money is credited to your card account within three minutes.  However, with their help, you can transfer finances only to your own card, this is a prerequisite.  Therefore, when registering on this resource, it is necessary to enter reliable information, which must coincide with the data entered during the registration of WebMoney wallet. </p><p>  If these methods of <span>withdrawing money from Webmoney</span> do not suit you for some reason, you can use the usual mail transfer.  But it is suitable for you if you withdraw rubles or hryvnias and if you are ready, in addition to the WebMoney commission, to pay a mail commission, and this, in total, will amount to more than 3% of the amount.  Your money will go from 2 to 5 days.  If you withdraw euros or dollars, then mail will not work for you.  In this case, you can use the Western Union service.  The interest for the transfer is also decent, and the term for receipt is about two days. </p><p>  Perhaps these are the most popular ways to withdraw electronic money.  On the Webmoney website, you can familiarize yourself with these methods in more detail, or maybe choose another.  But in our opinion, the most convenient and least expensive one is the withdrawal to a bank plastic card. </p>
