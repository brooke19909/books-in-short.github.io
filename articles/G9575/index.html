Getting to these resort towns is the easiest and cheapest way, of course, by train.  In the summer, there are many "southern" trains on the country's railways.  Residents of the Middle Volga region who decide to go to the Black Sea often take a ticket, for example, on the train 463rd Samara - Adler.  There are different reviews about this composition on the network - both good and not very good. </p><h2>  Description of composition </h2><p>  Most often, tourists who decide to spend their holidays in the resorts of the Black Sea coast of the Russian Federation, of course, purchase tickets for reserved seats in order to save money.  But some people prefer to travel with great comfort - in a compartment.  In summer, train No. 463 is composed of both varieties of wagons. </p>

    <p>  Not so long ago, the Russian government, together with the leadership of Russian Railways, decided to stop the production <span>of</span> old- <span>class reserved cars</span> .  At first, they wanted to gradually replace them only with two-story ones, completely stopping the assembly of ordinary ones.  However, this decision was later quashed.  Today, the country produces both double-decker and simple reserved seats, wagons modified and adapted to modern requirements.  The latter in our country so far, unfortunately, are collected in not too large numbers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The train number 463 may include both new and old reserved seats.  At the same time, passengers themselves are not provided with information about which of them sold tickets.  The price of travel documents for old and new cars is no different.  Meanwhile, travel conditions may vary significantly. </p><h2>  Departure / Arrival </h2><p>  <span><span><span>Departing from <span>Samara Station,</span> train no.</span></span></span> <span><span><span>463</span></span></span> <span><span><span>at 16:55 Moscow time.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>On the</span></span></span> <span><span><span>route to</span></span></span> <span><span><span>his</span></span></span> <span><span><span>destination, it is 1 day 21 hours.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>In total,</span></span></span> <span><span><span>the train route (</span></span></span> <span><span><span>463rd)</span></span></span> <span><span><span>Samara - Adler</span></span></span> <span><span><span>includes 41 stations</span></span></span> <span><span><span>.</span></span></span> </p>

    <h2>  Total </h2><p>  Thus, the actual composition, its route and schedule for passengers can be considered quite comfortable.  Arriving at the finished station trains number 463 and 464 at a convenient time for travelers.  The same applies to departure hours.  If we talk about the wagons themselves and the service provided in them, then here - how lucky.  Most likely, cashiers at Russian Railways stations themselves do not know which modification they are selling tickets to.  So it‚Äôs unlikely that it will be possible to purchase a travel document specifically in a new car from travelers who decided to get to the Black Sea by train No. 463.  But in any case, tickets for this composition should be bought early.  Then, perhaps, the passenger will be able to ‚Äúgrab‚Äù at least not a side seat and not located next to the toilet. </p>
