    <h2>  TOP 5 </h2><p>  To begin with, it is worth listing the really best banks in Russia - those that occupy the first lines in all lists and ratings. </p><p>  Naturally, Sberbank is the permanent leader.  If you believe the latest data for December 2016, the amount of its assets exceeds 22.6 trillion rubles. </p><p>  The second place is occupied by VTB <span>Bank of Moscow.</span>  The amount of its assets is approaching the mark of 10 trillion rubles.  By the way, it was formed a year earlier than Sberbank. </p><p>  In third place is Gazprombank, with assets of 5.2 trillion rubles.  Initially, by the way, it existed as a bank in the gas industry. </p><p>  The fourth line of the rating is occupied by VTB 24.  The amount of its assets is 3.2 trillion.  The youngest bank among all in this TOP, since it was founded in 2000. </p><p>  And finally, fifth place.  It is occupied by FC Otkrytie, whose assets are equal to 2.9 trillion. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Which organizations still deserve attention </h2><p>  Listing the <span>best banks in</span> Russia, it is worth taking a look below the fifth line of ratings.  Because there are also worthy organizations that strive in every possible way to become even better, and therefore offer their customers a lot of profitable offers. </p><p>  In sixth place is Rosselkhozbank, which trusts customers so much that it is ready to pay interest on the deposit immediately.  In any case, until the end of February such a service is valid.  The deposit rate is called “Interest Forward!”. </p><p>  Then follows Alfa-Bank.  It simply cannot be ignored when talking about the best banks in Russia.  Customers love him for his excellent online service, credit cards with an interest-free period of 3 months, and convenient conditions. </p><p>  Seventh place is taken by the National Clearing Center.  It can be described in one phrase.  This is the central counterparty in the financial market, providing stability on it.  Today it is developing rapidly.  In November alone, the amount of its assets grew by 4.45% (about 87 million rubles). </p><h2>  Universal and private financial organizations </h2><p>  They are also included in many ratings, which list the best banks in Russia in terms of reliability.  Take, for example, the private Promsvyazbank.  Stably takes 10th place in the TOPs.  It was founded in 1995, and for 22 years it has proven itself in the financial market.  In addition, she is engaged in charity work. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  And Sovcombank, founded in 1990, is a universal bank, which ranks 19th in the Russian rating.  It is popular because it provides financial services not only to individuals, but also to the largest Russian corporations and constituent entities of the Russian Federation.  Today, Sovcombank's customer base exceeds 1,500,000 people.  And the organization itself covers 65 regions of our country.  However, the main feature of the bank, for which it is loved, is the provision of a wide range of services to those people who are usually deprived of attention.  These are pensioners, borrowers with bad credit history, citizens of small towns.  Therefore, this organization, despite the total assets of only 500 billion, is included in the TOP of the best banks in Russia. </p>

    <h2>  Banks gaining popularity </h2><p>  Many organizations are really growing rapidly, monthly increasing their assets.  For example, Tinkoff Bank is unique in its kind, as it specializes in completely remote servicing.  This is extremely relevant in the 21st century. </p><p>  Or "RosEvroBank", which in November rose in the ranking by 4 positions, increasing the amount of assets by 6.21%.  True, most of his business is concentrated in Moscow and St. Petersburg. </p><p>  Well, and finally, it is worth noting the attention of the bank called “Express-Volga”.  Not the most popular organization, but over the past month the amount of its assets has increased by 12.84%.  And this means that we will still hear about this bank. </p>
