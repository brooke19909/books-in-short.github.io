Sights of Novosibirsk, photo</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It is hard to believe, but just about 120 years ago, in the place of one and a half million people in Novosibirsk, there was a small Krivoshchekovskaya settlement, where only 685 people permanently resided.  Today it is one of the most important economic and cultural centers of our country, where tens of thousands of tourists come annually to see the historical and modern <span>sights of Novosibirsk.</span>  Of particular interest to the guests are the numerous Orthodox churches, including the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral.  This magnificent building in the Byzantine style is the oldest stone building in the city and is among the attractions that are definitely worth a visit. </p><h2>  Alexander Nevsky Cathedral (Novosibirsk): background </h2><p>  It is generally accepted that Novosibirsk was founded on April 30, 1893, since it was on this day that a settlement was laid for workers engaged in the construction of the <span>Trans-Siberian Railway.</span>  Thanks to this important transport artery, in just a few years, Novonikolaevsk, as Novosibirsk was then called, turned into a prosperous city through which trade flowed between the European regions of the Russian Empire and the Far East.  As a sign of gratitude for the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway, its residents decided to establish a memorial church in honor of <span>Alexander the Third,</span> and in 1895 they organized a collection of donations, in which members of the royal family also took an active part.  In particular, the Romanovs allocated a land plot for construction, donated 11,500 rubles from personal money and presented brocade vestments for priests and deacons. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Construction of the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral </h2><p>  At the moment, there is no exact information about who developed the architectural design of the first stone <span>church in Novosibirsk.</span>  However, experts agree that Alexander Nevsky Cathedral (Novosibirsk) was built according to the design of the Church of Our Lady on Vasilievsky Island in St. Petersburg.  The well-known engineer-traveler N. M. Tikhomirov supervised the work, who made a lot of efforts so that the work was completed as soon as possible.  As a result, construction lasted only two years, and by the summer of 1899 the church was already ready to receive believers. </p><h2>  Temple history </h2><p>  In 1937, the Nevsky Cathedral (Novosibirsk at that time was already decorated with several churches) was closed.  They even tried to blow it up, but the building was built, as they say, for centuries, and only some partitions collapsed.  Then the authorities transferred the cathedral to the Promstroyproekt design institute, and in 1957 the West Siberian Newsreel Studio moved there.  The new owners carried out a radical redevelopment of the interior in order to adapt them to their needs.  To do this, using internal ceilings, the building was divided into three floors, the paintings were removed from the walls, and the dome was turned into a room.  Another reconstruction of the cathedral was planned for 1988, as it was supposed to arrange a concert hall for the chamber choir to perform there.  Fortunately, the public managed to defend the temple, and in 1989, by decision of the city authorities, Alexander Nevsky Cathedral (Novosibirsk) was returned to believers.  Regular services began, and a center for combating sects was opened here. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Description of the temple of Alexander Nevsky </h2><p>  After the transfer of the cathedral of the Orthodox Church, large-scale restoration work was carried out in it, as a result of which today it appears before the faithful in a form close to the original.  In particular, the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral (Novosibirsk) got rid of the ceilings, and again it is decorated with magnificent paintings by contemporary artists.  In addition, the bell tower was rebuilt, the domes were covered and covered with gilding, an iconostasis was installed.  Also, visitors can see the new baptismal temple with a large font for complete immersion. </p><h2>  Ascension Cathedral </h2>

    <p>  Novosibirsk is rightly called the city of Orthodox churches.  After all, there are about 30 churches belonging to the RCP, the main of which is the Ascension Cathedral.  This temple, founded in 1913, suffered less during the years of the Atheism, although it was nevertheless closed for as many as 7 years, giving it under a granary.  The year 1974 was especially significant for the cathedral, when its complete reconstruction began.  As a result, by 1988, the temple got its modern look, becoming completely stone.  In addition, to celebrate the 1000th anniversary of the Baptism of Russia, the Ascension Cathedral (Novosibirsk) was decorated with mosaics and paintings. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Znamenskaya church </h2><p>  Over the past decade, the <span>population of Novosibirsk</span> has grown several times, reaching one and a half million marks.  The number of Orthodox believers increased, so the shortage of churches began to be felt.  In this regard, several new churches were built, including the five-domed, three-nave Znamenskaya Church, founded in 1992.  In architectural terms, it is modeled on Russian churches of the 16-17th centuries and occupies a special place among the modern architectural sights of Novosibirsk. </p><h2>  Trinity Vladimir Cathedral </h2><p>  On the left bank of the Ob there is another new two-level temple, the construction of which was started in 1999.  This is the six-seeded Trinity-Vladimir Cathedral in Novosibirsk, which is also the courtyard of the Mikhailo-Arkhangelsk Monastery, located in the village of Kozikha.  The temple is exceptionally beautiful.  It has silver-plated domes, and in appearance it resembles the churches of medieval Russia.  In August 2013, during his stay in Siberia, Patriarch Kirill consecrated the Trinity Cathedral (Novosibirsk), which is located on the second level of the Trinity-Vladimir Church.  Thousands of parishioners, as well as representatives of the authorities of the city and region attended the solemn service. </p>

    <h2>  Chapel of St. Nicholas </h2><p>  In the distant 1914, on the eve of the First World War, in Novonikolaevsk it was decided to build a temple in honor of the 20th anniversary of the construction of a bridge across the Ob.  As a place for the chapel, subsequently consecrated in the name of St. Nicholas, the point was chosen, which is the geographical center of the Russian Empire.  Today, this snow-white church with a dome in the form of a helmet of an <span>Old Russian warrior</span> adorns the Red Avenue of the city, and wedding processions constantly approach it so that young people can light a candle and ask for blessings from St. Nicholas, who is considered the patron saint of Novosibirsk.  In addition, next to the chapel there is a park with shady alleys where you can relax during a walking tour. </p>

    <h2>  Sights of Novosibirsk </h2><p>  A photo on travel agency sites cannot convey all the beauty of these places.  In addition to visiting numerous temples, Novosibirsk can offer tourists to get acquainted with their secular architectural masterpieces.  For example, the number of architectural symbols of the city includes the largest building of the Opera House in Russia, which, after the reconstruction of 2005, is considered one of the most modernized and technically equipped in our country.  Another significant construction is the building of the railway station, built in 1939, which is one of the largest in Russia and is designed to receive up to 4000 passengers at a time. </p>

    <p>  Among the recognizable architectural sights of Novosibirsk is the Stock-apartment building, the project of which received a 1st degree diploma at the Paris Art and Technology Exhibition in 1937. </p><h2>  Museums </h2><p>  Although the oldest surviving building in Novosibirsk - Alexander Nevsky Cathedral (Novosibirsk) - will celebrate its 120th anniversary only next year, people in these parts lived in ancient times.  This is evidenced by numerous archaeological finds that can be seen in the Museum of Local Lore of the city.  In addition, magnificent ethnographic and numismatic collections are exhibited there. </p>

    <p>  The Novosibirsk Art Museum is also very popular with tourists.  In its halls the works of Russian and European painters of the 16-19th centuries are presented, there is a large collection of icons, and you can also see graphic works by contemporary artists.  In addition to museums with a long history, several modern ones also operate in Novosibirsk.  They are less known, but of great interest.  For example, the <span>Museum of the Sun</span> invites you to see the images of the daylight taken from ancient civilizations, but in the Museum "Siberian Birch Bark" you can get acquainted with the crafts of folk artists. </p>
