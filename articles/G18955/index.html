    <p>  The data necessary for reporting are submitted by the entrepreneur on paper in the form of a completed 3-NDFL declaration.  Filling out a tax return is a mandatory requirement not only for those who run their own business, but also for ordinary citizens who have received income outside their main place of employment for 12 months.  This category of taxpayers undertakes to file a declaration so that income taxes are withheld from their income.  For many Russian citizens, filling out a 3-NDFL tax return is a necessary condition for filing a tax deduction.  Failure to do so will result in penalties. </p><p>  Filling out a 3-NDFL tax return can cause certain difficulties for both a legal entity and an individual.  Avoiding such hiccups will help knowledge of the current tax law.  A sample tax return may be an example of reporting. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What is a 3-income tax return? </h2><p>  The procedure for filling out a tax return is prescribed in the current legislation of the country.  Detailed instructions developed by the Federal Tax Service allow entrepreneurs to quickly fill out various reports and papers on their own.  Despite the fact that the tax inspectorate provides instructions on how to fill out a tax return, it is necessary to rely on certain articles of the Tax Code to avoid errors.  An incorrectly completed document will not be considered valid. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tax return form" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/1622731.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The compiled report must be checked for errors and typos.  An individual or individual entrepreneur undertakes to affix a personal signature and seal to the documents.  An example of filling out a <span>tax return</span> can be seen on the stands at the tax office or on the official websites of the Federal Tax Service. </p><h2>  Tax deduction </h2><p>  Filling out a declaration in the form of 3-NDFL gives the taxpayer legal grounds for filing a tax deduction.  Such benefits can significantly reduce the tax base. </p><p>  It is possible to receive a tax deduction only after submitting a relevant application to the regulatory authorities.  Documents are attached to it, which confirm the right of the applicant to receive such benefits. </p><h2>  Filling out a 3-NDFL declaration on the Internet </h2><p>  Today, you can fill out, print and file a declaration in the form of 3-NDFL using special software, which can be downloaded from the official website of the Federal Tax Service of Russia or third-party resources.  Downloading such a program to a user's personal computer makes it possible to quickly enter personal data into the declaration form, which are automatically distributed according to the necessary columns and lines.  In the future, the taxpayer is required to introduce the necessary numbers, which will be distributed on the necessary lines of the declaration. </p>

    <p>  You can send a tax return to the appropriate authorities without resorting to a personal visit to the inspection.  Today it has become possible thanks to the Internet and special resources.  Sending a declaration online requires the taxpayer to verify receipt of documentation by regulatory authorities. </p><p>  The declaration can also be submitted through the Internet service "State Services".  Despite the availability and convenience of this method of sending documentation, it still requires the personal presence of a taxpayer at the Federal Tax Service, since a copy of the declaration must be signed. </p><p>  Filling out and filing a 3-personal income tax return requires the taxpayer to have only a personal computer with Internet access, the necessary package of documents and a small amount of free time.  For convenience, the Federal Tax Service of Russia has created special software that not only saves time, but also avoids errors while filling out the declaration. </p>
