    <h2>  City of Saki </h2><p>  Well equipped for tourists, the city is located four to five kilometers from the Black Sea.  The usual beaches of Saki, which almost all start in shallow water, must be reached by bus or minibus.  They go often.  Very important is the salty shallow (only one and a half meters) <span>Lake Saki.</span>  It was formed after the end of the ice age, and the natural depression was filled with sea water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beaches of saki crimea" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1989909.jpg" width="600"></div>  At the bottom, silt was deposited, which was preserved with salt.  Over millions of years, most of the water has evaporated, and what is left is called brine.  In it, a layer of salt is five meters.  Do not rush to go on an expensive trip to the Dead Sea.  Saki Lake is twice as rich in minerals and minerals.  No wonder the city has about a quarter of the population - people with disabilities who need constant treatment.  The territories are equipped with numerous ramps, so that its guests will be easy to move around.  Healthy companions and relatives of patients, when they rest from the procedures, will find entertainment and relaxation on the many beaches of Saki.

    <p>  In the wild places of the seaside in the vicinity of Saki there is no developed infrastructure.  The beaches are wide and spacious enough.  The sea is usually clean with well-heated shallow water off the coast.  The farther from the villages, the fewer people.  Some are completely deserted.  Here the traveler forgets about civilization and is completely immersed in unity with nature.  The beaches between Frunze and Novonikolayevka pose some danger, since the coast here is steep and there is a danger of collapses.  But far from all this confuses.  There are lovers of privacy here and sunbathing without swimsuits. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On the central sandy beach of the village of Frunze, a tourist will find parking, small shops, cafes, a locker room, a volleyball court.  There is also Bogayly Lake with healing mud.  That is, here you can relax and heal. </p><p>  The name "Robinson" should not bother lovers of a comfortable stay.  The beach is fully equipped.  It has shaded canopies, <span>tents, cafes,</span> locker rooms, and a toilet.  In addition, there is a pond where you can go fishing for a fee. </p><p>  The main beach in Novofedorovka is easily accessible by bus from Saki.
