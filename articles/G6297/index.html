The manufacturer decided to surprise the market by supplying a standard phone delivery kit with a large number of interchangeable panels of different colors.

    <p>  According to some marketers, this move may indicate that the brand wants to win an audience in several target groups at once.  It is understandable - young people will most likely wish to ‚Äúcolor‚Äù their phone in colorful tones; business people will prefer conservative shades.  Both will be in the arsenal of the owner of the smartphone.  Multi-colored panels will give users the opportunity to choose the best options in terms of compatibility with clothes, accessories, and at least with shades of an apartment or a car. </p>

Many experts note that the dimensions of the device are selected very competently: with a diagonal of the display in the ratio of 4 <span>to 3,</span> their "formula" (126x62x7.8 mm) makes the gadget very stylish.  The smartphone, according to experts, is conveniently in the palm of your hand.  Of course, the small thickness of the case gives a special charm to the phone. </p>

    <p>  Which of the elements of the device case do the experts see as the most remarkable?  This is probably an elegant plastic edging in the front of the gadget, slightly protruding above the display.  Actually, the screen itself, as experts say, is protected by a very durable and scratch-resistant glass. </p><p>  The phone‚Äôs delivery kit, as we said above, includes 5 spare panels of different colors, fixed on the back of the case.  Some of them are glossy, others are porous.  The user can choose the most suitable and comfortable, as well as change them as often as desired.  There are options with turning the device into a stylish gadget, which can be arbitrarily called Highscreen Omega Prime Mini Black, that is, with a black panel on the back.  And after a few seconds turn it into a democratic device Red, Blue or White with red, blue or white elements, respectively.  The panels are mounted on the case without unnecessary creaks and backlashes.  If you remove them, then you will see several slots for micro-SIM, as well as for micro-SD memory.  Many users believe that, thanks to interchangeable panels, the Highscreen Omega Prime Mini case is an almost unnecessary accessory. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Among the other notable innovations for the phone in the SE version is another processor (Snapdragon 200), as well as a more modern version of Android - 4.3. </p><h2>  Version S: large screen and plenty of memory </h2><p>  There is another modification of the phone - Highscreen Omega Prime Mini S. Its main difference from the flagship model is a larger display (4.7 inches) and an increased amount of internal memory (8 GB).  As in the case of the SE version, Android 4.3 and the Snapdragon 200 processor are installed in this modification of the smartphone. </p><h2>  The "classic" version: large dimensions and capacious battery </h2><p>  Our study of the smartphone would not be complete if we did not include in it a small review of Highscreen Omega Prime in the "original", "classic" version, without the prefix mini.  It is worth noting that there are very few differences between devices.  The key features of the "classics" is that it has a larger display (4.7 inches), as well as a more capacious battery (2000 mAh).  The gadget is also larger than the mini-version.  Its length is 139.1 mm, its width is 69.8, and its thickness is 9. Other characteristics, as well as the software and functionality of both devices, are generally similar. </p><h2>  Expert Summary </h2><p>  According to experts who tested the Highscreen Omega Prime Mini phone, this device, despite its "budget", may well compete in many functions with expensive models.  Therefore, if there is no desire to overpay for a promoted brand, then this smartphone may be the best choice.  The unique advantages of the device, noted by experts: a thin and light body, a fairly large amount of RAM, a good quality display, the presence of several interchangeable panels.  Among the signs that, according to some experts, can be attributed to the shortcomings: a battery with low capacity, as well as not too high quality videos shot with a regular camera.  However, many users who have left reviews about the Highscreen Omega Prime Mini smartphone do not consider these signs to be cons. </p>

    <p>  In terms of style, the smartphone, experts believe, is equally well suited for both men and women.  Elegance, and at the same time, the severity of the lines make it compatible with users of a wide variety of preferences in clothing and fashion. </p><h2>  Competing Solutions </h2><p>  The main competitors of the <span>Russian smartphone</span> are devices manufactured by leading global brands.  Among them - the Asus Padfone Mini phone, Samsing Galaxy 4th version and HTC One - also in mini-versions.  The Russian smartphone is slightly inferior in performance, however, experts believe that in practice, using the device to solve typical user tasks (listening to music, video, browsing the web) may not require a special computing chipset power.  Of course, one of the key advantages of the Highscreen Omega Prime Mini smartphone is the price, which is an average of 7 thousand rubles for shops.  This is about 30-50% lower than that installed by manufacturers of competing solutions from world brands (Samsung, Sony). </p><h2>  User reviews </h2><p>  What can the reviews left by users of the Highscreen Omega Prime Mini users tell us (not counting the ones to which we have already referred above)?  A significant part of the owners of the gadget agree with the opinion of experts that the main advantage of the device is the price.  Basically, users praise the phone and consider it a worthy alternative to solutions from leading world brands.  According to some owners of the gadget, Omega Prime Mini is the best smartphone in its segment in terms of combining price and functionality. </p><p>  Of course, a significant part of laudations relates to the possibilities of personalization due to interchangeable panels (we spoke about this at the very beginning).
