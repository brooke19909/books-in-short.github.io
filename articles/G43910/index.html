    <p>  Near famous tourist centers such as Kolomyia and Sheshory, there are many places worthy of your attention.  The city of Kosov is a district center, which is located on both banks of the Rybnitsa River.  Since ancient times, it has played an important role in the life of the Hutsul region, since it lies at the intersection of the main trade routes leading to Galicia and Podillia.  And today it is considered the unspoken capital of the Carpathian souvenirs.  A large souvenir market is open every Saturday, and it opens at three in the morning.  At almost every step there are small and large shops, which Kosovo invites tourists to hospitably.  The sights of the city are very diverse, so it is better to inspect them for several days. </p><p>  Goods and crafts sold in Kosovo are made by craftsmen in the city or its environs.  In the days of Austria-Hungary, carpet weaving, <span>arts and crafts</span> flourished here <span>.</span>  In the Soviet period, the city acquired the status of a resort.  Thousands of vacationers come here to improve their health at <span>recreation centers</span> and in private pensions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãof Kosov" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/292434.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Kosov, whose map is literally crowded with places of interest to visit, is an old city.  It was first mentioned in documents in 1424 as a village.  Salt was found here in the sixteenth century, so Kosovo has become a town.  They closed the salt bath in the middle of the twentieth century.  Repeatedly, the city was attacked by Turks and Tatars, as well as militant neighbors, but, like a <span>fairy bird, the</span> Phoenix, was reborn again in its beauty and grandeur. </p><p>  Kosov, whose sights are worth your attention, was inhabited by different peoples.  Ukrainians, Poles, Austrians and, of course, Jews left their mark in the city.  An important historical and cultural monument is the ancient Kirkut cemetery, where each tombstone can be considered a work of art.  The wooden Orthodox Church of the Nativity of <span>John the Baptist,</span> built in the Hutsul style in 1912, remembers the Patriarch of the UOC-KP Vladimir.  Near it is a cemetery with gloomy, but interesting crypts and tombstones.  Locals will show you the place where before there was another wooden church (built in 1895), burned down in 2009.  Rebuilt, it is much different from its predecessor.  In addition, there are two churches with original design in the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kosovo map" class="if" height="391" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/292436.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Young tourists also dream of visiting Kosovo.  Its sights are not only sacred structures, amazing nature and souvenirs.  Here is also the residence of St. Nicholas, who on December 19 brings gifts to every obedient child and leaves them under his pillow.  Everyone can come here to chat with the saint, tell him about their aspirations, ask them to fulfill their cherished dream. </p>
