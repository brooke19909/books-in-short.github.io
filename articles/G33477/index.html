Local landscapes, blue bays, snow-white fishing villages, olive groves - all this may seem unrealistically vivid, like a picture of a skilled artist.  No wonder the God of heaven - Zeus - chose Greece as his place of residence, its picturesque Mount Olympus. </p><p>  Greece is the cradle of ancient civilization.  She is considered the <span>birthplace of the Olympic Games.</span>  Those who rested here, say that in just a few days on the land of Hellas you get used to being in an unusual corner of paradise and stop feeling the border between myth and reality. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel rating 4" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/759229.jpg" width="600"></div>

Among them are many that have been chosen by Russians for several years, for example, Pegasos <span>Beach Hotel, Lindos Princess</span> and Medblue Gennadi Hotel 4 *.  We‚Äôll talk about the last hotel today. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  This is a relatively new hotel located in a quiet area of ‚Äã‚ÄãGennadi.  It is located in a part of Rhodes, untouched by civilization, in the south of the island in the village of the same name.  Just fifty meters from the hotel, the waves of the Mediterranean splash around a clean, quiet pebble beach.  Medblue Gennadi 4 * on the map of the island can be found about a kilometer from Gennadi, a small village with many shops and bars, traditional taverns.  In the center of the village, within walking distance from the hotel, there is a medical center, there is a post office, pharmacy and excellent restaurants.  They are only ten minutes walk away.  Famous attractions such as the Acropolis of Lindos, the castle of Monolithos and Prasonisi are also nearby. </p><p>  A sandy, gently sloping beach is one of the main advantages of the Medblue Gennadi.  300 meters separate it from the <span>bus stop,</span> from which every half hour into the island, towards Lindos, transport departs.  The compact and well-groomed area of ‚Äã‚Äãseven thousand square meters is fully equipped. </p>

    <p>  Many of those who rested in this hotel speak of it as a great opportunity to visit this land.  Russians separately note almost a family atmosphere and excellent cuisine.  Many express special thanks to the chef. </p><p>  Most tourists liked the fact that the hotel is located away from city noise, in a secluded corner, where you can still find wildlife.  Guests are satisfied not only with delicious food and comfortable rooms, but also with the work of the staff, whose cordiality and responsiveness were highly appreciated. </p><p>  The only drawback noted by some Russians is the lack of ATMs at the hotel.  In order to cash out, I had to get to the center of the village of Gennadi, although some found this forced walk only pleasant. </p>
