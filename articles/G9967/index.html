    <h2>  Where is the hotel "Deauville" (Anapa) located </h2><p>  The most important thing in the location of the resort hotel is its remoteness from the sea.  As for the Deauville hotel (Anapa), it is only 500 meters from the clean sandy beach.  The city center is approximately 2.5 km away.  But do not be afraid of this distance.  You can go for a walk at any time, because a free shuttle service is provided daily for guests.  As for the main transport hubs, the railway station is 5 kilometers away from the hotel, but the airport is 13 kilometers away. </p><h2>  Resort Hotel Rooms </h2><p>  Hotel Deauville (Anapa) pays great attention to the state of its number of rooms.  For yourself, you can choose one of the following options: </p><ul><li>  If you are traveling alone, then the best option for you would be a single standard room.  Despite the fact that the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe room is very compact, a cot or a crib can be located here. </li><li>  The double standard as a whole is very similar to the previous category.  Nevertheless, it features a large amount of space, as well as the presence of two full beds for a comfortable stay. </li><li>  Superior apartments can also be described as superior standard rooms.  There is a large double bed, as well as a sofa bed, which can serve as an extra bed for one adult guest or 2 children. </li><li>  Standard family room consists of two rooms and is designed for comfortable accommodation of four guests.

It has everything you need to comfortably accommodate four adults and two children.  Here, among other things, a kitchen corner is provided where you can independently cook food for yourself and your loved ones. </li><li>  Two-room "suite" is a combination of a miniature double bedroom, as well as a luxurious spacious living room.  By the way, an extra guest can sit on it on a soft sofa. </li><li>  "Superior Suite" differs from the previous category with an impressive area, as well as a wider list of upholstered furniture. </li><li>  Three-room executive apartments are comparable to real royal chambers.  In addition to incredible comfort, this room will also bring you a real <span>aesthetic pleasure</span> from luxurious classic design. </li></ul><p>  We can not say about the design of the apartments of the hotel "Deauville" (Anapa).

    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Despite an impeccable reputation, there are still some flaws and shortcomings at the Deauville Hotel SPA 5 * hotel (Anapa).  Guest reviews speak of the following negative points: </p><ul><li>  given that the hotel is designed for families, it is very strange that the transport that meets guests from the station or from the airport does not provide for special child seats; </li><li>  in this hotel it is strictly forbidden to visit the pool with young children, but at the same time there are no conditions to leave the child under supervision while the parents go to the spa; </li><li>  breakfast is rather meager and monotonous; </li><li>  in the private parking lot some suspicious persons constantly hang out, but the security does not react to it in any way; </li><li>  it‚Äôs very inconvenient that on the way to the sea you need to cross the roadway; </li><li>  overpriced food in restaurants and cafes; </li><li>  when you check into a hotel, no one will help you carry your suitcases to your room and will not even lead you to the door (and the hotel area is large and it‚Äôs easy to get lost in it); </li><li>  when you come to the restaurant for breakfast, you can often find the doors closed (even if the line is going, the staff does not think to speed up); </li><li>  there is a lack of high-quality animation (despite the fact that such personnel are available, he does not organize any entertainment); </li><li>  on the playground there is no lighting for walking at night; </li><li>  there are no garbage cans on the territory, and therefore you have to carry everything with you. </li></ul><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  If you are used to relaxing in an atmosphere of luxury, then the SPA Deauville hotel (Anapa) will be an ideal option for you.  Reviews of tourists especially note the interior of public areas, as well as the design of rooms.  You can not ignore the landscape design of the park area, where there are many decorative elements.  At the same time, cleanliness is respected everywhere, and friendly staff is at your service.  Be sure to pay attention to the numerous catering establishments that specialize in different culinary trends. </p><p> Nevertheless, the Deauville Hotel (Anapa) raises a number of complaints.  Reviews vacationers mainly focus on inflated prices, as well as some organizational issues.  So, there are some questions to the work of animation.  The system of work with children is not thought out.  There are also some problems with getting far to the sea, and the hotel does not provide special transport. </p><p>  In general, the hotel justifies its high status, but you should never stop there.  If the administration takes into account the comments of the guests, it will be possible to talk about reaching a fundamentally new level of service. </p>
