Can I listen to another person‚Äôs mobile phone?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Before thinking about, say, how to listen to a wife‚Äôs mobile phone, it is worth taking into account the fact that any interference with a person‚Äôs personal life is completely illegal.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter who you belong to: wife, husband, sister, mother and so on.  Therefore, if you suddenly seriously decided to attend to this problem, keep in mind that all the actions you take are contrary to the law. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to listen to a mobile phone" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15109/379508.jpg" width="468"></div></h2><h2>  How to listen to a mobile phone legally? </h2><p>  The answer is simple - no way.  Only law enforcement agencies can carry out wiretapping, and only if they have court orders.  In this case, they are assisted directly by the cellular communications operator, which is obliged, according to the decision, to provide maximum assistance to law enforcement agencies. </p><p>  An ordinary person can never use this service of mobile operators.  Unless you find a person working in law enforcement who agrees to help you solve this problem. </p><h2>  Are there any other options for listening to a mobile phone? </h2><p>  In our modern time, when, as they say, progress is moving by leaps and bounds, there are many ways how you can listen to a mobile phone.  One of them is the use of special equipment.  Based on this option, a person who needs to receive certain information uses special, usually very expensive equipment, due to which the outgoing signal from the victim‚Äôs mobile phone is intercepted on the way to the base of the mobile operator. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Despite the fact that this method is more than expensive, it allows you to listen without going into contact with the victim. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to listen to wife‚Äôs cell phone" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15109/379510.jpg?1398165005211" width="385"></div></h2><h2>  Strange MMS </h2><p>  It is no secret that most of the detective agencies employ former employees of secret intelligence services.  Sometimes they reveal their secrets to how to listen to a cell phone.  This option is possible due to the genius of programmers or hackers.  In order to use this listening method, all you need to know is the victim‚Äôs phone number.  A special virus program is attached to the picture, which is sent as a regular MMS message to a specific number.  As soon as the subscriber opens the message for reading, the Trojan program is quickly activated in the phone and starts its work. </p><p>  Now we can talk not only about how to listen to someone else's mobile phone.  This virus allows you to listen to conversations that are conducted outside the device.  Even if the subscriber turns off the smartphone, listening will continue. </p><h2>  Smart Phones </h2><p>  If we are talking about what kind of listening devices exist for mobile phones, then first of all I would like to note the device itself. </p>

    <p>  It is known for certain that there are certain models of smartphones that have built-in programs that allow not only to listen to the subscriber's telephone conversations, but also to read all SMS correspondence, as well as to listen to the environment.  Of course, you will not find such devices on free sale. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is known that some Internet resources are actively selling listening devices and the smartphones described above in particular.  If you had an idea to purchase such a telephone to give to your spouse or spouse, then pay special attention to such offers.  Otherwise, you run the risk of paying 30 thousand for an ordinary Chinese smartphone without any spyware. </p><h2>  Do you believe sites on the Internet? </h2><p>  Believe it or not, it's up to you.  In fact, the sources that offer assistance in resolving the issue of how to listen to someone else's mobile phone should be treated with extreme caution.  If you look closely, the cost of any equipment for wiretapping is quite high.  This is not only about spy phones, but also about bugs and other devices. </p><p>  You may be asked to pay only a fraction of the cost.  But this amount is also very impressive, especially when you consider the fact that there are at least a dozen people like you. </p>

    <p>  Therefore, before rushing headlong into an adventure, acquiring super-listening devices, think carefully about whether you are ready to throw a certain amount of money down the drain.  Yes, just take it and throw it away!  Not?  Then, perhaps, it‚Äôs not worth it to try buying a bride, as it is unknown to anyone? </p><h2>  Malware </h2><p>  In fact, you can install a virus on your phone that will spy and send you reports on the information received, manually.  In order to understand how to listen to a mobile phone using spyware, you will need the program itself and access to the victim‚Äôs phone. </p><p>  Install via the Internet, activate and ... listen to everything and everyone.  True, for this you need to have the software itself.  But, again, be vigilant, because there are plenty of people earning "divorce" of users on the network. </p><p>  As a rule, such "craftsmen" in all colors paint the charms of this program.  They offer an absolutely perfect option on how to listen to the victim‚Äôs mobile phone.  The fraudsters justify their kindness by the fact that, for example, being once deceived by their beloved wife or husband, they show solidarity and want to help everyone who finds themselves in such a similar situation. </p>

Sometimes, after downloading a program, you will suddenly find the simplest software for installing bluetooth, for example.

    <p>  In some cases, the program will download to your computer without the installation file, which you will be offered to buy at a separate price. </p><h2>  Be carefull </h2><p>  In fact, when deciding how to listen to a mobile phone, you may find yourself under the hood yourself.  Ask yourself: do you know which files you install on your PC?  But what if they contain any Trojan viruses that will subsequently steal your personal information? </p>

    <p>  It‚Äôs good if you have excellent anti-virus protection on your computer.  But it is known that some users simply neglect it. </p><p>  Performing deliberately illegal actions, think about the fact that the question of whether they can listen to a mobile phone that is in your personal use, you may well get an affirmative answer.  I wonder how you will feel in such a situation?  Will you be offended and outraged because you are an honest person?  Think about it, perhaps the person you are going to spy on is also not doing anything immoral.  Maybe you just misunderstood something? </p>
