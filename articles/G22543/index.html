    <p>  But the truth, as they say, is hiding somewhere nearby.  Without a doubt, the large screen is more convenient to use, but not every manufacturer is able to make a device that would be as balanced as possible both in price and in its characteristics in terms of management and operation.  However, an exception to the rule is not so rare in the smartphone market, so the Keneksi Crystal series can be considered as such.  The device can be attributed to the budget segment, because the model is relatively inexpensive (about 8 thousand rubles) and carries a good potential, which can and should interest a potential consumer. </p><p>  So, the hero of today's review is the Keneksi Crystal smartphone.  Let's try to analyze all its advantages along with the disadvantages, taking into account the opinions of experts and reviews of ordinary users. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Turning the device in your hands for several minutes, we can say that the model was created with an obvious eye on the Samsung Galaxy Note gadget.  In principle, there is nothing wrong with this, because imitation of the best (and this is a fact that the line has provided itself with the title of the best tablets of our time) is in itself commendable.  Even if we take into account such a significant indicator as build quality, the Keneksi Crystal phone does not lag behind its older "cousin" in anything. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The similarity with the Korean counterpart is especially noticeable due to the design of the rear panel of the a-la leather device: imitation is visible not only in the ‚Äústitching‚Äù, but also in the textured pattern itself.  But in fact, the back of the gadget, like Samsung, is made of plastic. </p><p>  The front of the smartphone, albeit remotely, is somewhat reminiscent of the Huawei line.  But the format of modern gadgets simply does not allow other design refinements, so, anyway, it‚Äôs quite difficult to come up with the original design of the ‚Äúface‚Äù of the device - they are all the same. </p><p>  Nevertheless, Keneksi Crystal Black has its own distinctive design features along with individual notes.  A metal frame is stretched around the entire perimeter of the front of the smartphone, giving a feeling of solidity, reliability and, probably, security.  If you look at the device in profile, you can see that the frame, firstly, consists of two parts, and secondly, is quite thick, and this is undoubtedly an original and interesting solution. </p><p>  In general, metal tricks are widespread in the design of Keneksi Crystal.  A review of the phone showed that the speaker grilles are made of metal, the micro-USB connector is covered with a metal plate, and even the screws holding the half of the case are made of the same material. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Build quality </h2><p>  Judging by user reviews, bench tests, and the previous paragraph, we can confidently say that the build quality of the Keneksi Crystal Black is performed at a height that some of Sony, Samsung and Lenovo‚Äôs favorites could not climb.  If we take into account the large screen along with the cost, then an unambiguous conclusion is not difficult - the model has no competitors in its segment. </p>

    <p>  The only thing some users complain about in their reviews is the other side of the ‚Äúmetal craze‚Äù - the weight of the device has reached 200 grams and is clearly felt in the hand. </p><p>  Under the lid, just above the battery, you can see two slots for SIM cards and one for micro-drives, with which, it should be noted, you should be very careful.  It's all about the floor layout, specific to the Keneksi Crystal line.  The characteristics of the slots are easy to confuse: the bottom is for mini-SIM cards (that is, a full-sized SIM), then there is a micro-SIM card and closes their groove for micro-drives.  In any case, before sticking something somewhere, it is better to leaf through the manual - it certainly will not be superfluous. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The layout of the case has a standard look: the volume rocker and the On / Off key are placed on the right side of the device, and the headset jacks and the charger connector are located on the top end of the smartphone. </p><p>  At the top of the Keneksi Crystal display are functional sensors and a front camera, along with LED indicators that are responsible for ping events and states of the gadget.  Touch buttons are located under the display, which for the Android system means a significant saving of screen space. </p><h2>  Hardware platform </h2><p>  The hardware base of the device is one of the most common SoC platforms from MediaTek MT6582 series.  It fits perfectly into the overall architecture of Keneksi Crystal.  Reviews of the new platform (2013) are very flattering: it has not lost its relevance and provides a smartphone with relatively high performance with relatively low power consumption. </p>

    <p>  The platform includes an ARM Cortex-A7 processor on four cores with a clock frequency of 1.3 GHz and a dual-core 400 MHz Mali 400MP MP-2 video chip. </p><p>  Through the SoC platform, GSM, Wi-Fi, 3G-modem and wireless Bluetooth are working.  Everything on this list works like a clock, and there are no complaints. </p><p>  The volume of the built-in flash memory Keneksi Crystal for all modifications is 8 GB, of which about 5.5 GB are available to the user for its programs and files.  RAM device - 1 GB without expandability. </p><h2>  Software platform </h2><p>  The smartphone runs on the platform of the Android 4.2.2 operating system with the default firmware MDLY MP.11 P4. </p>

    <p>  The interface of the latest OS has received a number of modifications, which are mainly aimed at the cosmetic mainstream (multi-colored icons in menu items, clearer outlines of icons, etc.). </p><p>  Pressing the context menu button on the main screen brings up a detailed customized section at the bottom of the display where you can perform the main desktop settings: change the theme, choose a wallpaper, add elements, and more. </p><p>  User reviews point out one interesting feature that they really liked about the Keneksi Crystal model.  A review of the screen at the time of locking allows you to instantly start the camera, dialer or SMS editor, which is very convenient. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The smartphone screen is the highlight of the model.  Its main advantages are high brightness and good viewing angles.  The modes work quite adequately, although the automatic brightness sometimes overestimates the values, but it‚Äôs hard to call it a drawback, rather it‚Äôs a distinctive feature of the device. </p>

    <p>  The display can simultaneously support up to five touches, which is more than enough for both games and serious work.  The resolution for the 5-inch gadget is normal - 1280 by 720 pc, as well as the density of the dots.  The display does not burden the GPU, working with confidence and stability, which can not be said about analogues with Full HD-development. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The Keneksi Crystal model is equipped with two types of cameras: the front with a resolution of 2 megapixels and the main - 8 megapixels.  The main camera has autofocus and a maximum aperture of f / 2.4. </p>

    <p>  The quality of the photo and video from the front camera is enough to communicate via Skype.  The main camera of the smartphone can take more or less high-quality photos from the video thanks to autofocus and a fast lens. </p><h2>  Performance and battery </h2><p>  The performance of the smartphone by modern standards is very good.  Software from An Tu Tu shows good results, evaluating the device at 19,000 integral points.  Similar programs give similar results - a solid average. </p><p>  Games on the device are relatively fast, and if 2D applications literally ‚Äúfly‚Äù, then programs loaded with 3D graphics can experience some problems, like FPS jerks and subsidence. </p><p>  In terms of battery life, the model showed itself in a very good light, even despite such a large display.  Charging lasts a long time, and in normal modes the phone can last about two to three days. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  The Keneksi Crystal smartphone is an extremely balanced device, which in our time is more likely an exception than a rule.  High-quality assembly, a large and bright display with an IPS matrix, excellent battery life and an extremely reasonable price make this device very attractive, especially since for such money it is very difficult to find something really worthwhile in this segment. </p><p>  The verdict is clear - we recommend buying. </p>
