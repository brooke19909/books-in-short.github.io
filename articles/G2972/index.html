How does this relate to the Samsung Note 5 reviewed by the reader?  We‚Äôll talk about this today, and also figure out what the device can offer potential buyers. </p>

    <p>  Samsung Note 5, a review of which spread on the Web shortly after the smartphone entered the international arena of mobile devices, became a niche product due to the application of the castling policy, which was described a little earlier.  Thus, this unit is available for purchase in a limited number of markets.  From the very beginning, device sales began in the homeland of the smartphone.  It is, of course, about South Korea.  From there, breaking hundreds of kilometers, the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Dual SIM, a review of which will be of interest to all potential buyers, enters the United States of America.  In the Russian Federation, official sales will begin only <span>on the eve of the New Year.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Causes </h2>

    <p>  So, why is the fate of the apparatus in this way?  Significant influence was exerted by the popularity that the EDGE + model gained.  According to some sales data, the demand for the device exceeded that of the Galaxy S6.  As a result, the deficit turned out to be very, very high.  And this, in turn, led to the fact that the company urgently increased the pace of production of such components as curved screens.  Among the advantages of the device was a rather interesting appearance obtained during the application of the original solution, and this only mobilized sales.  As you know, the smartphone market running the Android operating system is nothing more than a bunch of devices of the same type (in terms of design), in which the original appearance is an exception to the rule.  Couldn't an apparatus equipped with an individual design really like an audience? </p><p>  Actually, that's why it was decided to create Note 5 Duos, a review of which was made by more than one specialist in the field of smartphones.  Initially, the company's engineers proposed an idea in which they mentioned the possibility of equipping the EDGE + model with a stylus.  However, later, having examined and elaborated on this issue in more detail, experts came to the conclusion that such a decision should be discarded.  The problem was that the curved screen crossed out the convenient use of the stylus.  Probably, many remember the turmoil that arose due to the decision of the South Korean manufacturer to promote two models simultaneously on the smartphone market.  Now we are talking about the apparatus ‚ÄúC6‚Äù and ‚ÄúC6 Edge‚Äù.  The company took into account the sad experience of confusion, and that is why it once again abandoned attempts to sit on two chairs.  Which probably affected the quality of sales positively. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Note Product Line Benefits </h2>

    <p>  What users like this line of phablet?  The basis of popularity is laid by innovative (and so far the best) technological solutions.  This applies mainly to hardware stuffing.  Modules of cameras, memory, and processor are counted.  And engineers work on the software, trying to bring it to mind and optimize as much as possible.  Thus, we can say that the Note line (or rather, devices included in this product line) are equipped with the latest prototypes of operating systems (at least at the time the device entered the international mobile arena). </p><p>  The company's approach to this issue is also interesting.  Of course, competitors of the South Korean manufacturer can offer potential buyers similar devices.  However, there is one very important point: such devices appear on sale two or three years later, starting from the moment the Samsung device enters the international arena.  The Nexus 6 is an example. AMOLED matrix screens have a market gap of about three years.  Along with reduced energy efficiency, not very good brightness and backlight, as well as some other technical limitations, these parameters automatically make the smartphone unprofitable in terms of acquisition. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Of course, we can break the characteristics of smartphones into exceptional, individual parameters and already compare them with other devices.  But this is not practical, right?  Therefore, we can come to one simple conclusion that, in terms of aggregate characteristics, the devices defined in the Nout model line surpass their competitors by far.  Not giving the latter absolutely no chance.  And the thing here is probably in the components.  If the South Korean manufacturer has the corresponding elements in its arsenal, then other companies simply do not have them.  Well, it‚Äôs time for us to move from words to deeds, and we will begin, perhaps, with the parameters of the device. </p><h2>  Galaxy Note 5: review </h2>

    <p>  The characteristics of the device are as follows.  On board the smartphone, the latest version of the ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù version, 5.1.1, was installed as the operating system.  At the same time, a custom shell called TouchWiz is built in to use the phone.  A few words should be said specifically about her.  In the course of optimization work, TouchViz was greatly facilitated so that the user feels more comfortable and does not get confused in the navigation fields of the software. </p><h2>  Screen </h2>

    <p>  The South Korean manufacturer this time turned out to be a fairly dimensional device.  What is only one screen, the diagonal of which is 5.7 inches.  A kind of "shovel", as I would like to say.  But nevertheless, it is not possible to insult the model in such a way, since the engineers and designers have thoroughly got along with other relevant indicators.  For the rest, we note that the picture is displayed on the screen in Quad HD quality.  This means that the resolution will be 1440 by 2560 pixels.  Their density is 518 pieces per inch.  The matrix of the screen is made by SuperAMOLED technology.  The brightness level is simply excellent, in terms of color rendering, the smartphone occupies one of the first places in its segment, if not the first. </p><h2>  Chipset </h2>

    <p>  The Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Duos, a review of the technical characteristics of which should be studied before buying, has 4 gigabytes of RAM.  For storage of personal data, a different amount is allocated to the smartphone user (depending on the specification of the purchased model).  It can be 32, 64 and 128 GB.  It is logical that the more internal memory in the device, the more expensive it will cost a potential buyer.  At the same time, we note that there is no support for external microSD drives.  This means that fans of storing huge files on their device will have to fork out for a version with 64 or 128 GB of long-term memory.  Perhaps the lack of support for flash cards can be called one of the main shortcomings of the hero of our review today. </p><h2>  Connections </h2><p>  The communications set of Samsung Galaxy Note 5 EDGE, the review of which we conclude with a review of the main advantages and disadvantages of the phone, is quite good.  It has bluetooth version 4.2, Wi-Fi, operating in the bands a, b, g, n, ac, as well as an integrated LTE module in the device.  It makes it possible to work with fourth-generation cellular networks.  In fact, this means that the user will be much more comfortable using the Internet, loading pages, pictures, music and movies faster. </p><p>  For synchronization with a personal computer or laptop, a MicroUSB 2.0 connector is provided.  It is also useful for recharging the phone from the mains or an external power source.  The role of the latter can be an external battery for a certain number of amperes.  A good solution would be to purchase, for example, for 10,000 if you spend the whole day where there is no possibility of charging from the network.  Such a battery will allow you to raise the charge from 0 to 100 percent more than two times. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  The resolution of the front camera is 5 megapixels.  The main one is much more powerful.  She gives really cool, high-quality pictures.  The resolution of the main camera module is 16 megapixels.  For night shooting, an LED flash is provided.  Needless to say, the camera is equipped with an auto focus function?  Probably not.  There is optical stabilization, and the video is recorded in 4K resolution. </p><h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  The battery of the device is quite capacious - 3,000 milliamps per hour.  You can charge your phone wirelessly using one of two standards.  Fast charge up to 90 percent takes one hour.  Up to 100 percent in 90 minutes.  In mixed mode, the device will be able to work up to one day.  Continuous playback of video clips or movies will completely discharge the phone in 13 hours. </p><h2>  Dimensions </h2><p>  The dimensions of the smartphone in all three planes are the ratio of 153.2 (in height) to 76.1 (in width) to 7.6 (in thickness) millimeters.  In this case, the mass of the device does not exceed 171 grams.  Recall that the full review of Samsung Note 5 was released by the official manufacturer.  And now it's time to move on to the results of the article. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  What conclusions can be drawn based on the feedback from users who purchased this phone model?  Among the advantages (you can say, by default) were the quality and volume of the spoken and sound speaker.  The interlocutor is perfectly audible, there is always a good supply of volume.  At the same time, the sound is clear.  Microphones also pleased: at the other end of the invisible wire you will be heard no worse.  In general, the good work of the company's engineers, which will allow you to comfortably communicate with a person even in a fairly noisy environment. </p><p>  Good communication quality can also be written as a definite plus.  Needless to say, if the connection is not lost, does not disappear, everything works stably.  And this applies both to the Wi-Fi module, and to work in cellular networks.  There are no complaints about LTE.  In terms of communications, the work of engineers on software and the operating system helped in some way. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Among the significant shortcomings, the reviews highlight the lack of memory cards.  You will either have to be content with the 32 gigabyte version, or overpay for a larger amount.  Another solution to the problem is the use of cloud storage.  However, this is also not always convenient.  For some people, the lack of support for an external microSD drive can play a crucial role. </p>
