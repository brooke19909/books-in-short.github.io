    <h2>  The cultural life of the capital during the reign of Elizaveta Petrovna </h2><p>  With the accession to the throne of the new empress, the next stage in the formation of cultural spheres began in the state.  This heyday had an impact on the capital.  The city was significantly transformed.  In the era of the cultural development of St. Petersburg, preference was given to the construction of architectural monuments.  The Summer <span>Palace</span> deserves special attention <span>.</span>  <span>The palaces of</span> St. Petersburg to this day delight the eyes of residents and tourists. </p><p>  During the reign of Elizabeth Petrovna (1741 - 1761), the construction of palaces was of particular importance.  Then the erection of these masterpieces was dealt with by Francesco <span>Bartolomeo Rastrelli,</span> one of the best architects in the history of the state.  Among his works is the Summer Palace of Elizabeth Petrovna.  It should be noted as the best work of the architect. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  General characteristics of the structure </h2><p>  The summer palace of Elizabeth Petrovna in St. Petersburg was erected by B. F. Rastrelli from 1741 to 1744. According to the architect, the building included about 160 apartments, including a church and galleries.  The palace was decorated with numerous sculptures, fountains and a garden.  Over time, the residence felt a whole series of changes associated with the dissatisfaction of the architect with their work.  For several years, construction activities continued here. </p><h2>  Summer Palace of Elizabeth Petrovna: the history of construction </h2><p>  The territory on which Mikhailovsky Castle is located in the first half of the 18th century belonged to the Summer Garden - the royal estate of Peter I. On this site, Empress Anna Ioannovna was ordered to begin the construction of the palace.  The construction was entrusted to architect Rastrelli Jr.  But the architect did not have time to start work during the life of the empress. </p><p>  In 1740, power passed to <span>Anna Leopoldovna,</span> who decided to implement a project founded by her predecessor.  But after some time, a <span>palace coup</span> takes place <span>,</span> as a result of which imperial power passes to the youngest daughter of Peter I, Elizabeth.  Tsesarevna gives F. B. Rastrelli the order for the construction of the Summer Palace.  The Empress liked the result of the architect's work so much that she doubled his salary. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The exact date of laying the building is still controversial.  According to some historians, this event falls on July 24, 1741. Moreover, the beginning of the bookmarking took place in the presence of Empress Anna, her husband, as well as some courtiers and members of the guard. </p>

    <h2>  Features of the architectural style </h2><p>  The Summer Palace of Elizabeth Petrovna belongs to the Russian Baroque style.  This was the name of the set of architectural trends that formed on the territory of the Russian Empire and the Russian state in the XII - XIII centuries.  The structures of this period were characterized by: </p><ul><li>  splendor and intricacy of architectural forms; </li><li>  luxurious finishes; </li><li>  using sculpting; </li><li>  application of painting and gilding. </li></ul><p>  Among the styles of this era, the <span>Peter the Great Baroque is</span> distinguished <span>,</span> which arose thanks to the buildings of not only compatriots, but also architects from Western Europe.  They were invited by Peter I to ennoble the new capital, St. Petersburg. </p><p>  The most characteristic features of Peter's Baroque were: </p><ul><li>  abandonment of the Byzantine manner; </li><li>  simplicity and practicality; </li><li>  facades in red and white shades; </li><li>  the presence of symmetry of forms; </li><li>  mansard roofs; </li><li>  Arched window openings. </li></ul>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  What the Summer Palace looked like </h2><p>  Many of the engravings and drawings that have been preserved from that era almost exactly reflect the appearance of the palace.  Stone was chosen as the basis for the first floor, and wood for the second floor.  The building was painted in light pink shades, which is noteworthy for the Baroque style.  The basement is made of granite in gray-green color.  The summer palace of Empress Elizabeth Petrovna had two facades: the main facade overlooked the Moika, in the direction of the Summer Garden, and the other on the Neva prospect. </p><p>  Office buildings were located around the entire perimeter, which imitated a peculiar isolation. </p><p>  A wide road was laid along the Fontanka, which was accompanied by greenhouses and fruit trees.  Part of this territory was occupied by the Elephant Yard, the inhabitants of which, if desired, bathed in the Fontanka. </p><p>  The entrance to the palace was surrounded by wide gates, on which gilded double-headed eagles poured.  The gate was decorated with an openwork lattice.  Behind the fence was a large front yard. </p><p>  The view of the main facade was blocked by large flower beds and trees, which made up a kind of park. </p><p>  The central building was occupied by the Grand Front Hall.  It was decorated with Bohemian mirrors, marble sculptures and paintings by famous artists.  At the west side of the hall was the royal throne.  Living rooms, decorated with gilded carvings, led directly to the front hall.  Outside, curly staircases approached the room. </p><p>  Towards the Moika flaunted flower stalls.  There were also three fountain pools with complex shapes. </p>

    <h2>  Further transformations of the palace </h2><p>  During the year, a covered gallery was completed, through which you could take a walk to the Summer Garden.  On the walls of such a gallery were paintings by famous painters.  There was also designed a terrace with a hanging garden, located at the mezzanine level, where the Hermitage and the fountain were located.  The contour of the terrace was fenced with gilded bars.  Later, a palace church was attached to this site. </p><p>  After some time, a decorative park was planted near the palace.  A huge maze, bosquets and arbors passed through it.  Swings and carousels were placed in the center of the park. </p><p>  A complex of water towers was built on the territory adjacent to the palace, as the former water supply to the fountains did not have the necessary pressure.  Similar water towers were ennobled with the help of palace paintings. </p><p>  Architect Rastrelli was not satisfied with his work.  For this reason, after a decade, he brought the wooden Summer Palace of Elizabeth Petrovna to a real masterpiece.  Rastrelli regularly remade parts of the building.  So, later the walls were transformed with the help of curly platbands of windows and atlantes.  Lion masks and mascarons also served as their decoration. </p>

    <h2>  Destination </h2><p>  The summer residence is Elizabeth's first own home.  Before the empress, no one lived in this building.  Tsesarevna occupied the eastern wing of the residence.  The western wing stood out for the courtiers. </p><p>  Queen Elizabeth admired the luxury of the Summer Palace.  Every year, in April, the empress left the Winter Palace to temporarily settle in the summer.  The whole yard moved with her.  This event turned into a real ceremony, which was accompanied by an orchestra and artillery fire.  In September, Elizabeth moved back. </p>

    <h2>  The fate of the summer residence </h2><p>  In 1754, the Summer Palace of Elizabeth Petrovna in St. Petersburg became the birthplace of Paul I, who soon came to power. </p><p>  In 1762, feasts were held here on the occasion of a peace agreement with Prussia. </p><p>  As soon as the new emperor Paul I came to power, he immediately ordered the demolition of the structure.  In its place was built a castle, known today as Mikhailovsky.  It was in this residence that the life of Paul I ended. </p><p>  According to one of the legends, Mikhailovsky Castle was not built by chance on the site of the Summer Palace.  The emperor wished to spend the rest of his life in the place where he was born.  Another legend says that the archangel Michael appeared on guard and ordered the construction of a temple on the territory where the Summer Palace of Elizabeth Petrovna was located.  After this incident, the emperor ordered the construction of a new palace and church in the name of Archangel Michael.  Thus, Mikhailovsky Castle got its name by analogy with the Church of St. Michael the Archangel. </p>
