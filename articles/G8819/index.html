In 1987 and 1988, he won the main poker world championships - World Series of Poker, and then in 1989 he took second place at Phil Hellmuth.  Johnny Chen entered the Poker Hall of Fame in 1992.  For all his games, Johnny received nearly $ 6 million in total. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pokerscout.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Johnny Chen, poker" class="if uuid-2975428" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113069/2975428.jpg"></div><blockquote><p>  There are few players who are trying to trick me.  If anyone decides to bluff at the table and steal the chips, then it will be me. </p></blockquote><h2>  Johnny Chen's childhood </h2><p>  Johnny was born into an ordinary Chinese family in 1957, lived in Cato, also known as Guangzhou, during the first five years of his life.  Guangzhou is a city with a long history, located near the Pearl River and the South China Sea, and it is in this city that Johnny Chen's biography begins. </p><p>  Johnny moved with his family from Canton to Hong Kong in 1962, when he was only five.  The Chen family remained in Hong Kong for four years.  At that time, Hong Kong and all of China were at the center of a bloody cultural revolution. </p><p>  Johnny's parents took him from Hong Kong in 1968, they went across the Pacific to the United States.  They settled in Phoenix, Arizona, where the family lived for the next five years.  Immigration to the United States was difficult for Johnny and his parents, since at that time they did not speak English.  Johnny attended school in Phoenix and received good grades while learning English. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1973, the family moved again, this time to Houston, Texas.  Johnny Chan's parents opened a restaurant in Houston called Hoe Sai Gai, which means "The Great Whirlwind."  At 16, the future poker star attended school and helped parents in their restaurant business.  At that time, Johnny began to show interest in various games: chess, bowling.  Then the guy discovered a new game for himself - poker.  Over the next 24 years, Johnny Chen‚Äôs life really became the Great Whirlwind, as the restaurant was called. </p><h2>  New Life in Las Vegas </h2><p>  Johnny Chen lived in Houston until the age of 21, attended the hotel and restaurant management program at the University of Houston, and planned to continue his family restaurant business.  But Johnny's love of poker was too strong.  In 1978, he left college, left Houston, and moved to Las Vegas to start a new life. </p><p>  Johnny started traveling to Las Vegas at the age of 16 to play poker, although he was a minor.  At that time (70s), casino owners and managers did not care how old the client was if he had money. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cardplayer.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="World Series of Poker" class="if uuid-2975449" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113069/2975449.jpg"></div><p>  When Johnny Chen moved to Las Vegas and started playing, other players underestimated him because of his nationality.  No one at that time thought that an Asian guy could become one of the greatest poker players. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Chen always played very aggressively and was sometimes called a bully at poker tables.  Johnny did not win every time he played, sometimes he had to sell part of his belongings in order to save the bankroll he needed to play poker. </p><h2>  The orient express </h2><p>  Johnny got his nickname when he was a relative newcomer to the poker tournament.  Chen came to Las Vegas to become a professional poker player in 1978, and earned his famous nickname in 1982. </p><p>  For four years, Johnny Chen‚Äôs successful career has grown and matured.  Brunson, a famous poker player, said that Chen needs to learn to understand when to stop playing and how to control his hot temper. </p><p>  In 1982, Johnny Chan's poker game got even better.  At the same time, he decided to change some aspects of his personal life.  Johnny was a heavy smoker, but gave up his cigarette habit, and also began to take care of himself physically, eat better, exercise and give up alcohol. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dimepoker.cl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The orient express" class="if uuid-2982680" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113069/2982680.jpg"></div><p>  In January of the same year, Johnny Chen entered the tournament, which was held in Las Vegas, Nevada.  It was the $ 10,000 Bob Stupac America's Cup No Limit Hold'em tournament.  It was there that Chen showed the world his excellent poker skills, taking first place.  He played well, earned a place at the final table and successfully eliminated 13 of the last 16 players in just 30 minutes.  It was then that Bob Stupac gave him the nickname Orient Express. </p><p>  Johnny, a 25-year-old Asian guy, was on his way to becoming one of the best poker players in the world of all time.  His innate ability to read other players, combined with his self-confidence and keen poker skills, made him a true poker champion. </p><h2>  Top Poker Achievements </h2><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td><p>  date </p></td><td><p>  Tournament Name and Venue </p></td><td><p>  A place </p></td><td><p>  Prize, $ </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  05/11/1987 </p></td><td><p>  18th WSOP, Las Vegas </p></td><td><p>  1 </p></td><td><p>  625000 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  05/01/1988 </p></td><td><p>  19th WSOP, Las Vegas </p></td><td><p>  1 </p></td><td><p>  700,000 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  05/15/1989 </p></td><td><p>  20th WSOP, Las Vegas </p></td><td><p>  2 </p></td><td><p>  302000 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  12/22/1989 </p></td><td><p>  Hall of Fame Poker Classic, Las Vegas </p></td><td><p>  1 </p></td><td><p>  232000 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  05/10/2001 </p></td><td><p>  32nd WSOP, Las Vegas </p></td><td><p>  2 </p></td><td><p>  211210 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  04/29/2003 </p></td><td><p>  34th WSOP, Las Vegas </p></td><td><p>  1 </p></td><td><p>  224400 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  02/01/2005 </p></td><td><p>  Poker Superstars Invitational Tournament, Las Vegas </p></td><td><p>  2 </p></td><td><p>  750,000 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  06/25/2005 </p></td><td><p>  36th WSOP, Las Vegas </p></td><td><p>  1 </p></td><td><p>  303025 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  11/13/2005 </p></td><td><p>  Poker Superstars Invitational Tournament Season 2, Cabazon </p></td><td><p>  1 </p></td><td><p>  400,000 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  06/14/2008 </p></td><td><p>  39th WSOP, Las Vegas </p></td><td><p>  4 </p></td><td><p>  246874 </p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  10 World Series of Poker Bracelets </h2><p>  The World Series of Poker Gold Bracelet is a cherished dream for many players.
