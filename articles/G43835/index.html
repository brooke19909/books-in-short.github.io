The first written records of the existence of a settlement date back to 903.  Some sights of the Pskov region also belong to this date.  Krivichi (the first inhabitants of this territory) founded a settlement on a high hill.  It was limited by the Velikaya and Pskov rivers.  Under Kiev Princess Olga, the already fortified settlement turned into a real city.  And it was in Pskov in 1917 that Emperor Nicholas II abdicated his throne.  This village is full of historical events, incredibly beautiful architectural and cultural sites and pristine nature. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of the pskov region" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/608326.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Ancient settlement </h2><p>  Perhaps it‚Äôs worth starting to describe the sights of the Pskov region from the Vrev settlement.  This is a rather ancient place, which is located on the territory between the city of Ostrov and the village of Pushkin Mountains.  The main attraction here is considered a hill.  In the Middle Ages it was a fortress.  At that time, the settlement was subordinate to the authorities of the Pskov suburb and there were many temples and monasteries under it.  In the last century, Vrev turned into a village.  Residents from the surrounding villages began to gather here, since only in this place were a school, shops, a club. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the entrance to the village, a cemetery is seen, which occupies the largest area in the village.  This is a particularly ancient place.  True, almost all the ancient burial sites were destroyed, so it is impossible to identify them.  Rare stone crosses can be found in this ancient burial ground.  But there is Vrev and the existing cemetery, where quite well-known personalities rest.  For example, here the famous clairvoyant Pskov Maria Rezitskaya found her last refuge.  She is called the Russian Wang, and her gift is still shrouded in secrets and legends. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of pskov and the pskov region" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/608327.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  There is an Island somewhere in Russia </h2><p>  And not just anywhere, but in the Pskov region.  This town belongs to the so-called non-tourist places of Russia.  Only 25 thousand inhabitants live in the Island.  Here the church of the 16th century, an almost integral old city and one-of-a-kind chain bridges from the middle of the 19th century have been preserved. </p><p>  The city has an incredibly convenient location, so those attractions of the Pskov region that are in this village are not at all difficult to see.  The island is one of those regional centers where you can easily get to the regional center.  After all, a large number of both passing and local bus routes run here.  And the town is located at the fork of three highways, so if you do not have time for public transport, then private cabmen are always at your service. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pushkin mountains Pskov region attractions" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/608330.jpg" width="333"></div>

One of these is the Church of St. Nicholas the Miracle Worker, built in 1542.  Its bell tower was erected only in the XIX century.  The altar in this temple is facing north.  No one knows why this is exactly what happened.  One version claims that in this way the abbots emphasize the ownership of the cathedral in Pskov. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="island pskov region attractions" class="if" height="408" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/608328.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It is worth paying attention to chain bridges, which became a masterpiece of engineering skill in the mid-1800s.  They connect the central city square with the left bank of the Great River.  Each bridge reaches 94 meters in length.  The crossing was opened in 1853 in the presence of the emperor himself. </p><h2>  Legends of historical Pskov </h2><p>  There are some <span>sights of Pskov</span> and the Pskov region, which are covered in mystery and darkness.  The rattlesnake tower is the place covered in legends to the greatest extent.  In 1525, this building was built on the right bank of Pskov.  Modern archaeologists put forward the theory that the architect of the design was Ivan Fryazin - an architect from Italy.  The tower was built as a fortification.  This confirms the presence of six tiers and the presence of a large number of loopholes on each of them.  The rattlesnake reaches only 20 meters in height, but this does not interfere with the deployment of a whole military garrison in its internal territories. </p><h2>  Pechora </h2><p>  The town of Pechora is located on the very border of the Republic of Estonia.  The village was founded in 1473.  It also has its own <span>attractions.</span>  <span>Pechora of the</span> Pskov region have much in common with Estonian civilization.  For example, the Pechora monastery has a characteristic urban culture for this power. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of Pechora, Pskov region" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/608329.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  But the Annunciation Church has nothing to do with the Baltic states.  It was erected in 1540 under the abbess Cornelius.  Previously, in its place was the wooden temple of the Forty Martyrs.  Initially, the cathedral served as the refectory.  Today near the Annunciation are Sretenskaya Church (1868-1870) and the Brotherhood Corps (1827). </p><h2>  Village Pushkin mountains </h2><p>  This place gained fame only when there was established a museum-reserve to them.  Pushkin.  Today the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthis institution exceeds 700 hectares. </p><p>  The Pushkin Mountains (Pskov Region), the sights of which have such facilities as a museum post, a monument to Alexander Sergeyevich, Lake Malenets and others, are a rather famous place in Russia.  The museum post is located in the village of Bugrovo.  This is a unique place where you can write a letter with a quill pen, just like it was done in the XIX century. </p><p>  Sights of the Pskov region - it is also a windmill, which is located in the Pushkin Mountains.  It was built in the 80s of the last century.  The initiator of the creation of this masterpiece was writer-naturalist and journalist Vasily Peskov. </p>
