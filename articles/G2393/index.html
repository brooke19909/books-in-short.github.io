  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Legal purity of an apartment purchase transaction</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Is it worth it for the hundredth time to repeat that buying an apartment is an expensive, time-consuming and serious enterprise.  Any inaccuracy, mistake can result in financial and other losses.  Especially in this case, buyers are vulnerable.  They risk being left without money and without an apartment.  In order to avoid unpleasant consequences, the buyer must check the "purity of the transaction" of the sale. <br><br>  A legally competent approach will provide verification of the apartment and the entire process of registration.  The audit is designed to identify and eliminate all possible risks associated with the acquisition of property, no matter what in the future there will be more than one reason to challenge the legality of the purchase of real estate. </p><p>  First step you need <noindex>  <span>check the property in the registry</span> </noindex>  , after that you will know: <br><br>  The identity of the seller <br><br>  In addition to checking the seller‚Äôs passport data, it would be useful to require from the owner a certificate from the psychoneurological clinic about his legal capacity. <br><br>  When examining the passport of the owner of the purchased property, you should pay attention: <br><br>  - the document must meet all the necessary requirements (not to be expired, to have photos); <br><br>  - inscriptions, seals, stamps should be clear; <br><br>  - Corrections, unforeseen entries, lack of pages are not allowed; <br><br>  ¬¨- if there is a marriage stamp, you should find out if the spouse has the right to apply for a share in the apartment. <br><br>  Confirmation of the right to carry out real estate transactions: <br><br>  - verification of the certificate of ownership of the apartment.  It is not enough to verify its availability.  It is important to carefully verify the authenticity of the document; <br><br>  - verification of the power of attorney for the right to conduct transactions with property on behalf of the owner.  The power of attorney must be notarized, valid and not revoked.  To ensure the authenticity of the document, you can make a request to the notary's office; <br><br>  No encumbrance: <br><br>  - An extract from the home of the book is issued by the passport office.  It contains information indicating all persons residing and living in the apartment, information about the arrest for housing; <br><br>  - and an expanded statement of the Unified State Register, contains information about all transactions in relation to real estate; <br><br>  Dangerous moments: <br><br>  The risks of contesting a transaction increase in the presence of such factors: <br><br>  - several resales in recent years; <br><br>  - in the certificate from the house book there are registered citizens, but not registered in another place, as well as temporarily discharged residents (military personnel, prisoners); <br><br>  - previously the apartment was sold by proxy, the authenticity of which is not possible to verify. <br><br>  These are just the main points of checking the apartment.  It is extremely difficult for a real estate specialist to take into account all the nuances and avoid problems when buying a home.  Therefore, it is advisable to use the services of lawyers for a thorough audit.  The title insurance of the transaction also allows to somewhat reduce the risks. </p></div></article>
