The question is different: ‚ÄúBut where is it really worth investing?‚Äù  Any novice investor will be confused without clear guidance, because today there are many investment instruments. </p><p>  If your money will simply lie ‚Äúunder the pillow‚Äù, then inflation will definitely ‚Äúeat it‚Äù.  Of course, making a decision <noindex>  <span>To invest money</span> </noindex>  , you to some extent put them at risk.  But, nevertheless, there are several most proven methods.  For starters, these are various bank deposits.  This species is considered one of the most common today among the population.  Depending on the term and the amount invested, various banks can offer you favorable conditions and interest rates.  In this case, the procedure itself does not require much time and effort on your part.  All that is required is a passport and cash, and then wait for a pleasant accrual of additional funds to your main amount.  But there are those who consider deposits on deposits a relic of the past.  What other promising methods are the most effective and proven? </p><p>  In order to really not only save money from inflation, but also get a solid profit, you can use a mutual investment fund (MIF).  This method is designed for a rather long period of time, and is also intended for a wide range of investors.  In this case, the funds are trusted in the management of well-known companies.  The purpose of their creation is to make a profit, and then the distribution between investors.  Such a fund is not a legal entity, but can be said to represent an investment portfolio, which is conditionally divided into shares.  In addition, a great way to invest, which has always been considered and is considered profitable, is real estate, the prices of which are gradually rising.  Next year, such a property will be very profitable to sell, or lease, making a good profit.  The objects of such real estate can be not only apartments or houses, but also offices, various buildings, and even land, which are also in great demand. </p><p>  What else is a great investment tool is gold.  It is noted that every year there is a rapid trend towards a stable increase in the value of gold.  In addition, even in the inevitable period of inflation or crisis, such a contribution is a kind of quiet haven where you can, figuratively speaking, wait out the storm.  Gold prices are always stable against any economic instability, war, or even a change of government. </p></div></article>
