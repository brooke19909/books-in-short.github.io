    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  To begin with, it is worth saying a few words about the location of the Rahoni Cronwell Park Hotel 5. This complex is located on the second coastline.  The hotel rooms offer scenic views of the Aegean Sea, which can be reached in just a few minutes. </p><p>  Neo Skioni is a former fishing village, which is located in a very cozy, quiet, secluded place.  The only negative is the airport is far away.  It is located in Thessaloniki.  Get from there to the hotel for about an hour and forty minutes.  But there is a definite plus.  Airplanes do not interfere with the guests with their characteristic noise during takeoff and landing. </p><p>  In general, these places are an ideal recreation area.  After all, a 5-star boutique hotel is located on a hill, where olive and coniferous trees grow on each meter.  In addition, the hotel complex has a very beautiful and well-groomed surrounding area.  Exotic and fruit trees are planted here, which pleases the eye and creates an atmosphere of comfort.  By the way, it is interesting that the Skioni coast has been awarded the EU Blue Flag for its cleanliness for several years in a row. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  What is in the complex? </h2><p>  Rahoni Cronwell <span>Park Hotel 5 * is also</span> interesting in that it meets the highest environmental standards.  But the rooms are especially pleasing.  There are only twenty of them, but each is unique in its own way.  The apartment, located on the ground floor, has a green private relaxation area.  And the guests who settled on the second floors have two terraces.  One overlooks the sea, and the other overlooks the coniferous forest. </p><p>  Of these 20 rooms, two are Premium Deluxe.  There are also four Luxury Suites and fourteen - Superior Room.  They will be discussed in more detail later. </p><p>  Also on site is a restaurant called Skionic.  Upon arrival, hotel guests can enjoy Mediterranean and European cuisine in a cozy atmosphere.  But there is also a lobby bar serving alcoholic drinks, soft cocktails, as well as natural tea and coffee.  And you can visit the institution located on the roof of the hotel.  This is the main highlight of the hotel.  The Panorama Bar offers cocktails, drinks and snacks.  But the main thing is a magnificent view of the Aegean Sea. </p>

    <h2>  Standard rooms </h2><p>  Now, it‚Äôs worth briefly telling about apartments that potential guests of the Rahoni Cronwell Park Hotel can book.  The 5-star hotel, as mentioned earlier, offers three categories of rooms.  It‚Äôs worth starting with a standard apartment. </p><p>  Their area is 29 square meters.  m. Inside there is one large 2 double bed and two folding sofas.  There is also a spacious bathroom with a toilet and a balcony with a picturesque view of the sea.  Maximum capacity of this room is 4 people. </p><p>  The apartments have a telephone, a plasma TV with cable and satellite channels, a personal safe, air conditioning, a cozy seating area, a refrigerator, an alarm clock, as well as such nice little things as slippers, a hairdryer, a bathrobe, and toiletries. </p><p>  Such a room will cost about 60-65 thousand rubles (with breakfast included in the price).  If you need a full board, you will have to pay 80-90 tons.  The price depends on when the guest is booking the room, whether discounts are offered.

    <h2>  About booking </h2><p>  It is better to reserve a room in this complex long before the planned trip.  The complex has only 20 rooms, and there are a lot of comers. </p><p>  It is worth noting another nuance.  If guests decide to come with a small child (whose age is less than two years), they will be provided with a cot.  And for the stay of the baby will not need to pay extra.  The same goes for children under 12 years old.  They can sleep in the beds available in the apartment for free, but the property will not provide an extra bed. </p><p>  It should also be remembered that guests who arrived at the resort in May, October or September, also receive a free package of SPA-services.  And this cannot but rejoice.  Indeed, such a gift makes it possible to visit the indoor SPA-pool with hydromassage and heating for free from 9:00 to 12:00.  Also, guests have the right to visit any four saunas at the same time.  If you manage to catch it - then at least everything in a row.  This is a hammam, aromatic and ordinary saunas, as well as a hot stone bath. </p>

    <h2>  Guest Comments </h2><p>  Many people managed to visit the Cronwell Rahoni Park Hotel 5 *.  The reviews that many of them decide to leave are mostly positive. </p><p>  People say that this hotel complex is ideal for those who appreciate a warm, homely atmosphere.  The staff is very friendly and welcoming, and all the guests know each other in person. </p><p>  Many more visitors who do not really like to walk were pleased with the free bus, which regularly takes guests from the hotel to the beach.  And people who just appreciate walks are happy to describe the landscapes that open before their eyes on the way to the sea. </p><p>  Guests who come to rest with children say that one of the most important highlights of the family is animators who speak our language.  By the way, many argue that the hotel is aimed at people who have arrived from the Russian Federation.  A lot of Russian-speaking staff, which can not but rejoice.  But the dictionary should be grabbed - after all, there are employees who explain themselves in other languages. </p><p>  In general, people are advised to go here in the fall, in September.  The climate is mild, the sun is not so hot, the sea is becoming cleaner, and there are not many visitors.  Although, given the modest number of rooms here, you don‚Äôt even have to worry about calm.  It always reigns here. </p><p>  In general, it is an ideal setting for those who want privacy and peace from relaxation.  Therefore, if you want to get an unforgettable experience and for a long time stock up with pleasant memories, it is worth going here. </p>
