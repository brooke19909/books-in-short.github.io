There is the art of making a lot of money, and there is the art of spending it beautifully.  Usually mastery of the first skill excludes success in the second.  A person who will skillfully combine his income and expenses will become a truly excellent banker of his life. </p><p>  To date, a number of all kinds of theories have been described on how <span>to attract money to yourself.</span> </p><h3>  <strong>Cost control principle</strong> </h3><p>  Let's analyze one of the principles of achieving the wealth of famous authors and see why it does not affect many people. </p><p>  This is the principle of tight control over your expenses.  It lies in the fact that it is necessary to keep scrupulous records and record daily expenses.  In addition, you need to try to save at least 10% of your income every month. </p><p>  If you are guided by this principle, then theoretically with each month there will be more money.  And the result should be prosperity and wealth.  But let's make sense of what is happening in reality. </p><h3>  <strong>Failed result</strong> </h3><p>  To avoid a failed result, it is necessary to realize that by saving money it is impossible to become a rich person.  In the process of saving, there is negative information that there is very little money, there is always not enough money, you need to control costs.  As a result, the thought process focuses only on possible options for saving money.  How to attract money with the right thoughts?  Think positively and remember that the universe gives a person only what he wants to receive as a result. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h3>  <strong>Five Steps to Prosperity and Wealth</strong> </h3><p>  1. To understand how to attract money, you need to think first of all about how you can earn more.  Create your own business, improve your qualifications, switch to a more paid job, ask for a higher salary, find ways <span>to earn extra money.</span>  There are many options, the main thing is to catch a fire on the desire to see them. </p><p>  2. To become rich, you do not need to constantly think about how to attract money, flutter over them, save every penny, deny yourself the long-awaited purchases.  You have to go to bed with the thought that tomorrow you will wake up rich.  Money is a kind of energy that needs to be in constant motion. </p><p>  3. Do not sit on the chest with wealth and do not be afraid to open it.  Thus, you can only save your capital, but not replenish.  If the chest is constantly closed, then not a single penny can get into it. </p><p>  4. Buying yourself things, give money for them with pleasure and a sense of joy.  Never hold on to them.  The main thing is to believe that money is always enough.  It is necessary to think that in the near future they will be much more spent. </p><p>  5. Never take money carelessly.  With this approach, they are unlikely to come.  The ideal option is the perception of money is absolutely calm and neutral.  Treat them only as a way to achieve your goals. </p><h3>  <strong>How to attract money in Feng Shui</strong> </h3><p>  1. Repair all taps in your apartment.  Dripping water has the ability to flush your wealth. </p><p>  2. Place a piece of dried moss or seaweed under the carpet.  These plants attract money. </p><p>  3. Put in a room located in the southeast, a pot of <span>money tree.</span>  And in the southwest hang a lamp with a red or scarlet lampshade.  This color symbolizes wealth and passion. </p><p>  4. Keep bins away from wealth areas. </p><p>  5. In the northern corner of the apartment you can put a tortoise figure.  This animal brings money to the house. </p><p>  6. In the hallway, it is advisable to hang a chandelier with bright lamps.  Light will attract good energy into the house. </p><p>  7. It is necessary to regularly air the apartment.  Wind and fresh air allow positive energy to move freely around the house. </p><h3>  <strong>To summarize</strong> </h3><p>  The universe is abundant and it doesn‚Äôt care, give you one dollar or one million dollars.  You yourself declare how much money you really want to earn. </p><p>  How to attract money?  It is necessary to have worthy goals, then prosperity and wealth will come into your life. </p><p>  And in conclusion, I would like to add that money comes to those people who are ready to accept them.  Therefore, do not reject money through savings, but take it in the quantity you need! </p>
