Now it is one of the neighborhoods on the outskirts of the city.  The pond is located in the middle of a mixed forest.  The beauty of nature attracts tourists to these places.  Lovers of beach vacations and fishing come here.  The lake is located 75 km from the capital, away from noisy tracks and the bustle of the city. </p><h2>  Description of the lake </h2><p>  In the past, here, at the military unit, was the closed town of Zagorsk-7.  The lake was located on its outskirts.  Currently, he became part of the city of Sergiev Posad. </p><p>  The Torgosha River flowed nearby.  In the 1960s, the efforts of military builders and residents of the town created a dam with a length of 170 m on it. Thus, Lake Forest in Sergiev Posad was formed.  Improvements to this place were carried out.  A fisherman‚Äôs house and a boat station with a pier were built on the lake.  Unfortunately, these structures were destroyed and did not reach our days. </p><p>  The lake has an oblong shape with many bays.  On the right side is a sandy beach, the rest of the banks are located in the forest.  The pond stretched along the bed of the Torgosh River.  The length of Forest Lake in Sergiev Posad is about 5 km, width is from 200 to 400 m. The depth is small, about 4-5 m. Nearby is the cottage village "Forest Lake 2". </p>

    <p>  In 2017, repair of the dam on the lake was started.  The slope of the structure will be strengthened with slabs, it will be landscaped and an asphalt path will be made.  It is planned to modernize the drainage and intake device.  During the construction of the dam, a fountain in the form of a statue of Neptune was installed on its lower pool, but over time it became clogged and does not work.  It is supposed to repair and clean this building. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Beach relaxation and swimming </h2><p>  The right side of Forest Lake in Sergiev Posad is landscaped.

    <p>  Is it possible to swim in the Forest Lake in Sergiev Posad?  This question interests all vacationers.  Unfortunately, water samples do not meet the necessary quality standards, and officially swimming is not recommended here.  The lake receives drains from the nearest villages, and the bottom has not been cleaned for a long time.  Because of this, litter and silt accumulate, decomposition and decay are underway, and harmful microorganisms multiply. </p><p>  However, many vacationers are immersed in water, despite the ban.  On hot summer days, a lot of people go swimming in the lake.  In mid-August, the beach even hosts a holiday dedicated to the closing of the swimming season. </p><p>  For those who do not risk diving into the lake, boat and catamaran rentals are organized.  Camping enthusiasts come here.  The forest around the reservoir is rich in berries and mushrooms.  It is possible that after completion of the dam repair in the lake it will be possible to swim. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Fishing on the lake </h2><p>  Many people come to Sergiev Posad for fishing.
