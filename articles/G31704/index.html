On it you can see a huge number of significant places and architectural monuments, each of which is worth a visit.  All of them, together with the cozy ancient streets, form an amazing atmosphere here, which any traveler dreams of plunging into at least once in his life.  One of the most interesting and popular local places is the tower called Montparnasse, which is located in the heart of the French capital.  About it in more detail and will be discussed later. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Paris map with landmarks" class="if" height="430" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/767842.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  general description </h2><p>  The main feature of the building is its 209-meter height (the Montparnasse tower is the only skyscraper located in the city).  It consists of 56 floors, as well as 6 underground levels.  Many skeptics note the banality of its architecture, but this does not reduce the importance of the structure, because it boasts the highest viewing platform in Paris.  Indeed, only from here you can see the Eiffel Tower from a bird's eye view.  It is not surprising that for more than thirty years the tower of Montparnasse has been included in the list of the main attractions of the French capital. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As already noted above, the outer height of the skyscraper is 209 meters.  At the same time, it goes underground to a depth of 70 meters.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãeach floor is 2000 square meters.  As for the total weight, it is approximately 120 thousand tons.  At the foot of the building is a large commercial and public complex with an international textile center and a <span>swimming pool.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Paris city" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/767762.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Brief History </h2><p>  The history of the skyscraper dates back to 1956.  Then at its current location was the railway station of the same name.  The city of Paris was gradually growing, so over time it simply ceased to cope with the significantly increased volumes of freight and passenger traffic.  In the period from 1969 to 1972, the station was moved underground, and a business center appeared on top.  The project of the tower itself was developed by a group of architects consisting of Dubuison, Baudouin, de Oim, Arrec and Lopez.  According to their idea, the building is an oval-shaped cigar. </p><h2>  Inside the tower </h2><p>  Montparnasse Tower - as if a separate small town with its structure and attractions.  Movement between floors is due to <span>25</span> elevators.  Of particular interest to tourists are only a few of them.  In this case, we are talking about lifts running between the 1st and 56th floors.  Moreover, in order to get to the last level, they need only 38 seconds of time.  Each of the elevators is accompanied by a steward.  All the space under the observation deck is occupied by offices, shops, restaurants, representative offices of leading world companies and banks.  All of these institutions employ a total of more than five thousand people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Montparnasse tower height" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/767761.jpg" width="600"></div>

The upper level itself is a classic <span>helipad,</span> which is laid out under the landing strip, has <span>side lights</span> and is surrounded by a high grid.  It offers a unique view of the city of Paris, its surroundings and the <span>river Seine.</span>  Visibility on sunny days from here reaches 40 kilometers.  As evidenced by the numerous reviews of travelers who have been here, this place should be a must-see destination for any tourist, since the time spent at the top is simply impossible to forget. </p><h2>  Visit </h2><p>  The <span>Montparnasse</span> Tower <span>in Paris</span> is located at 33 Avenue du Maine, in the same district of the city.  You can get here on almost any form of public transport.  Depending on the season, the mode of operation of attractions may vary.  You can just go inside for free.  Along with this, climbing to the highest point is a very affordable pleasure.  In particular, for an adult ticket you need to pay 13 euros, for students and youth under the age of 20 years - 9.5 euros, and for children under 15 years of age - 7.5 euros. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Montparnasse tower" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/767763.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Compared to the Eiffel Tower </h2><p>  Even despite the large number of advantages that the Montparnasse tower boasts, it is not entirely advisable to compare it in importance with the main symbol of the French capital.  Each of these two attractions is distinguished by its own, unique destination.  If tourists can watch the city from the Eiffel Tower, Montparnasse also allows you to purchase souvenirs with clothes.  Be that as it may, the architecture of the skyscraper is very banal and mundane.  That is why, probably, the Paris business card - the Eiffel Tower - remains the main attraction of the city.  The advantages of Montparnasse in front of her include perhaps a relatively small lineup and the opportunity to see the world famous Eiffel's work from a bird's eye view. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Montparnasse Tower in Paris" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/767760.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Although the Montparnasse tower does not claim to be the symbol of Paris, it has long ceased to be an ordinary skyscraper with office buildings.  On the other hand, demonstrations continue to be held periodically in the French capital, the main requirement of which is the demolition of the building.  Many Parisians are sure that it spoils the romantic look of their city.  Be that as it may, it is noteworthy that the Eiffel Tower was also heavily criticized for the first few decades after its construction.  Paris and its inhabitants are gradually getting used to the presence of Montparnasse, and the city‚Äôs most chic observation deck continues to attract more and more visitors from all over the world from year to year. </p>
