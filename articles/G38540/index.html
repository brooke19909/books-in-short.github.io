The architecture of each is in unity with nature.  Hochosterwitz is a castle in Carinthia.  The journey there from the Salzkammergut, for example, takes as much as three hours.  But tourists still go to the castle in a crowd to admire the unusual structure on top of the mountain.  We offer to get to know the Hochosterwitz closer. </p><h2>  History tour </h2>

    <p>  Austrian castles such as Hochosterwitz are not just the residences of aristocrats and nobles.  First of all, it was a <span>fortress.</span>  Hochosterwitz <span>Castle</span> (Austria) was erected on the slopes of a lonely rock at the end of the ninth century.  In those days, these territories were dominated by the Slovenian principality of Carantania.  It is from here that the modern name of the land - Carinthia - went.  The cliff towered 160 meters above sea level.  In fine weather, it offers a beautiful view.  Therefore, it is not surprising that it was here that it was decided to erect a fortress in order to warn of a possible enemy. </p><p>  Until the 15th century, the Hochosterwitz castle belonged to the Osterwitz family.  Then the fortress passed into the possession of Emperor Frederick III.  And one of his descendants gave the castle to the governor of Carinthia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Our days </h2>

    <p>  Until the 16th century, in connection with the change of owners, the fortress underwent changes.  After that, there were no realignments or improvements to the architecture. </p><p>  Today, the Hochosterwitz Castle is owned by one of the famous Austrian families - Hevenh√ºller.  They do not live in a fortress, but in a house nearby.  But despite this, only a part of the castle is accessible for tourists to visit. </p><h2>  The territory of the fortress </h2>

    <p>  Hochosterwitz Castle is located in the center of four massive walls, some of which are made of rock stones.  As you approach the house, the fence becomes thicker.  They form the outer and inner courtyards of the fortress.  In the outer courtyards there are still several buildings that were economic and intended for housing servants.  There is also an ancient church.  The patio is central and is surrounded by arches.  Here is the ancestral chapel of the Hevenh√ºllers.  For tourists it is closed.  Of particular note is a well with groundwater, which is made right in the rock.  Thanks to him and a huge amount of food supplies, the defenders could be besieged for several years. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition, the walls are a labyrinth, and to get to the castle, you need to overcome fourteen gates.  They have a unique design, so they are not repeated.  For example, at the front gate there is a large coat of arms of the Hevenh√ºller family.  You can also see images of the flags of Carinthia.  Right behind the gates there are various traps and statues: either a bunch of boulders that should fall on the heads of opponents, then the figure of the founder of the fortress, dressed in armor.  If you believe the legend, then beyond the fourth gate, none of those who wanted to capture the castle could not get through.  The most interesting thing is that this is not just a fence.  The gate is a real building.  If you are curious about how they look inside, then you can consider the plates with the image of the interior decoration, which are attached to the walls. </p><p>  The closer to the top of the castle, the more obstacles there are on the road: the number of back streets and roads increases several times.  You can overcome all the way on foot or cheat and take the special elevator.  Those who finally managed to get to the top can visit the upper courtyard and museum located within the walls of the Hochosterwitz castle. </p><h2>  Interior decoration </h2>

    <p>  Behind the walls of the Hochosterwitz Castle, there are restored medieval interiors and the Hevenh√ºller Museum, which presents an extensive collection of various attributes of the time and objects related to the history of the fortress. </p><p>  The Havenhuller Museum has a large collection of interesting things, among which there are memorable tourist diaries, the authorship of which belongs to the King of England James I.  There are also exhibitions of paintings of the Renaissance and the military glory of the castle.  The exhibits of the latter are medieval types of weapons and armor.  For example, one armor differs from the rest in its enormous size.  It was once worn by Burghauptman Schenk - a 225 cm giant who lived in the castle and was needed in order to frighten attackers with his own look.  Its growth for medieval times was amazing, so the armor has survived to this day. </p><p>  And there is also a statue of the praying George Havenh√ºller.  Also, the museum has preserved various books, scrolls, porcelain, samples of seals, household items and much more.  As for weapons, there are really many different items.  After all, it was it that was actively used during the active defense of the Hochosterwitz Castle. </p><h2>  Castle for tourists </h2>

    <p>  The entire route to the Hochosterwitz Castle is 620 meters.  Tourists are invited to go through it on their own or take the alternative to take the elevator.  But then it becomes impossible to examine all fourteen gates and most of the territory of the fortress.  The funicular is equipped with just one booth for six people.  Therefore, sometimes you can wait a long time for your turn. </p><p>  You can buy thematic souvenirs both at the entrance and inside the castle.  But if you want to save a little, then it is better to do it in Klagenfurt.  Within the walls of the castle are several small cafes where you can eat and relax a bit after a hard climb.  A full lunch will not be served here, but coffee or tea with Austrian sausages will be offered.  You can also drink local beer. </p><p>  Inside, some rooms and the Havenhuller Museum are open to the public.  Taking photographs as a keepsake is prohibited by the rules.  There are also observation platforms from which, in clear weather, a view of the surroundings of up to 30 km opens. </p><h2>  Excursions to the castle </h2>
