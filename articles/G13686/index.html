    <h2>  The crisis in Russia is close.  How to make money on your savings? </h2><p>  Where to invest the money to make it work?  This is the main question that most Russian citizens pose themselves.  After all, it is no secret to anyone that the political and economic situation in the world has been extremely aggravated recently.  Instability in the financial market now and then affects the daily lives of many people.  The ruble is falling at an incredible rate, this is due to many factors.  First of all, the Russian economy was affected by the crisis in Ukraine and the sanctions imposed by the EU in connection with it.  But to a greater extent, according to experts, the cost of oil is to blame, which in the last year has fallen to the maximum level.  All these factors significantly influenced the ruble exchange rate.  Ever since the national currency lost the trust of its citizens, the Russians kept asking themselves the question: "Where to invest money reliably?"  Indeed, many experts argue that the ruble may devalue.  And this, in turn, will lead to the fact that many will lose their savings.  But that is not all.  Analysts are confident that in 2015 there will be a massive reduction in jobs and lower wages.  Therefore, talking about where it is now profitable to invest money, many still think about how to make money with it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Investing in a bank.  Deposit Benefit </h2><p>  Where to invest to make a profit?  One of the most popular ways to keep their savings with Russians is through a bank.  Of course, many banks use only as a financial pillow with the amount of means of living for a short period.  But you can approach this option and the other side.  Due to the fact that this year the Central Bank of Russia raised the key rate to 17%, it became very profitable to put savings on deposit.

For example, Sberbank, Gazprom, VTB and other <span>large banks in Russia.</span>  Making a deposit will not take much time and, in turn, will bring a pleasant monthly income.

    <h2>  Real estate investing </h2><p>  Answering the question: ‚ÄúWhat to invest money in 2015?‚Äù, Many experts recommend turning to such a proven and safe type of investment as real estate.  Everyone knows that it is she who takes the first place by the trust of citizens.  But often many people use square meters exclusively as a way to preserve their savings.  Forgetting that such an investment tool can bring considerable income to its owner.  Of course, considerable funds will be required to acquire real estate.  But if you can skillfully dispose of them, then the profit from the acquired property will cover all costs.  It is best to purchase an apartment at the initial stage of building a house.  Such projects bring the highest returns.  This is especially true for luxury housing.  In addition, it is not necessary to sell this property in the future, there is always the opportunity to rent out your square meters.  But for this it is necessary to carefully consider the infrastructure and location of the apartment when buying it.  Carefully inspect everything that could negatively affect the client‚Äôs interest: number of storeys, communications, view from the window.  All these little things play a very important role when renting an apartment.  But at the same time, having drawn up a profitable deal with a client, you can count on a good monthly income.  In what is investing money as profitable as real estate? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Forex Market and PAMM Accounts </h2><p>  Where to invest the money to make it work?  Often, reflecting on this issue, experts confidently talk about the Forex market.  In the Russian investment market, a new form for investing funds called PAMM-account has recently appeared.  Experienced players with confidence declare that with the help of such accounts you can earn good money.  This is especially beneficial today.  After all, the principle of earning money consists precisely in the fact that it is necessary to play at currency jumps.  And today there is precisely such a trend in the financial market.  But experts warn that almost 90% of newcomers, starting to work on the Forex market on their own, lose their savings.  Firstly, there is a lack of experience and knowledge, and secondly, for many, Forex trading is only a side type of earnings, which is why there is not enough time to delve into the intricacies of the foreign exchange market.  Therefore, experienced players often advise beginners to use the services of a professional trader.  Or, in extreme cases, take a series of training courses, which are often offered by investment companies and exchanges for free. </p><h2>  Securities and stocks </h2><p>  In times of past crises, many citizens of Russia, at the risk of losing their savings, invested them in securities and stocks.  Those who at least somehow knew this business, after a few years already had a good income.  Well, those who did not have experience with stocks lost their last savings.  Answering the question: ‚ÄúWhere to invest the money to make it work?‚Äù, We can say that the contribution to the shares will bring a decent profit.  But this can take years, and it is also necessary to have a sufficient level of skills and knowledge to choose a worthy company.  It is best to trust a professional manager with a good return history.  But even in this case, it is impossible to be 100% sure that the shares will bring profit.  After all, today's market is so volatile that it can depreciate the shares of absolutely any company in just a couple of minutes.  And experts advise: before choosing this type of investment, consult with specialists or take advantage of special courses that will help you gain some knowledge in this area. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Investing in gold and other metals </h2><p>  There is a category of citizens in Russia, which every time, faced with a crisis problem in the country, absolutely does not ask a question: ‚ÄúWhere to invest money to earn money?‚Äù  This category includes people who trust only this type of investment, like gold.  This is not surprising.  After all, since ancient times, gold was considered the <span>most stable currency.</span>  In the modern market, the situation has changed somewhat, but the fact that gold is mainly getting more expensive is an indisputable fact.  Of course, over time, the trends in such investments have changed somewhat, and today bank customers are successfully investing not only in gold, but also in other metals.  These include silver, platinum and palladium.  You can invest your precious metals in several ways: purchase a gold bar at the bank (but you have to pay 13% tax), buy gold coins (you can find them at Sberbank and other similar large organizations), buy securities (only those that are provided with gold, through the stock exchange), as well as open a non-cash metal account.  For those who have never used this type of investment, it is best to dwell on the latter option. </p>

    <h2>  Investing in your own business </h2><p>  Where to invest to earn money for a simple person?  After all, not everyone can decide to give their savings to the bank or buy unreliable shares on them.  Experts advise considering the option of opening a private business of the category of citizens that distrusts investments in other companies.  Moreover, now is the right moment for this.  Foreign companies, in connection with the sanctions and unprofitability of doing business on the territory of Russia, will hastily leave the borders of the Russian Federation.  This will lead to lower competition in the trade market.  And the commercial real estate market is likely to reduce the cost per square meter.  All this will provide an excellent opportunity for a novice entrepreneur to successfully start his own business.  Where to invest?  It is best to turn to essential goods, clothing or food.  The dollar is likely to continue to grow, so you can fill the range with national goods and dilute with Chinese products.  Also, experts recommend a closer look at areas such as pharmacy and funeral services.  No matter how strange it may sound, such organizations will always be profitable.  Of course, the risks associated with starting your own business are quite high.  But the economic situation in Russia today is not too stable.  Therefore, this choice of investment can be quite successful!  In addition, to reduce risks or with a lack of funds, you can find a worthy companion. </p>

In general, even experts believe that such investments are very profitable.  Indeed, the cost of training and medical care is growing annually.
