The Chelyabinsk region is characterized by a large number of reservoirs and beautiful nature, which is why there are always a lot of fishermen and just resting tourists.  Where did such an interesting name for the lake come from?  Its hydronym means "solar" in Turkic, which is quite true.  Especially in the summer season, one can often observe how the bright rays of the sun are reflected in the mirror surface of the lake. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Big Kuyash Lake" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1360588.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get to the pond? </h2><p>  Big Kuyash Lake (only positive reviews of it) is located between two large cities.  The distance to the regional center (Chelyabinsk) is 142 km, and to Yekaterinburg - 132 km. </p><p>  In order to come to these places on vacation, you need to overcome a certain path.  The Chelyabinsk - Yekaterinburg (M36) highway passes near the reservoir, along which you will need to move. </p><p>  If tourists travel from Chelyabinsk, then near the village of Tubuk you need to turn to Bagaryak.  Before reaching it a bit, turn onto the road leading to Kamensk-Uralsky.  Upon reaching the nearest intersection, we again take to the right to the transformer booth and from there go straight to the village of Ognevskoye.  It is he who is located on the lake (southwest coast). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  And for those who use a map or navigator, it will be useful to know the coordinates of the water area: 56 ¬∞ 08‚Ä≤15 ‚Ä≥ s.

The depth of the reservoir varies from 2 to 7 m. The surface area is 24 km <sup>2</sup> .  The water is clear, incorporates a lot of trace elements.  The banks are sloping, covered with vegetation.  Reed grows near the water, and a little further from the coastline - forests.  These are mainly birch and pine plantations.  The bottom of the lake is mostly sandy, in places where the depth exceeds 4 m - silty. </p><p>  The West Bank is not suitable for swimming, as there is a lot of vegetation, snags are often found at the bottom.
