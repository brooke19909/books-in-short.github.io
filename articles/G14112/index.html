    <p>  According to the design documentation, LCD "Winter-Summer" (St. Petersburg) is represented by 5 houses on the 21-22 floors.  The architectural solution is based on the theme of the seasons.  The developer decided to reflect it in the color scheme. </p><p>  On the one hand, the quarter is washed by the picturesque river Bolshaya Okhta, which is why residents of houses whose facades are facing it will receive not only comfortable housing, but also an amazing view. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  For the construction of the <span>residential complex "Winter-Summer" (St. Petersburg)</span> , the Krasnogvardeisky district of the Northern capital was chosen.  The complex is being built just a 5-minute walk from the Ladozhskaya metro station.  The project will occupy an area of ‚Äã‚Äã10 hectares and will become one of the largest not only in the region, but throughout the Northern capital. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  LCD "Winter-Summer" boasts excellent transport accessibility.  Within walking distance from the buildings are the railway station and the Ladozhskaya metro station, from where you can reach any point in the Northern capital.  At 800 meters from the complex - direct access to Kosygin Avenue and the Ring Road.  The traffic is rather dense, but the residents of the complex note that there are practically no large and long traffic congestions. </p>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The complex creates the most convenient social and shopping and entertainment infrastructure.  A school for 450 students and a kindergarten for 190 children will appear in the courtyard.  All the necessary commercial establishments will occupy the first non-residential floors of new buildings: a store, pharmacy, bakery, shopping and entertainment centers. </p><p>  The developer paid great attention to the safety of residents, fencing the territory of the complex and equipping it with a 24-hour video surveillance system, additional cameras are installed in children's playgrounds, parking lots. </p>

    <h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  The complex is located near the northern border of St. Petersburg, so its residents can easily get out into the countryside.  The embankment along the river will turn into a comfortable walking zone, the territory of the complex will be ennobled: a real garden will be laid out on it, which will favorably affect the ecological situation.  Only half an hour from the complex are the three largest tourist areas with lakes, a forest belt and clean air. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Flats </h2><p>  The main feature of the project is the rational use of each square meter in the Winter-Summer residential complex.  The layouts are focused on the preferences of modern residents, their comfort and convenience.  The corridor in one-room apartments is 4-5 square meters, in two-room apartments - up to 9 square meters.  Moreover, in this area managed to place a wardrobe for storing things.  Those who managed to buy an apartment here note that, in many respects, thanks to thoughtful planning decisions, they made such a choice. </p>

    <p>  One-room apartments with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã36 square meters turned out to be quite compact, but at the same time the owners received a rather spacious living room with two windows, a kitchen of 11 square meters and a combined bathroom with installed plumbing.  The developer also proposed more spacious "odnushki" with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã42 square meters, due to which it was possible to divide the bathroom and somewhat expand the space of the kitchen and living room.  One-bedroom apartment is a dream of a young family, residents share their impressions.  The developer on 45 square meters placed a kitchen-living room of 20 "squares", a separate bathroom and a fairly spacious bedroom.  The project includes four-room apartments, they are aimed at families with children. </p><h2>  Finish </h2><p>  Finishing complexes are currently popular.  The secret of popularity is extremely simple: after receiving the keys, it is enough for the owners to bring furniture into the apartment, and then begin to settle in their nest. </p><p>  LCD "Winter-Summer" was no exception.  All apartments are for rent with improved finishing, presented: </p><ul><li>  non-woven wallpaper on the walls; </li><li>  water-based paint on the ceiling; </li><li>  32nd class laminate flooring; </li><li>  <span>ceramic tiles</span> on the walls and floor in the bathrooms; </li><li>  Czech-made sanitary ware; </li><li>  installation of high-quality interior doors; </li><li>  electrical wiring; </li><li>  glazed balconies and loggias. </li></ul><p>  Moreover, all owners note in their reviews and comments that they were presented with several options for the color scheme of the apartment: light and dark. </p>

    <h2>  Price policy </h2><p>  Of course, those who plan to purchase an apartment in the Zima-Summer residential complex are worried by prices no less than other components.  A one-room apartment can be purchased for 3.4 million rubles, a two-room apartment - from 5 million rubles, the cost of three-room and four-room apartments starts from 8 million rubles.  The developer offers to purchase an installment plan before the completion of the object (December 2017) or to issue a mortgage loan on favorable terms. </p><h2>  Expert opinion </h2><p>  Of course, the feedback from pre-equity holders is primarily positive.  Such a beautiful, spectacular, at the same time convenient complex has not existed for a long time.  But what position do experts hold regarding it? </p><p>  So, the complex is being built on the territory of the former factory, surrounded by industrial facilities.  But at the moment there are no harmful industries that adversely affect the ecology of the region.  The location of the complex is its main advantage.  Proximity to the metro, all objects of commercial and social infrastructure really sets the project apart from the rest.  On both sides of the house are surrounded by the picturesque banks of the Okhta River, which residents can enjoy directly from their windows.  Spacious apartments with good layouts - what could be better?  Speaking about the identified shortcomings, I want to note the lack of social infrastructure, but this is a temporary phenomenon. </p>
