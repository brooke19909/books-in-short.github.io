In addition to technical filling, manufacturers of these devices are paying more and more attention to ergonomics.  For example, the latest models are equipped with touch displays, and the cases are made in smaller sizes.  Along with this, optics are being improved, which extends the functionality of models and makes them more independent of operating conditions.  It is these advantages that the <span>Mio</span> MiVue 568 car <span>DVR</span> can boast of with competitors, which also has a rich arsenal of new technological tools.  The manufacturer manages to combine compact dimensions and advanced hardware, which satisfies the needs of demanding car owners and the needs of novice users. </p><h2>  Device Overview </h2>

    <p>  The model initially had good prerequisites for success in the market in its class, since the company has been producing technological and high-quality registrars for several years.  Assessing the model line of the manufacturer, we can conclude that its developers are striving to introduce new options.  This is evidenced by the filling of the device Mio MiVue 568, which, in particular, is endowed with the ability to "mirror". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Unfortunately, the basic set of few pleases with the breadth of useful additions.  In addition to the charger and attachment, it has a rag case and a software disc.  We can say that this is a standard solution for all modern models, but the lack of a microSD card seems strange.  The fact is that the built-in memory of the Mio MiVue 568 recorder is generally absent, therefore, you can not do without additional space for storing video materials.  The rest of the delivery set is not satisfactory - the instruction covers all the nuances of operation, and the mount with a charger eliminates the need to use auxiliary means. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  With its parameters, the device emphasizes belonging to the category of inexpensive, but still productive and functional models.  A rather large number of DVRs has similar data today, however, the Mio MiVue 568, the characteristics of which are presented below, compares favorably with their combination: </p><ul><li>  Dimensions - 64.6 mm in height, 62.8 mm in width and 36.5 mm in thickness. </li><li>  Mass - 95 gr. </li><li>  The display is a 2.5 "LCD touch screen. </li><li>  Matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãa CMOS device that provides Full HD resolution. </li><li>  Visibility - angle of 130 ¬∞. </li><li>  The recording format is H.264. </li><li>  Memory - microSD support up to 32 GB. </li><li>  Connectors - power output, HD port and USB. </li><li>  Power - adapter with a power of 5 V. </li><li>  Temperature limits for operation - from -10 to +60 ¬∞ C. </li><li>  The range of operating humidity indicators is 5‚Äì85%. </li></ul><h2>  Appearance </h2>

However, the creators took care not only of aesthetic merits.  The compact size is probably the main advantage of the Mio MiVue 568, as they facilitate the use of the device and at the same time do not reduce its functionality.  A car enthusiast will be able to conveniently and with minimal damage to the view install the device on the glass, having a good hardware filling.  However, there are also disadvantages in the performance of the case.  It is made of matte black plastic, so all the advantages of the design will be overshadowed by fingerprints on the surface.  There is also criticism from users regarding the location of the connector for the charger.  The plug of the miniUSB power cable is made in the form of the letter ‚ÄúG‚Äù, that is, it is advisable to bring it to the device from the bottom.  However, the manufacturer located the port at the top.  Firstly, this solution does not contribute to ergonomics during operation, and secondly, the stay of the cable in a bent form affects its durability. </p><h2>  Functionality </h2>

    <p>  The model is equipped with a lens whose aperture is f / 1.8.  At the same time, the 3-megapixel matrix works with six glass lenses, supplemented by an infrared filter.  In combination, this provides a very good picture, even in dim light.  You can increase the efficiency of the lens using a polarizing filter, although this is unnecessary for the direct function of a car recorder.  As for visibility, 130 degrees is enough to simultaneously cover five lanes.  Again, for complex operating conditions, the Mio MiVue 568 DVR is provided with different shooting modes.  There is also an exposure setting in it, which allows you to control the brightness of the video with <span>insufficient visibility.</span>  But the video quality is devoid of any adjustments.  The equipment shoots in 1080p format, but this is abundant by modern standards.  The recording itself is possible not only during the movement, but also during the parking of the car.  In this case, a battery is provided for autonomous power. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Control </h2><p>  The model does not have traditional control buttons.  Unless you need to turn on the device using the button, but there are no physical controls in it.  The user will have to deal with a newfangled touch screen.  As the manufacturer notes, the recorder's menu is also sharpened for sensory manipulations with the expectation of achieving any setting after a maximum of three clicks.  Those who are used to this approach to management will have no problems.  The <span>Mio</span> MiVue 568 Touchscreen <span>DVR</span> really has a well-designed and user-friendly interface.  In place of the traditional text menu items with line-by-line breaks came signed icons - similar to a computer desktop.  Moreover, all sections are organized compactly and conveniently for perception.  The only negative relates to Russification - abbreviations, incorrectly used cases and syntax errors do not withstand any criticism.  However, you can get used to it. </p><h2>  DVR Features </h2>

    <p>  The model is far from the pinnacle of technological and functional breakthrough in the segment of DVRs.  Nevertheless, it is in its category for some positions that the device advances ahead of competitors.  And the matter is not only in the touch control method, which is now implemented even in some budget devices.  Its main feature is the presence of a GPS module.  In practice, the advantages of this add-on are primarily expressed in the ability to track the location coordinates that are attached to the video.  But the most important thing is the function of the radar detector, which provides the GPS receiver to the Mio MiVue 568 recorder. With its help, the camera database is loaded automatically, which allows you to control the speed mode in advance.  As a result, the risk of violation of traffic rules in sections of the road where stationary cameras are located is reduced.  Of course, in this model the radar detector cannot be called full-fledged, but for this class the progress is very substantial. </p><h2>  Fixation method </h2><p>  The fixing system through the bracket passed to the model from the 388 series recorder. I must say that the reviews about the predecessor are quite harmonious.  For example, reliability is noted with the strength of the fasteners, as well as its compactness.  Despite the modest size of the suction cup, it copes with its task of holding the device on the glass.  The cradle provides only one hinge, but with its help you can easily adjust the position of the device.  As you can see, in terms of implementing the fastener scheme, the <span>Mio</span> MiVue 568 car <span>DVR</span> also shows an example of a combination of minimalism, practicality and reliability.  And the installation itself is simple, and further operation in any position is not satisfactory to users.  It also benefits compactness and low weight of the device, with the retention of which a small suction cup can handle. </p>

    <h2>  Mio MiVue 568 update </h2><p>  Experienced motorists recommend updating as often as possible according to the location of the speed cameras.  The frequency of measures to expand the bases, depending on the source, is on average a week.  The device update procedure can be performed either using a proprietary Mio converter, or by downloading directly to a USB flash drive in a special directory.  In the first case, an additional update of the Mio MiVue 568 device may be required. The firmware available on the manufacturer‚Äôs website, for example, allows you to manually supplement the built-in database with new data on stationary cameras.  Also, in the latest software versions it is envisaged to remove the voice greeting function at the time of launching the electronic assistant. </p><h2>  Positive feedback about the model </h2><p>  The manufacturer has not in vain relied on compact dimensions and the maximum supply of modern functionality.  These qualities are primarily highlighted by users.  Mobility, reliability of fixation and minimal impact on the direct review of the driver - these advantages are noted by novice car enthusiasts.  For a more demanding consumer, the optional fullness of the Mio MiVue 568 comes to the fore. Owner reviews in this regard pay more attention to the GPS module and its benefits during operation.  Despite the fact that the used sensor belongs to the initial level, it performs its tasks well.  The main functions of the device also do not cause complaints.  The assistant is easy to set up, stably and qualitatively records video material, and also provides options for connecting to a TV and computer.  According to the registrar's owners, convenient applications from Mio help in this. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2>

    <p>  Not everyone succeeds in achieving high functionality and small sizes in the manufacture of DVRs.  Mio coped with this task, but it had to sacrifice other characteristics of the device.  Owners note a rather average quality of materials.  Although the operating practice is generally positive with respect to the fastening system, serious mechanical stress even damages the housing.  There are also complaints about the small battery capacity that the Mio MiVue 568 DVR is equipped with. The reviews also indicate that the model does not perform well when working in cold weather.  Conversely, with prolonged use in normal temperature conditions, the device overheats. </p><h2>  How much is? </h2><p>  For its class, the model has good data.  This is a set of options, and video quality, and a touch menu with a Mio MiVue 568 location sensor. The price is quite affordable and amounts to 6-7 thousand rubles.  On the market you can find devices that are close in cost and functionality, but they will lose in screen size and recording quality.  True, already for 5 thousand rubles.  there are models with a large battery capacity and a decent size of internal memory.  However, they lack touch control and a GPS sensor. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  The device is the best choice for connoisseurs of high technology who do not want to overpay for extra features.  A balanced optional and well-thought-out ergonomics are the main advantages of the Mio MiVue 568. The reviews will also add to the quality of the resulting video, which thanks to the filters and high resolution allows you to see the smallest details.  Of course, there are disadvantages that are expressed in small nuances.  Thus, the impression of ergonomics is spoiled by an inconveniently located charger cable, and the lack of a main memory forces each user to acquire microSD.  Nevertheless, you can close your eyes to these shortcomings by recalling the GPS module, the original design, the ease of installation of the recorder and, by and large, the rather modest price for such a filling. </p>
