  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Crochet dragons will bring happiness and good luck all year long!</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In fact, in the year of the Dragon it is pleasant to receive a small souvenir or a soft toy depicting the symbol of the year.  Dinosaurs, lizards, iguanas, and even simple lizards are also very successful.  And crocheting dragons will save you from wasting money on a cute trinket as a gift to loved ones. </p><p>  You can make a toy from yarn, you can make a glove - parsley for a puppet theater, tying only the head, and stitching the body from fabric.  And you can even use the old dimensionless tights, cutting them in a spiral and stretching the "thread".  You can even <span>knit a sofa cushion</span> from such synthetic "threads" <span>,</span> and very quickly.  And a beautiful gift, and useful, and original, and completely free!  So crocheting dragons is quite useful this year. </p><p>  In general, the most important thing is to understand what basic details the model that the craftswoman is going to make will consist of.  Crocheting a dragon toy includes a three-dimensional oval - a trunk, a three-dimensional oval or a ball - a head, tail, front paws - elongated ovals, rear paws - hemispheres and ridge.  Ears are possible, although this is not necessary.  In addition, you should stock up on stuffing filler and buttons or beads for the eyes.  Some needlewomen use only yarn of a different color to decorate the muzzle of the toy, simply embroidering all the details.  And others prefer to buy special eyes with pupils rolling inside in stores where they sell everything for needlework. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Crocheting dragons begins with the manufacture of the body.  Mostly used single crochet.  5 air loops are fixed in a ring and two rows are knitted with the addition, when two are knitted from each column.  Further, the addition is done through the column, and the fourth row after two on the third.  Then you need to knit without additions.  When the required size is reached, it is necessary to reduce according to how the addition went.  The main condition is the moment that all the details of the toy must have holes for stuffing. </p><p>  Crochet dragon pattern is a repetition of the algorithms for knitting ovals of different sizes.  Head knit about the same, only exclude 2 and 4 rows.  We begin to perform the front paws with 4 air loops, we add the 2nd row in each column, then we knit without additions.  The hind legs can look like hemispheres without feet and fillers - sort of cups upside down. </p><p>  Tail knitting a little harder.  It should start from the place of attachment of the ridge, gaining 10 loops.  The knitting is not circular, as was the case in the details described, but with the product turning over.  Moreover, from one edge, with which the tail will later attach to the body, it is necessary to draw a bevel, and from the other - a point.  To do this, in the second row, we start knitting with columns with two double crochets - 3 times.  Then there are 3 single crochet, 2 single crochet and 1 half-column.  After turning the product to the wrong side, we start the row from the second column - 2 single crochets, 3 - with one crochet and we knit all 3 with two crochets together.  After turning, on the contrary, we knit three in two double crochets from one column, 3 - with one double crochet, 1 single crochet and half-stitch.  Detail of the tail should be in the form of the letter V, which must be sewn on the outside to make a ‚Äúlittle bag‚Äù or bag.  After stuffing with filler, the tail must be sewn up to the body with the seam up. </p><p>  When all the details of the toy are completed, packed and assembled together, you can begin to manufacture the ridge.  There are two options for knitting it: directly from the back of the toy or with subsequent sewing after manufacture.  To do this, you need to tie a chain of the desired length - from the crown to the tip of the tail.  The execution algorithm is as follows: <span>"half-column,</span> single crochet, single crochet, double crochet, double crochet, single crochet". </p><p>  You can make an overlay on the belly of a toy of white color, you can tie charming ears or wings - crocheting dragons opens a huge field for a creative person to use his boundless imagination.  And most importantly, they say that this lesson will work for you all year, bringing good luck and the fulfillment of all your cherished desires.  Maybe people lie.  But try it - all of a sudden the truth will bring a dragon on its wings to the house of happiness? </p>
