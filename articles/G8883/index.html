It is enough to open the door of the refrigerator, by the way also connected to the outlet, and quench your thirst with a sip of a cool drink.  Well, about the lighting in our apartments, on the street and in the shops, there’s no need to talk.  It is enough to turn off the lighting for 5 minutes.  and everyone begins to remember where this fuse box is.  Although it’s correctly called the “power distribution cabinet”. </p><p>  There are several types of distribution cabinets.  But their main tasks are as follows: </p><p>  - introduction - distribution, i.e.  receipt and distribution of electricity between consumers, </p><p>  - control, i.e.  continuous monitoring of voltage and current consumption. </p><p>  - safety, protection against overloads and short circuits </p><p>  The main ones are: the main switchboard (main switchboard), the input-distribution device (ASU) and the switchboard ().  They are located in transformer substations, industrial enterprises and other facilities with high energy consumption. </p><p>  Following them go: </p><p>  - power distribution cabinets (ShRS).  Usually they turn on after the switchgear and are designed for a consumption current of up to 400 A. They are a cabinet with a central switch and fuses that protect the outgoing lines from overloads and short circuits. </p><p>  - <noindex>  <span>power distribution cabinets</span> </noindex>  (ShRE).  They include, RCDs (residual current devices), used to protect against earth leakage currents.  With the help of them, people are protected from electric shock and fires are prevented.  Typically, such cabinets are installed at production sites, in shops and warehouses.  They carry the main technological load.  Since they are connected to lighting, various equipment and utility rooms.  At the same time, it is in them that, whenever possible, the distribution of loads is carried out in phases (if 3-phase power supply is carried out). </p><p>  - Cabinets for distribution and metering of electricity (SHRUE).  Designed for installation in small rooms, with a consumption current of up to 100 A. Such premises are - private buildings, small offices, shops and stalls.  When planning the power supply of such premises, special attention should be paid to good grounding.  Since otherwise it will affect the malfunction of the RCD and as a result can lead to accidents. </p><p>  - control and automation cabinets ( and ).  Usually they contain fire and burglar alarm equipment, as well as process control equipment. </p></div></article>
