    <p>  It is difficult to name the most expensive camera in the world, because there are many models that belong to different categories.  We will distribute the most interesting samples into classes and consider each of them. </p><h2>  Equipment for advanced beginners and novice pros </h2><p>  Some photographers classify such models as semi-professional, but the classifier as such simply does not exist.  Therefore, let us use this very conditional and not quite clear definition. </p><p>  It includes only a few models.  First of all, this is a <span>Nikon</span> D4 <span>camera</span> , which today will have to pay about $ 6,000. This is a full-frame camera, which can be seen in the hands of many reporting people, family and wedding photographers, and journalists. </p>

    <p>  <span>Pentax 645D</span> will cost almost twice as much <span>.</span>  In it you will find two slots for memory cards, and rummaging through the settings, you will find several shooting modes.  The case, glass, shutter, all components and mechanisms are made soundly and reliably.  You can work with this camera even at minus 10. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Mamiya ZD - an excellent modern technology, devoid of unnecessary details.  Its 21-megapixel camera has a huge resource, even by the most modern standards.  The price tag for this camera, like the previous one, ranges from 10-10.5 thousand dollars. </p><p>  Unlike our next category of technology, in all three cases, the price is due solely to technical specifications.  You can be sure that you give money only for quality. </p><h2>  Luxurious decoration </h2><p>  The most expensive camera in the world may not necessarily take the most beautiful photos.  Moreover, some of these models will not be able to make a single shot, even the seediest one.  But they look just like a royal!  However, the models we are considering are capable of something. </p><p>  Gold Nikon FA with a standard lens 50mm / f1.4 was released in 1984 with a circulation of 2000 pieces.  He had a predecessor (FM), which did not hit the public market at all.  Today you can find a model of the FA series at auction, the price will average 150-200 thousand rubles.  But this camera with film and modest performance characteristics is certainly not for those who work part time shooting love stories on weekends.  Waiting for upscale shots from her is not worth it.  But if you dream of a beautiful trinket trimmed with lizard skin and 24-carat gold, be sure to pay attention to this camera. </p><p>  Sigma SD1 Wood Edition is a completely modern SLR, the characteristics of which are unlikely to interest a professional.  The company, by the way, produces an absolute analogue of this model, made of the most ordinary materials.  But mark <em>Wood</em> <em> </em>  <em>Edition</em> talks about the luxurious finish of the device with the noble wood of the cap of the amboy.  The camera looks very elegant and stylish.  However, even if you are ready to part with her for ten thousand dollars for her sake, do not rush to rejoice.  There are only 10 such cameras in the world, and today they have all found their owners. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  One of the most expensive is considered a Pentax LX Gold camera, the price of which averages 11.5 thousand euros.  It is trimmed with excellent patent leather and 18 carat gold, besides it is limited (1981 edition was 300 pieces). </p>

    <p>  Tightened in leather and Leica M9 Neiman Marcus Edition.  Gold is not used in the production, but the external lens is made of sapphire crystal.  Today you can find one of the 50 cameras released at a foreign auction for a lot of money.  A few years ago, the price in the catalog of expensive gifts was 17.5 tons. </p><h2>  Soap dish is among the best </h2><p>  Oddly enough, the ‚Äúsoap box‚Äù also fell into the company of the most advanced, rare and richly decorated cameras.  You can‚Äôt call it ordinary, because 380 diamonds flaunt on the case.  Canon Diamond IXUS is the most expensive digital camera in its class, because you will have to pay at least 40 thousand euros for it.  There is no need to talk about any technical features. </p>

    <h2>  Instant printing </h2><p>  Many of those who found the crisis of the nineties in their lifetime, probably remember the miracle of miracles, which at that time seemed to be the Polaroid.  The price for it was relatively low, but to get it in the province seemed simply impossible.  This camera, capable of immediately printing captured frames, was the dream of millions of workers.  Its main drawback was the inaccessibility and even higher cost of floppy disks.  Today the camera does not have much value (on average it will cost 250-1500 rubles).  But the manufacturer decided to develop the idea. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  The Socialmatic model from the Polaroid company, the price of which is approximately 11-12 thousand rubles, is the best in the class.  As in the old days, the camera itself is capable of printing photos. </p><h2>  The most expensive professional cameras </h2><p>  The Canon EOS 5D Mark is one of the most popular SLR cameras in the world.  On average, the price of a carcass will be about 30 thousand dollars, and you will determine the final cost only by choosing a lens.  Professionals call this camera one of the best in the world.  Even if you use the usual kit, you will have great opportunities when shooting portraits and panoramas, still life and macro, as well as video.  What can we say about professional branded optics! </p><p>  The Leica S2-P Camera, whose main feature is an advanced 37.5MP sensor, has another major advantage.  The manufacturing company provides customers with a "platinum guarantee", which implies full technical support and even a worthy replacement for the period of repair or maintenance.  The price of the gadget is $ 30 thousand. </p><p>  The Panoscan MK-3 Digital 360 Degree Panoramic for $ 40,000 will allow you to take 360-degree panoramic shots.  It works about 8 times faster than analogs and is recommended by the manufacturer not only for lovers of beautiful shots, but also for forensic experts. </p><p>  The 60.5-megapixel matrix of the Phase One P65 + Back camera is a serious bid to win.  This device is not only one of the most expensive (40 thousand dollars only for the ‚Äúbody‚Äù), but it is definitely one of the best in its class.  It was developed after a complete analysis of the shortcomings and advantages of all prototypes, and is also equipped with a unique <em>Sensor +</em> function. </p><p>  Hasselblad H4D-200MS Digital Camera will cost you at least $ 40,000.  The price is due to the presence of a sensor of 50 megapixels and the ability to take pictures with a resolution of 200 megapixels.  The unique <em>Multi-Shot</em> technology is the company's own development and significantly increases the speed of the camera. </p>

    <h2>  Real rarity </h2><p>  Susse Fr√®res Daguerreotype is the grandfather of all modern photographic equipment.  It was found by accident, and according to experts, not one of its analogues has survived to this day.  The ‚ÄúOld Man‚Äù was assembled back in 1839, therefore, there is no question of a film.  The captured image was first transferred to a polished plate using a reagent.  Then there was a process of development and print on paper. </p>

    <p>  This rarity, one of a kind, went off the auction for 978 thousand dollars.  Today it can be seen in one of the museums in Vienna. </p><h2>  Watering Can No. 0 </h2><p>  The equipment produced by this company has never been distinguished by a budget price.  Leica 0-Serie Nr. 107, which was estimated at 500 thousand before the auction, was not an exception, but an anonymous buyer from Asia paid almost four times more for it - $ 1.9 million.  At the moment, this is the most expensive camera in the world, known to experts.  Its main competitor (manufactured by Pentax) retired for 1.8 million, also to an anonymous buyer. </p>

    <h2>  Is there a limit to the price of photographic equipment? </h2><p>  If you pick up good modern equipment for work and decide to purchase the most expensive SLR camera in the world, be prepared for the fact that the starting price is not the limit.  Any photographer knows how much money he has to invest in his favorite business.  We examined only a few models, but often professional lenses are no less than the camera itself.  In the work you will need many more attributes: tripods, wardrobe trunks, lighting equipment and much more. </p><p>  However, for all this, do not forget that even the most expensive camera in the <span>world</span> is just a tool in the hands of a person.  No camera can guarantee a good result and will not become more significant than true professionalism, love of art and craftsmanship. </p>
