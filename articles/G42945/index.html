Some believe that the land was sold by Empress Catherine II.  Others even consider that Alaska was not for sale in the USA, but was leased by the decree of this reigning person for ninety-nine years.  The deadline has expired, but the Russian lands have not been returned.  As if already in the days of the Soviet Union, Secretary General Brezhnev did not want to take her back. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alaska Russia USA" class="if" height="457" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/394154.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  But if you recall the year in which Alaska was sold to America, it becomes clear that Catherine has nothing to do with this.  Emperor Alexander II ruled Russia during this period.  And it was he who played in history the decisive role that some ascribe to other rulers.  This Russian tsar is accused of practically giving away a huge territory.  But there is only one version in the official history of how things really were, how the peculiar territorial triangle of Alaska-Russia-USA took shape, the details of which are still not known to many. </p><h2>  Geography </h2><p>  Even a schoolboy knows that this peninsula is a cold and harsh land, where the Arctic and subarctic climatic zones reign.  Severe frosty winters with knocking down winds and snow-covered blizzards in this region are the norm.  And this is not surprising: just imagine where Alaska is.  The exception is only a small part of the Pacific coast, where the climate is temperate and quite suitable for human life.  Includes the state of Alaska, the mainland of <span>North America</span> to the very border with Canada.  In addition, it includes the Aleutian, Fox, Trinity and islands of the Alexander Archipelago.  Also, this peninsula is a narrow strip of land, stretched along the Pacific coast, is connected with the Dixon-Entrance Strait.  This is where one of the most original capitals in the world is located - Juneau. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Alaska - Russia </h2>

    <p>  The United States called this region nothing more than "Russian America."  In the second half of the eighteenth century, fur traders became increasingly interested in Alaska.  Already in the early sixties, here, on the island of Unalashka, the Russians founded a village and, of course, a port, through which trade in the produced fur was to be conducted.  In 1784, the merchant and explorer Grigory Shelikhov, at his own expense, organized an expedition to these parts, during which he built a settlement on the island of Kodiak. </p><p>  At the end of the century, European sailors came here who even made attempts to declare Spain sovereignty over certain areas of Alaska.  However, they did not achieve any results.  And today only some non-local geographical names remind of them in these parts, for example, the port of Valdez. </p><p>  The same Shelikhov, a few years later, initiated the organization of a commercial company for the development of Alaska, the creation of which was supposed to be similar to the British East India.  It was created in 1799, and Alexander Baranov, who since the late eighties had represented the interests of Russian industrialists in America, again became its first leader.  It was he who founded several settlements in Alaska, including the modern Sitka, which was then called the city of Novoarkhangelsk. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The activities of the company as a whole had a dual character.  On the one hand, she was engaged in predatory furs, but at the same time she contributed to the development of husbandry and animal husbandry in some areas.  From the beginning of the eighties, this activity was complicated by the struggle with American and English entrepreneurs who armed local Aborigines with the aim of fighting against the Russians. </p>

These documents at the state level determined the boundaries of Russian possessions in North America.  Until that time, when Alaska became American, less than four and a half decades remained.

    <h2>  Difficult situation </h2><p>  In 1861, in Russia, as is known, serfdom was abolished.  In order to pay compensation to his landlords, as well as to pay the costs of the company, Sovereign Alexander II was forced in 1862 to borrow from the Rothschilds at five percent per annum fifteen million pounds.  However, financial tycoons soon needed to return something, and the royal treasury was empty. </p><p>  <span>N. Muravyov-Amursky</span> , Governor-General of Eastern Siberia, was the first to initiate an initiative involving the sale, or rather the accession of Alaska to America.  It happened in the year 1853.  In his opinion, the deal was simply inevitable.  But then no one listened to him.  Four years later, Grand Duke Konstantin, the sovereign‚Äôs younger brother, suggested that Alexander ‚Äúsell something unnecessary‚Äù.  The most unnecessary thing turned out to be northern uncharted lands, which the Russians, in fact, did not master. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The very fact of alienation, as well as the history of the sale of Alaska by Russia today, is perceived by many in its own way.  But then the reasons were more than obvious: this vast territory never brought any special income to the Russians, and for the most part industrialists already killed the sea otters, fur seals and other owners of valuable furs, which were then in demand on the world market.  In general, the colony mainly survived only due to the large supply of ice to the cities of California.  There was nothing to keep military garrisons and officials working on this icy territory in order to develop colossal lands.  Russia, which recently survived the Crimean War, experienced financial difficulties after the defeat. </p><h2>  Background </h2><p>  Naturally, the history of the transfer of Alaska to America has its own forerunner, in addition, this step pursued certain goals and had good reasons.  It is known that at the beginning of the nineteenth century this land brought significant incomes from the fur trade, but by the sixties of the same century it became clear that there would be significantly more expenses in the future than would be the potential profit.  You will have to constantly spend money not only on the banal content of this territory, but also on its protection, and if you remember where Alaska is located on the map, you can imagine how much it would cost the bankrupt Russian empire. </p>

    <h2>  Background </h2><p>  Officially, the history of the sale of Alaska by Russia says that the proposal for the deal came from the famous Russian diplomat Edward Stekl.  And negotiations began precisely at a time when Great Britain began to make its claims on this territory. </p><p>  And this was another reason why it was very beneficial for Russia to get rid of its northern land. </p><p>  The question of in which year the Russians sold Alaska to America is now a matter of considerable controversy.  Some call the year 1866, others - the 1867th.  I must say that both of these dates correspond to reality. </p><h2>  Secret negotiations </h2><p>  On December 16, 1866, on a gloomy gloomy winter day, Emperor Alexander II convened a meeting.  It was attended by his brother, Prince Konstantin, ministers of the maritime and financial departments, as well as Baron Eduard Stekl, Russia's ambassador to Washington.  I must say that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãselling by the participants was approved and supported.  Actually, from this moment the accession of Alaska to the United States began.  At first, they waited for the end of the term of privileges of the <span>Russian-American company,</span> then - the civil war in the United States.  Nevertheless, on March 18, 1867, <span>American President</span> Johnson, after much deliberation, finally signed the Decree on the transfer of special powers to William Seward.  At the suggestion of the Minister of Finance, the minimum threshold price of Alaska was also established: five million rubles.  A week later, the Russian emperor, having approved the borders of his state, sent Stekly to America with an official appeal to Secretary of State Seward.  After that, negotiations started literally right away, during which it was possible to agree on an agreement to purchase Alaska from the Russian state for seven million dollars. </p><h2>  USA and Tsarist Russia </h2><p>  By the beginning of the sales process, relations between Russia and America had reached their zenith.  Even during the years of the Crimean War, the United States repeatedly emphasized: if the borders of the conflict expand, they will not take an anti-Russian position.  The intention to sell Alaska was kept in secret.  Surprisingly, with the already sufficient level of the then foreign intelligence, information did not leak into third states.  The London newspaper The Times wrote with great concern about the mysterious mutual sympathy that rises between the United States and Russia.  Moreover, the money paid for these northern lands paid off in a short period of time, and there‚Äôs no need to talk about the strategic plus from this deal, you just have to imagine where Alaska is located on the map. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alaska USA" class="if" height="262" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/394155.jpg?1400055622154" width="390"></div>

    <p>  Great Britain‚Äôs discontent was well-grounded: the treaty of 1867 not only made these two states closest neighbors, but also made it possible for Americans to surround British possessions in the north from all sides.  The statement by American General Welbridge at a dinner party in honor of the Russian delegation also added fuel to the fire.  Its meaning was as follows: on the planet there are two significant hemispheres, the western and eastern, one of which should represent the United States, and the second - Russia.  Naturally, this was only a subtle diplomatic pun, but the fact remains: the Russians seriously supported the Americans in their exaltation. </p><h2>  Direct transfer </h2><p>  The signing of the contract occurred on March 30, 1867 in Washington.  It was compiled in French and English, which at that time were diplomatic languages.  Interestingly, no official text in Russian simply does not exist.  Under the terms of the treaty, the entire Alaska peninsula passed to America, as well as its coastal strip ten miles south. </p><p>  The US Senate, although doubted the appropriateness of such a purchase, however, most of its members supported the deal. </p><p>  On October 18, 1867, Alaska was officially transferred to the Americans.  From Russia, A. A. Peshchurov, a special government commissioner, captain of the second rank, signed the protocol on the transfer of this territory.  Interestingly, the <span>Gregorian calendar</span> was introduced that day <span>.</span>  Therefore, the inhabitants of Alaska woke up on the eighteenth of October, although they went to bed on the fifth of October.  Therefore, if the answer to the question in which year Alaska was sold to America is clear, then this cannot be said about the date of signing the contract. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="State of alaska" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/394158.jpg" width="503"></div></h2><h2>  Mystic </h2><p>  On October 18, 1867, at half past four in the afternoon, the flag was changed at the flagpole located in front of the house of the ruler of Alaska.  Russian and American troops lined up in a row, and on a signal, one non-commissioned officer from each side began to lower the banner raised during the time of the Russian-American campaign.  The ceremony itself was held in an atmosphere of great solemnity, however, until the flag, entangled at the very top in the ropes, became the cause of the cliff breaking. </p><p>  By order, several sailors rushed up to try to unravel the cloth left over from the banner that hung in tatters on the mast.  However, no one realized to shout from below the sailor, who first crawled up to him, so that he would not drop the banner down, but would cry with him.  And when he dropped it from above, the flag hit the Russian bayonets.  To the mystics this incident would have seemed a sign, but at that moment it did not occur to anyone to think about it.  In general, the history of the transfer of Alaska to America is shrouded in thousands of myths, but many of them are untrue. </p><h2>  Glass and his mission </h2><p>  A significant role in the sale of Alaska was played by diplomat Stekl.  Since 1850, he was the Charg√© d'Affaires of the Russian Embassy in the United States, and from 1854 transferred to the post of Russian ambassador.  Glass's wife was an American, so he was fairly integrated into the upper circles of American society.  Such extensive connections helped him, they facilitated the implementation of the transaction.  The Russian diplomat actively lobbied for the interests of the Russian emperor.  In order to persuade the Senate to decide on the purchase of Alaska, Glass gave bribes, using all his connections.  Alexander II appointed him a reward in the amount of twenty five thousand dollars, as well as a life pension of six thousand rubles. </p><p>  Eduard Andreyevich immediately after the sale of Alaska came to Petersburg for a short while, but soon left for Paris.  Until the end of his life, this diplomat eschewed Russian society, however, it was his too.  After the story of Alaska behind Glass, notoriety remained.  And there were reasons for that. </p><h2>  Where's the money? </h2>

Eduard Stekl, having received the check, left a reward for himself, distributed almost a hundred and a half thousand as bribes to the senators who voted for ratification, and transferred the remaining money by bank transfer to London, from where the gold bullion purchased for the entire amount went to St. Petersburg by sea.  Some of the payment was lost when converting to pounds and gold.  But this was not the last loss of Russia.

    <p>  The main historical question is not in what year Alaska was sold to America, but where the money gained from this transaction went. </p><p>  Bark Orkney, on board of which there was such a long-awaited cargo for the Russian state, sank on the approach to Petersburg on July 16, 1868.  It is still unknown whether there was gold on it, or whether it did not leave Misty Albion.  Moreover, the insurance company declared itself bankrupt, and therefore only partially compensated for the damage to the Russians.  The Rothschilds failed to pay the debt, but tsarist Russia nevertheless lost a huge piece of land. </p><h2>  Mistakes and conjectures </h2><p>  The history of the sale of Alaska by Russia still generates all sorts of judgments and conjectures.  Since the negotiations were held in the strictest confidence, the signing of the contract was hidden for a long time.  And only a year later in the "Diplomatic Yearbook" was published a convention in French.  Such secrecy gave rise to speculation in the first place that Alaska was leased to the United States for a period of ninety-nine years, and after this period it will be returned to Russia.  Such an erroneous version became so tenacious that when this period expired, in the middle of the last century, demands began to sound to transfer it back.  But, unfortunately, this was only a fallacy.  Alaska did not rent, but was sold forever. </p><h2>  Facts </h2><p>  Interestingly, the United States over the past two centuries has been actively expanding its territory.  Few people know that back in 1803, America bought France from Louisiana for fifteen million dollars, a little later, for the amount of three times less, Florida was successfully acquired from Spain.  And already ten years later, in 1818, during the process of dividing the "inheritance", most of the territory passed from the Mexico to the United States. </p><p>  No less remarkable is the fact that Alaska officially became the next state only in 1959, and not at all in 1867, when it was sold. </p>
