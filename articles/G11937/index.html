    <h2>  Holidays in Russia </h2><p>  Where to fly in January to those who for some reason could not spend time abroad?  Of course, to Russia!  If you want to take up winter sports, then at your disposal are ski resorts in the Urals, the Caucasus and Krasnaya Polyana.  Near Moscow and St. Petersburg there are also many well-equipped ski resorts with pistes of various difficulty levels. </p><p>  If you decide to study the history of your native country more deeply, then feel free to go along the Golden Ring of Russia.  You will see ancient Russian cities, visit many historical museums, see monuments of architecture and much more. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  As a rule, travelers are happy to recall their <span>winter holidays</span> spent outside their hometown.  They return home rested, bring with them a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãphotographs and souvenirs.  Experienced tourists are advised every year to find something new and not focus on one country.  The world is so huge, and it's so great to see all its facets!  If you manage to choose the right direction, choose the right tour, successfully correlate price and quality, then you will certainly be satisfied with your winter vacation. </p><h2>  Voyage cost </h2><p>  As the saying goes, "prepare a sled in the summer, and a cart in the winter."  In order not to be disappointed in your trip and not spend all your savings on it, carefully consider the preparation.  Remember that holiday prices in January are skyrocketing, so book a tour a few months before the appointed date.  Some people prefer to wait until the last minute packages appear and save a significant amount on their purchase.  But this approach has its drawbacks.  Firstly, you can‚Äôt be sure that the last-minute ticket will appear exactly on the dates for which you have planned your vacation, or that it will appear at all.  Secondly, it is always a lottery, since it is difficult to guess which directions discounts will appear.  If such a prospect does not bother you, then you can safely go this way.  But just in case, be safe and provide backup options for holidays in Russia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to fly in January" class="if" height="282" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22797/513717.jpg" width="425"></div>

    <p>  At the moment, it is difficult to predict at what price it will be possible to purchase a tour.  Typically, the cost of the trip depends on the current exchange rate of the euro, so stay tuned. </p><p>  If you focus on the experience of past years, then a January vacation in Thailand will be a little more expensive than a trip to India or the UAE.  Bus tours to Europe are not too expensive, but be prepared for certain inconveniences.  If you do not have a Schengen visa yet, then you can save by going to one of the visa-free countries. </p>
