One of these quiet, budget hotels is Susagade Resort. </p><h2>  Location Features </h2><p>  This two-star hotel is located in the village of Vagator.  This small village is very popular among domestic tourists.  It is located just 17 km from the city of Goa, Panaji, near the coast.  The distance from Vagator to <span>Goa's only airport in Dabolim</span> is 42 km, and the nearest railway station, Qivim, is 14 km.  To the beach from the hotel guests have to get about 1 km. </p>

    <p>  It is most convenient to take a taxi from the airport to the hotel.  Transfer to the hotel, unfortunately, is not available.  The price of local taxi drivers to travel to the village of Vagator is fixed and is about $ 17- $ 19.  Experienced tourists advise beginners to look for travel companions.  You can give a tip to a taxi driver.  A trip from the train station to the hotel will cost about $ 7. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The most comfortable time of the year for a trip to Vagator is considered to be the period from November to March.  But the best weather here is, according to most tourists, in December.  The sea in Vagator at that time is calm, and there is almost no rain. </p><h2>  General description of the hotel </h2><p>  This budget hotel is a one-story long building, painted in blue and white.  Despite the fact that the architecture of the Susagade Resort 2 * hotel is somewhat reminiscent of the old Soviet hut, it looks very good.  The walls are painted in white and blue that mix well with each other.  The courtyard of this hotel also looks very neat.  The hotel building is surrounded on all sides by lush tropical vegetation, and flower beds are broken under the windows of the rooms.  The yard area and the paths between the lawns are lined with beautiful paving tiles. </p><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  In total, Susagade Resort (India, Goa) offers its guests 10 quite comfortable rooms.  If desired, you can choose Standard A / C Room or Standard Non A / C Room.  In addition to beds and nightstands, each room has a telephone and a TV.  Some Standard A / C Rooms are air-conditioned.  Shower and toilet in each room are individual. </p>

Cable TV and satellite channels can be watched in the room.  For storage of clothes in each room of the hotel there is a small double case. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Room Rates </h2><p>  It is worth renting rooms in this hotel is very inexpensive.

However, here for tourists there are several amenities.  So, for example, luggage, if desired, can be left in a specially equipped left-luggage office.  For bikes and cars rented by guests, free parking is provided.  Securities and documents can be returned to the safe. </p><p>  Tourists rest in this hotel usually for several weeks.  Of course, during this time things manage to get dirty.  In order to wash them, it is not necessary to look for dry cleaning in Vagator.  The hotel, among other things, has a rather well-equipped laundry room.  True, you can use this service only for a fee. </p>

One of the best, according to many tourists, is "Ju &amp; Mo".  In addition to traditional spicy Indian dishes, impromptu European dishes are also offered to tourists.  They don‚Äôt sell alcohol in a restaurant, but they‚Äôre allowed to bring it with them. </p>

    <p>  Very good reviews leave about one of the bakery Vagator "Bakery".  Here you can buy a delicious cheesecake.  Also, many tourists like to visit the Mango Three bar in Vagator.  In this institution, among other things, they sell quite edible pies with chicken, as well as delicious croissants with cheese. </p><p>  The cult place of Vagator, attracting tourists from all over North Goa, is the restaurant ‚ÄúMoonlight‚Äù.  Here you can order dumplings and dumplings, as well as a traditional Indian dish - manti "Mo-mo". </p><h2>  Susagade Resort 2 *: hotel reviews </h2><p>  Tourists have a good opinion about this hotel.  Of course, there are not so many amenities.  But, according to most guests, it fully justifies its two-star rating.  Not too demanding tourists who prefer an active holiday during the day and as calm as possible at night, this hotel fits very well. </p><p>  The staff at the hotel Susagade Resort 2 * (Goa), according to most vacationers, is polite and treats their duties well.  Bed linen and towels are changed daily.  Moreover, washing clothes in this hotel is very good.  At least a gray shade, as in many other cheap hotels in India, it does not. </p><h2>  Where to swim and sunbathe </h2><p>  There are several beaches in the village of Vagator.  Guests of the Susagade Resort 2 * hotel (India, Goa), if desired, can choose absolutely any of them.  The most beautiful beach (not only in the village, but in the whole of North Goa) is the Big Vagator.  The views here are simply magnificent.  The beach is covered with sand, sunbathing and swimming on it is very convenient.  However, judging by the reviews of tourists, local Indians are very hindered here.  Most of them come to coastal resorts from remote wilderness villages (usually once in a lifetime).  And each of these local village tourists definitely wants to be photographed against the background of a ‚Äúwhite man‚Äù, so that later they can show the pictures to family and friends. </p>

    <p>  In the north of Vagator there is another small hidden beach "Chapora Beach".  There are no annoying Indians here.  But in order to get to this beach, you need to go along a rather uncomfortable path.  The prices in the cafe are higher than on other beaches of Vagator.  The fact is that there is no access for cars to the coastline, and the owners of local cafes have to deliver groceries using the labor of workers, who, accordingly, have to pay. </p><p>  Small Vagator is also a relatively convenient beach located near Susagade Resort 2 * (Vagator).  Descent to the sea, however, is not too good here.  On the path you can meet cows, and it ends with a public toilet.  The latter is taken by some naive tourists as a local attraction, which is excellent as a background for a photo.  The beach itself is divided by rocks into several lagoons.  The view here is simply excellent, but swimming in the sea due to the many stones is somewhat unsafe. </p>

    <p>  Ozoron Beach is located in the south of Small Vagator.  Swimming here is convenient.  In addition, on this beach you can also see the face of the god Shiva carved in the rock, made by one of the Italian sculptors in the last century. </p><p>  If desired, you can rent a sun lounger and an umbrella on all the beaches of Vagator for a small fee.  Experienced tourists advise to go down to the seashore in the village carefully.  In most cases, paths surround, albeit rare, but still the jungle.  In any case, you should look under your feet, otherwise you can step on a snake. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  In addition to the face of Shiva, tourists at the Susagade Resort hotel have the opportunity to see: </p><ul><li>  Catholic Church Our Lady Of Valankani; </li><li>  Fort Chapor. </li></ul><p>  Of course, the most interesting attraction of Vagator is Fort Chapor.  It is an ancient fortress located on a hill, from which walls, windows and loopholes remained intact. </p>
