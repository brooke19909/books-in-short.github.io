    <h2>  Arda 3 *.  Sunny beach </h2><p>  To begin with about the location.  This friendly hotel is located near the center of the resort (approximately one kilometer).  To the airport - twenty-five kilometers (Burgas).  This is a beautiful, restored building of ten floors, hospitably opening the doors for its temporary residents.  Arda 3 * beach is located at some distance from the building, so you have to walk a bit along the picturesque streets (250 m).  This fact does not particularly concern guests, since this path is not tiring.  Advertising agents always talk about the breathtaking view that opens from the windows of the rooms.  Experienced tourists give advice: take those apartments that overlook the pool.  He is really unusually beautiful. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  Apartments Arda 3 * (Bulgaria) do not shine with originality.  There are single rooms with a standard suite.  It includes a bed (you can ask for an extra bed), TV, bar, shower, balcony.  You will have to pay extra for negotiations.  It is better to bring a hair dryer with you, there it is paid.  If you want to iron things, then you also have to fork out.  What can you do - a resort.  Who comes to mind to go to the beach in a tailcoat?  Arda 3 * offers other options.  You can come as a family, with one or two children.  If there are more people, you will have to order two rooms.  The air conditioning at the hotel is central.  Wealthy guests are offered a safe for a fee.  Here he is, Arda 3 * Sunny Beach, according to general information from advertising sites. </p>

    <h2>  Apartment reviews </h2><p>  Most of the guests, who were impressed by their impressions, did not express complaints about the numbers.  Everyone noted that Arda 3 * (Bulgaria) is a great option for a small budget.  If you do not have any special complaints, then get a lot of pleasure.  There is ambiguity in the issue of cleaning.  One was lucky - they cleaned the room daily, others were not happy, as the maid did not indulge in attention.  But no one begs a tip.  According to the impressions of tourists, the relatives of the owner work at the Arda 3 * hotel.  Of course, no one checked the passports, but the atmosphere is so ‚Äúhomely‚Äù that it occurred to many people.  By the way, most guests praise workers for their friendliness, sweet smile and lack of obsession. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Meals (breakfast) </h2><p>  Opinions diverged regarding the menu.  Which, in principle, is understandable, since people have different tastes.  Men were satisfied with the quality and calorie content of dishes.  Young mothers express dissatisfaction with the monotony of the menu.  Hotel Arda 3 * offers classic omelettes, sausages, vegetables.  From drinks juices, milk.  I liked the tea, for the sweet - jams.  In general, no frills, but nutritionally and efficiently.  And the probability of suffering from unusual food is very small.  The latter circumstance can be considered a plus.  Moreover, for lovers of exoticism around the hotel there are many establishments.  Prices are not scary, and the range of treats pleases. </p><h2>  Tour Prices </h2><p>  It is clear that the cost of tickets varies.  But in general, in 2014, you can relax for the completely symbolic sixteen thousand.  In season, the price rises to forty (per person).  Seasoned travelers are advised to take last minute packages.  So much more economical.  There are no particular difficulties with the settlement.  The attendants really ‚Äútremble‚Äù over every tourist.  About Arda 3 * reviews are mostly positive, which may inspire optimism.  The hotel itself is touted as a place to relax with children.  But mothers and children who visited there complain about the "environment" of the territory with bars providing the services of "18+".  If you do not pay attention to it, then you can relax perfectly. </p>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The sea, as already mentioned, is not far.  According to vacationers, it takes only five to seven minutes to walk - and the beach is already.  It is clean, sandy, well-groomed.  A deck chair and an umbrella - for a fee, but symbolic.  On the way, you can always buy fresh, delicious fruits.  Tourists recommend taking juices in benches, which are many (on the beach more expensive).  For children, the sea is a pleasure.  Good descent, not deep.  Moms have nothing to worry about.  People praise the rescue service.  They do not work through the sleeves.  With such observers it is simply impossible to drown. </p><h2>  Special recommendations </h2><p>  Almost everyone who decided to talk about their vacation, talking about booking rooms.  In their opinion, this way you can get a fresher room.  If you don‚Äôt like noise, it‚Äôs better to settle higher, as there are cafes around the hotel that ‚Äúgush‚Äù with music in the evening.  Approximately to the third floor, extraneous noise disappears.  And the view is more pleasant.  About money.  It is recommended that you bring the euro with you.  Change them is in the bank.  Exchangers, of course, are everywhere, but they have a lower rate.  Those departing to Bulgaria are advised to remember the name ‚ÄúCooperative Bank‚Äù - it will come in handy.  There are different opinions about the pool.  Some tourists complain that the water in it does not warm up.  Others did not like its openness and accessibility.  This means that everyone is allowed to swim in the pool, and not just hotel guests.  In any case, the sea is more pleasant and more useful.  And the beach can not be compared with the pool on the senses. </p>

    <h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Gold Coast - a place for a relaxing holiday.  Fans of extravagant fun do not seek here.  The sun and the sea can be interspersed with pleasant doing nothing in a cafe, walking and excursions.  Women are attracted to shops.  Many recommend going on a shopping hunt.  According to reviews by fans digging into the shelves, the prices here are more than reasonable.  Quite high-quality clothing can be purchased two times cheaper than in Russia.  A special recommendation for mothers: there are a lot of children's shops and shops around the hotel, full of acceptable offers.  Men are recommended to try local beer.  It has a special taste, does not bite at a price.  The audience at the hotel is different, but not annoying.  Mostly Europeans, people are calm, almost conservative. </p>
