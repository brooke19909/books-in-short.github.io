  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Marshal Poluboyarov - biography of the legendary commander</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The history of Russia of the 20th century is continuously connected with revolutionary events, world wars and various military operations of a smaller scale.  That is why the fate of the famous Soviet military leaders, including the hero of the Soviet Union, Marshal Pavel Pavlovich, is so attractive.  His biography is a reflection of the history of the state, his role in the history of the country of Soviets is difficult to overestimate, it is impossible to repeat the life path. </p><h2>  From an early youth to a high goal </h2><p>  The future Marshal Pavel Pavlovich Poluboyarov was born in the glorious city of Tula on June 3, 1901 (according to the old style).  Father is a simple artisan handicraftsman, and if not for the October Revolution, Pavel would have faced the same path - hard work from dark to dark, attempts to make ends meet, provide the family with at least the minimum conditions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="xn----7sbflbuawpe1ai2qf.xn--p1ai" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Marshal Poluboyarov" class="if uuid-2888126" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98075/2888126.jpg"></div><p>  The father could not have imagined that his son would reach such heights in the military branch that Marshal Pavel Pavubovich appeared on the family tree.  But Poluboyarov Sr. dreamed that the heir would get out into the people, and for this he needed education.  The young man entered the local city school, and at the end of the educational institution he took the position of accountant, then he mastered the working professions at the factory. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Guard the motherland </h2><p>  The revolutionary events of the beginning of the century could not ignore the ambitious and courageous guy.  The future Marshal Poluboyarov began a military career, so to speak, with the role of a labor combatant.  Very quickly, he became the head of the squads from the rank and file, entered the board, honestly performed his duties throughout 1917-1918. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Red Army" class="if uuid-2888134" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98075/2888134.jpg"></div><p>  Almost immediately, his political career began, which went hand in hand with the military.  In 1920, the well-known future Marshal Poluboyarov joined the ranks of the Communists, and from November 1919 - into the Workers 'and Peasants' Red Army.  The infantry command courses in Tula are the ‚Äúfirst school‚Äù of the young fighter, but Pavel raved about the equipment, so he entered the School of Armored Forces.  As subsequent life showed, the young man made the right choice. </p><p>  In the 1930s  Poluboyarov‚Äôs career goes uphill: in 1926, he holds the position of platoon commander, and in 1929, he was appointed the acting officer of the armored division in the Kiev 45th Infantry Division.  After 2 years, he becomes the chief of staff in the tank training regiment.  Pavel Pavlovich is engaged not only in practical work, tirelessly improves his qualifications, for four years (until December 1938) he was a student of the Military Academy of Mechanization and Motorization, which was named after Joseph Stalin. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  "In war as in war ..." </h2><p>  The future marshal of the armored forces Poluboyarov Pavel Pavlovich begins a new campaign to the heights of military glory in 1938.  As the head of the armored forces in the Trans-Baikal Military District, he takes part in battles on the Khalkhin-Gol River.  Then he was transferred first to Leningrad, then to the Baltic states. </p><div class="photo" data-original="waralbum.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Poluboyarov and friend" class="if uuid-2888131" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98075/2888131.jpg"></div><p>  Poluboyarov began his own war with the Nazis on the North-Western Front, and since 1942 he was transferred to the 17th Panzer Corps of the Voronezh Front as a deputy commander of the Kalinin Front. </p><h2>  The origins of the glory of the heroes of Cantemi </h2><p>  So far, the general, and in the near future, Marshal Pavel Pavlovich Poluboyarov takes part in the defense of Voronezh from the Nazis, in military operations on the Middle Don.  The tank corps under his leadership was particularly distinguished in the battles for the urban village of Kantemirovka, when a brilliant military operation was carried out, and Soviet troops advanced deep behind enemy lines.  The corps now began to be called Kantemirovsky. </p><div class="photo" data-original="foma.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kursk Bulge" class="if uuid-2888137" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98075/2888137.jpg"></div><p>  The corps of General Poluboyarov heroically fought with the Germans on the Orlov-Kursk Bulge, then took part in the liberation of Ukrainian cities and villages.  With the liberation of the territories of the Soviet Union, the war did not end for General Poluboyarov.  The corps under his leadership liberated Silesia, Poland, in particular Krakow, fought on the <span>Sandomierz bridgehead,</span> took part in Prague and Berlin operations. </p><p>  Pavel Poluboyarov received the title of Hero of the Soviet Union for the liberation of the German city of Dresden.  The operation was carried out brilliantly, the enemy was knocked out, and the amazing architecture, masterpieces of the famous gallery were saved. </p><h2>  War and Peace by Marshal Poluboyarov </h2><p>  At the end of World War II, Poluboyarov‚Äôs career did not stop, since 1946 he was appointed commander of the tank army (5th).  In 1954, he occupied an important and responsible post of chief of armored forces, since 1961 - head of armored forces.  Since August 28, 1962, Pavel Pavlovich Poluboyarov becomes a marshal of armored forces. </p><div class="photo" data-original="novodevichiynecropol.narod.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Novodevichy cemetery" class="if uuid-2888127" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98075/2888127.jpg"></div><p>  A specialist of the highest level, he is carrying out reorganization of troops, is developing and introducing into practice new types of tank weapons and equipment.  Spends a lot of time training highly qualified personnel.  On his track record is work as a deputy of the Supreme Council of the BSSR and the RSFSR, membership in the Central Committee of the CPSU. </p><p>  Pavel Pavlovich Poluboyarov went a long and difficult way from captain to marshal, took part in hostilities and led military units in peacetime.  He was awarded various orders and medals, one of the regiments that are part of the Kantemirov Tank Division, was given the name of the legendary commander. </p>
