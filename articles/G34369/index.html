  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Constant light kit: description, manufacturers overview, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the art of photography, one of the key points is lighting.  The photographer selects its intensity, quantity, brightness and pattern based on many factors, ranging from style to the figure of the model.  Therefore, it is imperative that this "detail" is of high quality and allows the master to create certain effects.  In this article we will learn about what it is - a set of constant light, what devices it consists of and how it works.  We will also consider the most popular brands in this area. </p><h2>  Small introduction </h2><p>  Everyone, exceptionally all photographers, even beginners, are well acquainted with the basic schemes for arranging lighting devices in a studio.  It is this technique (this or that variation of it) that allows you to create a specific effect - focus on the model, make a play of shadow and light, leave only a silhouette on the photo, etc. But in order to correctly manipulate all this, you should initially have a kit constant light.  It can be purchased ready-made by choosing the package that you need, or do it yourself.  In the second case, you will invest in a more "tight" budget, but at the same time you will encounter previously unprecedented difficulties.  Sources of constant light, in contrast to impulsive (flash and its varieties), make it possible to create deeper, meaningful photographs, thinking ahead of all the nuances.  This option is ideal for both photography and video shooting the same way, and, of course, today it is present in every studio. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.alzashop.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what is a constant light kit" class="if uuid-3112357" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/3112357.jpg"></div><h2>  Main characteristics </h2><p>  The qualities that any set of continuous light can possess, regardless of the brand manufacturer, are identical.  What are they like? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Burns on an ongoing basis. </li><li>  The pattern of the model and its shadow are clearly visible. </li><li>  With such a light, the photographer is mobile in the studio. </li><li>  More affordable in comparison with impulsive light. </li><li>  It is powered by the mains. </li></ul><p>  But it is also worth mentioning that any set of constant light for video shooting or for a photo studio consumes a huge amount of electricity.  Moreover, some appliances can become very hot, and the room quickly gets hot. </p><p>  Now we turn to the consideration of those sets that produce specific brands. </p><h2>  FST Studio Kit </h2><p>  Our list opens with the FST Studio Kit, which is designed for mobile video and photo studio.  It is considered one of the most popular and universal, while flaunting a very affordable price in combination with good quality.  The kit consists of the following units: </p><ul><li>  Installation for hanging the background with parameters 209 by 300 cm. </li><li>  Green, black and white backgrounds. </li><li>  2 softboxes 50 to 70. </li><li>  1 softbox 50 to 50. </li><li>  9 lamps with a capacity of 85 watts under the E27 base. </li><li>  2 racks 1.9 meters high. </li><li>  1 crane. </li><li>  Bag for transportation. </li></ul><p>  Lighting devices at full power emit color heat in the range of 5500 K. At the same time, the captured objects practically do not heat up.  This kit is often used for shooting news, short interviews, as well as for studio photo shoots. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="FST Studio Kit" class="if uuid-3112361" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/3112361.jpg"></div><h2>  Falcon Eyes Studio LED 275-kit </h2><p>  The second set of constant light LED 275-kit is designed for professionals who are versed in their field and rely on quality and reliability.  To begin, let's see what is presented in the set: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  2 LED illuminators. </li><li>  The remote control. </li><li>  Two reflectors 180 mm each. </li><li>  2 softboxes 60 to 90. </li><li>  2 racks L-2000. </li><li>  Bag for transportation. </li></ul><p>  The color temperature of lighting devices is 6500 K, which allows you to take photos and videos without distortion.  The lamps are equipped with the Bowen Bayonet system, which allows using nozzles to create certain lighting effects.  As for the control panel, it has 16 channels and 6 groups.  Also, the kit as a whole has a memory function - when you turn on the devices again, the last operating mode and position are configured. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.photospecialist.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Falcon Eyes Studio LED 275-kit" class="if uuid-3112363" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/3112363.jpg"></div><h2>  Grifon grif-13 </h2><p>  We pass to more universal and widespread sets, which will be suitable for both beginner photographers and pros.  The Grifon constant light kit cannot boast a huge number of components, but at the same time it meets all quality standards and allows you to make the most clear and sound shots.  It is suitable only for photography, and if it comes to video, then it is worth using additional devices.  So, this kit consists of: </p><ul><li>  Two racks. </li><li>  Two five-lamp illuminators with mount for umbrella. </li><li>  Two softboxes that are worn on illuminators, 60 to 90 cm in size. </li><li>  10 energy-saving lamps. </li><li>  A bag. </li></ul><p>  The temperature that is emitted by these devices ranges from 5000 to 5500 K. This gives extremely pure white light, which allows us to avoid unnecessary image correction in the future, when processing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cdiscount.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Constant light kit" class="if uuid-3112368" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/3112368.jpg"></div><h2>  Lumifor MACRO-1500-3UU KIT </h2><p>  And this is a set of halogen illuminators that are often used when shooting videos, and when it comes to studio photo shoots, most often only professionals choose such a light.  First of all, we suggest that you familiarize yourself with the configuration of this kit. </p><ul><li>  Three illuminators LUMIFOR MACRO with a wavelength of 50 Hz. </li><li>  Three studio reflectors LFM-12. </li><li>  Three 500 W halogen lamps. </li><li>  Two umbrellas for a clearance of diameters of 84 cm. </li><li>  Three studio racks with shock absorbers. </li><li>  Instruction </li></ul><p>  Many argue that in order to properly configure this light kit, you should "make friends" with it.  Intuitively, you can choose the most successful camera angles based on the characteristics of the shooting style and model.  It is also believed that this kit is ideal for macro photography and for subject pictures. </p><h2>  FANCIER FAN-WTD </h2><p>  A fairly straightforward and common kit, which is acquired by both beginners and professionals.  He is also a regular at studios at fashion magazines, as he is simply ideal for fashion shooting on photos and videos.  The emitted temperature is 5500 K, as a result there is no excess heat.  Therefore, this kit is also often used for subject and portrait shooting.  What does it consist of? </p><ul><li>  2 five-lamp illuminators. </li><li>  2 octoboxes. </li><li>  10 fluorescent lamps. </li><li>  2 two-meter racks. </li><li>  Bag for transportation. </li></ul><p>  It is believed that octagonal softboxes (octoboxes) are ideal for creating high-quality and artistic portraits, as well as for photographing food, still lifes, etc. This kit is universal, has all the necessary characteristics for a professional, and is absolutely inexpensive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="threecolumnblogger.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Portrait shooting" class="if uuid-3112377" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/3112377.jpg"></div><h2>  Logocam A-LED 500 / SFF DIM KIT 56 </h2><p>  One of the most expensive and "massive" in every sense of the word sets for lighting photos and videos.  Its main advantage is that it can work in places where connecting to the mains is undesirable or impossible.  Indispensable for visiting photo shoots and filming, and at the same time perfectly copes with the main tasks in simple studios.

This is an investment that should pay off and be profitable in the future, and this is only possible if the equipment is really high-quality.
