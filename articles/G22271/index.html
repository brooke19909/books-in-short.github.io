However, their cost is quite high, and clothes made from the thinnest genuine leather look rough and weigh quite a lot.  Therefore, fabric manufacturers again pleased fashionistas and created a modern material - varnish fabric, which took a strong position on the catwalks of the whole world.  It can be found both in collections of outerwear, and in everyday things, evening dresses and accessories. </p><h2>  Description and composition </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.tissus.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="blue fabric varnish" class="if uuid-2659493" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2659493.jpg"></div><p>  And yet, what is it - fabric varnish?  This name has French roots and means "varnished, glossy, shiny."  It is these adjectives that can characterize the classic variations of this fabric.  From the usual artificial leather substitutes, this material has an extensive color palette - from classic black and white to neon colors, you can also find mother-of-pearl shades, fabric with a gradient effect, embossed leather or other ornaments, printed pattern and matte surface.  Despite all the variety of options, the composition and production method of the varnish fabric varies slightly. </p><p>  In its structure, this fabric is a synthetic or semi-synthetic base (with the addition of viscose or wool) and a top coating.  As a rule, this is a polyurethane film pressed into the base fabric under high pressure.  The higher the pressure used in production, the better the adhesion of the substrate and the film, and accordingly, the better the quality of the material itself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Lacquer fabric, like any other material, has a number of advantages and disadvantages. </p><h2>  Advantages </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.grazia.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Outerwear made of varnish" class="if uuid-2659484" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2659484.jpg"></div><ul><li>  This material is very strong and flexible, therefore, products from it are durable. </li><li>  Thanks to an extensive assortment, you can choose not only the necessary color and texture of the material, but also the density.  This allows the use of fabric in many areas. </li><li>  Even the most dense version of varnish will weigh less than genuine leather and other leather substitutes, so the products are very light and comfortable to wear. </li><li>  The polyurethane film covering the base fabric is uniform, so the varnish fabric does not leak water and does not blow.  In addition, it is not affected by fungi and microorganisms. </li><li>  The fabric holds its shape and volume well, while being soft enough to form folds, which, combined with color, gloss and texture, makes even very simple models spectacular. </li><li>  Cutting parts out of such a material is very easy.  It does not deform, does not shrink, and its edges do not crumble. </li><li>  In addition to the above, it remains to say that the cost of this fabric is very affordable - about 400 rubles.  per meter. </li></ul><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Despite the abundance of advantages, the shortcomings of this material seriously make you think about the possibility of acquiring another material. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  First of all, the fabric does not breathe.  This means that any clothing will have a greenhouse effect.  That is why the fabric can not be used for summer clothes or for people with increased sweating. </li><li>  Over time, scuffs or scratches may appear on the material, which can no longer be removed. </li><li>  Sewing at home from fabric varnish is very difficult.  The needle should be very thin and sharp - when punched, a hole appears on the film, which can creep out under load, which will permanently ruin the product, and the metal foot will scratch the material, so you only need to use plastic.  And so that the fabric in the seam area is not deformed, it must be glued. </li><li>  When heated, the material irrevocably changes color, so you can‚Äôt iron it, which also makes it difficult to sew independently. </li><li>  If the quality of the material is not good enough, the upper film may burst and peel off, forming unaesthetic bald spots. </li></ul><h2>  Application </h2><div class="photo" data-original="deguisement.buttinette.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Varnish Leggings" class="if uuid-2659489" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2659489.jpg"></div><p>  Lake has a wide scope.  Gloves, handbags, belts, skirts, trousers and vests are sewed from it.  Silicone lacquer fabric is very popular when sewing outerwear, since it is such a variant of the material that is the most frost-resistant.  You can also find this fabric among <span>upholstery for furniture, materials for</span> stage costumes, car interior decoration and much more. </p><h2>  Care </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.tissus.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Yellow fabric varnish" class="if uuid-2659492" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2659492.jpg"></div><p>  It is very easy to take care of things from a varnish fabric.  They practically do not crease, the formed folds easily go under the press or at high humidity.  It is also not necessary to wash this material.  It is enough to wipe the places of contamination with a damp cloth, and moisten the stains from a ballpoint pen or felt-tip pen with alcohol.  This material does not have special storage conditions, so it can be used to make covers for bicycles or inflatable boats and store them in the garage. </p><p>  And in order for products to please their pristine look for a long time, one must remember 3 "not": </p><ol><li>  Do not iron. </li><li>  Do not use cleaning powder. </li><li>  Do not scratch. </li></ol><h2>  Reviews </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.vestemode.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Down jacket" class="if uuid-2659481" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2659481.jpg"></div><p>  It‚Äôs best to help answer the question of what it is - a varnish fabric, customer reviews that have come across this material directly.  Many were inclined to choose this fabric because of its color and water resistance.  In everyday clothes, they appreciated her ability to hide imperfections, making it possible to make the figure in the right places more rounded and appetizing.  Artists praise the fabric for its ductility and spectacular appearance.  As for outerwear, then, according to reviews, the silicone-250 varnish fabric, unlike other types of this material, best combines qualities such as heat and moisture insulation, appearance and wear resistance. </p><p>  Graceful varnish gloves, a pencil skirt, a leather coat or a strap made of varnish will be the perfect complement to any wardrobe, allowing you to feel more feminine and sexy in such products. </p>
