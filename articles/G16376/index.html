A popular holiday destination is famous for its comfortable climate, white beaches, excellent cuisine, excellent shopping and historical monuments. </p><h2>  A brief excursion into history </h2><p>  The center of the province of the same name in Sardinia was founded by the Phoenicians before our era and bore the name Caralis in honor of the hero of local epics.  Later, under Spanish influence, the city became known as Cagliari. </p><p>  Located at the crossroads of the Mediterranean trade routes, it was the main port of Carthage.  This period of domination had a strong influence not only on the history of the city, but also on its architecture. </p><p>  During the reign of the Roman Empire, Cagliari (Italy) turned into a serious commercial center.  It was at this time that the streets were paved in the city, water supply, sewage, and baths were built, administrative buildings and roads appeared that connected the port with other cities. </p><p>  After the death of the invincible empire, attacks of barbarians and revelry of pirates began.  In the 15th century, Cagliari fell under Spanish rule, and the period of crisis and war lasted another three centuries, until Sardinia came under Italian rule.  The region received official administrative independence in the middle of the 19th century, and the city begins to develop rapidly.  After World War II, the destroyed by the Americans Cagliari (Italy) was completely reconstructed. </p><h2>  Beach resort </h2><p>  Now the original city attracts great attention of travelers from different parts of the globe.  The resort center is famous for its excellent beaches with numerous bays.  The eight-kilometer center of nightlife Poetto, snow-white Villasimius, a cozy area with developed infrastructure of Kalamoska attract thousands of tourists annually. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cagliari Airport" class="if" height="408" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1366586.jpg" width="600"></div>

The Mediterranean food, considered the most wholesome, is incredibly liked by everyone who came to rest.  Seafood dishes amaze with their variety.  Baked clams, mussels, lobsters, eels are served with original sauces and will appeal to the most demanding gourmets.  However, local chefs will also indulge in a large number of meat dishes, and the most famous delicacy is <span>roasted pig.</span> </p><h2>  Basilica of St. Saturninus </h2><p>  Among the historical monuments, the early Christian church stands out, the first mention of which dates back to the VI century.  It is built, according to legend, at the burial place of St. Saturninus, who received martyrdom. </p><p>  Unfortunately, from the basilica, erected in the form of a cross, there is a small part that can be examined.  This is a very significant historical attraction of Cagliari (Italy), which is an important point in the tourist route. </p><h2>  Necropolis of tuvixedu </h2><p>  Archaeologists have discovered on the hill of Tuviksedu about a thousand graves, differing in various forms.  Burial sites related to the Carthaginian and Roman periods are considered a unique monument of the country.  The world's largest necropolis is of keen interest even to those who are indifferent to the ancient history of Cagliari (Italy). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãof cagliari" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1366584.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The most famous monument is the Snake Grotto, which got its name from the image of reptiles on the pediment of the facade of the Roman burial.  Poetic inscriptions are written on the inside of the grave, telling about the passionate love of the romance matron Atilia and her husband.  A noble Roman citizen was at death, and his wife so strongly asked the gods to die instead of her beloved, that they heard prayers and granted the woman's request.  In gratitude, the spouse erected a monument, which is now available for visits. </p><h2>  Cagliari Airport </h2><p>  Another attraction of the city is located seven kilometers from Cagliari international airport, serving more than three million people a year. </p><p>  The oldest air gates in Italy, built using the most modern technologies, have been modernized several times, and the architectural design of the building is a real delight. </p>
