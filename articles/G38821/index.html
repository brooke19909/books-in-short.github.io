So there are various useful applications and options.  For example, iMessage.  How to enable this option?  What it is?  Why is it necessary and is it necessary at all?  There are answers to all these questions. </p><h2>  What it is </h2><p>  Before you enable iMessage, you need to figure out what, in fact, is this application.  First of all, this is a useful option that allows owners of Apple-technology to communicate with each other for free.  Any user of a new generation <span>iPad, iPhone,</span> iPod can send text messages, photos, videos to the interlocutor.  Naturally, the application only works in the "home" company - Apple.  Any other company simply does not have the ability to connect to the dialogue in iMessage.  How to enable this application?  More about this later. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="imessage how to enable" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/920987.jpg" width="464"></div>

    <h2>  Due to what works </h2><p>  So why is it shareware?  Because nothing completely free exists.  Here, the issue price is limited by the requests of the Internet provider.  Yes, the application works exclusively at the expense of the Network, without being tied to a specific telecom operator.  Simply put - a SIM card is generally not needed here.  Only internet connection.  Conventionality lies in this: you also have to pay for the Network.  Well or not, when it comes to ‚Äúfree‚Äù Wi-Fi in public places.  And it becomes free more and more often and at many points.  Therefore, the appearance of such an application has become a real lifesaver for users. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Activation </h2><p>  Many have already appreciated all the charms of such a useful application as iMessage.  How to enable it on the device?  Yes, there is nothing easier!  You need to go to "Settings", in the "Messages" section.  The right side menu will say iMessage.  How to enable this option?  You just need to drag the toggle switch sideways so that it changes color to green.  All!  The application is activated, you can configure it for yourself.  Attention!  To activate, there must be an Internet connection (any: at least 3G, at least Wi-Fi).  Everything, after that you can use the application anytime, anywhere.  The latter is especially true.  Especially for those who travel a lot. </p><h2>  iPhone 5 </h2><p>  Before you enable iMessage on iPhone 5, you should learn more about both of them.  A useful application became available to users after the release of the mobile operating system iOs 5. Prior to this, the option simply did not exist!  This is for those who are just about to buy an iPhone, saving on models.  It is worth remembering immediately: outdated versions simply lose support for the company, as it develops, introduces more and more useful options, many of which simply don‚Äôt ‚Äúpull‚Äù old gadgets.  iPhone 5, by the way, was the first of the "apple" family, where the option of free messages became available.  And it made a splash!  Although at first some shortcomings were noticeable when working with telecom operators.  For example, when changing the SIM card, some internal settings were lost, after which the application stopped working.  But in the end, the developers finalized all their shortcomings, after which the function began to work like a clock: without glitches, "glitches", "lags." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to enable imessage on iphone" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/920986.jpg" width="510"></div>

For a long time, gadget owners have been using mobile phone tariffs with unlimited Internet, and "free" Wi-Fi is appearing more and more often.  So why pay for SMS and MMS, if you can send everything you want to your loved ones for free.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter how far apart you are from each other.  Yes, there are many other commercial and free applications with the same option, but here iMessage is also favorably different (how to enable it is already described above).  Firstly, you do not even need a phone number.  Only an individual number - Apple ID - and an email address that will be associated with the device automatically upon activation.  Secondly, when sending messages from the iPhone there is no need to enter the application.  It automatically determines to whom and how to send <span>SMS.</span>  <span>This, of</span> course, is in some way a ‚Äúrebellion‚Äù, because the user, in theory, must decide how to manage his messages.  But the innovation is really useful, and even allows you to save money. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to enable imessage function" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/920989.jpg" width="528"></div>

    <h2>  How it works </h2><p>  Before you enable iMessage on iPhone, you need to thoroughly understand everything.  The user types a message, selects the sender.  Everything, then the operating system decides for him.  If the addressee has iMessage, then the message leaves through a special channel - quickly and free of charge.  If not, then sending is carried out with a SIM card for money.  Everything is as simple as possible!  With an iPad that doesn't have Cercullar, it's still easier.  Messages immediately go through the iMessage channel.  But exclusively to those who also have this application.  Send messages to Android, Windows and other operating systems is not possible! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to enable imessage on iphone 5" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/920988.jpg" width="565"></div>

    <h2>  Custom settings </h2><p>  Before you enable the iMessage function, you should also learn how to configure it.  Not so much is allowed to the user.  But what is, is also quite enough!  First of all, a reading report.  The sender decides whether the interlocutor should see whether his message has been read or not.  Secondly, the user can block some contacts.  Those, for example, which for some reason are unpleasant for him.  Thirdly, you can set the retention period of messages.  For example, indefinitely.  They don‚Äôt take up a lot of space, but they can contain quite important information.  Fourth, you can set a time limit on video and audio.  For example, 2 minutes.  This is enough to record a voice message or send a short video hello.  By the way, for sending videos and video chat, there is a separate free system application that has worked well. </p><h2>  Mas </h2><p>  Naturally, Apple could not ignore its computer users!  IMessage is also available to them!  First you need to upgrade your operating system to OS X Mountain Lion.  Only starting with this version is the mentioned message function available.  How to enable iMessage on Mac?  Yes, just run the application from the desktop, setting your Apple ID.  And here the most important advantage of this program opens!  You can start the dialogue on one device (for example, on an iPhone), and continue on another (for example, on Mac).  There is one prerequisite - all gadgets must be tied to one individual number!  That's all, no SIM cards, money, limits. </p>
