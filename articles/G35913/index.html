    <p>  Sparta is a real warlike state, whose warriors have long held in fear more than one ancient state.  Some countries believed that this was only possible thanks to supernatural powers.  It was believed that it was impossible to defeat the Spartans.  However, in fact, the main reason for the victories of a warlike state was the special training of citizens. </p><p>  The education of the Spartans as warriors was the most important task set by the rulers.  This is not to say that the state was constantly preparing for aggressive campaigns.  The Spartans wanted peace, but at the same time they were afraid of losing the captured lands: the valley of Eurotas and the plain of Messenia.  Moreover, these territories had to be protected not from the neighbors who had lost them, but from slaves who constantly dreamed of freedom.  Given relations with Dorian communities, Sparta participated in campaigns in Athens.  In addition, many times the states of the Ancient World went to war on a powerful state and tried to capture it.  Therefore, the government demanded that soldiers be trained to defend the state from both external and internal enemies. </p><p>  Especially for this, a system for educating the Spartans was developed, according to which the citizens of Sparta could not live separately from each other, they had to serve the country, listen to their commander.  Thus, from birth, boys were not seen as sons, but as pupils of the whole society. </p><p>  Spartan education began from the moment a child was born.  Each newborn boy was shown to the so-called doctors who were experts in physical health.  If they decided that the child was weak, then he was left in the mountains of Taygetus at the will of the natural elements.  The children were not swaddled; their limbs were open to air and the sun, so they were tempered.  Starting from the age of seven, the state took all the cares of the new warrior upon itself. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Spartan education was divided into 3 levels depending on age.  Among them are the following: </p><p>  - from 7 to 12 years old; </p><p>  - from 12 to 20; </p><p>  - from 20 to 30. </p><p>  From 7 to 12 years old, Spartan education meant the unification of boys in groups.  Children played and studied at the same time.  At the same time, their mentors tried to provoke a fight in order to see the <span>strengths</span> and weaknesses of each ward.  Particular attention at this stage was paid to <span>physical education.</span> </p><p>  From 12 to 20 years, boys were trained in agels, a kind of boarding schools.  The head of this association was either a senior youth, or the most intelligent and agile of peers.  His duties included leading the agel and punishing the guilty.  The punishments were cruel.  Usually it was a flogging.  None of the pupils could complain, he had to endure any punishment steadily.  A prerequisite was submission.  Each warrior had to implicitly obey the orders of the senior leader.  During this period, the boys were subjected to severe physical tests.  They were forbidden to wear underwear.  They slept on the reeds, and washed themselves in the river. </p><p>  Spartan education from 20 to 30 years implied unification in sissity.  At age 20, warriors received small land plots, where they were engaged in the cultivation of fruit crops.  They paid tax for this.  At this age, they were allowed to start a family, raise children.  However, military training continued to occupy an important place in the life of the Spartan.  Young men over 20 joined 15 people each.  Thus, in their circle they trained in the afternoon, and in the evening they could go to their home. </p><p>  The Spartan warriors were obedient citizens who easily endured pain and won the battle.  They studied such disciplines as the art of intelligence, swimming, gymnastics, equestrian sport.  Reading and writing was given the minimum value. </p><p>  Spartan education is a unique system that for a long time has made children of real warriors. </p>
