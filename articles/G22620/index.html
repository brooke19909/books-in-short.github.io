  <section class="page js-page"><h1>If you come to Moscow, where to stay?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Business people and tourists coming to the capital of the Russian Federation ask one question - where to stay?  True, more and more travelers are now who pre-book hotel rooms. </p><p>  But is it worth staying in a government hotel if there is another, more attractive option - private housing.  It can also be booked ahead of time.  If, finding an ad that surrenders <noindex>  <span><strong>Apartments Pushkinskaya</strong></span> </noindex>  , you call the mistress, you can quite agree that she was waiting for you at a certain time.  And if, in addition, you pay a deposit, you can almost completely be sure that you will have where to stay in the capital of Russia. </p><p>  Moscow is a rather big city, therefore there are more than enough offers in it about renting out your own apartments for rent and even hourly.  Entrepreneurial Muscovites earn good money on visitors. </p><p>  It is especially beneficial to rent housing if it is located in a minute proximity to the metro.  Then you will not have problems to get where you need to.  The metro is not subject to traffic jams, unlike land transport.  In addition, the Moscow metro, despite everything, is the most beautiful in the world.  Going down to the stations, you will see for yourself.  Especially if you go on old branches. </p><p>  Choosing <noindex>  <span><strong>Apartments Proletarskaya</strong></span> </noindex>  or any other metro, you can be sure that you will always get to the place of business meeting or place of rest in a short time.  Especially if you do not go for a walk or a business meeting during rush hours. </p><p>  The only drawback of the subway is that there are a lot of people in the morning - when everyone rushes to offices and enterprises, and in the evening - when everyone returns from work.  If you cannot stand the crowds, you will have to use land transport, which is plentiful in the capital.  But the famous Moscow traffic jams can cross out all your business plans, you need to remember this. </p><p>  Of course, choosing accommodation in the capital, you should focus on where you will be on business the most.  If you put enough effort into finding an apartment, you can walk to business meetings.  These pleasant and useful walks will be remembered by you, especially if your path goes past beautiful buildings and parks. </p><p>  Anyway, it‚Äôs better not to go to Moscow without first finding an apartment.  If you are forced to choose housing in haste, you can choose not at all what you need and then seriously regret your rash choice. </p></div></article>
