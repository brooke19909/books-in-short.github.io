    <h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  Legends claim that in 1927 Vladimir Shemelev, a passionate tourism lover, discovered the place of the future Golden Lake tourist complex when he was looking for a parking lot and made a route map for guests from the capital and Novosibirsk.  He prepared the glades, and found future personnel from local residents.  And after a couple of days the first tourists came here. </p><p>  A year later, the base is already known as the official <span>campground</span> for groups sent to the Altai Mountains by the Russian Tourism Society. </p><p>  By the beginning of construction, the complex shifted slightly east, closer to Artybash. </p><p>  In 1937, the tourist complex was called "Artybashevsky Tourist House". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After the war, the base is empty for a long time.  But someone suddenly remembers the beautiful town of wooden buildings.  And by 1952, it was being thoroughly updated and expanded.  There is a new hotel complex, administration building, perkarni, kitchens and a large dining room. </p><p>  By 1956, vouchers were issued to the base.  They include a comfortable lodging for the night, a dining room with a terrific menu, a bathhouse, a station and boat rental, as well as qualified guides. </p>
