  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Coin "Victorious": description, value, photo</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  We can say that without exception we all love banknotes and try to treat them with respect.  However, there are enthusiastic people who are not only well versed in coins and banknotes, but who can profitably invest in them. </p><p>  Such an interesting hobby as numismatics allows you to collect not only rare ancient coins, but also those that were issued relatively recently, but have a small circulation and attractive investment value.  No doubt, the Victorious coin, which first appeared in circulation in February 2006, can be attributed to such modern collectibles. </p><h2>  How it was minted </h2><div class="photo" data-original="monetainvest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Golden &quot;victorious&quot; 100 rubles" class="if uuid-2925493" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2925493.jpg"></div><p>  One of the main investment coins of the USSR was a gold dime, which is popularly called the "Sower".  This gold coin was first minted in 1923, since then the State Bank of the USSR issued it again in 1975-1982. </p><p>  When the supply of these coins came to an end, it was decided to mint a new investment coin.  So the gold coin ‚ÄúVictorious‚Äù appeared, with a nominal value of 50 rubles, issued in a rather large circulation, 150,000 pieces, in the winter of 2006.  The first batch of coins was minted both in Moscow and in the mint of St. Petersburg. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Issued coins were in great demand among collectors, the first circulation was not enough.  The Victorious coin was continued to be minted almost every year, except for 2011 and 2012, when coins dedicated to the Olympic Games in Sochi were issued.  Interestingly, on the obverse of the coin minted in 2013, is the date 2012. </p><p>  The total circulation of these gold banknotes turned out to be the largest among all the valuable coins of Russia. </p><h2>  Coin features </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pokupkamonet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Coin appearance" class="if uuid-2925490" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2925490.jpg"></div><p>  Saint George the Victorious has long been considered one of the patrons of Russia, so it is not surprising that it was his image that was decided to be placed on the reverse of a new gold coin.  The author of the sketch was the national artist of Russia A.V. Baklanov. </p><p>  The obverse of the coin depicts St. George on a horse, striking with a spear a terrible serpent.  On the reverse is a double-headed eagle with wings down, the official emblem of the Bank of Russia and the face value of the coin.  The metal designation, its sample and the content of chemically pure precious metal shall also be indicated.  For a gold investment coin, this value is not less than 7.78 grams. </p><p>  In 2006, the gold <span>coin "George the Victorious"</span> was issued in only one denomination, 50 rubles.  Coins worth 100 rubles first appeared in 2012.  They were made in the technology of improved quality stamping, which experts call proof.  Thanks to this technology, the coin has a shiny mirror field and a contrasting matte relief of the image.  This version of the coin, as well as the coin "Victorious" issued at the same time with the face value of 50 rubles, is in great demand among collectors. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Not only gold </h2><div class="photo" data-original="oserebre.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Silver coin &quot;Victorious&quot;" class="if uuid-2925491" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2925491.jpg"></div><p>  Due to the great popularity enjoyed by the George the Victorious gold coin among collectors, in 2009 it was decided to issue a silver investment coin.  Its nominal value is 3 rubles.  Naturally, the actual price is much higher. </p><p>  In this version, the image of the saint on the obverse has remained unchanged, and on the reverse the name of the chemical element and the percentage of pure metal have changed.  It should be at least 31.10 grams. </p><p>  The first issue of the coin took place in a circulation of 280,000 pieces, since then the silver coin "Victorious" was issued two more times. </p><h2>  Actual value </h2><div class="photo" data-original="livecoins.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Coins &quot;Victorious&quot;" class="if uuid-2925519" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2925519.jpg"></div><p>  The real value of investment coins depends on several components and, of course, differs significantly from the actual value. </p><p>  Thanks to automated minting, the cost of a coin is almost equal to the price of the metal from which it is made, so there is no need to overpay for manufacturing.  The fact that the Pobedonosets coin was minted in pure 999 gold and its rather considerable weight of 7.9 grams make the purchase of the coin financially attractive. </p><p>  In addition, the value of collection coins increases depending on the year of issue, the older the coin, the more profitable it can be sold.  Therefore, this type of investment is suitable for people who know how to wait.  Buying gold coins will not bring instant benefits, but will help to preserve and increase invested capital. </p><h2>  Investment in coins </h2><div class="photo" data-original="numizmatcoins.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Coins &quot;Victorious&quot; 50 and 100 rubles" class="if uuid-2925499" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2925499.jpg"></div><p>  The question of how to maintain and increase your capital is of concern to everyone.  If a decision is made on long-term investments, precious metal coins can be a good way out.  Of course, world prices for precious metals are also subject to fluctuations, but not as critical as major world currencies.  In addition, there is no additional tax burden on the purchase and storage of investment coins, unlike bullion metal.  Yes, and official registration for such a purchase is also not required. </p><p>  Currently, you can buy the coin "George the Victorious" in Sberbank, in any large branch.  Of course, the price of coins at numerous online auctions is slightly lower, but there I offer lots from 15-25 pieces.  When ordering such a wholesale lot, the bank can also reduce the cost of coins. </p><p>  To buy several or even one Victorious coin at Sberbank, you only need a passport.  Be sure to keep the purchase receipt, which is issued along with the purchased coins.  This receipt will help with the further sale of the coin. </p><p>  Experienced numismatists recommend carefully analyzing the situation on the world precious metals market before purchasing investment coins, especially paying attention to the London Stock Exchange quotes.  It is better to plan the acquisition at a decline in the cost of metal, and sell at the peak of value. </p><p>  When planning the sale of coins, it should be remembered that if 3 years have not passed since the time of purchase, you will have to pay the personal income tax on the amount and fill out an income statement. </p><h2>  How to store coins correctly </h2><div class="photo" data-original="siqnalrp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gold coins per pack" class="if uuid-2925507" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2925507.jpg"></div><p>  To store coins from <span>precious metals</span> does not need much space.  However, professionals advise storing collection coins not at home, but in a bank cell, where constant temperature and humidity are maintained. </p><p>  Gold is a very soft metal, and it is necessary to handle products from it very carefully.  No wonder investment coins, and the Pobedonosets coin, including them, are packed in transparent plastic containers before selling.  This plain packaging allows you to protect the coin from damage, scratches and exposure to foreign substances.  Even a slight greasy stain on a coin can reduce its value, and defects and dents will make further profitable sale of the coin impossible. </p>
