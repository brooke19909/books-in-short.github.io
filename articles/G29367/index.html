    <p>  As you know, when choosing a hotel, first of all, it is worth considering its location.  First Bungalow Beach Resort 3 is located on the beautiful coast of Koh Samui, in the southern part of Chaweng Bay.  This is a fairly lively, albeit calm area - there are shops and cafes nearby, so the guests do not feel divorced from life. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The distance to the center of Chaweng is only a kilometer - you can easily get there on foot or by taxi.  By the way, the nearest international airport is about 12 km from the hotel building.  Of course, you can count on a convenient transfer, but the road after the flight will take no more than 20 - 30 minutes, which is very important. </p><h2>  Hotel First Bungalow Beach Resort 3 * (Thailand, Koh Samui): information about the territory and infrastructure </h2>

    <p>  The hotel complex has a fairly large territory.  It itself consists of several small, cozy buildings (they are two or three-story), as well as individual small bungalows.  The buildings are built in an elegant style and slightly reminiscent of country villas. </p><p>  The territory is very well-groomed and beautiful - lawns, curly bushes, tall palm trees, bright exotic flowers, wonderful artificial grottoes, streams and, of course, Thai scenery are emerald green everywhere.  Guests love the design of the hotel.  By the way, in 2006 a complete reconstruction was carried out, and after it several cosmetic repairs.

    <p>  Of course, comfort is an important factor for a tourist, because after a bright day full of activity you always want to return to a comfortable room.  It‚Äôs worth mentioning that all the rooms here are spacious, with large windows, spacious wooden balconies or terraces.  The decoration of the rooms is stylish.  You can count on a large bed with soft cushions and an orthopedic mattress.  There are sofas, bedside tables, a spacious wardrobe, in short, everything you need for the convenience of guests. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In addition, guests at First Bungalow Beach Hotel can rely on modern technology.  A standard hotel suite consists of a TV (you can watch mainly local cable channels), a telephone, a powerful air conditioning system and a small safe with a combination lock.  For a small fee, guests get access to high-speed Internet, which, of course, is very convenient. </p><p>  There is a minibar in the rooms, but for free it is filled only with drinking water in convenient plastic bottles.  Of course, other drinks are brought to the room upon request, but this is a paid service.  By the way, guests can ask to bring in the room and food. </p><p>  The bathroom is spacious enough - there is everything you need for hygiene, including a shower, sink, toilet, wall mirror and a set of cosmetic accessories.  Some rooms already have hair dryers; in other cases, they can be obtained at the reception. </p><p>  By the way, reviews of guests suggest that the rooms are maintained almost perfect cleanliness.  Clean towels are delivered to the room every day, and I change linen on the bed several times a week. </p><h2>  Can I count on food? </h2>

    <p>  Of course, tourists coming here want to spend at least some time on the beach.  What does the First Bungalow Beach Resort offer its guests?  Samui is an island famous for its beautiful beaches.  One of them is located just 100 meters from the hotel grounds. </p><p>  Traveler reviews say that this is one of the most beautiful places on the island.  The wide coastal strip is completely covered with fine soft sand, as well as the entrance to the sea.  The waters are calm, although waves rise from time to time, which, of course, pleases fans of windsurfing.  By the way, it is very clean here, the depth of the bay increases gradually, there is also a wide area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe shallows where children splash. </p><p>  Of course, there are plenty of umbrellas and sun loungers on the shore.  By the way, along the coast there is a picturesque palm grove, where you can hide from the sun and enjoy the much-desired coolness.  <span>A beach towel</span> is available at the hotel absolutely free.  There is a <span>beach bar,</span> which offers light snacks and chilled drinks. </p><p>  Beaches about.  Samui is very popular among travelers from all over the world.

    <p>  Koh Samui is an amazing place.  There are many attractions, both cultural and historical, as well as natural, natural.  That is why tourists prefer to devote at least a few days to excursion vacations.  There is a bureau on site that will help you find an interesting excursion and talk about the most interesting places in the vicinity. </p><p>  You can have a good time at the hotel.  There is a clear water pool in the courtyard for travelers to cool off.  Nearby, on the terrace, there are large, comfortable sunbeds and wide-brimmed umbrellas.  Here you can sunbathe, relax and chat with new friends. </p><p>  There is another smaller pool - it is equipped with a powerful hydromassage system.  You can relax in the jacuzzi, enjoying the fresh sea air and a view of the exotic garden.  It will delight guests and a beauty salon, where you can use the services of stylists and cosmetologists.  The hotel also has a massage parlor, which offers real Thai massage. </p><h2>  Conditions for a family vacation with a child </h2><p>  Today, more and more tourists take their entire family to distant countries, including children of different ages.  Of course, comfort issues are crucial for parents.  What can the First Bungalow Beach Resort offer the child? </p><p>  According to reviews, the hotel is perfect for families.  Moreover, most of the guests here are parents with children.  We tried to create all conditions for little tourists.  For example, a bed can be delivered to a room - it is folding, but large and comfortable.  The local restaurant has several high chairs served by the smallest guests.  From the menu you can always choose something for the child.  And on the territory of the hotel there are several experienced, professional nannies - one of them will definitely look after your children, and for a very small fee. </p><p>  Koh Samui, Thailand is an amazing, almost fabulous place where kids have fun.  Some entertainment can be found on site.  For example, there is a spacious but shallow pool for children here, where the water is always clean and warm.  In addition, the kids have a great time outdoors with a swing, where they play with new friends.  Naturally, several entertainment complexes can be found in the city center - here not only the kids will have a good time, but also their parents. </p><h2>  What do tourists say?  Recommendations and reviews </h2><p>  A few minutes of communication with a person who has already managed to spend at least a day at the hotel can sometimes help to make a clearer picture.  What impressions do guests have at the First Bungalow Beach Resort? </p><p>  Reviews are positive.  Almost all tourists, without exception, say that the hotel is very comfortable and beautiful.  The rooms are beautifully furnished, and the maids here really maintain cleanliness - it‚Äôs nice to return to the room and after a couple of days the tourists feel at home.  Service also contributes to this.  Despite the lack of knowledge of the Russian language, local workers always try to understand and help hotel guests (by the way, almost everyone is fluent in English). </p><p>  The food is also at a decent level - fresh and delicious dishes are served for breakfast.  Most tourists eat in the hotel restaurant and the rest of the day, because they cook well here, the choice of food is large, and the prices are quite normal.  An undoubted advantage is direct access to the sea.  As you know, hotels in Samui, on the beach in particular, are by no means cheap.  Prices for accommodation at this hotel are relatively low - this is one of the reasons for its popularity among travelers. </p>
