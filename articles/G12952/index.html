    <p>  The soundbar is a soundbar, which is a compact audio system that allows you to enjoy music without massive speakers and subwoofers.  The soundbar does not have a large number of speakers, since all the necessary functions are collected in one case.  What is a soundbar, an inexperienced user will ask?  This is the perfect alternative to your home theater, which takes up little space and allows you to enjoy great sound at optimal volume. </p><h2>  How does it work? </h2><p>  The soundbar attracts attention with its versatility: it can work in tandem with the TV, and as a standalone player, if you connect a USB flash drive to it or insert a music disc.  Two types of <span>systems are</span> popular today <span>: active</span> (connection is made to the TV directly) and passive (connection of an AV receiver is required). </p><p>  To better know what a soundbar is, you need to study its structure.  The modern model consists of: </p><ul><li>  player </li><li>  set of speakers; </li><li>  an audio processor that delivers full sound. </li></ul><p>  As a rule, sound panels can have up to 16 sound speakers, which are located at certain angles, as well as a bass speaker - it acts as a subwoofer.  The panel is easy to use, as it can be customized to the needs of each user using the remote control. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where to put? </h2>

The specially designed housing also serves the purpose of reproducing high-quality sound. </p><h2>  Which is better - a soundbar or a home theater? </h2><p>  Today, various types of <span>speakers are</span> very popular <span>.</span>  Which is better?

    <p>  The Sony HT-CT660 soundbar costs 15,000 rubles, while its class is 2.1.  Users note that at such a high price, the model does not justify either its quality or additional functions.  Among the advantages of technology, high-quality sound is noted, but other options are limited.  The HT-CT660 can only be used to listen to music from various sources or connect to phones via Bluetooth. </p><p>  Soundbar Sony HT-GT1 - a more advanced configuration model 2.1.  This audio system costs from 14,000 rubles, suitable for daily watching a movie and listening to music.  The body of the panel and subwoofer is made of wood, so there is no noise and rattle when playing, the sound is excellent even at high volume.  The presence of special Sony Clear Voice technology ensures that the sound is clear even during dialogs. </p><p>  To wirelessly transfer high-quality music, just touch the panel with a smartphone or tablet that supports Bluetooth and NFC.

There is also an original BASS BAZUKA button: it instantly turns on the bass level, while the sound does not lose either clarity or purity. </p><h2>  Panasonic </h2><p>  The Panasonic SC-HTB520 soundbar is a 1-in-1 option.  For about 14,000 rubles, you can purchase a full-fledged home theater equipped with a wireless subwoofer.  Users note that with excellent sound quality, the network features of the device are minimal.  However, in some cases it is advisable to use just such a system.
