The son of the Grand <span>Duke Vladimir,</span> father, grandfather, uncle of some of the rulers of Europe.  When he was in power in Kiev, the first set of laws was published in Russia, which went down in the history of the state as ‚ÄúRussian Truth‚Äù.  He is counted among the saints and is revered by the Russian Orthodox Church as "faithful." </p><div class="photo" data-original="meest-online.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="nickname of yaroslav vladimirovich" class="if uuid-2877117" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2877117.jpg"></div><h2>  Birth </h2><p>  Prince Yaroslav Vladimirovich, known in history as Yaroslav the Wise, was born in the family of the baptist of Russia, Prince of Novgorod and Kiev Vladimir Svyatoslavovich and supposedly Polotsk Princess Rogneda in 979.  He is from the Rurikovich clan.  The year of birth, like the mother of the prince, is not reliably established.  The famous historian N. Kostomarov expressed doubt about Rogneda as the mother of Yaroslav. </p><p>  The historian from France Arrignon was sure that the Byzantine princess Anna was the mother of Yaroslav.  His confidence is confirmed by the intervention of Yaroslav Vladimirovich in the internal political affairs of Byzantium in 1043.  The official version is the one according to which Rogneda was the mother of Vladimir, as most sources indicate this.  That is what most Russian and world historians adhere to. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If doubts about the mother can be explained by the lack of proper information, a series of certain events that researchers need to somehow explain, the argument about the date of birth confirms the historians' assumption that the struggle for the great reign of Kiev was not easy and fratricidal. </p><p>  It should be recalled that the rule of Kiev gave the title of Grand Duke.  In the ladder form, this title was considered the main one, and it was passed to the elder sons.  It was Kiev that paid tribute to all other cities.  Therefore, often in the struggle for seniority all kinds of tricks were used, including changing the date of birth. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.unian.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Prince Yaroslav Vladimir the wise" class="if uuid-2877101" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2877101.jpg"></div><h2>  Year of birth </h2><p>  Based on chronicles, historians have established that Yaroslav Vladimirovich was the third son of Rogneda, after Izyaslav, Mstislav.  After him came Vsevolod.  This is confirmed in the annals of "The Tale of Bygone Years."  The eldest son, supposedly, was Vysheslav, whose mother is considered to be the first wife of Vladimir, tin jam. </p><p>  Between Mstislav and Yaroslav there was another son of Prince Vladimir, Svyatopolk, born of a Greek woman, the widow of his brother, Kiev Prince Yaropolk Svyatoslavovich.  He died in the struggle with Prince Vladimir for the throne of Kiev, and his wife was the last to be taken as a concubine.  Fatherhood was controversial, but Prince Vladimir considered him to be his own son. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Today it is precisely established that Svyatopolk was older than Yaroslav Vladimirovich, his year of birth was in 979. This is also confirmed by a number of annals.  It was found that the marriage of Prince Vladimir and Rogneda was in 979.  Given that he is the third son of Rogneda, it can be assumed that the date of birth is not set correctly. </p><p>  Many scientists, including S. Solovyov, believe that Yaroslav Vladimirovich could not be born in 979 or 978.  This is confirmed by studies of bone remains in the XX century, they indicate that presumably the remains belonged to a person aged 50 to 60 years. </p><p>  Even the historian Soloviev expressed doubts about the life expectancy of Yaroslav - 76 years.  Based on this, we can conclude that the date of birth is incorrectly set.  This was done in order to show that Yaroslav was older than Svyatopolk, which justified his right to Kiev rule.  According to some reports, the date of birth of Yaroslav should correspond to 988 or 989 years. </p><h2>  Childhood and youth </h2><p>  Prince Vladimir bestowed various cities on the board of his sons.  Prince Yaroslav Vladimirovich got Rostov.  At this time he was only 9 years old, so the so-called breadwinner, who was the governor and was called Budy or Buda, was attached to him.  Almost nothing is known about the Rostov period, since the prince was young enough for rule.  After the death of Prince of Novgorod Vysheslav in 1010, Rostov Prince Yaroslav, who was 18-22 years old at that time, was appointed governor of Novgorod.  This once again confirms that the time of his birth in the annals of temporary years is indicated incorrectly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The foundation of Yaroslavl </h2><p>  A legend is associated with the history of the emergence of Yaroslavl, according to which Prince Yaroslav Vladimirovich the Wise founded the city during his journey from Rostov to Novgorod along the Volga River.  During the stay, the prince with his retinue went to a large cliff, suddenly a bear jumped out of the thicket of forest.  Yaroslav, with the help of an ax and running servants, killed him.  A small fortress was built on this site, from which subsequently grew a city called Yaroslavl.  Maybe this is just a beautiful legend, but, nevertheless, Yaroslavl considers the date of his birth from 1010. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nk.org.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="why Prince Yaroslav Vladimirovich was nicknamed Yaroslav the Wise" class="if uuid-2877156" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2877156.jpg"></div><h2>  Prince of Novgorod </h2><p>  After the death of Vysheslav, the question arose of rule in the Novgorod principality.  Since Novgorod was the second most important city after Kiev, where Vladimir reigned, the administration was to be inherited by his eldest son, Izyaslav, who was disgraced by his father, and he had passed away by the time the governor of Novgorod was appointed. </p><p>  After Izyaslav Svyatopolk walked, but he was in prison on charges of treason against his father.  The next eldest son was Prince Yaroslav Vladimirovich the Wise, whom Prince Vladimir appointed to reign in Novgorod.  This city was supposed to pay tribute to Kiev, which amounted to 2/3 of all taxes collected, the rest of the money was only enough to support the squad and the prince.  This caused discontent of the Novgorodians, who were waiting for a reason to rebel against Kiev. </p><p>  In a brief biography of Yaroslav Vladimirovich the Wise, the period of Novgorod rule is not well known.  All generations of Ruriks, ruling in Novgorod, lived in the Settlement, located near the village.  But Yaroslav settled in the city itself in the trading place "Yaroslav's Court."  This period includes historians and the marriage of Yaroslav.  His first wife, according to some sources, was called Anna (literally not established).  She was Norwegian by origin. </p><h2>  Uprising against Kiev </h2><p>  Toward the end of his life, Grand Duke Vladimir brought his youngest son, Boris, to him, to whom he transferred control of the army and was going to leave him the throne of Kiev, contrary to the rules of succession by his elder sons.  Svyatopolk, at that time the older brother, whom Vladimir threw into prison, spoke against him. </p><p>  Yaroslav decides to go to war against his father for the abolition of tribute to Kiev.  Not having enough troops, he hires the Varangians who arrived in Novgorod.  Upon learning this, Vladimir was about to march against the rebellious Novgorod, but was very sick.  In addition, in the middle of the summer of 1015, Pechenegs invaded Kievan Rus.  Instead of going against Novgorod, Boris was forced to fight against the nomadic steppes who fled under the onslaught of the army of Russia. </p><p>  At this time, in Novgorod, the Vikings, languishing from idleness, engaged in robbery and violence, which raised local residents against them, who killed them.  Yaroslav was in his suburban village of Rakome.  Upon learning of the incident, Yaroslav ordered the ringleaders of the battle to be brought to him, promising to forgive them.  But as soon as they appeared, he ordered to seize them and execute them.  What incurred the wrath of most of Novgorod. </p><p>  At this point, he receives a letter from his sister, who informed him of the death of Vladimir.  Understanding that it is impossible to leave unresolved problems, Yaroslav asks the Novgorodians for peace, promising to give for each murdered person a certain monetary amount of vira (payment). </p><div class="photo" data-original="rushist.wikia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Grand Duke Yaroslav Vladimirovich" class="if uuid-2877164" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2877164.jpg"></div><h2>  The fight with Svyatopolk for the throne in Kiev </h2><p>  Prince Vladimir dies in the city of Berestov on June 15, 1015.  The board was taken over by the eldest of the Svyatopolk brothers, whom the people called the Cursed.  To protect himself, he kills his younger brothers: beloved by the people of Kiev Boris, Gleb and Svyatoslav.  Yaroslav Vladimirovich was waiting for the same fate, the time of the Novgorod rule strengthened him as a politician, and he represented a danger to Svyatopolk. </p><p>  Therefore, Yaroslav, with the support of the Novgorodians and the called Vikings, defeated the army of Svyatopolk near Lyubich in 1016 and entered Kiev.  Accursed several times approached the city in alliance with the Pechenegs.  In 1018, the King of Poland Boleslav the Brave came to his aid - the father-in-law of Svyatopolk, who entered Kiev, captured there the wife of Yaroslav Anna, his sisters and stepmother.  But instead of transferring the throne to Svyatopolk, he decided to seize it himself. </p><p>  Saddened, Yaroslav returned to Novgorod and decided to flee abroad, but the townspeople did not let him go, announcing that they themselves would go against the Poles.  Again the Varangians were called up.  In 1019, the troops moved to Kiev, where local residents rose to battle with the Poles.  On the Alte River, Svyatopolk was defeated, wounded, but managed to escape.  Yaroslav Vladimirovich - the Grand Duke of Kiev reigned on the throne. </p><div class="photo" data-original="russian7.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Prince Yaroslav Vladimirovich" class="if uuid-2877099" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2877099.jpg"></div><h2>  Personal life of Yaroslav </h2><p>  Historians also disagree on how many Yaroslav's wives were.  Most are inclined to believe that the prince had one wife Ingigerda - the daughter of King Olaf Shetkonunga of Sweden, whom he married in 1019.  But some historians suggest that he had two wives.  The first is the Norwegian Anna, from whom he had a son, Ilya.  They, allegedly, with the sisters and stepmother of the Great Yaroslav Vladimirovich were taken to full by King Boleslav, and taken to the Polish lands, where they disappeared without a trace. </p><p>  There is a third version, according to which, Anna is the name of Ingigerda in monasticism.  In 1439, the nun Anna was canonized and is the patroness of Novgorod.  Inigerder father gave land as a gift, which are adjacent to the city of Ladoga.  They were later called Ingermanland, where Peter the Great was built St. Petersburg.  Ingigerda and Prince Yaroslav had 9 children: 3 daughters and 6 sons. </p><h2>  Kiev government </h2><p>  The years of the reign of Yaroslav Vladimirovich were full of military confrontations.  In 1020, the native nephew of Prince Bryachislav invaded Novgorod, taking in it many prisoners and booty.  Yaroslav‚Äôs squad overtook him on the Sudom River near Pskov, where he was defeated by the prince, leaving prisoners and loot, and fled.  In 1021, Yaroslav gave him the inheritance of the city of Vitebsk and Usvyat. </p><p>  In 1023, the Tmutarakan Prince Mstislav, the younger brother of Yaroslav, invaded the lands of Kievan Rus.  He defeated the army of Yaroslav under Deciduous, capturing the entire left bank.  In 1026, having gathered the army, Yaroslav returned to Kiev, where he concluded an agreement with his brother that he would rule on the right bank, and the left bank would belong to Mstislav. </p><p>  In 1029, together with Mstislav, they made a trip to Tmutarakan, where they defeated and drove out the yasses.  In 1030, he conquered a chud in the Baltic and laid the city of Yuryev (Tartu).  In the same year he went to the city of Belz in Galicia and conquered it. </p><p>  In 1031, the King of Norway Harald III the Severe fled to Yaroslav, who would later become his son-in-law by marrying his daughter Elizabeth. </p><p>  In 1034, Yaroslav made the Novgorod prince his beloved son, Vladimir.  In 1036 he brought him sad news - Mstislav suddenly died.  Concerned about the possibility of challenging the Kiev possessions of the last of the brothers, Sudislav, he imprisoned Prince Pskov in prison. </p><div class="photo" data-original="deduhova.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="reign of yaroslav vladimirovich" class="if uuid-2877142" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2877142.jpg"></div><h2>  The meaning of the reign of Yaroslav </h2><p>  Grand Duke Yaroslav Vladimirovich the Wise ruled the data in land management as a zealous owner.  He constantly multiplied the territory;  Strengthened the borders, settling the captive Poles who defended Russia from the steppe nomads across the southern expanses of the steppes;  strengthened the western frontiers;  stopped forever the raids of the Pechenegs;  built fortresses and cities.  During his reign, military campaigns did not stop, which allowed to save the state from enemies and expand its territory. </p><p>  But the importance of government was not only that.  The time of his reign is the highest prosperity of the state, the era of prosperity of Kievan Rus.  First of all, he helped the spread of Orthodoxy in Russia.  He built temples, promoted enlightenment in this area and prepared priests.  When it was opened the first monasteries.  His merit is in the liberation of the Russian church from Greek and Byzantine dependence. </p><p>  In the place of the final victory over the Pechenegs, he built the Hagia Sophia, decorated with frescoes and mosaics.  Two monasteries were also built there: St. George, in honor of his patron Saint George the Victorious and St. Irina, in the name of his wife's angel.  The Kiev church of St. Sophia was built in the likeness of Tsaregradsky, this can be seen in the photo.  Yaroslav Vladimirovich the Wise contributed to the construction of cathedrals of the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra and the construction of a monastery. </p><p>  All of Kiev was surrounded by a stone wall in which the Golden Gate is arranged.  Yaroslav, being an enlightened man, ordered to purchase books, and translate them from Greek and other languages.  He bought a lot.  All of them gathered at St. Sophia Cathedral and were available for general use.  He ordered priests to educate people; schools were established under him in Novgorod and Kiev. </p><div class="photo" data-original="de.ellas-cookies.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Yaroslav Vladimirovich" class="if uuid-2877096" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2877096.jpg"></div><h2>  Why was Prince Yaroslav Vladimirovich nicknamed Yaroslav the Wise? </h2><p>  Historians attach particular importance to the collections of laws compiled under Yaroslavl that were in force in Kievan Rus.  The Code of Laws ‚ÄúRussian Truth‚Äù was the first legal document that laid the foundation for the legislation of the Russian state.  In addition, it was supplemented and developed at a later time.  This suggests that the laws used in everyday life. </p><p>  A church charter was drawn up and translated from the Byzantine language.  Yaroslav cared about the spread of Christianity, did everything so that the churches shone with grandeur, and ordinary Christians were taught the basic Orthodox laws.  He cared about the prosperity of cities and the tranquility of the people inhabiting the lands of Kievan Rus.  It was for these cases that Yaroslav Vladimirovich was given the nickname the Wise. </p><p>  In the days of Kievan Rus, dynastic marriages played an important role.  It was they who helped establish foreign policy relations.  He became related with many noble families of Europe, which allowed him to solve many matters without bloodshed.  His policy allowed to establish good relations with his brother Mstislav and participate in new campaigns with him. </p><p>  Prince Yaroslav the Wise died, as is commonly believed, on February 20, 1054 in the hands of Vsevolod, his son.  They were given a covenant to their children: to live in peace, never to fight each other.  Many famous historians do not agree with the date of death, but, nevertheless, this is a generally accepted date.  He was buried in St. Sophia Cathedral in Kiev.  In the XX century, the crypt was opened three times, in 1964, at the autopsy, its remains were not found.  It is believed that they were taken out in 1943 by Ukrainian Nazi minions.  The remains are allegedly located in the United States. </p>
