Even the most ignorant know that the so-called dish is an antenna that receives a signal from satellites from space. </p><h2>  TV options without a dish </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.tvservisdarko.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="satellite television" class="if uuid-3154902" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98075/3154902.jpg"></div><p>  Nevertheless, today it is quite possible to watch television channels without parabolic antennas.  Modern technologies offer several ways to install satellite television: </p><ul><li>  Cable TV connection is still a fairly widespread, popular and economical way.  Many more use it.  Connected by whole houses.  This requires cabling to the receiving TV. </li><li>  Receiving a signal to the antenna using the digital standard DVB-T2.  In other words, the signal is transmitted to the receiver indirectly through repeaters that are on the ground.  The quality of the resulting image and sound with this method of receiving a signal is excellent.  The antenna will need the simplest decimeter. </li><li>  Modern technologies and methods for transmitting information via WIFI allow you to connect television receivers to the Internet. </li><li>  In addition, many Internet users completely dispense with a plate to watch channels directly from computer screens. </li></ul><h2>  What is free and how to use it </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.axios.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cable TV" class="if uuid-3154891" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98075/3154891.jpg"></div><p>  Satellite TV operators always offer free channels in packages.  In addition, they are guaranteed for the population and the state.  For the operator, this is simultaneously an advertising move to attract customers.  Without coding some channels, operators are motivated to install satellite TV and pay for watching many paid satellite TV channels. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How does satellite broadcasting without installing a dish </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.usinenouvelle.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="satellite in space" class="if uuid-3154911" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98075/3154911.jpg"></div><p>  It must be admitted that installing the so-called dish and servicing such satellite television is a troublesome business.  In addition, almost all operators offer a simpler option for installing satellite television <strong>-</strong> without a dish, via the Internet.  To do this, you need to purchase special equipment, the cable connects the home Internet router and the operator's input receiver.  Such a connection is quite affordable for the majority of the population. </p><p>  The competition in this market of services is very big.  And there are already operators offering options for connecting to satellite TV without a dish, which do not include, among other things, the use of a receiver.  Simply downloading special operator programs and connecting the service through your personal account is enough. </p><h2>  What equipment is needed </h2><p>  If it is decided to install satellite TV without a dish, then the operator providing such services, as a rule, provides or recommends the necessary equipment.  Depending on which connection option is selected, you will need: </p><ul><li>  Receiver. </li><li>  Tuner for satellite television (with support for DVB-S2). </li><li>  Software. </li></ul><p>  Buying a receiver is a responsible and difficult matter, although not very costly.  The price of different devices ranges from cheap (less than $ 20) to expensive ($ 200).  It all depends on their functionality: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  the presence or absence of a card reader; </li><li>  the ability to record transfers to flash drives; </li><li>  video viewing capabilities; </li><li>  pause broadcast functions; </li><li>  digital standard; </li><li>  the number of other functions (connectors for connecting a keyboard and mouse, the ability to view files and photos, view content from other external devices, a built-in media player) </li></ul><p>  Almost a modern receiver is a complex electronic radio "computer" with an operating system. </p><h2>  Satellite TV Frequency Bands </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.rvworldstore.co.nz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tuner for tv" class="if uuid-3154906" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98075/3154906.jpg"></div><p>  Those who use satellite television know that the frequency ranges of free channels are very often updated.  Especially with HD channels.  Overnight, you can stay without your favorite programs.  Therefore, it is important to monitor satellite TV frequencies and their updates.  All channels will always be in place if you timely change their parameters on the receiver and DVB card.  If you keep abreast of changes in the frequencies of satellite television, then you can track the emergence of new ones.  However, many channels are encoded and this information can no longer be obtained in the public domain. </p><h2>  What kind of TV is needed to receive DVB-T2 standard </h2><div class="photo" data-original="playtech.ro" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="a happy family" class="if uuid-3154931" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98075/3154931.jpg"></div><p>  Watching television without any plates and operators, and for free, is also possible.  At the end of last year, the Government announced its complete readiness to switch to a digital network.  To date, two free packages that broadcast 20 federal channels are working across Russia.  It is important to understand that viewing them is possible only if you have a TV with certain parameters. </p><p>  In a word, you need a device with a tuner and support for the DVB-T2 standard.  If you plan to buy a new TV in your home or office, then it makes sense to consult with sellers and purchase a device that allows you to watch two multiplex digital television packages for free, in cases where there is no cable TV, a dish and the Internet. </p><p>  As a rule, all TVs that were released after 2016 support the DVB-T2 standard.  Many of these televisions were purchased before this date.  There are a lot of them both among the assortment of well-known brands, as well as less popular brands.  If the purchase of a new TV is not yet expected, then you will have to buy a receiver.  You can find out which satellite tuner is right for you in specialized stores.  To do this, you only need to know the model and brand of your TV. </p>
