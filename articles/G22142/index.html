    <h2>  State Description </h2><p>  The name of the state itself comes from the Spanish word montana, which translates as "mountains".  This is quite symbolic, because in the center and in the west of Montana there are more than 70 <span>ranges of the Rocky Mountains.</span>  Its capital - the city of Helena - is famous for the Capitol, the home of the Legislature of Montana.  And the largest cities include Billings, Missoula and Bozeman. </p><p>  Montana is a state with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã381,156 square meters.  km  Of these, 377,295 sq. M.  km  On the east side, it borders with North and South Dakota, on the south - with the state of Wyoming, on the west - with Idaho, and on the north - with British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Alberta (Canada). </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  In 1803, when the United States acquired the Louisiana <span>colony</span> from <span>France</span> , the lands of Montana became part of the United States.  Lewis Meriweser and William Clark were honored to be Montana's first explorers.  They led an expedition whose purpose was to explore a new territory.  During the expedition, they made the first map of the northwestern lands of the United States.  L. Meriweser and W. Clark brilliantly coped with the task assigned to them, and the state of Montana (America) began to develop rapidly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what Montana is famous for" class="if" height="273" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1250365.jpg" width="600"></div>
