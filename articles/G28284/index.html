The latter can be especially carefully checked by employees of the Federal Tax Service when checking the activities of legal entities.  Therefore, the correct accounting of VAT in the organization is necessary. </p><h2>  Tax calculation </h2><p>  Accounting for such tax in accounting is carried out on several accounts.  The main ones are 19 and 68. In the latter, such a payment is recorded in the subaccount of the same name. </p><ul><li>  The receipt of certain values ‚Äã‚Äãat the enterprise is reflected by posting (debit-credit): 19 - 60 (76). </li><li>  The amount of VAT recorded in the debit 19 of the account, reflected in the invoice, is written off to the account 68.02: 68.02 - 19. </li><li>  If the organization sells products and issues invoices with the tax in question, then the following posting is used in accounting: 90.3 - 68. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vat accounting" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61468/2177573.jpg"></div></li><li>  After the end of the reporting period, on the ‚ÄúVAT‚Äù subaccount 68 accounts (68.02) we show the balance reflecting the debt of the legal entity for this tax. </li><li>  After transferring this payment to the budget, we post: 68.02 - 51. </li><li>  If the tax payment deadline is overdue, interest is charged to the organization, which is reflected by the posting: 99 (s / account ‚ÄúAccrued interest‚Äù) - 68.02 (we use analytics on accrued interest). </li><li>  Penalty payment is accompanied by a posting: 68.02 (the same analytics) - 51. </li></ul><h2>  VAT accounting for the organization - the tax agent for this tax </h2><p>  An organization may act as a tax agent for such a tax if it purchased products from a company that is not a resident of the Russian Federation and is not registered in our country, and also if it rents property that belongs to state or municipal structures. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="accounting vat in accounting" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61468/2177530.jpg"></div>

    <p>  A similar tax at the simplified tax system is paid in the following cases: </p><ul><li>  If products are imported into the territory of our state. </li><li>  If the activity is carried out under <span>concession agreements,</span> trust management <span>agreements</span> or simple partnership upon recognition of the business entity as a tax agent.  Accounting for VAT in the simplified tax system is made by the same postings that were shown earlier.  The deducted amount of such a tax is not deductible, since this business entity is not a payer of the tax in question. </li><li>  If, at the request of customers, an organization located on the simplified tax system made invoices with allocated VAT.  At the same time, revenue relates to income, while tax cannot be attributed to expenses. </li></ul><p>  If the business entity located on the STS acts as an intermediary, acting on its own behalf, then the tax in question is allocated in invoices, the amount for which is not transferred to the budget. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Tax accounting </h2><p>  If the organization or individual entrepreneur is the payer of the payment in question, then both accounting and tax accounting of VAT are applied.  This happens on the basis of the 21st chapter of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  When implementing the latter, it is necessary to take into account the object and base of taxation, the components of the tax payable.  The first in the case of accounting for VAT are operations performed by an economic entity for the sale of products.  The tax base is the monetary value of this object. </p><p>  The accounting in question is carried out at the accrued amount minus the allotted tax for reimbursement by adding the restored payment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tax accounting" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61468/2177583.jpg"></div>

Those forms from the above that are used in the organization make up its accounting tax policy.  It is developed along with accounting. </p><p>  The prices of goods for tax accounting should be average market prices with possible fluctuations within 20%. </p><h2>  Accounting for VAT in the program of the company "1C" </h2><p>  In 2016, the company updated the program, as a result of which it became possible to apply separate accounting for the tax in question.  It must be used for those entities that carry out operations, both taxable by such a payment, and non-taxable by it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="VAT account" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61468/2177590.jpg"></div>

    <p>  After that, VAT accounting in ‚Äú1C‚Äù became more clear.  Incoming tax can be tracked at any time. </p><p>  VAT accounting in ‚Äú1C: Accounting‚Äù is based on accumulative registers, which are relevant databases.  Through them you can detect errors in calculations and deductions.  They speed up reporting and responsiveness in the analysis. </p><p>  Accounting for such a tax in the program in question occurs automatically.  It is made on the basis of operations and documents that are entered by users into the database. </p><p>  From the ‚ÄúReceipt‚Äù or ‚ÄúSale of goods and services‚Äù forms, you can register an ‚ÄúInvoice‚Äù. </p><p>  If the organization is just beginning to carry out accounting in the described program, then first you need to set the accounting policy of the organization.  For entities using OSNO, the program configures VAT accounting parameters. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  The main VAT accounts are 19 and 68.02.  Postings are presented above.  It is carried out both when conducting accounting and tax accounting.  The tax is accounted for by maintaining the appropriate registers, which include: sales, purchases and registration book of invoices.  This concept as accumulative databases is also used in the main program used for accounting in general and for accounting for the tax in question in particular - ‚Äú1C: Accounting‚Äù. </p>
