As a result of this, you may find yourself in a very unpleasant situation when, in an accident, the culprit of the accident simply does not have insurance.  What to do in such a situation and what to do in order to receive monetary compensation from him for the damage caused?  From this article, you will learn about the main actions that should be taken if the culprit of the accident does not have insurance. </p><h2>  How to behave at the scene of a traffic accident? </h2>

In no case do you need to fall into a hysterical state.  It is strictly forbidden to apply physical or <span>psychological pressure</span> on the culprit of the accident, since in this case he can file a counterclaim, and a situation in which the law is completely on your side can turn against you.  If the culprit of the accident does not have insurance, what to do in this situation, you think?  The first step is to immediately call the traffic police at the scene.  At the same time, it doesn‚Äôt matter how badly your car was damaged, because if the culprit doesn‚Äôt have an insurance policy, the standard European-style protocol is useless and you can‚Äôt get any compensation.

In addition, the data of the person responsible for the accident will be indicated in the protocol, however, if the address of residence is different from the registration, then in this case it will be much more difficult to find it. </p><h2>  Automotive Technical Expertise </h2>

Moreover, if the driver got into an accident, the culprit turned out to be without insurance, then you will have to deal with the examination yourself.  In addition, all associated costs also fall on your shoulders.  You will need to find a company authorized to carry out such activities and pay for its services.  If subsequently the court proves the guilt of another participant in the accident, then you can fully compensate for these costs.

It is better to do this by registered mail so that you have evidence that it has been notified.  In addition, it is mandatory to familiarize the other side with the result of the examination, show the original act, and also transmit a copy of the document.  According to statistics, this is quite enough for the court with the culprit of the accident without insurance to be won in your favor.  Many participants in the accident prefer not even to bring the matter to court, but to settle the conflict quietly and peacefully, paying the victim the full amount. </p><h2>  Trial </h2>

The first step is to invite him to resolve the issue without going to court.  If he flatly refuses to pay for the repair of a car, it is necessary to draw up a pre-trial claim.  You can do this yourself or use the services of a legal adviser.  In this document, it is necessary to describe in detail the accident, indicate all the documents that you have on hand about this incident, and also do not forget to mention the absence of an insurance policy for the person responsible for the accident.  In addition, the appeal also indicates the full amount of compensation that you want to receive.

    <p>  If during the accident the perpetrator is not included in the insurance, and within two weeks after the presentation of the pre-trial appeal to him, no action was taken on his part, then it is necessary to transfer the case to court.  To do this, you will have to hire a good lawyer, whose services will cost somewhere in 30,000 rubles.  In addition, you will have to pay a state fee, the amount of which is 400 rubles.  It is worth noting that all these expenses will be fully compensated to you by the culprit of the accident if the court found him guilty.  You can do without the help of a lawyer and represent your interests in court on your own, however, for this you need to be well versed in all the legal nuances. </p><h2>  Court proceedings </h2><p>  In most cases, the trial lasts approximately 2-3 months, however, the trial can be significantly delayed if the court requires any additional documents, as well as if the second party does not appear for any reason. </p><p>  If the trial is delayed for a very long time, then to compensate for the damage, you can request the court to seize the car from the culprit of the accident and sell it through an auction.  In this case, <span>compensation is paid to</span> you from the proceeds after the sale of the car. </p>

Compensation for damage in these cases will occur gradually, by deducting a certain part of the wages of the culprit of the accident, which may take several years if the damage is very large.

    <h2>  What to do if the insurance policy is not valid? </h2><p>  Another common situation that many drivers face in an accident is an invalid insurance policy.  Similar situations arise when the insurance company has ceased to operate or does not have a license authorizing the provision of insurance services.  In the first case, compensation will be paid to you from the reserve fund of the Union of Auto Insurers.  But the second case is more problematic, because in most cases, drivers injured in road accidents simply do not have time to conduct an expert examination and assessment of the damage caused, as a result of which the chance that the second side will reimburse you for all expenses is almost zero.  In order to avoid such a problem, in the event of an accident, it is very important to contact the insurance company as soon as possible and make sure that it has the appropriate permits. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

Any delay significantly reduces your chances of successfully receiving compensation for the damage caused by the culprit of the accident.  There are more severe cases that occur in legal practice and require more time to resolve, however, if you act completely within the framework of the current legislation, then you can easily cope with all this.  But be that as it may, be always careful on the road!  Not a single financial compensation will return the spent nerves and health.
