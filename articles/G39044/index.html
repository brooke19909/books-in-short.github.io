For the manufacture of simple products from such a material does not require special skill, while more complex work requires patience, time and perseverance.  In any case, in order to understand whether this type of needlework is suitable for leisure activities specifically for you, you need to try to weave something.  In the article, we present simple patterns for weaving with beads. </p><h2>  How to choose the right material: tips </h2><p>  Before you start creating a beautiful thing, you need to decide on a pattern for weaving with beads and purchase the right materials.  Large parts are best suited for beginners.  You should not immediately choose large products for execution.  As a rule, they require a high level of skill and a long time.  It should be noted that the type of finished product largely determines the quality of the material used.  Therefore, if during selection on the wire there were roughnesses, and there are inclusions on the beads, it is recommended to refuse such details.  In order to choose a quality material, you must adhere to the following tips: </p><ol><li>  It is good if the beads have the same shape and size as in the scheme. </li><li>  Before buying beads inspected for defective items. </li><li>  The size of the beads is selected by number. </li><li>  The larger the <span>size of the beads,</span> the smaller the number on its markings. </li><li>  For beginners in beadwork, a wire modeling the contour of the finished elements should be preferred. </li><li>  Depending on the product, a fishing line of different thickness and color is selected, in addition, a special needle for work is supposed to be attached to it. </li></ol><p>  Next, we consider simple patterns for weaving beads for beginners and the techniques for their implementation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="dS_4Pf8NW-c" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=869&amp;v=dS_4Pf8NW-c" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/5/1/9/4/15194.jpg"></div><h2>  Mosaic weaving </h2><p>  Despite the fact that this technique is available even for beginners, quite often experienced needlewomen make mistakes in its implementation.  Therefore, during operation it is important to follow the details of the scheme for weaving with beads. </p><p>  Elements in mosaic weaving are arranged strictly in a checkerboard pattern, forming a dense base.  The main principles of this technique are as follows: </p><ul><li>  weaving is performed on one thread; </li><li>  there should be an even number of beads; </li><li>  to create a canvas with an odd number of beads, you must leave moves through the extreme bead. </li></ul><p>  The weaving of the base in a mosaic technique of beads of an even amount begins with stringing beads, the number of which should be a multiple of two, they form the first row.  For the next row, one bead is typed, and the needle is passed through the second from the end of the level.  Again, bead is recruited and held through the fourth from the end of the row.  In this way, the entire row is stitched.  Finish it by passing the needle through the first bead in the level.  To start sewing the third and all subsequent rows, a new bead is drawn through the last one strung in the previous row.  Before breaking the thread, the needle is zigzag through all the rows. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="abstinencedu.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mosaic technique" class="if uuid-3122081" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3122081.jpg"></div><h2>  Brick weaving </h2><p>  Externally, products made in brick technology resemble a mosaic structure.  However, they differ in the weaving method.  It runs in the opposite direction.  Often the product is woven in both techniques.  Due to their external similarities, the transition is almost imperceptible. </p><p>  <span>Brick weaving is</span> performed as follows: </p><ol><li>  To weave the first level, five beads are collected on a needle.  First, two beads are strung on the needle, then another one, behind it the thread is passed through the second bead in the direction of weaving, and then through the third in the given direction.  After this, the fourth bead is strung, the needle is passed through the third, but now in the opposite direction of weaving.  Do the same with the fifth bead and return to the beginning, passing through each stringed bead in turn. </li><li>  The next level of weaving can be expanded.  Two beads are put on the needle and a stitch is made, grabbing the thread connecting a pair of beads of the first row and exit through the second bead of the current row.  Then a third bead is strung, and the stitch passes between the second and third beads of the lower row.  The fourth and fifth beads do the same.  When it comes to the sixth bead, the needle is passed from top to bottom through the fifth bead and pulled through the fourth of both rows. </li><li>  At the third and fourth levels, the foundation needs to be expanded by the same method, but from the fifth row they are moving to narrowing.  To do this, a pair of beads is strung, and the stitch is made under the thread connecting the beads number six and seven in the fourth row, and through the second bead of the fifth row returns to its place.  Then the needle is led alternately through each bead in the direction of weaving of the current row. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="chucao.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="brick weaving" class="if uuid-3122085" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3122085.jpg"></div><h2>  Circular weaving </h2><p>  This type of weaving is one of the most common, it allows you to create openwork products.  At the base of circular weaving is always a thick wire, onto which several beads are strung, and a thinner wire with beads is attached below.  Two wires are parallel to each other and are combined by a common curl.  So a half-arc is formed.  On the other side of the base, another wire with beads is attached and connected to the rod from below.  If you make several more of these arcs, with the upper and lower alternation of the wire, you get a leaf. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The final row is fixed with two turns, and the end is cut off.  The main core is trimmed so that there is an end of 0.5 cm, it is hidden in the inner part of the jewelry. </p><div class="photo" data-original="chucao.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="circular weaving" class="if uuid-3122088" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3122088.jpg"></div><h2>  Parallel weaving </h2><p>  This is the easiest way.  Beadwork for beginners (photo of the scheme is presented below) in this technique will make it easy to make figures, flowers and other products. </p><p>  Its principle is that for the first pair of rows of weaving beads are collected from one end of the wire, and the opposite end is held towards the first row through the beads of the second.  Both rows are tightly shifted to the center of the wire and tightened.  Then both ends are brought out from opposite edges of the product, while the rows are close to each other.  Flat and volumetric things are made in this way, with the only difference being that for volumetric figures the rows are laid under each other, and flat - in the same plane. </p><div class="photo" data-original="zdrowie-blog.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="parallel weaving" class="if uuid-3122063" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3122063.jpg"></div><h2>  How to make a bracelet? </h2><p>  Consider the scheme for weaving bracelets from beads in a monastic way.  It looks like a mosaic weaving, only performed by two threads. </p><p>  Necessary actions: </p><ol><li>  Four beads are strung on a fishing line.  Pass one end in the opposite direction to make a cross. </li><li>  One bead is put on the fishing line on the right, and two on the left.  The right end is threaded through the extreme beads to make a cross.  In this way, weaving is continued until the end of the row.  To go to the next row, three beads are strung on the right end and weaved according to the pattern, so that the top beads of the first row are the basis of the second. </li><li>  A couple more beads are strung on the right end and two more crosses are made on the second level.  Weaving continues to the desired width of the bracelet. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="zdrowie-blog.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bracelet weaving" class="if uuid-3122060" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3122060.jpg"></div><h2>  Make a tree </h2><p>  If you follow the pattern, weaving a tree from beads is quite simple. </p><p>  A step-by-step scheme of weaving from beads for beginners is below: </p><ol><li>  First you need to cut the wire into sections of 80 cm. </li><li>  7 cm of green beads are strung on one part, 20 cm back from the edge, miniature twists of 3 beads are made and the wire is twisted with a zigzag.  In this way, 7 branches are harvested and proceed to the composition.  To begin with, twist a couple of branches, 3 mm fall back and add another.  Gradually adding ready-made branches, a branched tree looms. </li><li>  For greater realism, the shaft needs to be further decorated.  You can do this with a floral tape.  An element is wrapped around it, completing black stripes that will imitate the birch bark.  Then, using gypsum, the tree is placed inside the pot. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.joandidion.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wood weaving" class="if uuid-3122099" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3122099.jpg"></div><h2>  Gathering a Flower: Rose </h2><p>  A video and a diagram for weaving a flower with beads are presented below.  The following actions must be performed: </p><div class="photo" data-original="abstinencedu.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rose petal weaving" class="if uuid-3122156" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3122156.jpg"></div><ol><li>  Two pieces of wire 10 and 50 cm are harvested. 5 beads are strung on a smaller length and a long length is wound around it.  Beads are strung on 2/3 of the length and form an arc, covering the axis with the long part of the wire. </li><li>  On each side of the axis, 5 arcs must be made.  5-10 similar parts are manufactured according to the same principle. </li><li>  Then proceed to the collection of the flower.  3 petals are horizontally folded with a slight deflection.  So that the middle does not crumble, the wire is pressed tightly.  To make the stem strong, a thick wire is inserted between the petals.  Then with the help of thread floss each petal is tightly attached to the stem. </li></ol><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="JggYOmJkn0M" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=185&amp;v=JggYOmJkn0M" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/5/1/9/3/15193.jpg"></div><h2>  How to weave a bauble? </h2><p>  Girls are very fond of wearing jewelry in the form of bracelets of different widths and shapes.  Such <span>beadwork is</span> called baubles.  Below you will find bead patterns for children. </p><div class="photo" data-original="zdrowie-blog.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bauble pigtail" class="if uuid-3122070" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3122070.jpg"></div><p>  The sequence of actions is as follows: </p><ol><li>  At one end of the fishing line is attached part of the lock for the bracelet.  Beads of 3 cm length are strung on two pieces of fishing line. One bead is threaded through both pieces, connecting them. </li><li>  Then again 3 cm of beads are strung on each segment individually and again the segments are united by a common bead.  Then, 2 beads are put on each piece and again combined together, a flower should turn out.  After that, 3 cm of beads are strung on each fishing line.  In this way, a bauble is woven of the desired length. </li><li>  At the end, the second half of the castle is attached. <div class="photo" data-original="www.joandidion.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="weaving baubles" class="if uuid-3122093" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3122093.jpg"></div></li></ol><p>  Next, we present to your attention several schemes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="zdrowie-blog.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bauble flower" class="if uuid-3122073" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3122073.jpg"></div><p>  Such a bauble is woven with one thread.  If you want a wide bracelet, then you can use this pattern to weave several elements that will have adjacent two side flower beads. </p><div class="photo" data-original="indulgy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bauble with blue flowers" class="if uuid-3122148" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3122148.jpg"></div><p>  Also from beads you can weave some kind of animal, for example, a crocodile, a hare.  Follow the diagram below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="armandspowersports.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crocodile bead" class="if uuid-3122178" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3122178.jpg"></div><p>  Or show your child how to make a surround snowman.  This craft can be put on the table or attached to clothes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="armandspowersports.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="snowman bead" class="if uuid-3122177" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3122177.jpg"></div><p>  Using one of the above schemes for weaving with beads, you can make a beautiful product for yourself or as a gift to loved ones.
