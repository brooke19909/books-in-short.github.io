And with the birth of the baby, there are even more of them.  Naturally, the main labor activity occurs at a time when the child is sleeping.  And not all mothers will agree to leave their baby unattended in another room. </p><p>  It was for such cases that special gadgets - baby monitors, were developed.  Similar equipment is used by millions of families around the world.  The device is quite simple, akin to old push-button phones.  The baby monitor consists of two blocks - parent and child.  The first is next to mom, and the second is in the room of the baby. </p><p>  Soundtrack allows you to find out what is happening with the child.  You will hear the baby crying, his sniffing and other sounds that you can quickly respond to.  A more advanced version of such a device, a baby monitor, is also on sale.  But the practicality of this gadget is called into question by many.  Especially when it comes to a newborn baby, where it is the sounds that are important, not the image.  What to choose - a baby monitor or a baby monitor, of course, you decide, but for many mothers, judging by the reviews, the first option is quite enough. </p><p>  Today's market offers a ton of solutions to this plan.  And getting confused in the presented assortment is very easy.  In this case, real user reviews and baby monitor ratings help.  We will just try to summarize the latter with an eye on Russian realities and price sectors. </p><p>  So, we offer you an overview of the best baby monitors.  The list includes the most popular devices, distinguished by their quality component and a large number of positive reviews from parents.  All the models described below can be purchased both in online and offline stores.  So there should not be a problem with the purchase. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Baby Monitor Rating: </p><ol><li>  Ramili Baby RA300SP. </li><li>  Philips AVENT SCD506 / 52. </li><li>  Maman BM1000. </li><li>  Switel BCC38. </li><li>  Balio MV-03. </li><li>  Motorola MBP160. </li></ol><p>  Consider each participant in more detail. </p><h2>  Ramili Baby RA300SP </h2><p>  The first place in our ranking of baby monitors is occupied by a model from the well-known British company Ramili Baby in this segment.  The device has the best ratio of price to return.  The device has received rich functional equipment, and also boasts a considerable number of awards at thematic contests and exhibitions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="market.yandex.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ramili Baby RA300SP" class="if uuid-3167732" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3167732.jpg"></div><p>  An important part of the device is a wireless monitor for monitoring the baby‚Äôs breathing.  It has extensive sensitivity settings and an intelligent sensor.  The model works at a distance of up to 650 meters and provides high-quality two-way communication.  The latter allows you to reassure the baby with his voice at a distance. </p><p>  Convenience to the device is added by the touch display with which you can make all the settings.  Also pleasing was the abundance of signals, including vibration feedback.  Additionally, there is a feeding timer, a thermometer, a night lamp and even a few lullabies.  The cost of the model ranges from 7 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Philips AVENT SCD506 / 52 </h2><p>  This is a digital device with a working range of 330 meters in open spaces and about 100 meters in closed.  This distance is enough for trouble-free operation in almost all Russian apartments. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.alzashop.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Philips AVENT SCD506 / 52" class="if uuid-3167733" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3167733.jpg"></div><p>  One of the main features of the <span>Philips Avent</span> SCD506 <span>baby monitor</span> is the availability of a modern DECT module.  This technology eliminates collateral interference almost completely and makes the sound perfectly clear.  It also provides complete confidentiality of the connection of the two blocks.  Which for some consumers is far from the last argument when choosing such devices. </p><p>  The unit for mom has flexible volume control.  But even if the sound module is turned off, the device will still notify the user of the crying with a vibration or light signal.  Also on the children's block there is an opportunity to turn on the nightlight and play lullabies from a wide list. </p><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  The Philips Avent SCD506 Series is compact in size and easy to use.  It does not take up much space and fits comfortably next to the pillow even in small cots.  If the user is out of range, the gadget will immediately notify you of this with a special sound signal. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.al.to" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Philips AVENT SCD506" class="if uuid-3167738" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3167738.jpg"></div><p>  The Philips Avent parent unit can work continuously for about a day, after which it needs to be recharged.  Used energy-saving technology can significantly increase battery life when both gadgets are nearby. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It is also worth noting the absence of interference at the time of transmission of the audio signal.  Pleased with the cost of the device.  With such an impressive range of technologies, the price tag of 5,000 rubles seems quite adequate to many. </p><h2>  Maman bm1000 </h2><p>  The model is a Russian development, so the price tag for it is not as biting as for foreign counterparts.  Moreover, in its functionality, the Maman BM1000 baby monitor is not inferior to foreign competing gadgets. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ejikkids.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Maman bm1000" class="if uuid-3167736" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3167736.jpg"></div><p>  We should also mention the design of the device.  Both blocks received the form of owls, one of which is equipped with a nightlight.  This solution looks very fresh and beautiful.  The parent unit has feedback functionality, allowing you to reassure the baby at a distance. </p><p>  The range of the devices should be enough for almost everyone: 50 meters indoors and 300 meters in open spaces.  There is also an energy-saving mode.  In this case, the devices do not exchange signals, but with a high noise level (crying), an audible alarm is activated. </p><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  The parent unit has a liquid crystal display and a functional strip above it, indicating the volume of the crying child.  The device turned out to be comfortable to wear due to thoughtful attachment to clothes, and in his hand it lies like a glove. </p><p>  The device is flexibly configured, and the menu itself and its branches can not be called sophisticated.  Intuitive controls allow you to change almost any parameter of the baby monitor.  There are also no complaints about the quality of communication.  The device correctly suppresses interference, transmitting only voice, and not the environment. </p><p>  Pleased with the build quality.  Users in their reviews do not mention anything about backlashes, gaps and other design flaws.  A baby monitor from a Russian manufacturer can be found in almost all specialized domestic stores.  While it takes a lot of time to search for foreign analogues.  The cost of the device varies around 4 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Switel BCC38 </h2><p>  The model from Switzerland pleases not only with its low cost, but also with the quality of performance along with efficiency.  Judging by user reviews, the Switchel BCC38 baby monitor flawlessly copes with its tasks regardless of the number and thickness of the walls in the rooms.  The reception range of the device is quite impressive - 300 meters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Switel BCC38" class="if uuid-3167734" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3167734.jpg"></div><p>  Most domestic consumers prefer this particular device due to its perfectly balanced qualities.  Both baby monitor units can operate both on conventional batteries and on battery power.  This solution allows you to use the device outside the home. </p><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  It is also worth noting the presence of an advanced jamming system.  The sound at the output is clear and without extraneous noise.  Pleased with the ergonomic part of the device.  Due to the clip, the unit is easily fixed on clothes, and the thoughtful design is conveniently located in the palm of your hand. </p><p>  There is also a crying indicator light.  Cute little stars on the case will inform about the intensity of the latter.  There are no questions about the build quality.  Both blocks look solid.  No backlash, gaps, squeaks and other defects were found by users.  The cost of the device is a little less than 4 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Balio MV-03 </h2><p>  The country of production stops many from buying, but this is just the case when the Chinese gadget turned out to be surprisingly high-quality.  The baby monitor Balio MV 03 offers a very impressive working distance of 400 meters.  Moreover, the concrete walls and their quantity practically do not interfere with the device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sima-land.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Balio MV-03" class="if uuid-3167735" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3167735.jpg"></div><p>  The device works great both in apartments and in the fresh air, while walking with the baby.  The quality of communication is at a very decent level.  The digital stabilizer almost completely eliminates interference in both directions. </p><p>  In the pros, you can write a decent battery life.  But there are also disadvantages.  The fact is that a capacious battery adds weight to the gadget, and ergonomic qualities suffer.  Yes, the device fits perfectly in your hand, but its severity negates all its portability.  Nevertheless, in a woman‚Äôs handbag or on the kitchen table, he looks great and pleases the eye with his attractive appearance. </p><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  The device also has a number of additional functions.  Users in particular note a thoughtful night light that does not blind the baby and allows you to calmly approach it, not including external light.  In addition, the gadget offers a large selection of alerts and convenient controls.  There is no crying indicator here, but the cost of the device does not imply the presence of any kind of ‚Äúchips‚Äù. </p><p>  Both blocks are assembled efficiently and do not crumble in your hands, like other Chinese consumer goods.  Users in their reviews note that there were no backlashes, gaps, crunches behind the devices.  Model MV-03 is a frequent guest in domestic stores where you can buy it for more than three thousand rubles. </p><h2>  "Motorola MBP160" </h2><p>  In the last place of our ranking of baby monitors is an inexpensive model from a well-known brand.  The device of the MVP160 series primarily boasts its reliability and high build quality.  Both devices from the kit look monolithic, and you can not say for them that this is a budget option. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.motorolastore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Motorola MBP160" class="if uuid-3167737" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3167737.jpg"></div><p>  The interface of the parent unit is simple and intuitive.  All keys are clearly labeled, which does not cause unnecessary questions.  Pleased with the appearance of both gadgets.  Properly calibrated color contrast and a pleasant to the touch surface add solidity to the devices. </p><p>  The coverage area is at a very decent level - 300 meters in non-premises and up to 50 meters in apartments with dense concrete floors.  In addition, the device uses a module with DECT technology, which allows you to transmit a digital signal without interference. </p><p>  The Motorola MBP160 parent unit has both sound and visual alerts.  Both signals are implemented equally well.  You can choose from several tunes or regular squeakers.  The intensity of the visual part can also be adjusted widely. </p><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  The children's unit is powered by the network, and the battery is responsible for the autonomy of the parent.  The charge lasts for about a couple of days of continuous operation.  The gadget sits well in the hand and its appearance is more like a phone without a screen.  If necessary, you can fix the block on the belt using a special clip. </p><p>  Also, users respond well to the built-in night light on the children's block.  There are several colors to choose from.  All of them are implemented as they should: they do not blind the baby, they allow you to calmly approach him, not including external lighting. </p><p>  The model is good for many.  Here, high-quality assembly, and efficient operation, and the presence of additional functionality.  The price is also pleasing - about 2 thousand rubles.  But many users complain about a large number of fakes.  Moreover, the latter are sold for almost the same amount as the original.  So in the case of the baby monitor from "Motorola" you need to be especially careful. </p>
