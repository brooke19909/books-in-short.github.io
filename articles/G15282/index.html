  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Crucifer family</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere - it is here that the cruciferous family, with more than three thousand species, is mainly distributed.  It includes annuals, biennials, as well as perennials with a similar structure. </p><p>  The cruciferous family got its name because of the cross-shaped petals in the flowers of its species.  Other common symptoms are four sepals that make up the calyx, four petals that make up the corolla, stamens (two short and four long).  Inflorescence brush is also a characteristic feature of all plants belonging to the family.  Crucifers form fruits - pods.  As for the leaves, a basal rosette is formed from them or they are attached to the stem alternately.  The root system is the core, in some members of the family a root crop is formed.  The erect stem is often covered with soft or hard hairs. </p><p>  Plants are pollinated mainly by bees and bumblebees, flies and butterflies.  This suggests that members of the family are wonderful honey plants with a strong aroma. </p><p>  Vegetable, oilseeds, fodder, medicinal, ornamental plants, as well as weeds - all of them are members of this family.  Cruciferous weeds are a serious headache for agricultural workers: often a special treatment regimen is required in order to destroy them.  At the same time, some of their species are actively used by folk medicine - for example, a <span>shepherd‚Äôs bag is</span> used to <span>stop bleeding.</span>  This property of it is well known not only in domestic, but also in Chinese and Tibetan medicine, therefore, this weed is also attributed to medicinal plants.  Turnip, also representing the Cruciferous family, serves as raw material for high-quality <span>green fodder,</span> and left-handed people are perhaps the most striking decorative representatives of the family. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There is no person who has not heard of <span>rapeseed oil.</span>  It used to be one of the most popular foods used in America.  However, scientists have proved the presence of toxic substances in it that affect the heart muscle, thyroid gland and kidneys, as well as provoke the formation of fatty deposits.  Today, rapeseed and mustard are in demand varieties of technical oils. </p><p>  Well, perhaps the most interesting group <span>of</span> cruciferous <span>plants</span> is vegetables.  Before the appearance of potatoes in Russia, its place was taken by turnips.  ‚ÄúSecond bread‚Äù - this is what it was called by the people, and in almost every Russian folk tale this wonderful representative of this family was mentioned.  Today in the USA they are actively engaged in the cultivation of this root crop. </p><p>  Another ancient root crop, radish, in combination with honey has long been used in Russia as a folk remedy that contributes to the rapid removal of sputum from the respiratory tract with a cold.  And salads from radish and its closest relative, radish, have long taken their rightful place on our table. </p><p>  Not only technical oils are made from mustard, but also an excellent seasoning.  And who in childhood was not treated for a cold with mustard plasters?  Modern medicine has long appreciated the healing properties of this representative of cruciferous. </p><p>  One cannot but mention the most famous plant of the family - cabbage.  Its wild forms have been known since prehistoric times.  Today, the popularity of this vegetable is very high.  It is grown on all continents, hundreds of dishes are prepared from cabbage, sour cabbage soup is cooked and delicious cakes are baked, and juice is used for medicinal purposes.  Kohlrabi, broccoli, Beijing cabbage - this is only a small fraction of varietal diversity.  Each of its species has its own unique taste and has its lovers and connoisseurs. </p><p>  By the way, not so long ago the Cruciferous family was renamed, giving it a name in honor of the most famous representative - Cabbage. </p>
