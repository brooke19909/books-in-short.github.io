In it you can take a nap and do meditation, forgetting for a while about everyday problems.  For some, such a place can become a center for generating new ideas and even <span>a workplace.</span>  For children, it will definitely be a magnet that attracts attention, and for very small children it will be a convenient cradle. </p><p>  Fresh air is good for relaxing and for work.

    <h2>  Varieties and Features </h2><p>  For their intended purpose, the hanging chairs can be divided into children's, characterized by smaller dimensions, estimated weight and safety margin, and universal, designed including the weight of an adult.  We can also distinguish family designs, which are distinguished by even larger sizes and strength characteristics. </p><p>  According to the installation method, hanging chairs can be stationary, having a fixed mounting location, and removable.  Such structures can be easily removed and suspended in another suitable place.  They, as a rule, are distinguished by simplicity of fastenings and ease of assembly.  They can be quickly removed during bad weather, after the end of a <span>picnic in nature</span> or at the end of the season. </p><p>  If you wish, you can make a very simple hanging chair with your own hands.  Photos of different types of structures make it clear how much they differ in structural features and installation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Materials </h2><p>  For the manufacture of a round base, it is easiest to use fabric, willow rods or rope.  The frame can be made by hand or used gymnastic hoop.  It is lightweight, moderately durable and is most likely suitable for a baby cradle or for a middle-aged child. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY do-it-yourself hanging chair photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28294/683678.jpg" width="385"></div>

    <p>  For older adults or adults, a round frame is best made from a metal-plastic pipe for water supply.  It can be bent into a circle of various diameters and connected with a wood or plastic insert with additional fastening to bolts or screws. </p><p>  It is necessary to secure the hanging chair made with your own hands reliably, with a margin of safety.  To the ceiling, if it is not possible to make a through hole, a metal ring or hook is mounted on anchor bolts.  For the convenience of attaching slings, you can use <span>carabiners for climbing equipment.</span>  It is convenient to select the length of the slings with metal adjusting buckles. </p><h2>  Wicker chair </h2><p>  This design will be easy and practical.  A round frame made of a metal-plastic pipe is suitable.  It is bent with a ring of the desired diameter and fixed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY wicker hanging chair" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28294/683680.jpg" width="324"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Then a cord braids the entire surface of the pipe.  You will have to get acquainted with the technique of weaving macram√©.  To create a grid using a flat knot "checkerboard".  The cord is tightened tightly, the sagging of the base will depend on this. </p><p>  The second ring of metal-plastic pipe form the backrest and handrails.  In one place, two rings are fastened with a cord.  On the other hand, put two wooden struts of planks of the required length.  At their ends, grooves are made along the <span>diameter of the pipe</span> and securely fixed with a cord.  These planks achieve a constant back height and the required rigidity of the structure.  The space between the rings is also braided. </p><p>  A wicker hanging chair made by yourself is attached to the ceiling on a reliable bracket.  For suspensions use twisted rope or slings. </p><h2>  <span>DIY swing swing chair</span> </h2><p>  Such a design, if you do not take into account a simple wide board suspended on two ropes from a branch of an old tree, provides a stationary installation method with concreting the base. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY swing swing chair" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28294/683676.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <p>  Guide racks are usually installed at an angle.  Moreover, the more massive the base of the swing, the more it should be.  Racks with additional struts are more convenient to make metal, from pipes of suitable diameter, but it is possible from a wooden beam.  The jumper must withstand rated loads. </p><p>  Pendants for a swing most often choose chain, they do not stretch and can be exposed to moisture for a long time.  The seat and back are made of wooden boards of the required thickness.  The stationary installation method involves the presence of a canopy to protect the seat from rain. </p><p>  Often a swing is made with openwork railings, planks are varnished or painted.  Such hanging chairs have a presentable appearance and are often made for families. </p><h2>  Chair hammock hanging </h2><p>  Do it yourself with your own hands is not difficult.  To make it, you will need a piece of dense fabric about two meters, a strong twisted rope, a <span>wooden block</span> about one meter long and 40-50 mm thick and a bracket for hanging. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY hammock chair" class="if" height="456" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28294/695567.jpg" width="452"></div>

    <p>  For a simple version of the hammock, the side edges are tucked so as not to spill, and stitched on a sewing machine (you can also manually, reinforced seam) to form a channel for pulling the rope. </p><p>  The bar serves to give the chair the necessary width.  In it, closer to the edges, on both sides, two holes with a diameter are drilled, allowing to stretch the rope.  Its ends are brought into the extreme holes, it is tied along the stop assembly so that the block does not fall. </p><p>  Next, the rope stretches through the channels formed at the edges of the fabric, and winds into the free holes of the bar.  The length of the edges, the tension under load are adjusted and the fixing knots fit. </p><p>  Such a simple hanging hammock chair, made with your own hands from a piece of cloth and rope, is hung on a hook mounted in the ceiling. </p><h2>  Master Class: A Simple Idea </h2><p>  Surely many in the country or in a country house have an old armchair transported from a city apartment after acquiring new furniture.  It‚Äôs more familiar and better to relax, it can be used for hanging. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to make a DIY hanging chair" class="if" height="329" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28294/695593.jpg" width="277"></div>

    <p>  In the manufacture of chairs "from scratch" there are two tasks.  The first is to make a durable and comfortable place to sit with the back, the second is to suspend it, ensuring reliability.  Using an old, time-tested chair, you can consider the first task completed and go directly to the second. </p><p>  At this stage, you need to choose the type of brackets for installation, think over the correct angle of inclination, choose the material for the suspensions.  Well, and decide how to pick up a chair so that it is both reliable and not critical for the wooden legs of the structure.  By the way, they can not be removed, but suspended as is above the floor, raised by 5-10 cm. </p><p>  After such a practice, it will be much easier to make a hanging chair with your own hands completely from start to finish.  The experience and knowledge gained during the installation of the suspension structure will surely come in handy and serve as a guideline for possible improvements and improvements.  The materials of the old suspension can be easily adapted for a new foundation. </p><p>  So you can make the original do-it-yourself hanging chair twice as fast.  Friends, acquaintances and neighbors will certainly be pleasantly surprised by such a non-standard and practical approach. </p>
