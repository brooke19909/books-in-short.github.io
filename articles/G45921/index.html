    <h2>  From the history of the temple </h2><p>  St. Matthias Church is located on a mountain in the Buda Castle at Szentharomsag ter 2. In 2015, the cathedral turned one thousand years old.  According to historical information, the founder of the cathedral was Istvan I - the first Hungarian king.  Around 1015, he ordered the construction of a religious building to glorify the name of the Virgin Mary at the peak of Castle Hill.  It is believed that it was here that the confessor Gellert was buried, who in 1046 died a traumatic death. </p><p>  Due to the invasion of Hungary (1241‚Äì1242), the Mongol-Tatar horde has not survived to this day, a single image or any other material evidence of this building.  During the years 1250-1270, the church of St. Matthias was again erected on a castle hill, and in the XIV century it was rebuilt again. </p><p>  During the reign of King Matthias Corwin (1458-1490), the church was again significantly reconstructed.  Prior to this, the church was called the Virgin Mary, and after this restoration, it acquired its modern name - St. Matthias Church.  After <span>this, the cathedral</span> was again devastated by the Turks in 1526.  They arranged a mosque in the cathedral, which existed there for almost 150 years. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After several centuries, they tried to reconstruct the building, but the attempt was unsuccessful.  During the last perestroika, under the leadership of Fridies Schulek in 1874‚Äì1896, the church acquired a modern appearance. </p>

    <h2>  Elements of the interior of the temple </h2><p>  St. Matthias Church (address above) contains many interesting interior details.  The oldest part of the temple is the gates of Mary.  They are in the atrium at the foot of the bell tower.  The gates are considered the only real Gothic part of the structure dating from the XIV century. </p><p>  An interesting detail of the church is the Matthias shield of 1470 with a portrait of the king.  From the very beginning, the shield was on the outside of the tower, but during one of the reconstructions it was moved inside the building.  The shield is bordered with frescoes depicting the faces of two black knights. </p><p>  Near the main entrance to the cathedral is the Loreta chapel.  During the reign of the Anjou dynasty in Hungary, they worshiped Our Lady of Loreta. </p>
