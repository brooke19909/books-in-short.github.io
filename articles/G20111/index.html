To the sea only 5-7 minutes in a calm step.  The excellent location relative to all infrastructure often attracts tourists.  The place is good for lovers of a calm and measured rest. </p><h2>  Population </h2><p>  The flight to Crete from the central region of the country is very short, however, tourists as soon as possible want to get the room keys, put their things and go to the sea.  What can the hotel Simple Hersonissos Blue 2 * offer?  <span>Check-out time</span> at the hotel is 14:00.  Tourists who arrive earlier than the specified time period may not even expect to check in.

    <p>  Tourists note that the rooms are decorated in a traditional European style - nothing more.  They are small, represented by only one room.  Recall that Simple Hersonissos Blue 2 * <span>(Crete, Hersonissos)</span> - the hotel is not new, which can be seen by the state of the furniture.  Tourists note that the furniture in the rooms is old, in some very old.  A double bed is represented by two beds, sleeping on them is quite uncomfortable.  Vacationers are surprised by the lack of a duvet cover for a blanket, it is replaced by a small sheet.  The equipment in the room is quite old, but it works properly.  In some rooms, the air conditioner makes strange and incomprehensible sounds during operation, but it does its job perfectly.  But there is one feature: you can control the air conditioner only using the remote control, which is issued at the reception for an additional fee. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Now for the bathroom: it is very small, the toilet and shower tray are quite close to each other.  There is a curtain, but it constantly sticks to the body, therefore, while taking water procedures, the spray flies in all directions.  Vacationers complain about interruptions in the supply of hot water, or rather, its absence in the morning.  Only in the afternoon and in the late afternoon the water is heated to a comfortable temperature.  If after waking up you want to cheer up - a <span>cold shower</span> is perfect for you.  Plumbing is old, some rooms have leaking taps.  All necessary bath accessories must be taken with you: in the room you will not even find a bar of soap. </p>

    <p>  Speaking about the shortcomings of the Simple Hersonissos Blue 2 * hotel, I want to say a few words about the lack of sound insulation.  Everything that happens in the next room is audible.  If noisy neighbors come across, there will be no rest from them even at night. </p><p>  Apartment rooms have a small kitchen with a minimal set of household appliances and utensils.  Here you can always cook something for breakfast, lunch and dinner. </p><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  The hotel area is quite small, but all vacationers can take advantage of free parking for a rental car.  Admittedly, many vacationers who come to Crete rent a car.  This is a great opportunity to travel around the whole island, get acquainted with its most beautiful places and visit beaches remote from civilization. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  For all vacationers, the Simple Hersonissos Blue 2 * hotel (Greece) offers an outdoor pool located on its territory.  It is very small, equipped with sunbeds and umbrellas, free for vacationers.  True, only occasionally can tourists be seen here, most prefer spending time at sea. </p>

    <p>  The hotel is completely not intended for families with babies: here, vacationers will not see either a playground or a children's pool.  All those who still came here with little travelers were only disappointed: they are bored and uninterested here, they have to entertain the children on their own. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  Of course, choosing a 2 * hotel, it‚Äôs stupid to count on excellent service.  Nevertheless, people hope to get good service at the Simple Hersonissos Blue 2 * hotel.  The reviews of tourists are largely contradictory, but perhaps everyone has complaints about the irregular cleaning of rooms and the dirt in the hotel.  The administration saves literally everything, for 40 hotel rooms there is only one cleaning lady.  Obviously, she is simply not able to service all the rooms.  That is why cleaning is done only a few times for a week's stay, and it is superficial in nature: you should not count on mopping and cleaning plumbing, all the cleaner will do is take out the trash.  Bed linen for 10 days can never be changed.  Towels are changed exclusively at the request of vacationers. </p><p>  The reception is open around the clock, the hotel staff is polite and friendly, ready to go forward and help in solving the current problem.  Here you can get acquainted with the excursion program of the resort: the staff will definitely tell you which excursions are worth visiting and which are better to refuse. </p><p>  The hotel does not have wireless Internet, the only way to connect with the world is to visit local cafes and restaurants. </p>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Simple Hersonissos Blue 2 * hotel offers all-inclusive meals.  But vacationers say that it‚Äôs not worth it.  Food is not impressive in its diversity: it is the same every day.  For breakfast you can see yogurt, cereal, milk, cold cuts of meat and cheese, fresh bread, tea, and coffee to choose from.  During lunch and dinner, many tourists noticed how special cars with containers arrive, and the restaurant staff simply shift food from them - respectively, the hotel does not cook.  If breakfasts are more or less decent, then lunches and dinners are just disgusting: meat of incomprehensible origin, sticky pasta or unsalted potatoes, only occasionally can you see fresh vegetables and fruits.  Moreover, leftover food can be served quite calmly the next day.  Water for making tea and coffee is poured from the tap, and the water in Crete is not the highest quality.  Do not count on freshly squeezed juices in the bar - this is just a diluted powder.  From alcoholic beverages beer, wine, cognac. </p><p>  Food is not just not diverse, it is of poor quality.  In order not to poison yourself with local masterpieces, it is better to eat in cafes and restaurants, there are plenty of them. </p>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  A short walk from the Simple Hersonissos Blue 2 * hotel is an excellent sandy beach.  It is wide enough with a gentle approach to the sea.  Here you can rent sports and water activities, surfing.  The sea is warm, crystal clear.  Crete is a paradise for beach lovers.  The coast offers stunning views of the local beauty and surroundings of the resort. </p><p>  Along the coast there are enough cafes and restaurants where you can always have a bite to eat.  On the beach you can taste seafood, boiled corn, as well as local ice cream. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Many tourists who pay attention to the Simple Hersonissos Blue 2 * hotel are attracted to the all-inclusive program.  But do not rely on what you are used to seeing in Turkey and Egypt.  First of all, understand that this is a 2 * hotel, so everything here, from the arrangement of rooms to food, is more than budget.  You will have to visit local restaurants and cafes to grab a bite to eat.  That is why it is better to pay attention to other hotels, moreover, you can save quite a lot.  If you purchased the tour on favorable terms, staying at this hotel will cost you quite a budget, you can also have a good rest here, especially if you spend the night in your room. </p><p>  In general, the hotel is suitable for undemanding tourists who are looking for a room with an excellent location and only intend to spend the night in it. </p>
