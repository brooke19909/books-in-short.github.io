It has an intersectoral character and is involved in solving a whole range of problems in the systems of public education, healthcare and social assistance to the population.  A clinical psychologist works to increase psychological resources, as well as the adaptive capacity of people.  In addition, it is aimed at preventing and overcoming all kinds of ailments, harmonizing <span>mental development,</span> psychological rehabilitation and protecting health. </p><p>  The term "clinical psychology" in Russia has long been replaced by "medical psychology", they defined the same field of activity.  But in 1990, it was necessary to bring the Russian educational program in line with international standards.  Within the framework of this, a specialty called "clinical psychology" was approved.  In contrast to what is happening in our country, in the practice of other nations, medical psychology denotes a narrower sphere of psychology of the interaction of the patient and the therapist or doctor.  But clinical psychology is a holistic practical and scientific psychological discipline. </p><p>  It is used not only in medicine, but also in many social, educational, advisory institutions that serve people with <span>psychological problems</span> and developmental anomalies. </p><p>  The tasks of clinical psychology are diverse.  Firstly, it is designed to study the influence of psychosocial and psychological factors on the <span>development of personal</span> and behavioral disorders in people, their correction and prevention.  Secondly, she studies the specifics and nature of any violations in the development of the psyche of a particular person.  Thirdly, she explores how abnormalities and disorders in somatic and mental development affect the behavior and personality of people.  Fourth, she studies the nature of relationships with the immediate environment of an abnormal person.  Fifth, she studies and creates various psychological methods of influencing the human psyche for preventive and corrective purposes. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The subject of this scientific and practical discipline is the mental manifestations of disorders, their influence on the psyche, the role of the psyche itself in their occurrence, course, and prevention.  In addition, the subject of this discipline is also considered a violation <span>of the psyche, the</span> development of all kinds of principles and research methods in the clinic, methods and psychotherapy. </p><p>  The main section of clinical psychology is pathopsychology.  She deals with issues such as mental disorders of the person, disorders of adequate perception of the world due to CNS lesions.  She is also exploring the creation of methods for correcting and treating such diseases. </p><p>  In clinical psychology there is also a section of neuropsychology.  This discipline studies the role of the brain and central nervous system in various mental processes.  The psychosomatics section explores all sorts of problems of people who are sick with somatic disorders.  This means that due to the <span>influence of the psychological</span> factor, people have various diseases of the internal organs, oncology and so on.  There are also sections in clinical psychology such as psychiatry and <span>psychological correction.</span> </p><p>  Methods of clinical psychology allow us to differentiate, objectify and qualify a variety of pathology options and norms.  The choice of a specific method depends on what task the psychologist faces, what is the mental state of a particular patient, and so on.  This is a conversation, observation, study of products of creativity.  They also include psychophysiological methods, anamnestic, biographical and experimental-psychological methods. </p>
