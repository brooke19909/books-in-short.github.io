It is generally accepted that this is the Pentateuch of Moses, including the <span>first books of the</span> Bible known to us: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy (in Hebrew the names come from the first word of the book, for example, Genesis - ‚ÄúIn the beginning‚Äù, ‚ÄúExodus‚Äù - ‚ÄúNames " etc).  But for Jews, this is a much broader and more comprehensive concept that defines the chosen nation. </p>

In the Jewish synagogue, there is a special sacred place, the Aron Kodesh - the ark, in which the holy book is kept.  <span>What is the</span> Torah?  This is Scripture, framed in a special scroll by hand of written text.  The scroll is made of specially processed parchment, the ends of which are fixed on two wooden bases decorated with carvings.  Every Saturday, a chapter from the Pentateuch is read in the synagogue.  Thus, in a year the whole text is reread.

    <p>  The origin of the Torah is also a controversial issue.  Some researchers believe that these books were written gradually over several hundred years based on an oral tradition.  But any real Jew will tell you with confidence that the Torah was given to <span>Mount Sinai</span> by God Moses himself after the people left Egypt, at that time a covenant was made between the Most High and his people. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The origin of the Torah" class="if" height="347" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13600/120211.jpg" width="600"></div>  These sacred books describe the <span>origin of the earth,</span> as well as its initial history before and after the flood.  The covenant of Abraham with God gave the foundation for the appearance of a people in which all the nations of the earth should receive a blessing.  Particular attention is paid to the moral law - the decalogue or, more simply, the 10 commandments, as well as the ceremonial law that describes the standards of ministry in the sanctuary.  The Pentateuch, the Mosaic Law, clearly shows the cause-effect relationship between the life of the people and their well-being.  Thus, the dispersal of the Jews across the earth is a consequence of disobedience, and the restoration of the state is a sign of mercy due to repentance.

Every teenager who goes through initiation (bar mitzvah) first goes to the synagogue to read a chapter from this book.  Also, tradition requires each Jewish man to write his own list, which is quite difficult to accomplish.  The fact is that it is necessary to strictly follow the existing canons of writing, the number of characters is calculated so that the error does not slip in, you need to write the list in a special font, calligraphic handwriting in Hebrew.  Some order the creation of their own list of specialists - calligraphers, but it is very expensive.  As often happened, the Jews carry out this command, but not quite as required.  For example, one list can be ordered as a group, and thus, as if everyone is the owner of the Book.

    <p>  What is the Torah for a Jew?  This is primarily his connection with the chosen people, especially the blessed.  These are the rules according to which you need to build your life and the promised privileges for it.  And most importantly, it is a means to keep oneself clean and to know the will of the Almighty. </p><p>  You can find a lot of negative information about the Torah, rather, this is due to the negative in relation to its interpretation by the Jews themselves.  But one cannot but agree that the Pentateuch played a huge role for many cultures, formed the basis of <span>world religions</span> (Christianity and Judaism), the commandments of the ten words are the basis of morality of any society, the basis of criminal and civil law.  Thus, despite different answers to the question of what the Torah is, its huge impact on the development of all human history should be recognized. </p>
