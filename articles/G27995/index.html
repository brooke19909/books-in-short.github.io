    <h2>  Opinions of tourists: negative </h2><p>  It is rare to find a hotel that has no displeased visitors.  Solemar Hotel 3 * complex was not an exception, reviews about which are sometimes negative.  Tourists note the following disadvantages of the hotel: </p><ul><li>  Air conditioning is paid, although the description does not mention it anywhere. </li><li>  Very slow and cramped elevator.  You have to wait a very long time to get to your floor. </li><li>  Tasteless beer.  It seems to be diluted with water. </li><li>  A small shower that is not suitable for full people.  The drain is completely clogged, so the water leaves for a very long time and spills onto the floor. </li><li>  To go far to the beach, you have to get around the road and several local cafes. </li><li>  Very noisy if the windows overlook the road. </li><li>  I come across old towels with sewn holes. </li><li>  There are very few fruits on the menu.  For lunch and dinner, they give some apples, oranges, and sometimes a few slices of watermelon. </li></ul><h2>  Is it worth it to relax in this place? </h2><p>  After reviewing the description and reviews of this hotel, we can say that it is suitable for a budget holiday.  Families with young children, elderly people and tourists who are looking for a place for a relaxing vacation should come here.  For youth companies, by contrast, this place may seem too boring.
