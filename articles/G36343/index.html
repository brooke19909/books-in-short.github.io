    <p>  Upon request, a cot and a pot are provided for free to guests in their room.  There is also the opportunity to rent a stroller for your baby, if suddenly the guests could not bring their own to rest.  This is very convenient, because not everyone will be able to take children's transport on the plane. </p><p>  Animators often arrange various children's performances, and at a special disco for young tourists, children can show their dancing skills and successes. </p><p>  The restaurants provide highchairs and a special menu, thanks to which parents can tasty and healthy feed their child.  Here you can also use a blender and a heater for baby food. </p><h2>  General impressions of tourists </h2><p>  When choosing a place for a future vacation, tourists rely not only on the description of hotels in Turkey on their official websites and information from travel agencies, but also on the impressions of other vacationers.  Reviews of the Queens Park Goynuk hotel will make it the most complete impression. </p>

    <p>  As always, our compatriots evaluate the hotel both positively and negatively, but most agree that this place to stay does not match its stars. </p><h2>  Advantages of Queen's Park Resort Goynuk </h2><p>  Almost all reviews praise the large and spacious Queen's Park Resort Goynuk.  It is very green, planted with a lot of flowers.  A variety of trees also did not leave our compatriots indifferent.  Among them are palm trees and fruit trees.  Tourists also like the hotel‚Äôs excellent location overlooking the thick green mountains. </p><p>  According to the reviews of our compatriots, the hotel has a very good children's mini club.  Here, not only watching cartoons with children and drawing, but every day they come up with new topics for games, competitions, master crafts. </p>

    <p>  They respond positively to the animators and entertainment shows that they host.  Programs for children, organized at the highest level, are especially noted. </p><h2>  Disadvantages of relaxing at the hotel </h2><p>  In their reviews, many vacationers write that the rooms leave much to be desired.  Despite the fact that the last repair was carried out relatively recently, all rooms require updating.  The furniture is simple, in some places there are ragged pieces of walls.  Also, guests are unhappy with the cleaning of the rooms: many write that it is carried out irregularly. </p><p>  Some tourists who visited the Queens Park Goynuk hotel are unhappy with the rather monotonous dishes in restaurants and a small selection of drinks. </p>

    <p>  Not satisfied, our compatriots were left and the service staff as a whole.  Some write that the waiters in restaurants serve slowly, and last but not least they approach Russians.  Reception staff rarely respond to requests and comments, probably waiting for some kind of reward for their services. </p><p>  Of course, any positive feedback about this hotel is definitely the opposite.  There are tourists who were delighted with the food and staff.  But most guests believe that this hotel does not reach the declared five-star level. </p>
