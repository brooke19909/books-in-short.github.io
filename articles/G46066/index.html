Real money or cheating?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Earning on the Internet is of interest to many.  Not everyone knows that you can earn money without investing (or with them) on the World Wide Web.  And those who are already aware of such opportunities are trying to find the most suitable place to earn money.  One such venue was a company called the Venture Alliance.  Reviews about it are of interest to many.  But it‚Äôs difficult to understand exactly whether this company can be trusted or not.  Nevertheless, we will try to find out whether it is really possible to join this company, or better to bypass it.  This is not so difficult if you carefully look at all the nuances. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="venture alliance reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1227135.jpg"></div>

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

    <h2>  Activities </h2><p>  First of all, you need to think about what, in principle, our today's corporation is engaged in.  Maybe her very activity is already alarming?  Not really.  <span>Venture</span> Alliance positions itself as a financial corporation.  That is, she is engaged in monetary operations, or rather, investment. </p><p>  What does it mean?  You invest in it and then make a profit.  And, as you promise, rather big.  In principle, this kind of proposal really takes place in the modern world, although it is not always true.  And for that, the Venture Alliance gets mixed reviews.  On the one hand, you can become an investor who will receive a certain profit from participating in the life of the company, on the other hand, this is a dubious matter. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Passive profit </h2><p>  Another advantage of this company is that it supposedly brings you passive income.  That is, you can do nothing and receive for this or that money.  Venture Alliance - Daily Lifetime Income.  That is how the company positions itself.  In addition, some users assure the veracity of this proposal. </p><p>  Of course, you will have to invest first.  This is normal - to get something, you must first sacrifice something.  People are aware of this rule, so it is with great pleasure that they begin to work with the Venture Alliance.  The question is different - is it right? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="venture alliance com" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1227136.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Again, reviews are mixed here.  After all, passive income in itself is suspicious.  Especially when he is lifelong.  And if you think about it, then the investment will really sooner or later under certain circumstances begin to make a profit.  However, many users who were already familiar with Internet earnings are skeptical of this offer.  Most often you have to look for an option that does not require you from the so-called down payment. </p><h2>  Earnings at your fingertips </h2><p>  Venture Alliance - a divorce or a real way to profit without limits?  This question interests many.  Especially those who have nothing to do in their dreams, but only receive money.  Sounds like a fairy tale, right?  But the Venture Alliance firm assures that with them it is possible to realize the idea. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The thing is that your earnings will directly depend on your investments.  How exactly?  On a day you get 1% of how much the company contributed to the treasury.  The more money you transfer, the higher your income.  It is not limited in time.  That is, it is enough to invest only once, and then receive a certain profit for life.  It looks like something incredible.  You don‚Äôt need to work or invite new users to the project - just invest and get a return. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="venture alliance scam" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1227137.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  To believe </h2><p>  This kind of approach causes a lot of suspicion among citizens.  Especially for those who, in principle, do not believe in a "freebie" on the Web.  This is a normal occurrence.  Why?  There is a lot of fraud on the Internet, which often simply serves as a money-laundering affair.  1% of your investment is a pretty decent amount, given that people transfer relatively much money to the account of such companies.  And all this only in order to get at least some kind of income.  Doubtful success that makes you wary. </p><h2>  Website </h2><p>  Still thinking which project we're dealing with?  Sometimes it‚Äôs enough to look at the official page of a company to make the picture clearer.  Venture Alliance.com arouses great mistrust among users.  Therefore, there is every reason to believe that this is a real deception. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  What causes high distrust?  Venture Alliance.com, if you look closely, looks patterned.  That is, on the Web you can find a lot of similar pages that are not created on some kind of free hosting like Yukoz.  It is no secret to anyone that stereotyping is the first sign of a scam. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="venture alliance divorce" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1227138.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Indeed, it is enough to look for companies with similar activities (the same as the Venture Alliance) to verify the truth of the words spoken.  In most cases, you will see identical pages where only the name of the corporation, photos and comments of investors and administration will differ.  All other information will either be replaced poorly, or in general will be similar.  A strange phenomenon, isn't it?  Is the Venture Alliance a scam that simply spins on the Internet? </p><h2>  Harsh reality </h2><p>  Yes, that‚Äôs exactly it.  As practice shows, after joining the project you will be able to feel the reality of what is happening on yourself.  How exactly? </p><p>  The thing is that in fact, the Venture Alliance receives feedback from most users, working on the principle of a financial pyramid.  You bring money here, more and more, to receive some kind of lifelong passive income.  And you supposedly "just like that" will be given daily and unconditionally a certain percentage of investments.  At the same time indefinitely. </p><p>  Doubtful, isn't it?  Free cheese happens only in mousetraps, and here it is presented in this way.  No company can just pay money to its investors, and even on an unlimited basis.  Thus, the Venture Alliance is a real <span>financial pyramid.</span>  And such projects, as a rule, are a common money-laundering. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="venture alliance" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1227139.jpg"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <h2>  But what about earnings </h2><p>  To finally be convinced of this, just look at the result of your cooperation.  Or pay attention to the experience of other users.  Venture Alliance reviews are not getting the best after investors try to withdraw earned money from the system. </p><p>  What will happen?  Nothing.  You will issue a "fake" money transfer to an electronic wallet or your bank card, but you will not receive any money.  Why?  Because all your earnings are <span>a hoax.</span>  A constantly replenished account is just an imitation of the project.  All this was invented in order to breed users for money.  A long-known technique that no longer surprises anyone. </p><h2>  Eternal praise </h2><p>  How long will the Venture Alliance last?  This question interests many users who already had the recklessness to contact such a deft deception.  Nevertheless, it is impossible to answer exactly here.  Until the company is sued (which is almost impossible to do now, because you yourself give your money to the company), it will function. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="venture alliance daily lifetime income" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1227140.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Another pretty interesting point - the Internet is full of reviews that literally praise the activities of the corporation.  Where do they come from if we are dealing with a real scam designed for user confidence?  The answer is simple.  And with him, perhaps, many are familiar. </p><p>  The Venture Alliance receives positive reviews due to the fact that they are simply bought by fraudulent owners.  People get paid to post laudatory posts and company posts.  They even manage to present evidence in the form of videos and screenshots.  Only you can not trust them. </p><p>  Firstly, if you look closely, all praise for the Venture Alliance will be cliche.  A minimum of useful information in essence, a maximum of promises of high income, and passive.  What to do if you saw evidence of profit?  Do not believe it either.  Modern scammers masterfully fake both commercials and screenshots.  This helps them to breed unsuspecting users for money.  In principle, all modern schoolchildren should cope with the falsification of evidence - a little knowledge in Photoshop and video editors - and the problems have been solved. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="venture alliance how long" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1227141.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  So, the Venture Alliance receives positive reviews, but all this is a lie.  This company is a real fake, which can not be trusted.  Try to avoid it, and especially not invest in the project! </p>
