    <h2>  Smartphone niche </h2><p>  Desire 210 is one of the most affordable entry-level smartphones to date. It only has a set of basic functions and there is nothing superfluous, and it is currently priced at only $ 90.  This is a great smartphone for those who need a gadget with a basic set of features for every day and with a minimum cost.  From a practical point of view, the purchase of HTC Desire 210 Dual Sim Black is more preferable.  The feedback from the owners of the device suggests that in this version, dirt is not very noticeable on the surface of the case, and scratches are not so easy to distinguish.  But the white version is better suited for the weak half of humanity.  It will emphasize the individuality of each woman or girl.  And they use smart phones more accurately. </p><h2>  Design solutions </h2><p>  As already mentioned, there are only two color options for the body of this gadget: black and white.  The greatest demand from them is HTC Desire 210 Dual Sim Black.  Reviews indicate that dirt and scratches on it are not as noticeable as on a white case.  On the front panel (it is made of plastic) the device displays a 4-inch display.  Under it is a 3-button control panel, and above it is a speaker, a sensor panel and a front camera eye.  On the lower edge of the device, there is only the opening of the conversational microphone, and on the upper edge there is a port for connecting an external audio system.  Mechanical control buttons (screen lock, device volume control) are located on the right side of the device, and the microUSB port is on the left.  On the back cover, in addition to the logo of the manufacturer, there is also a peephole of the main camera. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  CPU </h2><p>  A modest entry-level 2-core chip is used in the HTC Desire 210 Dual Sim.  User reviews highlight a fairly low level of its performance.  But you can‚Äôt expect more from MT6572.  Each of its computing modules can operate in the highest load mode at a frequency of 1 GHz.  Also, its cores are based on an energy-efficient architecture, code-named "Cortex A7."  But they cannot boast of a high level of performance.  So it turns out that the most demanding applications, high-quality video and other resource-intensive tasks simply will not start on this device.  But everyday tasks (surfing various sites, reading any books, undemanding toys, watching videos, listening to radio and music) are quite capable of him. </p><h2>  Device graphics </h2><p>  This device belongs to the budget class of devices and boasts the presence of the most modest TFT-matrix today.  <span>The screen resolution</span> of this smartphone is 480x800.  Given the fact that the diagonal of the display is only 4 inches, it is not so easy to distinguish individual pixels.  The touch surface of the screen itself can process only two touches to its surface.  A separate graphic adapter is not provided in this smart phone, and the image processing function automatically falls on the <span>central processor,</span> which already cannot boast of high performance, but also has to perform additional functions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  What cameras are in the device? </h2><p>  A fairly high-quality main camera, located at the top of the back cover of the device, in the HTC Desire 210 Dual Sim.  Reviews, photos and videos obtained using the main camera and posted on the forums by users, once again convince.  Although she has a rather modest sensitive element of 5 megapixels, the quality of photos and videos is acceptable.  Panoramic images are almost flawless.  But detailed pictures will be difficult to clearly photograph - the autofocus system is not in this device.  Similarly, the lack of backlighting does not allow the main camera to be used in the dark or in the absence of a normal level of illumination.  The maximum resolution of pictures on this is 2592 by 1944, and the video is recorded in HD format, that is 720x1280.  There is also a <span>front camera.</span>  She has a sensor only 0.3 megapixels.  Therefore, her photos and videos are obtained in disgusting quality.  And for a "selfie" this will also not be enough.  The only reason for which its parameters are enough is IP-telephony, that is, for making video calls.  The picture quality is not perfect, but it is enough for Skype, for example. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Memory subsystem </h2><p>  The memory subsystem in the HTC Desire 210 Dual SIM Black device is very modestly organized.  Owner reviews highlight this feature of this device.  It is also worth noting that a rarer modification of this smartphone in a white case boasts the same amount of RAM and the exact same capacity of the integrated drive.  More specifically, only 512 MB of RAM installed in this gadget.  Of these, only 200 MB a user can use for their needs.  The rest is occupied by the operating system and proprietary add-on from HTC.  The capacity of the integrated drive is at least 4 GB.  At the same time, half of them are filled with preinstalled software.  That is, the owner of this smartphone can only count on 2 GB, which is clearly not enough for comfortable work.  As a result, the owner of this smartphone cannot do without a memory card.  The corresponding slot is hidden behind the back cover and located near the place of installation of SIM cards.  Its maximum capacity in this case can be 32 GB. </p>

    <h2>  The battery and autonomy of the smartphone </h2><p>  The battery is very modest in this device.  Its capacity is very modest 1300 mAh.  Add to this a 4-inch display diagonal and a dual-core processor solution (besides it is also energy-efficient), we will get 2-3 days of confident operation with an average load.  If you increase the intensity of use of the device, then the indicated values ‚Äã‚Äãwill decrease to 12-24 hours.  But in the minimum load mode, you can stretch 4 days.  If the <span>battery capacity</span> were greater, then the size and weight of the device would not have a dramatic effect.  But the degree of autonomy of the gadget would increase significantly and then we could count on 5 days of work on one battery charge. </p><h2>  List of interfaces </h2><p>  An impressive communication set boasts HTC Desire 210 Dual Sim.  Owner reviews highlight the wired ports of 3.5 mm audio jacks and microUSB and wireless Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZhPS and mobile networks of GSM and 3G standards.  In general, the list of interfaces of this device allows you to solve any, even the most complex tasks associated with data transfer. </p>

    <h2>  System software </h2><p>  The Android operating system acts as a system software that controls the HTC Desire 210 Dual Sim smartphone.  Reviews indicate the availability of version 4.2.  Apparently, you should not expect updates for this device, you will have to be content with exactly what is already there.  BlinkFeed is preinstalled on top of system software.  Also included in the basic firmware of the device are such software components as a set of applications from Google and social clients Facebook and Twitter.  A set of typical mini-programs (calculator, organizer, calendar) is also predefined. </p><h2>  Owner reviews </h2><p>  You do not have to expect phenomenal features from the budget HTC Desire 210 Dual Sim.  Reviews indicate its mediocre parameters.  But still, its technical specifications make it possible to easily solve most everyday tasks: listening to audio recordings and radio stations, watching videos and images, surfing various Internet resources, reading books, simple toys and playing videos from Youtube - this device can handle all this without any problems .  Therefore, from the position of functionality, this smartphone has no drawbacks, taking into account how the manufacturer himself positions it.  Some dissatisfaction is caused by the battery capacity and the degree of autonomy of the device.  But, as practice shows, with a reasonable approach, one battery charge can last 2-3 days.  So this problem can still be solved by setting up the device and installing additional software. </p>

    <h2>  Cost </h2><p>  The version of this smartphone in a black case will cost you today $ 90.  2-3 dollars more expensive is the mobile phone HTC Desire 210 Dual Sim White.  User reviews indicate that the cost is more than acceptable.  To the declared 90 dollars, you must also add the cost of accessories (case, protective film, memory card).  As a result, the cost of the device will increase slightly and amount to about <span>$ 100,</span> but this will already unlock the potential of this gadget to the maximum. </p>
