What are there for this application?  This will be discussed in our article.  Despite the fact that everyone in the house has a TV, many users of Apple devices are interested in how to watch TV on an iPhone.  A step-by-step instruction on how to do this will be presented in the article.  We will also consider different options for gaining access to channels on our smartphone. </p><p>  There is no standard application for viewing.  You have to download it.  It is only necessary to decide which application to use for viewing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pcworld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to watch tv on iphone for free" class="if uuid-2959748" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2959748.jpg"></div><h2>  Yunisov TV app: description </h2><p>  You will find this application in the AppStore as one of the best.  IPhone users download this utility most often.  It's all about the large number of channels provided for viewing.  There are about 130 of them in Yunosov. However, it is worth noting that some of them require paid subscriptions.  Another plus is the competent distribution of channels by category.  There is a TV channel program. </p><p>  Although this application looks decent, among the disadvantages it is worth noting the price of the application.  It is not free and costs 429 rubles (as of 2018, so the current price may be outdated).  However, this price is offset by the lack of ongoing advertising or offers to subscribe to some paid content or a separate channel.  The application is recommended for use if the user of the iPhone has the opportunity to pay for it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Crystal TV + app </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidout.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to watch tv on an iPhone through the application" class="if uuid-2959787" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2959787.jpg"></div><p>  To watch TV on your iPhone for free, you can download Crystal TV +.  This is a free app.  For this reason, Crystal TV + is particularly popular among iPhone users. </p><p>  But in addition to the above advantages, the following can be attributed to the pluses: </p><ul><li>  the ability to increase the volume while viewing inside the application, as well as adjust the brightness of the broadcast image; </li><li>  in parallel, you can watch the broadcast of one channel and view what is shown on others. </li></ul><p>  Cons of the Crysral TV + application: </p><ul><li>  a small number of channels for free; </li><li>  the need for a subscription to view most of the proposed channels (169 rubles per month as of 2018); </li><li>  In the free version, an advertisement often pops up and an offer to subscribe to the paid version of the application. </li></ul><p>  Despite a number of shortcomings, many users are quite happy with the free version of Crystal TV +. </p><h2>  Tviz service: description and features </h2><p>  This application provides the ability to view more than twenty channels for free.  Paid downloads and monthly subscription fees include about 200 channels. </p><p>  The peculiarity is the fact that the channels can only be watched live, as expected from the broadcast.  That is, in this application there is no function of rewinding the air or pause during the broadcast. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="yablyk.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="twez application" class="if uuid-2959790" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2959790.jpg"></div><p>  The cost of subscribing to all provided TV channels is 229 rubles or 29 rubles per month (information may be outdated as of 2018). </p><p>  The application itself can not but rejoice with its number of available channels on a paid basis.  However, in the free version, ads and offers for a paid subscription systematically pop up, which makes it difficult to enjoy watching TV in full. </p><h2>  Peers.TV application </h2><p>  How to watch TV on an iPhone?  Through the application, it is possible to use 80 channels for a fee and 30 channels for free.  The program has become quite popular among the likes. </p><p>  This application is made popular by the ability to save the broadcast you‚Äôve watched and add it to your Favorites. </p><p>  Peers.TV provides two paid options.  One of them costs 59 rubles a month.  At the same time, it will be possible to choose five paid channels and a complete lack of advertising.  Another way for this payment also allows you to open all paid channels, but at the same time, advertising does not go anywhere.  She will systematically pop up. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hi-news.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="watching tv on iphone" class="if uuid-2959793" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2959793.jpg"></div><h2>  Pros and cons of this application </h2><p>  Pros of Peers.TV: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  the ability to add broadcasts to the "Favorites" (save broadcasts); </li><li>  80 paid channels, with the ability to choose what to pay for (all paid channels or 5 paid and the complete lack of advertising); </li><li>  saving a movie for viewing without the Internet. </li></ul><p>  Cons Peers.TV: </p><ul><li>  with free downloads numerous advertisements; </li><li>  paid version costs 59 rubles per month. </li></ul><h2>  Lime HD TV app </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.ihelplounge.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how can i watch tv on iphone" class="if uuid-2959783" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2959783.jpg"></div><p>  Lime HD TV is a good app to watch TV on your iPhone.

It includes more than 100 channels, of which about 80 are provided for free. </p><p>  A huge base of both TV channels and films in general allows SPB TV Russia to be brought to the forefront compared to other similar applications. </p><p>  Those who want to watch TV on an iPhone should pay attention to this utility.  Since it has a lot of advantages, namely: </p><ul><li>  a large number of free channels (about 80); </li><li>  the ability to record broadcasts; </li><li>  the ability to watch movies separately from TV broadcasts; </li><li>  the ability to connect a file cabinet and disable ads at the same time for 99 rubles per month; </li><li>  large file cabinet of films and series. </li></ul><p>  Cons of SPB TV Russia: </p><ul><li>  the free version has a huge amount of advertising, </li><li>  the cost of connecting a file cabinet and turning off advertising (99 rubles per month). </li><li>  the cost of full functionality (of all channels, a cinema hall and disabling of advertising) is 250 rubles per month. </li></ul><p>  This application is well suited for fans to see something interesting, but who do not know what to choose.  A movie library will provide a good choice for every taste and color.  Everyone here will find everything that their heart desires, for 250 rubles a month. </p><h2>  TV + application </h2><p>  TV + is a great app for those who want to watch TV via iPhone.  It is intended for use only by the iOS system.  That is, looking for this application in the Play Market is useless.  It is exclusively in the AppStore.  The application can be used on all Apple devices. </p><p>  Advantages of the program: </p><ul><li>  free use of this application; </li><li>  the ability to control the volume and brightness of the transmitted image inside the application. </li></ul><p>  Cons of TV +: </p><ul><li>  only Russian TV channels; </li><li>  applies only to the territory of the Russian Federation. </li></ul><p>  For residents of the Russian Federation, this is a very profitable application to watch TV online on an iPhone. </p><h2>  Application "Yandex.Telemarket" </h2><p>  This application is used only in web-mode (via PC).  If you use an iPhone, you can use the Yandex.Telemarket online service.  This is not an application.  You can use it through any browser installed on your iPhone. </p><p>  Pros: the availability of all channels of this online resource.

However, there is an exception - this is the TV + application.  There you can watch all the content for free, but only within the territory of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  In all other cases, it is necessary to purchase paid versions of the application so that you do not get constantly pop-up ads while watching your favorite show.  There are applications that include movie theaters. </p>
