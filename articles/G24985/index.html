  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DIY make-up</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Most girls can go over their wardrobe for hours.  Often things are drawn out from the depths of the closet, which are a year, two, and some even more.  And then the global question arises of what to do with a long-forgotten thing?  It‚Äôs a pity to throw it away, it‚Äôs already unfashionable to wear.  In this case, fantasy and dexterity come to the rescue.  Stylish alterations of clothes with their own hands help to save money, as well as become noticeable in the crowd. </p><p>  Well, when a thing has retained its original appearance.  Worse if your favorite shirt or shorts have a greasy stain or a gaping hole.  In such cases, do not panic ahead of time: you can save everything, well, or almost everything. </p><p>  But first, you need to draw up a small algorithm of actions and consider options for remaking clothes and their decor. </p><h2>  Assessment of the scale of the tragedy </h2><p>  Option one: a blouse dear to the heart is found at the very bottom of the cabinet.  To return to life, it is enough to arrange washing, ironing.  After these procedures, answer your question, do you need to remake old clothes in stylish clothes with your own hands or are you ready to wear it in this form?  If the last option is selected, then the task is completed - and the blouse is ready for a walk.  If you decide to completely transform the thing, choose a decoration method. </p><p>  Option two: washing did not help remove stains on the fabric.  It‚Äôs especially a shame if you managed to use the thing a couple of times.  But there are no hopeless situations - clothing decor will help.  Which one depends on the size of the problem areas. </p><p>  The third option: holes on clothes appear not only in children, adults are also not immune from this.  Have you ever had such situations: bought a new branded item, just put it on and - is there a nail that just destroyed the new thing?  In this case, several ideas will help to remake clothes into a more stylish one.  Just a little time and effort - and again you are irresistible. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Even if you only have buttons or a flap from your pocket, you can even find use for them. </p><h2>  Do-it-yourself magical ways to make clothes </h2><p>  Unfortunately, there is no magic wand with a wave of which the old thing will turn into a new one.  You will create magic and magic yourself.  Most likely, it will be necessary to visit a specialized store of accessories and <span>sewing supplies.</span> </p><p>  The main methods of decorating and transforming are the following: </p><ul><li>  drawings on clothes; </li><li>  decoration with rhinestones; </li><li>  sewn sequins; </li><li>  embroidery; </li><li>  decorative patches; </li><li>  thermal stickers; </li><li>  cutting stylized holes; </li><li>  combining two or more wardrobe items into one new one; </li><li>  changing the length of clothing items. </li></ul><p>  Before choosing the appropriate option, it is better to familiarize yourself with existing ones.  Perhaps some finished work will lead you to the right thought and help to realize the <span>idea of ‚Äã‚Äãremaking clothes with your own hands.</span> </p><h2>  Brush is your main weapon </h2><p>  Just as an artist creates his canvases with oil paints on canvas, so you are able to create a work of art on clothes. </p><p>  The main difference is the type of paint.  Oil ones are not suitable, special acrylic ones are needed to keep well on the fabric.  It is best to draw on clothes that are not stretched (for example, jeans, thick cotton).  If you arrange art experiments on stretching textiles, then you may encounter the problem of a cracked pattern.  Acrylic paint, when it dries, turns into a thin film.  Therefore, deformations are extremely undesirable for her. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  So, paints and brushes of the right size were bought, a glass of water at hand, clothes (suppose these will be jeans) are washed, ironed and the workplace is prepared.  Drawing for drawing in your head, printed or painted on a sheet. </p><p>  But, before grabbing the brushes, it is best to use a chalk or pencil to mark the fabric, contrasting in color with the fabric.  In order not to spoil the thing, it is better to apply, it is possible and schematically, the image in chalk: firstly, it will be possible to correctly and beautifully arrange the composition, secondly, to check that there is enough space for everything (and then suddenly the most beautiful part of the pattern does not fit on the width of the leg), thirdly, you will have time to fix and redraw something. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="pencil outline" class="if uuid-2428313" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80783/2428313.jpg"></div><p>  Since the pencil is easily washed off, the next step is drawing the contours of the drawing.  And now you can safely do your own artistic entertainment. </p><p>  A feature of acrylic paints on textiles is that they dye their threads with their pigment.  Therefore, it is best to try to make as few layers as possible in the drawing.  Then the drawing will live much longer. </p><p>  An acrylic lacquer is used as the final fixing of the image.  On sale you can find two types: matte and glossy finish.  An interesting result is obtained by combining them: select some details of the picture with a shiny surface (gloss), and create others with a matte surface. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="combination of matte and glossy varnish" class="if uuid-2429856" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80783/2429856.jpg"></div><p>  After completing the drawing process, all your work of art on fabric is fixed with a regular iron.  And, most importantly, carefully read the instructions to correctly observe the intervals between all stages of work, set the desired temperature when ironing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="pastel drawing" class="if uuid-2428311" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80783/2428311.jpg"></div><p>  Remaking clothes from old to stylish is a fascinating and not very difficult process.  In order for the designer thing to last longer, it is important to wash it at an acceptable temperature, not to wrinkle too much (fraught with a cracked pattern). </p><p>  In addition to paints, there are many other art materials: felt-tip pens and pencils on the fabric (perfect for small and clear drawings), pastel (after fixing with an iron, the brightness disappears and the impression of a translucent drawing appears), contours, crayons and many others.  So it‚Äôs possible to unleash all your artistic potential. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="pastel for fabric" class="if uuid-2428312" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80783/2428312.jpg"></div><p>  This way of decorating clothes is perfect if you want to update the design or hide inappropriate stains that are not displayed. </p><h2>  Girls like stars </h2><p>  It's no secret that the female gender likes to adorn absolutely everything with shiny rhinestones: phone cases, nails, hair clips, used in makeup, dressing. </p><p>  About the last option a little more.  Unfortunately, it is not always possible to buy a thing you like with a stylish pattern.  Either too expensive, or the right size is not available. </p><p>  In this case, do not panic.  Let's <span>rework old clothes.</span>  <span>So</span> get your magic hands out of your pockets and go to the store for a tool. </p><p>  For a wonderful transformation we need: </p><ul><li>  A sketch of a future drawing. </li><li>  Rhinestones of the right size, shape and color.  The required amount must be calculated in advance independently. </li><li>  Glue gun. </li><li>  Glue sticks.  It‚Äôs better not to save on this material.  The easiest way is to go to a hardware store and pick up quality rods of a suitable diameter there. </li><li>  Pencil for fabric. </li><li>  Tweezers. </li><li>  Little scissors. </li></ul><p>  Having collected all the necessary materials and tools on the desktop, preparing clothes, you can sit down and start creating. </p><p>  The first step is to transfer the sketch to the clothes.  To do this, use chalk or a pencil.  If you doubt your eye, then you can mark the place for rhinestones.  Firstly, if desired, it will be possible to change the frequency with which you will be glued, and secondly, the latter will be placed beautifully and evenly. </p><p>  The next step is the realization of a dream in reality.  For convenience, you can use tweezers.  Apply a drop of glue to the fabric, grasp the strazik with tweezers and quickly and accurately apply and press it to the right place in the composition. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lookwhatmelissamade.blogspot.com.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="T-shirt with rhinestones" class="if uuid-2431581" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80783/2431581.jpg"></div><p>  The picture is ready, you enjoy the result of remaking clothes, a new thing looks just amazing!  The final and final touch is the removal of excess glue with scissors.  Of course, if nothing went beyond the previously defined boundaries, then you can safely skip this step. </p><p>  This way of decorating is suitable for those cases when you need to refresh clothes with new details.  Given the size and shape of the rhinestone and the composition of the pattern, it is possible to successfully cover small defects on the fabric. </p><h2>  One, two, three and - done </h2><p>  The ability to create holes on clothes in the most unexpected places is inherent not only to small children, but also often found in adults (who said that after thirty it is impossible to climb fences?).  And if a thing is very dear to you, it becomes very disappointing. </p><p>  The easiest and most universal way to hide traces on a damaged item is to sew a hole and hide the traces under a decorative sticker or patch. </p><p>  You can use a purchased applique or make yourself a suitable fabric from a flap. </p><p>  In the first case, you only need to attach the thermal sticker to the right place and gently fix it with an iron. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="thermal stickers on clothes" class="if uuid-2428354" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80783/2428354.jpg"></div><p>  Sometimes you can find applications without glue.  In this case, as with a home-made patch, you use the power of your skillful hands and sew the jewelry in the right place with the exact same stitches. </p><p>  The good news is that such alteration of clothes takes extremely little time and resources. </p><h2>  Dragon Scales? </h2><p>  Sequins are most often used for decoration.  They give a festive look to a dress or jacket.  They can close any area on clothes, until the complete transformation of the thing into a solid scale of sequins. </p><p>  With the right and harmonious combination with everyday clothes, this decoration is suitable for daily wear. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ourlifeisbeautiful.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mischievous sequins" class="if uuid-2429842" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80783/2429842.jpg"></div><p>  Sequins are sewn onto the fabric one at a time with threads, gradually filling out the necessary pattern.  Under this decor, you can hide any imperfections of old clothes.  Remaking, of course, takes a lot of time, requires painstaking and patience, but all your efforts will pay off with interest. </p><h2>  No hoops needed </h2><p>  The next option to update clothes will help to hide spots, holes and other troubles of any scale. </p><p>  Embroidery is an ancient art, it is not one hundred years old.  However, new techniques continue to emerge.  If there used to be a cross in fashion, now paintings are created by satin stitch, various kinds of knots, mouline thread or ribbons can be used.  This needlework has many subspecies, masters do not cease to amaze with something new, unusual. </p><p>  Embroidered patterns on clothes look attractive, help to make the thing original.  To facilitate your work, various types of canvases are presented in stores in a wide assortment, including water-soluble.  This is ideal for <span>remaking clothes.</span> </p><p>  Tools and materials you need: </p><ul><li>  A thing to remake. </li><li>  Threads for embroidery (silk, satin, wool) or ribbons.  This is at your discretion. </li><li>  Needles for embroidery.  They need to be selected depending on the thickness and density of the material. </li><li>  Scissors to remove excess and tail of thread. </li><li>  A suitable canvas, although you can choose the option "by eye". <div class="photo" data-original="scoutmob.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="T-shirt embroidery" class="if uuid-2428366" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80783/2428366.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  You can choose any pattern or picture you like.  If there is no suitable scheme, then you can use one of the many programs to create it from a photograph or drawing. </p><h2>  Tear and wipe </h2><p>  Shabby and ripped jeans are not necessarily old.  In most cases, this was done intentionally in order to look stylish.  The fashion for this design technique has not disappeared for many years, and the methods are only being improved.  If your parents used bricks or machine tools, today they use almost any suitable tool. </p><p>  Now it‚Äôs easy to find information about what abrasions or holes are obtained with the help of one or another object (just some kind of hole encyclopedia). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="worn jeans" class="if uuid-2428374" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80783/2428374.jpg"></div><p>  So for the modification of things there is no strictly designated list of tools.  Go ahead, and your imagination and creativity will help you! </p><p>  After creating new holes on the fabric, they can be decorated with any improvised materials: all kinds of pins, hairpins, buttons of an unusual shape, original beads, rhinestones and so on. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="rework with holes" class="if uuid-2432185" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45860/2432185.jpg"></div><p>  This method of clothing alteration is suitable in order to hide, on a general background, gaps already obtained at random. </p><h2>  Lightweight fabric for summer </h2><p>  Remember the phrase from the notorious movie: ‚ÄúAnd the trousers turn ...‚Äù? </p><p>  Grab a pair of scissors, an unnecessary or damaged item and cut off all unnecessary items.  This is not a joke, it is a great way to update your wardrobe.  To fill your hand, you can first practice on what is not a pity to spoil. </p><p>  Pants will turn into shorts, a maxi-length skirt in a miniskirt or midi, a shirt will become a sleeveless jacket. </p><p>  It is not worth throwing off the cut off parts of clothes, they can be used for the next version of the do-it-yourself clothing modification. </p><div class="photo" data-original="look-what-i-made.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="from a shirt to a backpack" class="if uuid-2428319" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80783/2428319.jpg"></div><h2>  Alteration of clothes from the old two </h2><p>  An old friend is better than two new ones.  And in our case, this saying will sound like this: the old two are better in the new one.  This advice is perfect for lovers of sewing and tailoring.  Take out the remnants of things from the previous alteration, take new ones and lay them around you to assess the possibilities. </p><p>  This method is somewhat reminiscent of the creation of Frankenstein. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="combining several things" class="if uuid-2428383" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80783/2428383.jpg"></div><p>  Sleeves from one shirt (or one from different), a collar from another, a back cut out of jeans trousers ... Well and so on with the same enthusiasm. </p><p>  If you catch the point and clearly understand the main goal of such a project, then soon all your friends will obviously be envious of your stylish new things.  And now it will be often! </p>
