All account transactions from the card are confirmed by an SMS password from number 900. But sometimes a one-time Sberbank password does not come for payment.  What to do in this case? </p><h2>  Reasons for Delayed Notifications </h2><p>  300 seconds are allocated to the client of Sberbank to confirm payment of cellular communications, the Internet, a communal apartment and other payments in the Internet bank.  During this time, the cardholder must receive a notification from 900. But sometimes the one-time password of Sberbank does not come.  And this may be due to: </p><ul><li>  Incorrect binding of the Mobile Bank. </li><li>  System crash. </li><li>  The virus. </li><li>  The lack of free memory space for SMS on the phone. </li><li>  Change of operator. </li><li>  Delay in receiving a message. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.sberbank.rs" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="why do not one-time passwords come from sberbank" class="if uuid-2960268" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2960268.jpg"></div><p>  These are the most common reasons why a one-time password from Sberbank does not come.  If the cardholder is faced with one of these problems, do not worry - the situation can be corrected in a few minutes. </p><h2>  Mobile Banking Errors </h2><p>  To confirm operations in Sberbank Online, it is not necessary to connect the full Mobile Bank service package.  SMS with a code from 900 come even with an economical tariff without a monthly fee. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But if the client has connected the full tariff, then in the absence of funds on the card after payment for the service, the card may "go into the red", and the "Mobile Bank" will be blocked.  This may cause the lack of a confirmation code via SMS. </p><p>  In this case, you should deposit money in the amount of the debt (or a little more) so that SMS notifications become active again.  The service is automatically unlocked no later than 24 hours from the moment of depositing funds. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.iotgadgets.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank one-time password does not come for payment" class="if uuid-2960286" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2960286.jpg"></div><p>  Another reason why one-time passwords from Sberbank do not come may be a change in the Mobile Bank number.  If the client has connected a new phone number to the card, the service may work with a delay of one day from the moment of binding.  It is recommended to wait for an SMS that the new "Mobile Bank" has been successfully connected to the card in order to continue payment in the Internet bank. </p><h2>  Crash in the Sberbank Online system </h2><p>  Despite the security and prevalence, sometimes even a bank like Sberbank may experience malfunctions in some programs.  And Sberbank Online is no exception.  If SMS passwords do not come due to technical problems, it is recommended to wait with the payment. </p><p>  Otherwise, the operation may ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù, and the money debited from the card will remain in one of the company's correspondent accounts.  If a client is faced with such a situation, he should immediately contact the bank office or Contact Center by calling 900. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Sometimes the reason why Sberbank's one-time passwords do not come is due to a general failure.  In this case, problems may arise, including when using terminals or other services (mobile application, for example). </p><h2>  Virus and its impact on Internet banking </h2><p>  Computer scammers are constantly developing their skills and programs, making life difficult for cardholders as well.  Viruses can now spread not only in computers and laptops, now they interfere with the work of smartphones. </p><p>  With one of these ill-wishers, phone malfunctions can start in programs that often lead to the theft of customer data or funds from cards.  To avoid this, you should install an antivirus. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kamatica.rs" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="one-time passwords from Sberbank do not come" class="if uuid-2960274" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2960274.jpg"></div><p>  The mobile version of Sberbank Online has a built-in antivirus, but this is not a 100% guarantee of security when working in the Internet bank. </p><h2>  Lack of memory in the phone tied to the card </h2><p>  One of the common reasons why a one-time Sberbank password does not come for payment is the overfilled phone memory.  To solve the problem, it is enough to delete unnecessary SMS notifications so that a message from 900 appears in the "New" or "Unread" folder. </p><p>  But when deleting, you should carefully select files for cleaning: you can accidentally move a new message, in which there will be a treasured password for payment.  If this still happened, you should order a re-password in Sberbank Online.  It will also be valid for 300 seconds after sending. </p><h2>  Change mobile operator </h2><p>  If the client is not satisfied with his tariff plan and operator, he can choose another, more advantageous offer, keeping his previous number.  But the change of mobile operator does not always positively affect the operation of the Mobile Bank service. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.abbyy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="why does not the one-time password from Sberbank come" class="if uuid-2960282" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2960282.jpg"></div><p>  In 9 out of 10 clients, when switching to a different tariff plan and changing the mobile operator, there are no problems with using Internet banking.  But every 10th client is faced with the fact that he does not receive a one-time Sberbank password for payment and login. </p><p>  The first thing you can do in this situation is to call 900 and find out if the Mobile Bank service is active with this phone number.  If the service works, you need to wait 24 hours and try again to use the service.  In the event that the wait did not help, you should leave a statement to the Support Service to resume the work of the Mobile Bank. </p><p>  If the operator says that the service is disabled, then the second thing to do is re-enable notifications.  This can be done immediately during the conversation, in the terminal or office of the bank (with passport and card). </p><p>  If even reconnecting the service did not solve the problem with the arrival of notifications, then perhaps the reason is related to the mobile operator.  It is recommended to contact a new tariff provider to resolve the issue of SMS receipt.  To contact you should bring your passport and mobile phone. </p><h2>  Delay in receiving SMS: what to do? </h2><p>  Sometimes the reason why Sberbank‚Äôs one-time password does not come for payment is not due to the absence of it as such, but to a delay.  The client is given no more than 5 minutes to process the request and confirm the operation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.banjaluka.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank one-time password does not come for payment" class="if uuid-2960235" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2960235.jpg"></div><p>  If during this time the cardholder has not responded with a code from SMS, the operation will be in the "Draft" status.  The delay in receiving SMS is most often associated with a temporary malfunction.  In this case, you should wait until the time for confirmation of the operation expires (300 seconds), and then again send a request for confirmation. </p><p>  Repeated notification arrives much faster: the client can see the coveted SMS in 30 seconds.  If this does not help, you need to restart your cell phone and log into the Sberbank Online system, and then try again. </p>
