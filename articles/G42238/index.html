This is a shared, partially shared, or split budget.  The classic version of the distribution of funds in many families of our country is general family money.  This system assumes that all earned funds are stored with one of the spouses, he is also responsible for their distribution and spending.  Most often, with such a budget organization, the wife manages the money.  The main disadvantage of this option is the increased liability (for the distribution of funds) of one of the spouses.  At the same time, most of the most part of household duties falls on the shoulders of the person who controls cash flows.  A separate budget is often chosen by young couples.  In this case, each of the spouses manages their personal income, while allocating a part for general needs.  The option is not bad, but only if both husband and wife work and have a stable income.  The most democratic form of the family budget: partially general.  There are two varieties of it.  In the first case, the majority of the money earned by the spouses is added to the general piggy bank and spent in accordance with the needs of the family.  At the same time, everyone has enough finances in their personal management.  In the second case, the largest of the spouses' salaries is spent on basic household expenses.  The money earned by the second of the pair (lower salary) is postponed.  Both options are a very suitable basis for sound financial planning.  How to conduct home accounting, who should manage the money in the family?  Each couple should find the answer to this question directly for themselves.  All of the home budget options described above are acceptable and have a right to exist.

It all depends on your lifestyle and personal preferences.  The classic format is ledger.  This is a notebook, notebook or barn book, previously lined up for the number of expense items.  In this case, the budget is filled in by hand.  You will need pens (it is more convenient to use at least 2 colors).  It is useful to keep your ledger together with a calculator for simplicity and speed of calculation.

The first rule is regularity.  Record all expenses regularly.  Not all of us have the opportunity to fill out financial tables daily.  However, at least once every 2 days to do this is necessary.  If you keep records less often, you will most likely forget a significant portion of the minor expenses.  Specialists in financial planning recommend not to miss a single trifle.  Often such "small" expenses, such as paying for public transport, ice cream and coffee on the way home, make up a significant part of any expense item.

All funds received by family members are recorded here.  These are salaries, social benefits, interest on investments.  Do not forget about one-time income.

Even if you won the lottery or accidentally found a bill in the street, be sure to write down the amount received in the income section.  It turns out that all <span>sources of income</span> can be divided into stable and one-time.  Of course, financial planning should be based on the first category.

    <h2>  Main expense items </h2><p>  The most significant expense item is monthly payments.  Each independent person pays monthly utility bills, Internet and telephony, education.  Usually these are fixed amounts.  If we conduct home bookkeeping, all regular monthly payments can be made out in one column.  Many modern people spend personal finances on additional education or self-development.  Should I include in the monthly payments section the cost of a subscription to a fitness center or language courses?  If there are no more than 3 items of such expenses, it is logical to write them in the same section.  With more paid educational services, it makes sense to put them in a separate column.  The next extensive section of the home budget is food.  How many total columns should be in the table, how to conduct home accounting correctly?  It all depends on the needs and habits of the family.  Standard expenses for most items: home, clothes, household chemicals, medicines, entertainment, hobbies, gifts.  If the family has children or pets, for each of them it is also possible to allocate a separate section of expenses.  How many total sections should your budget have, you will understand as soon as you start to keep it.  Do not forget to make the column ‚ÄúMiscellaneous‚Äù.  It will be possible to record in it all forgotten expenses, as well as expenses that are not amenable to the selected classification. </p><h2>  Will the home budget fit? </h2>

Most of our compatriots, unknowingly related to the <span>home economy,</span> can only name the amounts of monthly payments with confidence.  And this is already important data for analysis.  If utility bills and other mandatory monthly contributions exceed half the family‚Äôs income, this is an occasion to think about finding a part-time job or changing your main job.  In cases where this is not possible, you should try to apply for subsidies.  For many categories of beneficiaries, social discounts are provided for paying for utilities and children's education.  Be sure to regularly summarize the budget and analyze the rationality of spending.  You already know how to do home bookkeeping.  A PC program designed to control personal expenses can read all entered data in an automated mode.  If you keep your home budget in a notebook, you will have to use a calculator.

How to save without compromising the quality of life?  One of the extensive items of expenditure is food.  It‚Äôs really possible to save on food if you always draw up a sample menu and lists of necessary purchases in advance.  Compare prices in various stores, make purchases at wholesale bases.  You can also save money on purchasing clothes by visiting seasonal sales and giving preference to things from past collections.  Try to refuse impulsive purchases, try to plan in advance each trip to the store.
