Some people use such property for personal convenience, while someone helps cars make money.  In any case, the presence of TS is not only positive aspects, but also costs.  For example, for maintenance and repair.  Also, a citizen has to pay a capacity tax annually.  It is called transport.  It will be discussed about him further.  Unfortunately, many people experience serious difficulties in the process of payment and calculation of the corresponding tax charge.  If you carefully study the current legislation, you can quickly clarify the situation.  This is what we will do.  The information presented is useful for experienced car owners, beginners and those who are just thinking about buying a car. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pravo.moe" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Transport tax in Russia" class="if uuid-3183050" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3183050.jpg"></div><h2>  general characteristics </h2><p>  What is capacity tax?  In another way it is also called transport.  This is an annual tax type accrual that relies on a person owning a device for transporting people or goods on roads, subject to mandatory registration with authorized bodies. </p><p>  Some types of vehicles are exempt from taxation, but there are not many.  We will talk about such benefits later.  First, we will generally examine the corresponding tax. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is of an annual nature, and is regulated by the regional government.  This leads to the fact that for the same transport in different cities you have to pay differently. </p><h2>  Why is it called capacity tax? </h2><p>  Some people wonder why the transport tax is also called "engine power."  There is a logical explanation for this. </p><p>  The thing is that the tax rate on cars directly depends on the capacity of the vehicle engine.  The larger it is, the higher the bet will be.  There is nothing difficult or incomprehensible in this. </p><p>  True, tax rates in all regions will be different.  Moreover, they are reviewed annually.  Therefore, more accurate information according to the data for calculating tax on vehicles will have to be specified in a particular city separately. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bankrate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Auto tax - how much to pay" class="if uuid-3183057" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3183057.jpg"></div><h2>  How to count - collect data </h2><p>  Calculation of the engine power tax is not as difficult as it seems.  The main thing is to properly prepare for the corresponding process.  Only then will a person have no problems. </p><p>  To achieve the desired result, you need to get some information about the transport and its owner.  Otherwise, the calculations will become unrealistic.  And this is quite normal. </p><p>  At the moment, in order to successfully calculate the tax on vehicle power, it is necessary to clarify: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__0-vn-module__46o"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__1-vn-module__46o"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__2-vn-module__46o"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__3-vn-module__46o"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__4-vn-module__46o"></div></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  car engine power; </li><li>  tax rate for the selected transport; </li><li>  the value of the corresponding movable object; </li><li>  vehicle year of manufacture; </li><li>  place of registration of transport; </li><li>  number of months of car ownership (per calendar year). </li></ul><p>  Also, in some cases, it is recommended to clarify the so-called increase coefficient.  It is required if the car owned is recognized as luxurious.  This will also be described below. </p><h2>  Registration of the owner and registration of transport </h2><p>  How does engine power affect vehicle tax?  As a rule, the more powerful the car, the higher its horsepower will "cost".  This means that you will have to pay less for low-powered vehicles.  This is a completely logical phenomenon. </p><p>  Some are interested in what to do if the owner of a movable object is registered in one region and his car is registered in another?  How to calculate auto tax under similar circumstances? </p><div class="photo" data-original="pro-pensionerov.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Calculation of engine power tax" class="if uuid-3183051" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3183051.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, it is better that the registration of the owner and the place of registration of transport coincide.  Otherwise, tax accruals will be made at the rates of the region where the citizen registered the car.  Sometimes it is beneficial, sometimes not very. </p><h2>  The concept of luxury vehicle </h2><p>  The vehicle capacity tax, as already mentioned, can be calculated in different ways.  An important role is played by the cost of transport.  In some cases, cars owned by citizens and companies are recognized as elite.  They are subject to an improved formula for calculating tax on vehicles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Luxury cars are movable property of the corresponding type, the average cost of which is three million rubles or more.  It is important to remember that it is not the amount in the purchase agreement that is taken into account, but the producer price. </p><p>  From year to year, the list of elite vehicles is revised by the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Thus, sometimes ordinary cars fall into it, the cost of which simply reaches the indicator indicated earlier.  At the moment, a jump in the dollar exchange rate led to this phenomenon. </p><h2>  Power rate </h2><p>  Interested in auto tax?  The vehicle power scale in Russia, together with the tax rates in Moscow for 2018, is presented below.  This is just a good example that helps to understand the relationship between the power of cars and tax rates. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ppt.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Engine power and tax rate table" class="if uuid-3183055" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3183055.jpg"></div><p>  The corresponding list, as already mentioned, in each region will be its own.  And he is revised from year to year.  As a rule, capacity tax rates go up. </p><h2>  About ratios </h2><p>  As already mentioned, sometimes to calculate the tax on vehicles it is necessary to clarify the increase coefficient.  This is a special indicator that helps to increase the tax charge for luxury cars. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.zarplata-online.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Increasing ratios for luxury vehicles" class="if uuid-3183054" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3183054.jpg"></div><p>  It is formed by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.  Like the elite transport list, it is reviewed annually.  Therefore, the relevant data will have to be clarified along with tax rates in the tax authority of a particular city.  Otherwise, the owner of the car runs the risk of making a mistake in calculating the tax payable. </p><h2>  Formula for conventional transport </h2><p>  The tax rate on car power, as was emphasized earlier, depends on many factors.  It is installed in each region and differs from the capacity of transport.  These are the rules. </p><p>  Moreover, to find out what tax on engine power will have to pay in a given year, you can use different formulas.  Let's start with the most common scenario. </p><p>  We are talking about calculating the payment for an ordinary car, which is owned by an individual.  In order to cope with a similar task, you will need to perform the following mathematical steps: </p><ol><li>  Divide vehicle ownership months (per year) by 12. </li><li>  To multiply the tax rate by the number of "horses" in the engine. </li><li>  Multiply the first resulting digit by the second. </li></ol><p>  At this stage, the calculations can be completed.  A citizen will see how much he will have to pay for a particular car in the selected region.  But this is only one of several available formulas. </p><h2>  How to count the accrual for the elite? </h2><p>  The capacity tax in Russia, as has been said, is calculated differently.  We have already familiarized ourselves with one of several available formulas.  It is used in practice most often. </p><p>  It happens that a citizen owns an elite machine.  To calculate the tax on vehicles in this case, it is necessary to use an improved formula.  But which one? </p><p>  In order to achieve the desired result, you just need to multiply the amount obtained in the course of the above actions by the increase coefficient.  This will be the tax on the power of a luxury car. </p><div class="photo" data-original="viplawyer.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Auto tax formula" class="if uuid-3183052" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3183052.jpg"></div><h2>  If the owner is a legal entity </h2><p>  And there is another rather interesting solution to the problem.  True, in practice it is less common than the above formulas.  It's about calculating taxes on auto organizations. </p><p>  In this case, sometimes you have to try pretty hard.  The thing is that the calculation of the studied payment is possible in the course of the following actions: </p><ol><li>  Multiply the engine power of the facility by the tax rate. </li><li>  Multiply the resulting number with the share of the owner in the rights to the vehicle. </li><li>  Carry out a multiplication by the number of months of vehicle ownership per year, divided in advance by twelve. </li><li>  Multiply the corresponding figure with a multiplying factor (if necessary). </li><li>  From the resulting indicator, subtract privileges, as well as payments for "Plato." </li></ol><p>  That's all.  As practice shows, it is better not to calculate the tax on the TS of organizations and legal entities manually.  High probability of errors.  And they can lead to tax debts, which will not affect the company in the best way. </p><h2>  In automatic mode </h2><p>  Fortunately, a solution to almost any problem can be found pretty quickly.  Especially when it comes to calculating taxes in Russia.  And transport including. </p><p>  To quickly find out the size of the tax on a car by capacity, as well as save yourself from unnecessary problems with calculations, you can use specialized applications.  This includes working with online calculators.  These are services that calculate taxes according to data entered in a special form. </p><p>  You can find such resources on various information sites.  It is best to use a calculator from the Federal Tax Service of Russia.  This is the best, reliable and reliable solution. </p><p>  Do you want to calculate the tax on engine power in 190 "horses" or with another indicator?  Then it is recommended to act like this: </p><ol><li>  Go to the official website of the Federal Tax Service of the Russian Federation on the Internet.  The site "tax.ru" is implied. </li><li>  Switch to the Services tab. </li><li>  Click on the words "Tax calculator" in the menu that appears. </li><li>  Press the line "Transport tax". </li><li>  Carefully study the data entry form, and then indicate the requested information.  In the fields, as a rule, the place of registration of the vehicle is indicated, as well as the year of its release, capacity, time of ownership (per year) and available benefits, if any. </li><li>  Check the spelling of the information. </li><li>  Click with the mouse (cursor) on the button responsible for starting the calculation of the corresponding amount. </li></ol><p>  Then it remains only to wait.  After a few seconds, the system will perform the necessary mathematical operations, and then display the amount payable. </p><p>  Important: for safety reasons, it is recommended to check the amount of car tax directly with the tax authority. </p><h2>  Payment Dates </h2><p>  As soon as the tax rate on vehicle power, as well as other necessary information about the vehicle is known, everyone will be able to calculate the amount of tax payment.  This is not enough to avoid problems with the Federal Tax Service.  It is also necessary to make a payment on time.  But which ones? </p><p>  In 2019, citizens must transfer funds to the state treasury by December 1.  The very next day, a person will be considered a debtor, they will be able to apply some sanctions to punish him. </p><p>  Organizations have to pay until the fifth of February.  As in the case of individuals, the next day the organization will be considered in arrears.  This means that certain measures of influence may also be applied to it in order to recover funds. </p><p>  Important: in some cities there may be different dates for paying vehicle tax. </p><h2>  About privileges in the Russian Federation </h2><p>  The tax on car power, as was emphasized earlier, is not always paid.  Some vehicles are completely exempt from such accruals, and at the federal level.  What exactly can be attributed to the category of preferential transport in the Russian Federation? </p><p>  As a rule, you can not pay for boats with oars or with engine power up to 5 liters.  from.  Also, tax is not charged on state and agricultural transport.  For ships that are intended for the carriage of goods and transportation of passengers. </p><p>  Does a citizen have movable property in the form of a car with a capacity of up to 100 "horses"?  Then you can not pay for it, but only if one condition is met - transport must be purchased with the support of social services.  services. </p><p>  For cars of special services in Russia do not pay tax, as well as for ships that were entered in the Russian registry.  Cars specially equipped for the disabled are another category of preferential transport. </p><p>  In these cases, there is no need to specifically contact the Federal Tax Service for registration of benefits.  At the regional level in some cities, certain categories of citizens are exempted from taxes on vehicle power, or they are entitled to a discount of fifty to ninety percent of the amount accrued. </p><div class="photo" data-original="autocarinsurancecheap.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How does engine power affect tax" class="if uuid-3183056" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3183056.jpg"></div><h2>  If a debt has formed </h2><p>  Transport tax abolished or not?  This question is asked by the owners of the vehicle from year to year.  The reason for this is fake news about the abolition of the corresponding tax.  It has not been canceled and will not be canceled.  In the coming years for sure. </p><p>  What will happen if a person has delayed the relevant payment?  Will have to face certain sanctions.  They include: </p><ul><li>  charging interest from the first day of late payments; </li><li>  fine (20 percent of the debt in the absence of intent, otherwise - 40 percent); </li><li>  seizure of a person‚Äôs property and his bank accounts / cards; </li><li>  assignment of the status of travel abroad (ban on leaving the Russian Federation). </li></ul><p>  Moreover, the last two paragraphs apply when the debt case is referred to the bailiffs.  This can happen if the debt has reached three thousand rubles. </p><p>  Transport tax abolished or not?  If you want to prevent late payment and remain a bona fide taxpayer, you just need to clarify the information of interest in the local tax.  Only in this case will it be possible to avoid problems. </p>
