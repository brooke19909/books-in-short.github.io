Some of them are available at the hotel.  In particular, a cot can be delivered to the room upon request.  The restaurant has high chairs, and despite the lack of a special menu, you can easily pick up something really tasty and healthy for your child.  For entertainment, there is also a small section of the pool, which is spacious enough, but not too deep - children can have a great time here.  Mini-clubs and children's animation are not available on site.  Nevertheless, there are a lot of entertainment centers for children in the city, where you should definitely bring children. </p><h2>  Hotel Traveler Reviews </h2>
