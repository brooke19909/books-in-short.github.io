Smartphones, tablets and other gadgets began to take a lot of time, but at the same time they remain indispensable assistants.  Therefore, any damage to the device takes us by surprise.  And before running to the service center, everyone tries to figure out why the tablet does not turn on. </p><h2>  Tablets </h2><p>  This touchscreen device has long ceased to be an element of luxury.  No one brags about this gadget, because many have it, as needed. </p><p>  The first tablet personal computer was presented in 2002.  Already then, in addition to working with the stylus, the device allowed you to control your fingers.  16 years have passed since then.  Tablets have changed their appearance, have acquired a huge number of variations and modifications. </p><p>  Some may compete with desktop PCs.  Others are so beautiful that buyers buy them just for the sake of appearance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitaltrends.com" data-author=": Julian Chokkattu, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Work tablet" class="if uuid-2376698" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2376698.jpg"></div><p>  Since 2002, <span>tablet computers have</span> gotten rid of simple screens, weak systems, and memory shortages.  But they could not get rid of various breakdowns.  Why doesn‚Äôt the tablet turn on?  This question may still worry users. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Breakdown reasons </h2><p>  If suddenly you notice that your gadget has stopped turning on, do not immediately sound the alarm.  Unfortunately, few people succeed in creating the ideal device.  Maybe right away, or maybe after 5 years, various kinds of failures begin to occur with the gadget. </p><p>  Why doesn‚Äôt the tablet turn on?  The reasons for this problem are huge.  Some of them can really be solved only with the help of specialists in the service center.  But most failures can actually be fixed on their own.  It is important to be attentive to your gadget and be able to analyze its behavior. </p><p>  Usually, understanding this issue, experts say that the failure can be software or hardware.  Of course, in most cases the reason lies in these problems.  But there may be another matter. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ifixit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tablet repair" class="if uuid-2376666" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2376666.jpg"></div><p>  For example, you just forgot that you did not charge the tablet.  Naturally, due to the fact that it is completely discharged, it may not turn on even for the first few minutes.  It is possible that malfunctions are associated with physical damage.  Here, of course, nothing can be done independently.  And the question about why the Lenovo tablet does not turn on (for example) can only be answered by a specialist from the service center. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hardware Issues </h2><p>  It is easy to guess that in this case there are problems with one or more components of the tablet.  There is a possibility that one of the elements of the board is out of order.  The contacts may have burned out or the batteries may be damaged due to humidity. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lifewire.com" data-author=": Vickyanddiana, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tablet reboot" class="if uuid-2376671" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2376671.jpg"></div><p>  A hardware failure could cause the tablet to crash.  Especially if the device was built poorly.  In this case, not only the screen may break, but also the ‚Äúinside‚Äù of the device. </p><h2>  Solving hardware problems </h2><p>  Why the tablet does not turn on, experts in the service center will be able to say.  If you have a guarantee, and you understand that the cause of a hardware failure was not external influences on the device, then be sure to bring it in for repair.  There they will fix everything for free, and you will not need to think independently what to do with this problem. </p><p>  If there is no guarantee already, and the proper skills for repairing such devices are also missing, then again you will have to turn to specialists for help.  In this case, they will be able to think about how to fix a tablet that has fallen or is exposed to water. </p><p>  The only thing you need to be prepared for is that repairs can fly you a pretty penny.  If hardware failures are really serious, then many recommend selling a damaged gadget for parts, after adding money and buying a new one.  Sometimes repairs cost 50-100% of the cost of the tablet. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Perhaps you are a little versed in electronics, you can disassemble the device yourself and find the reasons for its breakdown.  But this is best not to do if it is still under warranty.  If you understand that you have nothing to lose, you can tinker with a soldering iron and a screwdriver yourself.  You may be able to restore the device‚Äôs performance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.techrepublic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tablet parsing" class="if uuid-2376664" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2376664.jpg"></div><h2>  Software issues </h2><p>  Here in such failures lies most of the causes of various errors.  This also includes problems in the operation of applications, disabling some functions and, of course, turning off the device. </p><p>  To begin with, many recommend putting the tablet on charge.  Sometimes a ‚Äúmiraculous resurrection‚Äù of the apparatus occurs.  Perhaps you have a problem with the device‚Äôs battery, which can quickly discharge and not respond to current for a long time.  You need to wait at least 10-15 minutes. </p><h2>  Charging problems </h2><p>  There may be a question about why the tablet does not turn on when charging.  In addition to the software component, the reason may be different.  For example, your charger just stopped working.  If possible, immediately check another charge.  If she started charging the tablet and the device turned on, then everything is in order with the gadget. </p><p>  There is also the option that the charging connector could get clogged with something or even be damaged.  Now this is rarely seen, unless, of course, the user monitors careful operation, and does not pull out the wire, and before the contacts were often destroyed, which led to similar errors. </p><p>  Next, you should check whether everything is normal with the supply of electricity, maybe you did not notice that the lights were turned off at home, and everyone is waiting for the tablet to turn on. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.anandtech.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Charger" class="if uuid-2376672" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2376672.jpg"></div><h2>  What to do? </h2><p>  When you figure out why the Samsung tablet or any other model does not turn on, you can try to fix the problem.  It is clear that if there is a problem with charging, we buy a new one.  If you notice that the connector is staggering, most likely you will have to carry the device to the service, because you yourself will not replace this element.  You will also need to consult a specialist if the tablet has received physical damage. </p><p>  But what to do if in this case the software component is to blame?  There is a possibility that the system firmware has flown or malicious utilities have got there.  Put the tablet on charge for 10-15 minutes.  After connect it to the computer. </p><p>  If the PC does not see the gadget, then definitely have to carry the tablet for repair.  If the system detects a connected device, it means that not everything is lost.  You can reflash the device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="oservice.ge" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Service center" class="if uuid-2376687" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2376687.jpg"></div><h2>  No answer </h2><p>  In addition to the above problem, some want to know why the tablet does not turn on and does not charge.  Again, the problem may be hiding in the charger.  Maybe it‚Äôs broken, and the tablet is dead, so nothing happens. </p><p>  If you are sure that the charger is working, there is electricity at home, then you are overtaken by problems with a software failure.  Put the device on charge, wait half an hour, and only then try turning it on.  There may be some problems with the battery, which has become weak and requires more time to charge. </p><h2>  Software solutions </h2><p>  Why doesn‚Äôt the Irbis tablet or other model turn on?  If you examined the gadget carefully and know for sure that there are no physical damages, you can try to "tweak" it with the software. </p><p>  Try rebooting your device.  Some tablet models have a separate Reset button.  More precisely, this function is implemented by a hole in which there is a small button.  To activate it, you can take a needle and gently hold Reset for 10 seconds. </p><p>  If there is no such option, you have to start the bootloader.  To do this, on almost all tablet models, you need to hold down the power key and the volume button up.  Recovery will boot.  This menu allows you not only to restart the device, but also to format it, and even reflash it. </p><p>  In this menu you need to select the Wipe data section.  To do this, use the volume rocker to move and the power button to select an option.  After that, you will need to confirm the action by clicking on Yes - Delete all user data. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.userguidemanualpdf.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Enable mode" class="if uuid-2376694" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2376694.jpg"></div><p>  In many ways, this operation is a panacea for all problems.  Even if, for example, you don‚Äôt know why Wi-Fi does not turn on on your tablet. </p><p>  By the way, if you have problems with turning on the wireless network, regular rebooting of the device very often helps.  If nothing happens, try deleting and reactivating your network.  Sometimes failures occur, not related to the device itself, but caused by the problems of the Internet provider. </p>
