    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  A number of negative aspects characterize such a resort institution as Alkionis Hotel 3 *.  Reviews note the following hotel flaws: </p><ul><li>  the hotel stands along the road, and therefore, if you open the window, the noise of passing cars may interfere with your vacation; </li><li>  go far enough to the sea (about 10 minutes), and along the way you will constantly encounter garbage cans; </li><li>  cramped rooms; </li><li>  the air conditioner in the room is installed directly above the head of the bed, and therefore, in order not to catch a cold, you have to turn it off at night, which makes it very stuffy; </li><li>  during registration, employees do not report almost anything about the hotel and its services, and there are no information sheets in the rooms; </li><li>  the cabinets inside are rather dirty, and their shelves are somehow sticky, and therefore things have to be kept in suitcases; </li><li>  for using the safe and refrigerator you have to pay 3 euros per day; </li><li>  constant interruptions with the supply of hot water; </li><li>  monotonous and not very hearty breakfasts; </li><li>  instead of juice, instant powder drinks are served in the dining room; </li><li>  there is practically no territory, and therefore in the evening you will not be able to walk around the hotel; </li><li>  too little entertainment that begins to bother after a couple of days; </li><li>  the beach is very dirty; </li><li>  the use of sun loungers and deck chairs at sea is paid; </li><li>  even for an additional fee, administrators refuse to extend their stay in the room, and therefore you have to wait outside the hotel or leave for the airport in advance; </li><li>  the pool is quite small, and therefore it will be crowded with a large number of guests; </li><li>  washed bedding, which contains holes and patches; </li><li>  the windows outside are unwashed, and therefore stains spoil the beautiful mountain landscape; </li><li>  the hotel has total savings on hygiene items; </li><li>  there are a lot of mosquitoes in the hotel, and guests are not given any means to deal with them (you have to buy everything yourself); </li><li>  old creaky beds with bulging mattresses; </li><li>  every day they delay dinner for about half an hour, but close the restaurant on schedule; </li><li>  rarely change bath towels and linen; </li><li>  cracked tiles in the bathroom; </li><li>  TV does not work well; </li><li>  if the room is located next to the kitchen, then it will always have a steady smell of food; </li><li>  when booking you can not choose a specific room, but only a category; </li><li>  the bathroom door creaks unpleasantly; </li><li>  the restaurant does not have wireless internet; </li><li>  there is a lot of greenery on the territory, but this is somewhat offset by the large number of plantings around; </li><li>  poor wireless internet signal (moreover, it does not always work). </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Despite the dilapidated atmosphere and many other shortcomings, this hotel has a unique charm.  This is largely due to the location surrounded by mountains covered with greenery.  Neither luxury in the interior, nor high standards of service from this institution should be expected.  Rather, it is a good place for an overnight stay, which is chosen by active tourists who are used to spending most of the time on excursions.  Due to the almost complete lack of entertainment in this hotel, you can rarely meet young people. </p>
