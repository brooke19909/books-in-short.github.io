  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Choosing the right sports heart rate monitor is not easy.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you are engaged in sports exercises for your own health or maintaining your body in good physical shape, then you just need a sports heart rate monitor.  Especially if you have limitations on the number of loads that you can load your body. </p><p>  And then you go to a sports store or look in the online store for a product called: <noindex>  <span>sports heart rate monitor</span> </noindex>  .  But most likely you will encounter the problem of a variety of models of products, as well as a big difference in price between the individual representatives of this device. </p><p>  Therefore, let's consider the criteria that will help you determine which sports heart rate monitor to buy for you.  First, you need to decide for what purpose you need a heart rate monitor.  Based on this, you can choose a product that will satisfy all your requirements, and will not pay extra money.  And secondly, a lot will depend on the amount you are willing to pay for this device. </p><p>  If you need to control only the pulse, so as not to overdo it with physical activity, and constantly monitor its frequency, then an ordinary cheap heart rate monitor, which is worn on the arm and looks like a regular watch, will be enough.  The cost of such a device is not great, but I wanted to warn you against buying goods of an unknown manufacturer, since such a heart rate monitor usually has a large error in determining the heart rate, and it will serve somewhere around the year exactly for the warranty period.  Products of well-known manufacturers last about five years, and the accuracy of determining the pulse is much higher.  Although their cost will be higher.  Typically, such instances have an audible alarm, a sharp increase in heart rate, which gives you the ability to control the situation. </p><p>  The more expensive and advanced heart rate monitor has a GPS module, it easily interfaces with a computer in order to dump training data on it.  In such versions of the heart rate monitor, a sensor is also used, which is put on the chest in the form of a rubber belt.  What does it give?  Such a heart rate monitor is practically no different from a mini computer and provides a lot of useful information that may be useful to you.  What kind of information can this be: </p><ol><li>  Training time </li><li>  The distance you covered from the start of your workout. </li><li>  Counting the calories you burned during your workout. </li><li>  The history of your workouts. </li><li>  Fitness test. </li></ol><p>  Of course, there is still a lot of different information that may be present in various models produced by various manufacturers.  But it is very important to decide whether such information is somewhat necessary for you, and accordingly, whether you need to overpay for such information, or whether you can do with a simpler model. </p></div></article>
