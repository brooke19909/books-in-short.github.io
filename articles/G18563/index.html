It has no offices, customer service is conducted through the World Wide Web and by phone.  You can find out the balance of the Tinkoff card, as well as other information, using the usual means of communication.  There are several ways, and they are all quite simple. </p><h2>  Short Message Service </h2><p>  The method is suitable for those cases when there is no Internet access.  Immediately it is worth noting that the service is paid, the cost, as for a regular SMS message at the tariffs of the operator. </p><p>  Description of how to find out the balance of the Tinkoff card by SMS: </p><ul><li>  You must send a message to the short number 2273. SMS is sent from the phone number that is attached to the card. </li><li>  In the text box you should write ‚ÄúBalance 1234‚Äù, where 1234 is the last 4 digits of the number of the card whose balance is to be found out. </li><li>  After 1-2 minutes, a message will arrive indicating the balance. </li></ul><p>  This method can be used only by Beeline, MTS, Megafon subscribers.  Subscribers of other mobile operators and from abroad should send the same message, but to the number + 7-903-767-2273.  Message is paid. </p><p>  There is another way to find out the balance using the short message service, however, you don‚Äôt need to send anything anywhere.  Each time after making any financial transaction, a SMS notification is sent to the phone that is attached to the card.  It indicates which operation was performed, how much was debited and how much was left.  The last message does not need to be erased, you can always open it and see information about the remaining funds. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to find out the balance of the Tinkoff card via the Internet </h2><div class="photo" data-original="vildyaev.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tinkoff map" class="if uuid-2966373" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95252/2966373.jpg"></div><p>  After concluding an agreement with the bank, the client on the official website gets access to his personal account.  Through it, you can perform all financial transactions.  Convenience lies in the fact that at any time the client sees all completed operations, and not the last 10, as in most banks.  Using your personal account, you can independently open and close accounts, order an additional card (if necessary).  You can also make various payments, write to the bank for service issues and more. </p><p>  Even those who have just become a client of the bank and do not understand how to find out the balance of the Tinkoff card can easily figure it out.  Information on all available accounts is reflected on the page in your account in the upper left corner.  You must select the line "Payment cards" and click on it.  Next, find the card number, the set of income and expenses of which you need to find out.  When you click on it, balance information will be displayed. </p><h2>  Mobile app </h2><div class="photo" data-original="blogbankir.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mobile app" class="if uuid-2966349" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95252/2966349.jpg"></div><p>  In order to figure out how to find out the balance of the Tinkoff card through a specially designed mobile application, you must first install it.  You can download it, for example, through the Play Market.  The store guarantees the security of the program. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Using the application, you can work with accounts: make transfers, pay bills, and make purchases.  The program always works, except when there is no Internet access.  After downloading, you need to log in.  The main page will display the account balance. </p><h2>  Call to the bank </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.euwork.hu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="phone operator" class="if uuid-2966378" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95252/2966378.jpg"></div><p>  Bank operators work from 4.00 to 23.59 every day without holidays and weekends.  If there is no Internet connection, there is no possibility or desire to write SMS, you can find out the balance of the Tinkoff card by number.  Friendly, attentive and, most importantly, competent employees will provide detailed information on each issue of the bank's services. </p><p>  When signing the contract, a special brochure is issued with a detailed and simple description of how to perform certain operations, how to replenish or withdraw funds, and also a telephone is indicated by which you can always contact a financial institution. </p><p>  If it is difficult to understand the new information, you can call the multi-channel number and ask the operator how it is easier to find out the balance.  A bank employee will tell you how best to do it.  Or you can dial 8 (800) 555-10-10 and say ‚Äúbalance‚Äù.  An automated system will provide the necessary information. </p><h2>  Contract statement </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.videoblocks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="girl at the computer" class="if uuid-2966389" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95252/2966389.jpg"></div><p>  When concluding an agreement with Tinkoff Bank, the client, in addition to general personal data (full name, address, telephone), indicates his e-mail.  The bank is positioned as mobile, it means that the client has an email.  Using the mail you can quickly get any documentation, it receives notifications of changes in rates.  The bank makes the distribution of necessary and useful information, for example, how to protect yourself from scammers. </p><p>  In addition to the above, a contract statement is sent to the e-mail monthly.  The service is free and very necessary.  The document describes all operations carried out during the billing period with an indication of the description (the place where the card was calculated), amount, date and time. </p><p>  How to find out the balance of the Tinkoff card?  You can look in the mail and see the extract.  True, the method has disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  Between the preparation of the extract and receiving it on the "electronic" take a day.  During this time, you can repeatedly pay by card. </li><li>  The document arrives once a month, during this time the card balance can either be replenished or vice versa. </li><li>  If there is no access to the Internet, there is no access to the statement. </li></ul>
