Sberbank’s Internet accounts and car payments cannot be imagined without the Mobile Bank service.  But not all cardholders know how to check if Sberbank’s Mobile Bank is connected.  There are several easy ways to do this. </p><h2>  Features of the "Mobile Bank" from Sberbank </h2><p>  This is a service that allows customers to receive notifications for transactions on the Internet, send quick transfers and payments, and learn about the latest transactions on the card account. </p><div class="photo" data-original="r.search.yahoo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to check if Sberbank’s mobile bank is connected to the phone" class="if uuid-3016360" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3016360.jpg"></div><p>  There are 2 service packages: paid, the cost of which is 30 or 60 rubles per month, depending on the type of card, and free, or economical.  The choice of tariff depends on whether the client wants to receive SMS about the account balance after each incoming and outgoing transaction. </p><p>  The economical tariff involves SMS when entering Sberbank Online and performing operations: sending payments to customers by the number "900", clarifying the balance of the card and the "Thank you" bonus program.  It is free, because the client does not receive messages related to changing the credit card account. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.rt.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to check if the mobile bank of sberbank is connected to the card" class="if uuid-3016365" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3016365.jpg"></div><p>  Without this, you cannot transfer to another client, use Internet banking and connect auto payments to the card.  Therefore, it is very important to know how to check if Sberbank's Mobile Bank is connected. </p><h2>  Verification Methods </h2><p>  For the convenience of customers, there are several ways to verify information.  The cardholder chooses which option is comfortable for him. </p><p>  How to check if Sberbank’s Mobile Bank is connected: </p><ol><li>  Via SMS to the number "900". </li><li>  By phone support. </li><li>  Through Sberbank Online. </li><li>  Using a mobile application. </li><li>  In the office of the bank. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.iotgadgets.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to check if Sberbank’s mobile bank is connected through the application" class="if uuid-3016367" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3016367.jpg"></div><p>  Any way to check SMS alerts is free.  For some options, you need to have a passport with you (in order to pass the identification of the client). </p><h2>  How to check alerts by number "900": instructions </h2><p>  The easiest and fastest way to check if Sberbank’s Mobile Bank is connected is to send a message to 900.
