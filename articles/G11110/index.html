A feature of this type of refrigerator can be safely called high power.  Devices are made most often with the lower location of the freezer.  A rather voluminous freshness zone allows you to store vegetables and fruits without problems.  Also, the manufacturer took care of the availability of space for various bottles.  <span>The energy class</span> in this case depends on the power of the modification.  As a rule, models are manufactured with high-quality refrigerant P300.  However, despite their high quality, they sometimes fail.  This happens most often due to improper use of the device. </p>

    <h2>  User's manual </h2><p>  <span>Installation of refrigerators</span> does not take much time.  In addition, its legs can be adjusted.  In order to verify the operability of the device, it should be connected to a 220 V network. You can always check the temperature in the chamber using the display system.  Modern models are produced with mechanical and electronic controls.  If we consider the first option, then you can adjust the climate control using the controller. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Many electronically controlled models come with a display.  In this case, the temperature is set on the central panel.  Defrosting systems in devices use a static type.  Thus, the maintenance models are quite simple.  If necessary, the power of freezing products in the chamber can be increased. </p>

    <h2>  Compressor failure </h2><p>  What should I do if the Bosch two-chamber refrigerator (Know Frost) stops freezing?  In most cases, the problem is compressor failure.  When this happens, repairs are very expensive.  In order to independently inspect the device, you must remove the back cover of the refrigerator.  The pipe can not be touched.  First of all, it is important to twist the capacitor.  It is mounted near the roller.  The next step is to remove the bottom filter. </p><p>  After that, it will be possible to see the compressor of the Bosch refrigerator.  When it breaks, it burns very much.  In this case, the contacts appear blackened.  In workshops, compressors, as a rule, are not repaired.  In such a situation, the part can simply be replaced.  Spare parts for refrigerators are ordered through service centers. </p><h2>  Malfunctions with a temperature regulator </h2><p>  The temperature controller is installed at the rear panel, which has a Bosch refrigerator (two-chamber, Nou Frost).  Failures with this part are rare.  To repair the device you have to disconnect the base.  It is mounted in all models with screws.  Under the base is a small gasket.  Behind it is a dehumidifier: you can not touch it.  In order to inspect the thermostat, you have to twist the protective cover.  In many models, it is fixed on the stops.  In this case, the edge of the plate you just need to pry a sharp object. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After that, the temperature controller can be carefully removed.  During inspection, the wiring connection is checked first.  If the connecting contacts are broken, you can try to fix the situation with a soldering iron.  If the problem is a breakdown of the regulator specifically, you must contact the workshop. </p><h2>  Terminal box repair </h2><p>  She very rarely fails.  This happens, as a rule, due to overvoltage in the network.  Repair of Bosch refrigerators in this case should be started by disconnecting the motor.  It is located next to the pipe, however, it is forbidden to touch it.  The capacitor must be removed during repair.  <span>The terminal box</span> is located at the bottom of the refrigerator.  It is located on a small stand, which was specially built for it by the manufacturer.  To repair the part, the base does not need to be unscrewed. </p><p>  To repair the terminal box, first clean the contacts.  After that, inspect the pipe.  If it has moisture, it should be removed.  This can be done with an ordinary rag.  If the above steps do not help, then you have to take the refrigerator to a service center. </p><h2>  Filter change </h2><p>  They also rarely break.  Model repair in case of filter malfunction can be done independently.  To do this, removing the back cover is optional.  Simply twist the platinum.  The filter is located near the nozzle: connected to it by a screw method.  You can twist the part without a key.  Then it remains only to purchase a similar filter and put it in place.  Spare parts for refrigerators can be ordered through service centers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Dryer replacement </h2><p>  Some models have very poor quality dehumidifiers.  In violation of the temperature regime they fail.  In this case, repair of Bosch refrigerators should begin by unscrewing the back cover.  The next step is to inspect the model capacitor.  If there is no moisture on it, that‚Äôs good.  The dehumidifier is located directly behind the compressor cover.  You can remove it with a <span>wrench.</span> </p><p>  After disconnecting the part, carefully inspect it: there may be various defects.  If there is no external damage, then the problem lies in the breakdown of the relay itself.  In this case, the dehumidifier is easier to completely replace.  The device marking is always indicated by the manufacturer on the rear panel. </p><h2>  Reviews on "Bosch KG39" </h2><p>  Most users like the two-chamber Bosch refrigerator (Nou Frost).  Positive reviews indicate primarily the convenient location of the shelves.  If necessary, a large pot can be placed in the chamber.  The user is able to rearrange shelves easily.  Doors in this case are also outweighed.  These large refrigerators (two-chamber) make noise only at maximum load.  They do not have a minibar.  It is also important to note that only one compressor is used.  Thus, you can forget about quick freezing.  The temperature can be adjusted.  The lower hitch in the device can withstand heavy loads.  The price of the model is from 65 thousand rubles. </p>
