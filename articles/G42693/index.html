    <p>  Of great interest are 8 parks of the reserve, namely Alexandria, Kolonistsky, Aleksandrovsky, English, Lugovoi, Oldenburgsky Park, Own cottage, Sergievka.  The four <span>cascades of Peterhof</span> - the Big and the Lion, Golden and Chess Mountains - are famous all over the world.  Each of them is distinguished by its unique architecture.  Just in order to see these fountains, it is worth including Peterhof in the list of objects planned for visiting. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now let's talk about the many interesting museums in St. Petersburg. </p><h2>  Water museum </h2><p>  As a rule, specialized institutions are more likely to be interesting to professionals in a certain field than ordinary visitors, but this does not apply to the Water Museum, which occupies the Main Water Station on Shpalernaya Street, built in 1861.  It is worth noting that it was thanks to this water tower that St. Petersburg was able to reach one level with such European cities as Paris, London, Rome.  The water supply station provided water to every house in the city, replacing the water carriers.  The design of the tower was developed by Ivan Merz and Ernest Schubersky. </p><p>  Since then, much has changed, and today the history of this tower has allowed us to create another object that can successfully complement interesting museums in St. Petersburg.  Interesting excursions are organized here for teenagers, children and adults, during which they offer to see the following expositions: a multimedia complex, a historical exposition and an exhibition hall. </p>

    <p>  The museum has a huge number of chocolate exhibits made in the form of panels with famous places of St. Petersburg, a bust of Lenin or Peter I, a model of St. Isaac's Cathedral.  There are simpler chocolate figures: dolls, donkeys, hares, horses, bears, etc. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Freud's Dream Museum </h2><p>  The most interesting museums of St. Petersburg are also associated with the life and work of famous personalities.  It is to such cultural objects that <span>the Freud Museum</span> belongs <span>,</span> located at the East European Institute of Psychoanalysis.  The museum was opened in 1999 thanks to the ten-year painstaking work of psychoanalyst Viktor Mazin.  The discovery was timed to coincide with the centennial of the publication of the book "Interpretation of Dreams."  Museums dedicated to the life and work of Freud are also available in Vienna (Austria), London (England) and Przibor (Czech Republic). </p><p>  The exposition occupies two small rooms (Introductory and Dream Halls), but despite this, you can spend quite a lot of time trying to unravel the secrets of mysterious objects.  In the first room there are 12 showcases, the contents of which are dedicated to the stages of life of the founder of psychoanalysis.  The second hall presents exhibits that make visitors immerse themselves in the world of their own fantasies, memories, ideas and dreams.  A visit to the museum will be especially interesting for people who once read The Interpretation of Dreams. </p><h2>  Railway museum </h2><p>  One cannot fail to mention one more object, considering interesting museums of St. Petersburg.  The list would not be complete without the Railway Museum, which was opened back in 1813.  In 1902, a new building was specially built for him, in which it is located today. </p>

    <p>  The museum's collection is represented by numerous exhibits that are associated with rail transport.  This train, and wagons, and locomotives, and auxiliary items required for the movement of trains, and construction vehicles, and other structures.  Some of the exhibits displayed at the museum in 1900 were exhibited at an international exhibition in Paris.  Frequent visitors here are students studying specialties related to railway transport.  After all, it is probably impossible to come up with a more advanced study guide than real objects or their layouts. </p><p>  Today the Railway Museum in St. Petersburg can offer visitors more than 50,000 exhibits, among which there are both models and models, as well as real, still working locomotives and trains. </p><h2>  Club cafe and museum "Kamchatka" </h2><p>  Not only ancient places and objects are famous for St. Petersburg.  Interesting museums of this city are often represented by more modern exhibits, the history of which is still remembered by modern residents.  Such cultural objects belong to both the club cafe and the Kamchatka Museum, located on Blokhin Street. </p><p>  Until 1999, there was a functioning boiler room in which Viktor Tsoi, the leader of the Kino rock band, worked from 1986 to 1988.  In those days, Choi worked three days later, due to which he had enough time for creativity, and the Soviet government did not consider him a parasite.  Frequent guests in this boiler room at that time were <span>Sergey Kurekhin,</span> Boris Grebenshchikov and Alexander Bashlachev.  Many famous songs were born here. </p><p>  After the boiler house was closed, at the initiative of businessman Alexei Sergeyenko and his friends, the historical site was restored and slightly transformed.  Today it is a cafe-bar with a stage where young rock bands perform weekly.  The room contains an exposition consisting of plates, posters, diplomas and photographs of the Kino group.  In a separate niche under the glass, a 12-string guitar of the singer and musician is presented.  This museum is of greatest interest to admirers of Russian rock in general and the work of the Kino group in particular, because other interesting museums of St. Petersburg do not mention this era. </p><h2>  Brewery History Museum </h2><p>  Brewery Museum, located in the building of the plant.  Stepan Razin on the street of the same name, is the first cultural institution of beer subjects in the Russian Federation.  Visitors get the opportunity to learn the secrets of creating beer, as well as get acquainted with the characteristics of the culture of consumption of this drink.  Here you can see exhibits that are not found in any museum in the world.  By the way, many interesting museums of <span>St. Petersburg for children</span> and adults present unique exhibits of various spheres of human life and activity. </p>

    <p>  The institution was established in 1995.  His collection consists of more than 600 exhibits.  Some of them were previously used at the same factory, some were bought from collectors, and some were donated by other museums.  Here you can see a copy of the ancient Egyptian brewery (its original is presented in the Hermitage).  In one of the halls of the museum there are exhibits that talk about brewing in Russia.  This is an old copper boiler, grip, forged scales, various bottles and labels. </p><h2>  Puppet Museum </h2><p>  Not only the state cares about the cultural development of citizens whose city of residence is St. Petersburg.

Its creation began with several private collections of dolls, and today the number of exhibits exceeds 5,000. In addition, museum visitors, who often become not only children but also adults, have the opportunity to get acquainted with the history of puppetry, and also take part in one of the master classes. </p><p>  The exposition of the Puppet Museum consists of 9 halls: St. Petersburg Perspective, Village Village, Pride and Glory of the Fatherland, Left Russia, Forest Kingdom, Fairy Halls, interior dolls, frivolous dolls, workshops, and a theater hall .  In each of them you can see a lot of new and interesting things for both an adult and a child. </p><h2>  Butterfly Museum </h2><p>  Some tourists believe that the most interesting museums in St. Petersburg are the Mindo Butterfly Garden on ul.  Ropshinskaya and a similar garden on the street.  The truth.  Visitors to both gardens fall into the real world of harmony and beauty.  Here come into the world, carefree flutter, eat, sleep, sit on visitors butterflies of various species.  The museum is a real tropical paradise with swamp creek and aquatic turtles. </p>
