There is also a children's restaurant with a specialized menu and a corner for mothers, where they can prepare their own meals for their baby.  In addition, the hotel has four sites.  One of them is located right on the beach, which is very convenient for all parents who are there: the children are nearby, and at the same time are busy with games.

It is bulk, and in the water under the feet is small pebbles, however, it is quite acceptable and does not cause inconvenience.  There is a beautiful pier with a bar on the shore.  Sunset at sea is quite gentle, but there are often waves. </p><h2>  A bit about the resort </h2><p>  Club Hotel Nena HV-1 (Turkey) (photos are given in the article) is located near the village of Kyzylagach, which is a wonderful children's resort.  Many hotels have been built here, all of them are focused on families with children.

This is a real historical open-air museum.  The city has been known since the seventh century BC.  But at the same time, most of the historical monuments preserved in Side dates from the second century BC. </p><p>  Along the perimeter of the city, the walls of an ancient fortress are preserved, which remind of past times.  No less interesting for tourists is the Nymphaeum Fountain.  The ancient Greeks built sanctuaries, dedicating them to water nymphs.  They looked like semicircular buildings three stories high.  In Side, unlike other cities, a lot of historical monuments have been preserved. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="club hotel nena hv 1 hotel description" class="if" height="341" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1462203.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Near the city, tourists can enjoy the <span>Manavgat waterfall,</span> which was artificially created during the construction of the dam.  More recently, this place could be visited for free, but now everything has changed.  The waterfall has one feature - its height is two meters, but its width is forty meters. </p><p>  In the northwestern part of the city are the remains of an ancient aqueduct.  It was once built to deliver water from a river in a mountainous area.  For those times, it's just an awesome design. </p><p>  In the old district of Side, the Agora has survived to this day.  This is something like a market square, where trade was going on and people gathered.  Of course, many details have suffered greatly from time to time, but even in this form this place is simply amazing. </p><p>  In Side, you should definitely visit the ancient amphitheater built by the Greeks.  Here, once there was a gladiatorial battle, and later on this place was a temple in the open.  The statues that once stood in the amphitheater have long gone to museums.  And in the ruins of an ancient theater, opera performances are sometimes arranged. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel club hotel nena hv 1 photo gallery" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1462211.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  A must-see place for tourists is the port of Side.  Even in ancient times, the harbor flourished due to the trade in slaves that pirates brought here.  Side later turned into a port with international trade.  And now, on the coast, the remains of the oldest moles have been preserved.  From the port you can go for a walk along the river. </p><p>  One of the favorite places for tourists is the <span>Green Canyon.</span>  Here, beautiful vegetation, turquoise water and majestic mountains - all this creates stunning landscapes. </p><h2>  Hotel Club Hotel Nena HV-1: reviews </h2><p>  According to vacationers, the hotel is popular among tourists precisely because of its location.  Being a little away from the village of Kyzylagach, the complex provides its guests with the peace and quiet that many so need.  Since the hotel <strong> </strong>  Club Hotel Nena HV-1 has a large territory and good infrastructure, its remoteness does not affect the comfort of rest.  Most of the guests are Turkish families.  In general, it is noticeable that the complex is designed for vacationers with children.  Probably, active youth and avid party-goers can look for another place to relax, although it is not boring here. </p><p>  The territory itself is very beautiful and well-groomed, there are many flowers and beautiful trees.  It‚Äôs just nice to walk on it.  Near the hotel there is a supermarket and shops, where you can buy everything you need.  Clubs are also nearby.  They carry a hotel minibus for free.  It is very comfortable.  If you want to see Side, then you can get a minibus or book an excursion with local guides.  As a rule, tourists visiting Turkey is not the first time prefer to travel independently. </p><p>  The hotel rooms are in good condition.  Of course, somewhere you can find scuffs or cracks, but in general, everything is in order.  The bathroom and the bathroom are very clean, without fungus and dark seams between the tiles.  All hygiene products are also present.  True, sometimes they forget to replenish.  Cleaning takes place daily, bed linen is changed, as a rule, once every three days, and towels daily.  The staff performs their duties when you are not in the room, just do not forget to hang up the appropriate signs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel club hotel nena hv 1 turkey photos" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1462237.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The apartments are equipped with good double and single beds, they are very convenient and comfortable.  Sliding wardrobes are functional and capacious.  In general, all furniture is very solid.  Perhaps someone will think that the rooms are decorated without any kind of chic, but this is not necessary.  The main thing is that everything is working properly.  Not very conveniently located air conditioners, blow directly onto the bed.  In this situation, you have to turn it off.  The apartments have a safe, but for some reason it is paid.  In principle, you can not use it. </p><p>  Hotel Club Hotel Nena HV-1 (photos are given in the article) has a nice and friendly staff.  Resettlement occurs very quickly, without confusion and confusion regarding the reserved apartments.  The hotel has a Russian-speaking staff, so you can always explain.  Hotel staff are friendly to guests, wanting to help in case of any questions.  Cleaning is normal. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  How are meals at Club Nena Hotel HV-1?  Guest reviews, as is usually the case, are ambiguous: someone lacks variety.  In general, summarizing the opinions of many tourists, we can say that the food is well organized.  Guests are offered a buffet.  All dishes are very tasty and fresh.  Of the meat, as a rule, turkey and chicken prevail, lamb and beef are served less often, but daily, if it is important for someone.  Fish is also always on the tables, but you can argue about its taste.  Seafood is not very popular.  Grilled vegetables are very tasty.  In addition, there is always a significant amount of all kinds of snacks and salads.  There are also dishes of children's and dietary tables. </p><p>  There is no need to talk about Turkish cakes and sweets.  All desserts are very tasty and varied.  Fruit is also quite enough.  Between main meals you can eat in the bars.  So, for example, in the afternoon bake cakes, waffles.  All tourists say that it is impossible to stay hungry at the hotel, but extra pounds during the holidays gain everything, even with an active lifestyle.  The restaurant waiters deserve special praise: they work very quickly and well. </p><h2>  Animation Reviews </h2><p>  As a rule, parents who are planning a vacation at sea are interested in the question: ‚ÄúWhat animation does Club Hotel Nena HV-1 provide its guests?‚Äù  Tours offered by agencies are very diverse, but not all of them are suitable for children.  As for this complex, the pleasant fact is that it is designed specifically for families with children.  This is evidenced even by the situation itself.  On the territory there are several children's pools with slides, playgrounds, a mini club.  Animators work all day with the kids, organizing their leisure.  It is very convenient for parents.  The beach has a playground and pool.  Children, on the one hand, are at sea and are busy with games, and at the same time are under the supervision of their parents.  In the evenings, mini-discos are organized for young guests.  The children remain completely delighted after them, after which they go to sleep exhaustively. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel club hotel nena hv 1 reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1462243.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In total, the hotel has three children's pools, two of them with wonderful slides.  In the hotel you can rent a stroller, and in the restaurant special chairs for babies are free of charge.  Young guests are generally delighted with the living creatures in the hotel.  Cats with kittens, chickens, hens, and males freely walk here. </p><p>  As for adult animation, during the day everyone can join in water aerobics and entertainment on the beach.  In the evenings, musical shows are arranged for parents, Turkish Nights are especially interesting, but they are not often held.  According to vacationers, after 22.00 the hotel becomes quiet, most of the people go by numbers, putting the kids to bed.  If someone wants a longer and more active entertainment, you can visit local clubs.  Some vacationers believe that adult animation is poorly organized, although this can be argued, because the hotel initially positions itself as a family complex, and not as a party place. </p><p>  A wonderful pastime can be trips in Side to explore historical monuments.  There are a lot of them preserved in the city, perhaps one vacation is not enough to admire the most beautiful places. </p><h2>  Beach and sea: reviews </h2><p>  The sea and the beach are what vacationers are actually going to Turkey for.  The Kyzylagac region is considered a warmer region than other places on the Mediterranean coast.  The sea here is very warm, clean and transparent. </p><p>  The hotel's beach is sandy (bulk), it has umbrellas and sunbeds.  And the entrance to the sea is pebbles, it is not large, so there is no problem to go into the water.  It is rather difficult to walk along the hot sand to the sea, so it‚Äôs better to use shoes anyway.  The only thing that is not very convenient for children is that it becomes deep in the water after a couple of steps. </p><p>  On the beach there is a bar where you can not only take soft drinks, but also have a snack. </p><p>  In the morning hours the sea is calm, quiet, there is not even a slight ripple, but later a light breeze appears, and after it there are waves.  For everyone, the hotel organizes diving lessons.  In these places, very rich underwater flora and fauna.  Even if you are not a supporter of deep-sea swims, diving with a mask will give a lot of impressions. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Club Hotel Nena HV-1 is a wonderful place with a beautiful territory, a good beach and a warm sea, which can be recommended to those tourists who want to find a decent place for a relaxing family vacation with children. </p>
