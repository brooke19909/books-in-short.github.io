    <h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Matrix - 18 megapixels (4896x3672, 1 / 2.3 inches).  The lens is 41.7x optical zoom (24-1000 equiv. Mm), F / 3.0-5.9.  Information is stored on <span>SD, SDHC</span> or SDXC <span>memory</span> cards;  In addition, there is a built-in memory of 15 MB.  Photo file format - JPEG;  video files - MOV (1920x1080p) with stereo sound;  as well as 640x480, 1280x720 or 1920x1080p.  The Nikon COOLPIX P520 has a combined AV output and USB, as well as mini-HDMI.  <span>Overall dimensions of the</span> device are 126x84x102 mm. </p><h2>  Super zoom </h2><p>  Cameras of this type are commonly called superzoom.  Let's understand what is meant by this term.  These are devices that are equipped with a small matrix and have a stationary lens, characterized by a huge zoom ratio.  Another popular name for this class is bridge cameras, which implies an intermediate position of such devices between system and compact cameras.  Almost all compact digital cameras with a small matrix size are characterized by an extremely high zoom ratio.  For devices with a large matrix, a similar approximation is impossible to realize, since the optics would be too big, heavy and expensive. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In fact, only a super-powerful approximation is already enough to justify the existence of this class and ensure its popularity.  However, the Nikon COOLPIX P520 camera (photo above) stands out from the crowd by the fact that its functionality is very rich, and in appearance and control system it is close to SLR cameras.  The zoom ratio of this camera reaches 42x, but the range starts from a fairly wide angle (24 equiv. Mm), which greatly expands the possibilities of taking pictures.  And BSI technology (backlighting) allows you to read the picture at high speed, and this ensures the Full HD video format and high-speed shooting mode. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikon COOLPIX P520 Digital Camera" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/485749.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  For some reason, in this case, the manufacturer departed from the usual traditional standards - strict black.  As a result, this model has three color options.  The Nikon COOLPIX P520 Red camera, as the name implies, is made in red.  Although in fact it is closer to the color of rotten cherries.  This model looks quite stylish.  The next camera - Nikon COOLPIX P520 Black 1 - is made in matte black, which is considered traditional for photography.  The next option is also black, but with a glossy sheen, making the device glamorous and more effective.  This model is called Nikon COOLPIX P520 Black 2. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Control system </h2><p>  The camera has a very successful execution of the case, it fits comfortably in the hand.  The rubber overlay on the handle with a notch is tactile. However, if you do not take care of it, it will clog up with dust very quickly, and then it will not look so elegant.  Between the lens and the grip there is an autofocus backlight and an automatic timer timer.  She has an orange glow.  Around the shutter release button is a lever that controls the zoom.  This is where an interesting ergonomic feature of this model lies: the pseudo-mirror design of the Nikon COOLPIX P520 implies that you need to hold it, like mirrored devices, with the palm of your left hand under the lens, and place your thumb on the left, on the lens barrel. </p><p>  Just in this place, the designers placed the zoom control lever.  This control partially imitates the zoom ring on the lens.  This element allows you to not only zoom in / out, but can also be used for manual focus.  On the left side of the case there is a button with the image of lightning, it is designed to raise the built-in flash.  In this model, it is not possible to install an external flash.  In the place where this connector is usually located in cameras, the Nikon COOLPIX P520 has a stereo microphone and an antenna for the GPS module.  Next to the zoom lever there is a programming button - "Fn".  It allows you to set one of the following parameters: image size, image quality, PictureControl color schemes, white balance, shutter mode, metering type, ISO sensitivity, stabilizer mode and autofocus zone mode. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikon COOLPIX P520 black camera" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/485754.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Inconvenience of management </h2><p>  One of the miscalculations of the developers of this camera is the location of both drives on the rear panel.  As a result, the thumb of the right hand always has to rush between them and all the buttons.  It is much more convenient to work when one disc is in front, on the handle.  The next inconvenience is the inability to switch the image output between the electronic viewfinder and the monitor by pressing a button.  In addition, there is no sensor for automatic switching in case the viewfinder is close to the face.  The picture is displayed on the viewfinder when the monitor is turned by the screen to the body.  This implementation is somewhat inconvenient when it is necessary to view the photographs taken during the shooting process.  Also, the electronic viewfinder suffers from poor image quality.  The picture is high-speed, the resolution is low, the bright areas are poorly designed, but for framing purposes it‚Äôs enough. </p><h2>  Model functionality </h2><p>  The monitor of the Nikon COOLPIX P520 rotates freely in two axes, turning to the left of the camera.  This design allows you to shoot from unusual angles and in portrait (vertical) orientation.  The ‚ÄúDISP‚Äù key is located to the right of the viewfinder, it switches the modes of displaying information on the screen.  When you press the shutter button halfway, the area where the autofocus has worked is highlighted in green, and other information is also displayed.  But the ISO value determined by the automation is not indicated when working in the "Auto-ISO" mode.  Video recording starts without first switching after pressing the red dot key.  The Up button selects the flash modes: Off, Fill (forced shutdown), Auto, Red-eye reduction auto, Rear-curtain sync, and Slow sync.  It is forbidden to switch modes when the flash is lowered.  The Down key turns on the macro mode, allows you to fix the <span>focal length</span> at infinity (image of mountains).  This function is useful when taking pictures through glass or fireworks (when there is no object to fix).  The ‚ÄúLeft‚Äù key starts the self-timer (with a delay of 2 or 10 seconds).  ‚ÄúRight‚Äù includes exposure compensation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="compact digital cameras" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/485756.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Shooting modes, video, panorama </h2><p>  The Nikon COOLPIX P520 has eleven standard modes that are switched by the control dial.  In ‚ÄúAuto mode‚Äù (the image of the camera is green), the camera takes full control, the set of adjustable functions in it is limited.  In the ‚ÄúP‚Äù software mode, moving the control disk shifts the program (the aperture / shutter speed determined by the automation changes, while the exposure remains unchanged).  As with most cameras, this model has a classic set of ‚ÄúASM‚Äù (expo modes): ‚ÄúA‚Äù - aperture priority;  "S" - extracts;  "M" - manual installation of an expopair.  "Night landscape" provides for work in two versions: with a tripod and with hands.  ‚ÄúBacklight‚Äù works when the flash is on, which illuminates a dark foreground object, or using HDR technology (wide dynamic range).  In this case, several pictures are taken at different exposure values, and then combined into one.  User mode (‚ÄúU‚Äù) - camera settings are saved, even the zoom value is remembered.  The ‚ÄúSCENE‚Äù position on the disc stores seventeen scene programs that can be selected through the menu.  When you select this mode, most of the options are unavailable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikon COOLPIX P520 Camera" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/485758.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Video recording </h2><p>  The camera can record video using a variety of settings for format, frame rate and resolution.  The user can apply the effects of the EFFECTS group, exposure compensation, but the set exposure levels are ignored.  You can set the <span>aperture and shutter speed</span> in the ‚ÄúM‚Äù <span>mode,</span> but the video will be shot automatically, all settings are ignored.  After the clip is recorded, the device saves the video to a flash drive.  Among the various video options there is a slow-motion (accelerated) recording, as well as accelerated shooting (twice as fast). </p><h2>  Parameters, rate of fire, menu </h2><p>  When you press the ‚ÄúMENU‚Äù button located on the back of the camera, the Nikon COOLPIX P520 menu is displayed on the screen (the user manual details all the modes, programs, settings and functions of the camera), where parameters are controlled for which there were no buttons on the case devices.  The essence of most parameters is understandable and does not require a detailed explanation.  Image styles or color schemes for this model are called ‚ÄúPicture Control‚Äù, which means image management.  There are only four of them: standard (SD), bright (VI), neutral (NL), monochrome (MC). </p><p>  The chart shows the location and combination of styles in the Contrast and Saturation coordinates.  The ‚ÄúContinuous‚Äù menu item refers to the operation of the shutter.  It allows you to perform conventional single-frame, continuous high-speed, continuous low-speed shooting.  The ‚ÄúPre-Shooting Buffer‚Äù mode fixes from the moment of half-pressing the shutter at a speed of 15 frames / sec.  in a fixed resolution of 3 megapixels.  All information is stored in a buffer.  When the button is pressed, recording stops, up to twenty pictures are recorded on the memory card.  The ‚ÄúSelect the best shot‚Äù mode takes ten shots in a row, after which the camera selects and saves the best one, the minimum selection blur is the main criterion for selection.  This mode is recommended for taking pictures in low light conditions or when moving, when shaking cannot be avoided.  In addition, it is optimal when shooting at large focal lengths, at which the slightest tremor of hands turns into a significant hanging of the lens in the frame, which even the image stabilizer can not always handle. </p>

    <p>  The item ‚ÄúSensitivity‚Äù consists of two parts - setting the <span>ISO sensitivity</span> and setting the maximum shutter speed of the camera automation.  This model also provides for setting the noise reduction intensity setting.  The device offers three options - normal, moderate (weak) and enhanced.  The ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù section is devoted to managing auxiliary settings of the camera. </p><h2>  GPS navigation system </h2><p>  One of the most important features of this model is the integrated global positioning <span>navigation system</span> .  It allows using signals that come from satellites to determine the location of the camera.  In modern devices, this function is used more often, it is especially popular among ‚Äútravel cameras‚Äù (this model can also be attributed to this class).  The navigation system is activated in the corresponding section of the menu.  When it is turned on, the satellite icon appears on the screen.  In this case, the <span>geographical coordinates are</span> recorded along with the photos taken in EXIF.  In addition, the base of various points of interest and attractions works in this mode.  If you are close to such a place, its name will appear at the bottom of the monitor.  You can configure the signatures of these objects along with the taken pictures, as well as their display when viewing. </p><h2>  Nikon COOLPIX P520 Camera: User Reviews </h2><p>  Consider the positive aspects of this model.  Most amateur photographers choose this unit due to the huge zoom ratio and the presence of a wide angle in this mode.  They note effective optical image stabilization, a unique control for different types of zooming or manual focusing, a complete set of PASM modes.  Many amateurs call the advantages of this camera to be interesting parameters for handheld night shooting ("Portrait" and "Landscape"), combining several frames and improving quality at a high ISO level. </p>
