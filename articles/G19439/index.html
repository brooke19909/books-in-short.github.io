The hotel on its sign has four stars.  But, of course, this alone does not guarantee an adequate rest, even in the countries of the European Union.  Therefore, to describe the hotel, we relied on the reviews of those tourists who visited there recently - in the summer and in the velvet season of two thousand and sixteen.  And, although their opinion can also be very subjective, it nevertheless reflects reality more than rainbow leaflets. </p><p>  First, let's say who this hotel is suitable for.  It will be comfortable for those tourists who crave a quiet and measured rest.  There is animation in the hotel, but you will have to go to the nearby resort towns for an incendiary nightlife.  But the sea is ten steps away, and the restaurant's terrace hangs over the beach.  The main contingent of vacationers at the hotel is young people, couples and senior citizens from Central European countries. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alia mare resort" class="if" height="285" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1572837.jpg" width="435"></div>

    <h2>  Where is the hotel located </h2><p>  Alia Mare Resort (Greece) is located in the southern part of Rhodes.  Nearby is the village of Lardos.  And the resort town of Lindos is seven kilometers away.  <span>Rhodes</span> International <span>Airport is</span> quite far away, it takes about an hour to go.  Aliya Mare Resort is a front-line hotel.  It has its own pebble and sandy beach.  Despite the fact that the hotel is not in the center of the village, this place cannot be called a wilderness.  Around the same resort hotels, and within walking distance there are two supermarkets, taverns and many small shops with souvenirs and goods for a beach holiday.  According to reviews, the most popular goods there were masks and tubes.  Although Rhodes is not Egypt with Thailand, it turns out that there is also something to see in the Mediterranean Sea.  If hunting has fallen, you can take a walk in the picturesque village of Lardos.  Lindos can be reached in fifteen minutes by bus.  His stop is not far from the hotel.  A car rental service is located next to the Aliyya Mare Resort Hotel, just to the right of the entrance.  With a car you can go around the whole island and save on excursions.  Tourists put the location of the hotel five. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alia Mare Resort Greece" class="if" height="292" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1572832.jpg" width="435"></div>

Therefore, in the four-story building there are architectural details of the modern high-tech style.  The balconies are covered with plexiglass, which is good for children: there is no need for a risk to life to climb to see the world.  Guest rooms have huge panoramic windows all over the wall.  Half of the rooms overlook the sea, the rest overlook the mountains.  For "sea view" you have to pay extra.  Between the building and the beach there are two outdoor pools - for adults and children.  Closest to the sea is a restaurant.  Its terrace just hangs over the beach, and you can trapeze under the rustle of waves.  The territory of the hotel is small, but well equipped.  Everywhere is clean, green.  Around the pools there is a sun terrace, with sun loungers and parasols.  Tourists really liked the compact area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel.  According to this indicator, the reviews put the hotel five plus. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alia Mare Resort 4 pics" class="if" height="235" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1572834.jpg" width="435"></div>

The rooms are equipped with good appliances.  There is a TV with cable channels, air conditioning, refrigerator, hairdryer.  In the bathroom with the light turned on, an extractor hood that instantly dries the spray from taking a shower. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alia Mare Resort 4" class="if" height="234" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1572839.jpg" width="435"></div>

At first, she bothered some tourists.  But then it turned out that the glass was completely opaque, even when the light was on in the bathroom.  The guests were pleased that the air conditioner was not dependent on an electronic key pulled out of the slot.  That is, it was possible to come from the heat to a rather chilled room.  Maids were cleaned every day: towels were changed and new hygiene items were put in.  And fresh linens were laid twice a week.  Guests loved the spacious, furnished balconies.  Recommendations for choosing a room: do not skimp on the "sea view" and ask for a room on the upper floors.  Although the sound insulation is good here, people are sitting late at the bar on the basement level.  In general, tourists gave the rooms and their service four points out of five possible. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The all-inclusive program has been introduced at Alia Mare Resort.  The reviews described the choice of dishes as corresponding to a four-star hotel.  That is, lobsters and foie gras are not given there, but you certainly will not stay hungry.  For breakfast, they always give one set of dishes: eggs in different forms, sausages, bacon, cheese, delicious Greek yogurt, cereal, milk.  For lunch, there are always two types of side dish, meat and fish, a lot of fresh vegetables and pickles, fruits.  Dinner was richer than other meals.  A day later, four kinds of ice cream were offered.  There were grilled dishes.  From the drinks, Greek table wines and beer were poured.  The hotel has two bars - by the pool and on the beach.  The alcohol there is of high quality.  The bartender at the pool speaks Russian.  For those who want to taste the delights of Greek cuisine outside the hotel, tourists recommend visiting the neighboring establishment, Periklis Tavern. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alia Mare Resort reviews" class="if" height="236" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1572835.jpg" width="435"></div>

    <h2>  Beach and sea </h2><p>  Alia Mare Resort was named a beachfront location by the reviews. You can go down to the beach for breakfast right from the restaurant.  Unlike other coasts, sunbeds and umbrellas on it are free.  True, they are not enough.  But the beach is well arranged.  There is a shower, toilet, changing cabins, a bar.  In summer, wooden floorings are laid on pebbles so that the pebbles do not burn the heels.  The only negative is the stones in shallow water.  Therefore, tourists recommend buying slippers-coral, they are sold in all stores for eight euros.  You can choose another option: to go to the beach of the neighboring Sunrise Hotel - it is cleared of boulders.  But there you have to pay about four euros for using a deck chair and an umbrella. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alia Mare Resort Greece o Rhodes" class="if" height="239" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1572833.jpg" width="435"></div>
