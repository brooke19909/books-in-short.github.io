    <p>  Quite often, the metal coating has poor contact inside the USB port or at the charger cable.  This can be either a defect caused by the manufacturer or cable wear. </p><p>  What should I do if the phone is slowly charging due to poor contact?  Turn off the device and remove the battery if possible.  After that, all contacts should be cleaned with something like a thin needle.  This must be done very carefully and carefully.  After cleaning, replace the battery and reconnect the <span>charger.</span>  Often this method helps to restore the normal charging process. </p><h2>  Dust and debris in the charging port </h2><p>  Many carry their gadgets in jeans pockets, and they have small fibers that can cause the phone to charge slowly.  Masters very often encounter just such an incident.  What to do if fibers or dust clogged in the connector?  It can be brought back to normal by blowing with compressed air from a spray can.  You can use a powerful cold air dryer or compressor.  After cleaning, the phone starts charging normally. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Cable replacement </h2>

    <p>  In the entire charger, the most fragile part is the cable.  Due to constant bends, it quickly fails, as a result of which the phone charges very slowly.  What to do?  The easiest way to diagnose a damaged cable is to temporarily replace it with another one.  In the event that the other cable with the device works as it should, then the original wire is faulty.  If not, then the reason is not in it. </p><h2>  Adapter replacement </h2>

    <p>  So, the cable problem is out of the question, but is the phone charging slowly anyway?  In this case, the charger itself must be checked for operability.  If the design allows you to remove the cable from the adapter, then the check will be simple.  Often you may encounter chargers whose ports have been severely worn out due to the large number of plug and unplug cords. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You also need to check the adapter and cable on other phones.  This will help ensure that the problem is not related to the mobile device itself.  And it will be useful to check the outlet. </p><h2>  Safety is the main thing </h2><p>  Do not charge the device near water or in very humid conditions, as well as in very hot conditions.  No need to keep the device connected to electricity for too long.  If it charges in just three hours, then why leave it recharged all night?  Because of this, after a while, the phone slowly charges and quickly discharges. </p><p>  If there is a need to replace the wire or the charger itself, then you need to be careful, since cheap copies from Chinese manufacturers can be sources of danger.  Recently, there has been an increasing number of cases of fire of mobile phones due to poor-quality adapters. </p><h2>  Battery Replacement </h2>

    <p>  Battery life cannot last forever.  After 4-5 years of use, its capacity is lost, which is why the phone is slowly charging.  The more often charging and discharging processes occur, the sooner the battery will deteriorate.  If the battery stops working after only six months of use, then this is not normal.  In this case, you should contact the seller. </p><p>  Sometimes a defective battery can be easily identified after inspection.  If it is swollen, it should be replaced immediately. </p><h2>  Charging from the right source </h2>

    <p>  Many people charge their gadgets from computers and laptops.  They have a question: why is the phone charging slowly?  Computer ports have too little power.  From the outlet, the phone will always charge much faster. </p><p>  The problem may be that the adapter is used from a completely different device, for example, from a headset, which is not designed for the phone at all.  You can often hear a complaint that the Samsung phone is charging slowly.  At the same time, users charge it with an adapter from other models.  But all the adapters supply a different output voltage. </p><h2>  Software update or rollback to previous version </h2><p>  Updates on the phone can negatively affect the battery life of the phone.  This is especially true when the old model is updated to the new version of Android.  Fresh models are usually optimized for updates. </p><p>  If the reason lies precisely in this, then you can try to roll back to the previous version of the software.  For starters, it makes sense to try to reset the settings to factory settings, as device manufacturers often recommend.  This will help to avoid data loss due to a different version of the operating system. </p><p>  In the same way, the charging problem can be solved by installing a newer version of the software. </p><h2>  Phone off </h2><p>  Often applications run in the background.  Their use significantly affects the duration of the charging process.  For example, if a browser is running, Skype, and something else, then the smartphone will need much more time to fully charge. </p><p>  You can turn off the device and put it on charge.  So the process will go faster. </p><h2>  Calibration of the battery indicator </h2><p>  In conclusion, you need to remember another type of problem: the indicator on the screen shows that the charge is full, and the device turns off very quickly and requires recharging.  Most people think that the battery is unusable.  But often the reason lies elsewhere.  This happens after flashing the phone.  After its completion, battery calibration is necessary, which many people forget.  The bottom line is that after replacing the firmware, the phone does not know how much charge remained.  Therefore, you need to calibrate the display so that the correct battery charge is indicated. </p>
