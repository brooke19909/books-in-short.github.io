There are many popular resort villages with excellent infrastructure, reasonable prices and good service.  One of them is <span>Divnomorskoe (Gelendzhik).</span>  In the very center of this village is the Kars Hotel.  His address is very simple: Chernomorskaya street, 21-b.  Below we will consider the reviews of guests about how they lived in this hotel, about the level of its services and the quality of rest.  The hotel is not seasonal, it works all year round, so you can go here not only on vacation.  This is a chain hotel, it belongs to the line of the same name, which has hotels in different areas of Greater Gelendzhik. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Kars Address" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1605249.jpg" width="453"></div>

    <h2>  Recreation, Divnomorskoe </h2><p>  Hotel "Kars" is located in the village where Russian tourists like to go.  Many spend their holidays here annually.  The sea is cleaner here, beaches are more convenient and air is more transparent than in Big Gelendzhik.  And to the city center - only some twelve kilometers.  It can be reached by bus. </p><p>  But in Divnomorskoye, tourist infrastructure is so good that many people don‚Äôt need to go to Big Gelendzhik.  The climate here is almost Mediterranean, and the nature is very beautiful.  Nearby there is not a single industrial enterprise that only speaks of good ecology.  No wonder the resort is positioning itself as a child.  Young people love to come here.  In Divnomorskoy there is where to walk and "break away".  The local night clubs, especially those in the open air, are famous throughout the Krasnodar Territory. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Of course, the main attraction of the village Divnomorskoe is the beach.  Although it is not wide, it is comfortable and clean.  There are a lot of people in the center, but if you go a little left or right, you will always find secluded corners. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest Divnomorsk hotel Kars" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1605251.jpg" width="600"></div>
