    <h2>  Geographical position </h2><p>  Omsk is located in the southern part of the West Siberian Plain, at the confluence <span>of the Om</span> River in the Irtysh.  The distance to Moscow in a straight line is 2242 km, and to the border with Kazakhstan - about 150 km.  The city is located in the 4th hour zone and covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã572 square meters.  km </p><h2>  Title </h2><p>  Experts are still arguing over whether or not the word "Omsk" is an abbreviation.  The history of the name of the city is rather vague.  There is a version that it consists of the first letters of the words in the phrase "Remote Place for Exile of Prisoners".  However, most researchers perceive a connection with the name of the Om River.  In favor of the second version is the fact that <span>this toponym</span> appeared long before the prison for the convicts appeared in Omsk. </p><h2>  The background of Omsk </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the first people settled in these places in the Stone Age.  This is evidenced by many artifacts found during archaeological excavations in the Omsk site.  They were replaced in the Neolithic era by representatives of another more developed culture, who owned pottery, and later tribes that smelted bronze, the so-called Andronovites, settled there.  Their cemeteries were discovered at the place where the Omsk fortress was once located, and on the territory of the modern Museum Street.  Then, 12 km from the mouth of Omi, the Irmenians founded a settlement, which existed from about 10 to 8 century BC.  e.  The next inhabitants of these places were the Kulays, and later they were replaced by the Huns who resettled from Transbaikalia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  The foundation of the Omsk fortress </h2><p>  At the end of the 16th century, the Oirat local population, with whom Russia had diplomatic relations, asked to establish a city on Omi to protect it from attacks by the Khotogoy Khanate.  However, in the 1620-1630s, the situation changed.  In particular, the Oiraws, who became part of the <span>Dzungar Khanate,</span> themselves began to cause concern to the inhabitants of Tarsk district.  This was the reason that the local governor in 1627 sent messengers to the capital with a request to found a prison at the mouth of Omi.  Although everyone understood the need for such a step, circumstances prevented its implementation for a long time.  Under Peter the Great, under the leadership of Colonel Ivan Buchholz, an expedition was set up, which built a fortress on Lake Yamyshevsky.  Its appearance was hostile to the Dzungars, who besieged the Russian fort, and after the expedition members left it, they destroyed it to the ground.  Nevertheless, Ivan Buchholz did not give up and, going to the mouth of Omi, founded a new fortress there.  Scientists believe that this event occurred on May 4-5, 1716 according to the old style, which means that the date of foundation of Omsk is May 16.  Despite this, for several decades, City Day has been celebrated on the first Sunday of August. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  18 century </h2><p>  The main event of this period was the construction of a stone fortress in 50 years.  Initially, this structure was conceived as the most significant fortification in the east of the Russian Empire.  Due to frequent fires, the city that arose around it was rebuilt several times, often unsystematically.  In 1785, by decree of Empress Catherine the Second, the emblem of the city of Omsk was approved, which is used today with some changes. </p>

    <h2>  19th century </h2><p>  The history of the city of Omsk from the very beginning is closely connected with exiles and convicts.  In particular, the Decembrists N. Basargin, N. Chizhov, V. Shteingel and many others were in exile there. </p><p>  In the 19th century, Omsk became the administrative center of the West-Siberian Governor-General, and then Stepnoy.  In the years 1850-1854.  the great Russian writer F.M.Dostoevsky was imprisoned in a local prison.  He left invaluable testimonies about life in the city during that period of its history, which can be found on the pages of the book Notes from the Dead House. </p><p>  In the years 1894-1895.  the Trans-Siberian Railway passed through the city.  This event had a huge impact on the development of Omsk.  He turned it into a major transport hub in the south of Siberia, and trade and industry began to develop there. </p><h2>  The beginning of the 20th century </h2><p>  The emergence of industrial enterprises and large railway depots led to the formation of revolutionary circles.  In 1905, Omsk took part in mass rallies to support the capital's proletariat. </p><p>  At the end of 1914, the construction of the Railway Directorate began in the city with the help of Hungarian prisoners of war, and a few months later the Omsk water supply was opened. </p>

    <p>  The revolutionary events in Petrograd quickly resonated with the workers of the city.  Immediately, new authorities and the Red Guard were formed.  At the same time, rebellion attempts were repeatedly made in the city, during which the streets of Omsk became places of fighting.  One of the most difficult periods in the history of the city was the second half of 1918.  Already in the middle of summer, Omsk was abandoned by the Bolsheviks, and the so-called Provisional Government settled there, which included A.V. Kolchak.  Thus, during the Civil War, the city was the capital of White Russia. </p><h2>  In the Soviet period </h2><p>  In 1921, an event occurred that did not have the best effect on the development of the <span>city: the functions of the</span> administrative center of Siberia were transferred to Novonikolaevsk, which was later renamed Novosibirsk.  The situation changed only after the war.  In 1947, Omsk was allocated to an independent administrative center with its own special budget and was categorized as a city of republican subordination.  The transformation of the city into a large industrial metropolis was also facilitated by the fact that during the WWII many industrial giants from the European part of the country were evacuated there.  As a result, a synthetic rubber plant and an oil refinery were founded.  Over time, the borders of the city gradually expanded, new streets of Omsk appeared: Herzen Bogdan, Khmelnitsky, etc., as well as areas such as the town of Neftyanikov. </p>
