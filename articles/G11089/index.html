The coal mines, built by the Russians, and then the French and British, concentrated a large amount of labor around them.  Today, there is a beautiful modern city of Karaganda. </p><h2>  From the first settlements to a powerful industrial center </h2><p>  To work in the mines, residents of the nearest villages were involved.  As the extraction of workers began to increase, there was a shortage.  This problem was solved by exiled convicts who worked in the faces for free. </p>

The houses settled down, collapsed, new ones grew in their place.  Overgrown settlements began to form in villages.  In 1931, a mining village, with the light hand of those in power, acquired the status of a working village.
