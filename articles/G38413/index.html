    <p>  A homemade toy always has many advantages, ranging from personal preferences to the quality of the products included in the composition.  This is a great solution for allergy sufferers who are very sensitive to a variety of synthetic odors.  In addition, such home-made animals come out at times cheaper than the purchased options. </p><p>  So, today our hero will be a <span>crocheted crochet toy dog, patterns and description of</span> which we will analyze in detail.  We will pay great attention to all the details, difficulties and features of the work, so that this lesson is understandable even for beginners. </p><h2>  For work without care </h2>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet crochet patterns and description" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2047466.jpg"></div>  To start the knitting process, you need to prepare the necessary materials.  Since this is, first of all, a knitted dog (crochet), the scheme and description of which will be considered by us later, special attention should be paid to the filler.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At present, there is a choice on the market, and the variety is so great that you instantly lose your mind.  Therefore, you need a determinant in advance what qualities crocheted dogs with schemes and description should have. </p><p>  For example, if you want the product to have relaxing effects, then polystyrene balls will be an ideal option.  In another case, softness and lightness will add synthetic winterizer, holofiber and synthetic winterizer.  And if you are trying to create an organic clean toy, then sawdust and wood shavings will perfectly help you in this matter. </p><h2>  Warm threads </h2><p>  As for yarn, you can also talk for a very long time.  For all its diversity, first of all, be based on your preferences.  So, if you do not want the knitted product to be covered with spools, fluffed and electrified, then yarn with a high content of synthetic fibers is perfect for you.  And vice versa, if you need a crocheted dog, the scheme and description of which we will describe a little later, had an air gun, then choose a mohair or thread with a large percentage of natural wool. </p><p>  In addition, you should not face the process of making toys to run to the store for new skeins of yarn.  Due to the fact that the product is knitted in a special technique, we need a small amount of thread, trimming and the remains of which will definitely be found in your home. </p><h2>  What is amigurumi </h2>

    <p>  Do not be afraid of such a name when you hear it for the first time, since the complexity of pronunciation and memorization of a word is completely not justified in practice.  So, amigurumi is the Japanese art of crocheting different toys.  This can be almost imperceptible animals, as well as large-scale pillows, caps and other elements containing many details. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Since this is an eastern current, it is accompanied by very cute faces, colors and shapes of toys.  In addition, the silhouette of amigurumi is its main feature, thanks to which it is so recognizable around the world.  Round shapes, slightly bulky heads, a huge number of tiny details: all this emphasizes the individuality of this style of knitting.  These will be our crocheted <span>amigurumi</span> dogs <span>, the schemes</span> and description of which we will consider in detail right now. </p><h2>  Some more necessary </h2>

    <p>  When listing, we did not name all the necessary components of which the toy will consist.

Therefore, his choice is yours, as it directly depends on the thickness of the yarn.  In addition, when buying a tool, pay attention to the handle and its connection with the metal part, because this is the main place of failure, even for a new thing. </li><li>  Beads or ready-made eyes to create a muzzle. </li><li>  Thread floss.  They will also help us add the individual characteristics of the toy face. </li></ul><h2>  Special characters </h2><p>  Also, during the manufacture of a crochet dog (with diagrams and a description), we will introduce you to the special abbreviations that are often used in knitting circles.

It is a certain basis of any toy and is done in literally a couple of seconds. </li><li>  RLS - SC.  This is the second ‚Äúpattern‚Äù to be used in the amigurumi technique, since it is very small and neat, and the canvas of the finished product looks very solid. </li><li>  UB - the usual process of reducing loops. </li><li>  PR is the reverse process of adding loops to it. </li><li>  VP - an air loop is the basis of the basis of any product crocheted. </li></ul><h2>  Crochet dogs: schemes and description of the process </h2>

    <p>  It's time to start making toys.  In order to make everything clear and no questions arise, we will write down all the steps as detailed as possible.  This will not only simplify the process of perceiving information, but also speed up the process of work. </p><ul><li>  To begin with, we will tie the upper paws: for this, we will make an amigurumi ring (KA) and knit 6 single crochet columns (RLS) into it with the color of the future toy dog.  Tighten the ring a bit to give it a neat shape.  Now, in a new row, in each single crochet (RLS), we make two of the same loops: total in a row will be 12 finished loops. </li><li>  Now we make an increase every second single crochet (RLS) to get 18 loops in a row.  Thus, we gradually increase the handle, then knit two columns (RLS) in every third element.  If you count, then at the end you should get 24 loops. </li><li>  Now we change the color of the thread, as the blouse sleeve begins.  You choose its color yourself, and we will take lime.  We knit the first row with a thread of a new color, and then make a decrease (UB).  To do this, you need to knit each 3 and 4 loops together.  As a result, you will have 18 single crochets (RLS). </li><li>  Now, from the seventh to the twenty-fourth rows, we simply knit all the single crochet (RLS) columns.  As a result, we get a long "pipe" of green color.  When all the rows are ready, we fill the foot, leaving a little empty space, fold the pipe hole in half and carefully knit the loops together, getting the finished part.  We also make the second foot. </li><li>  We turn to the manufacture of hind legs: we knit a heel of dark yarn, gaining a chain of 10 air loops (VP).  Now, starting from the second loop, we knit 8 single crochet (RLS), in the 9th loop we make an increase (PR) of five columns and again 8 single crochet (RLS).  We make the 1st column (RLS) in a new row, in the 2nd we make an increase (PR), we knit another 6 loops, in the next two columns we make the 1st increase (PR), and then we create 2 more columns without a crochet ( SBZ). </li><li>  We knit the next half in the mirror order, as we knitted the first part, getting 28 loops at the end of the row.  In the new row we make 10 single crochet (SBZ), in the next 9 loops we do the 1st increase, and then again 10 loops.  Total 38 columns that complete the heel. </li><li>  Now we take a crochet thread of the color of the hair of our dog, we gradually get acquainted with the schemes and description of which, and we knit all 38 columns.  In a new row, we knit 10 loops, and the next 12 we make decreases (UB), completing the row again with 10 columns.  Then we knit 12 loops, 5 columns of decrease and again 12 loops.  We start the row with 8 single crochet, make 6 columns of decrease, turning them into 3 columns, and end the row, 9 loops.  In total, 23 columns are obtained. </li></ul>

    <p>  We change the thread to a dark color depicting pants, we knit the first 23 single crochet (RLS).  We knit in this way from the 10th to the 23rd rows.  At the first leg we cut the thread, carefully tucking it into the canvas, and at the second - leave it untouched.  Do not forget to put the filler. </p><h2>  Soft tummy </h2><p>  Now that the legs and handles are ready, we proceed to the manufacture of the body.  It was not for nothing that we left the thread on one of the lower paws, since it is from it that we will continue to knit the body of the toy. </p><ol><li>  In the 23rd row, we knit all the loops on the leg, then we collect 10 air loops and again 23 columns near the second leg.  The resulting 56 loops we knit the next 3 rows.  And in the 4th row we decrease, getting 50 SC  Thus we knit 4 rows. </li><li>  In the 5th row, we reduce the total number of loops by 7 parts, change the thread to the green color of the sweater and knit 43 loops of 3 rows.  Again we decrease by 6 loops, but we already do 11 rows of 36 columns, again we decrease by 6 loops and we knit 2 rows.  In the next row, we decrease another 6 loops, make one row and leave the thread for further fastening. </li><li>  We knit the head according to the scheme below, having typed 60 loops, make 9 rows, and then we go down, filling it with a synthetic winterizer in advance. </li></ol><h2>  Mustache, Bows and Tail </h2><p>  We knit the ears and muzzle according to the same pattern, but of different colors, making an amigurumi ring, picking up columns in it and knitting rows.  In the end, you should get a "cup" from which we will make the ears, folded in half, and knit the muzzle, fill the blank with synthetic winterizer. </p>

On the head, you can add a dark spot, like in real dogs, a stick of sticking out wool.  Now that we have crocheted dogs with a description and patterns for us, we can safely please ourselves and loved ones with homemade toys! </p>
