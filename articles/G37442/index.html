  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The location of the abdominal organs of a person.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The anatomy of the human abdominal cavity is of great interest to those who still have insufficient knowledge in this area.  Therefore, we will get to know better the <span>internal organs of the human</span> body.  The abdominal cavity includes a space located under the diaphragm in the human body, which fills the abdominal organs.  The abdominal cavity is separated from the thoracic cavity using the diaphragm.  In the lower part of the <span>abdominal cavity</span> passes into the pelvic area. </p><p>  What is the <span>location of the</span> abdominal organs?  It is divided directly into the peritoneum and into a space called retroperitoneal.  It is lined with a serous membrane, passing to the abdominal viscera.  The anatomy of the abdominal organs is constructed in such a way that due to the presence of the epithelial cover and serous fluid, the friction of the surfaces of the organs in contact with each other is eliminated.  The abdominal wall in front and on the sides limits the location of the abdominal organs, including the digestive tract, liver, spleen, gall bladder, kidneys, adrenal glands, and ureter.  Also, the wall is penetrated by muscles, connective tissue formations, fatty tissue.  Blood vessels supply blood to all organs. </p><p>  The location of the abdominal organs is maintained in an upright position thanks to the muscles of the anterior wall, called the <span>abdominal press.</span>  In addition, muscles protect internal organs from various external influences. </p><p>  In the upper part of the peritoneum there is a stomach in which food is processed.  The amount of food taken affects the size of the stomach.  It looks like a pouch.  The stomach is represented by the cardinal part (inlet), body, bottom and outlet. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The digestive tube called the intestine, ending at the anus, provides a way out of the stomach.  It is the walls of the intestine that absorb a significant part of the nutrients. </p><p>  The spleen is a separate organ of the lymph system.  However, due to its location, a closer connection of the <span>circulatory system</span> is carried out <span>.</span>  The spleen has an elongated body, and it is located under the left hypochondrium.  Its role is very important in the metabolic process, especially if it is associated with the exchange of iron. </p><p>  The area of â€‹â€‹the upper abdominal cavity is occupied by the liver.  Using ligaments, it attaches to the abdominal wall, diaphragm, and directly to the stomach and intestines.  The liver covers the fibrous membrane.  The structure of the liver is soft, but rather dense, with a red-brown color.  The main functions of the liver are the formation of bile and its secretion. </p><p>  <span>The gall bladder</span> is part <span>of the digestive</span> system.  Its functions are the accumulation of bile and its concentration, as well as the regulation and maintenance of duct pressure at the proper level.  This organ is located on the right side of the liver in its lower part.  The shape of the gallbladder resembles a pear.  The extensibility of its walls allows you to hold the liquid about two hundred milliliters. </p><p>  The kidneys are one of the most important organs.  They are located on both sides of the spine.  Their role is to remove the final products resulting from metabolism, as well as the removal of fluid from the body. </p><p>  Above the upper part of the kidneys are the adrenal glands.  They have a brain substance responsible for the release of adrenaline and norepinephrine into the blood.  Lipid production occurs in the cortex. </p><p>  The location of the abdominal organs is controlled by ultrasound.  His method is one of the most affordable, safe and painless, allowing you to diagnose a disease at an early stage of its development. </p>
