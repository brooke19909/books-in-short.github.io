Accumulative-mortgage housing system for military personnel</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The time when everyone could get housing from the state is over.  Now the solution of the housing problem falls on the shoulders of those in need.  Since 2005, a special system of the Target Housing Loan (LHL) for the military has been operating.  The essence of this program will be discussed in this article. </p><h2>  Mortgage </h2><p>  To buy an apartment as a pledge through a bank, you need to make a down payment and pay a certain amount of money every month.  Such a scheme may be suitable for representatives of typical professions with a stable income level, but not for people who have devoted their entire lives to public service.  Especially for them, in 2004, the government developed a funded mortgage system (NIS). </p><p>  The essence of the program is as follows.  A NIS participant receives a monthly subsidy in his account, which he can use only to pay an advance on a mortgage.  In 2013, its size was 18.5 thousand rubles.  During the year, 222 thousand rubles could be accumulated.  The size of the subsidy is the same for all employees, but annually it is indexed upwards.  In 2014, this amount amounted to 233.1 thousand rubles.  36 months after participating in the program, you can submit a report on the issuance of a certificate (CL) for a soldier.  This is the starting point in obtaining a mortgage.  Although the money goes to the borrower's account, he cannot use it until a certain time.  Therefore, formally, a person receives funds in loans.  The program is aimed not only at providing housing for a certain category of citizens, but also at forming an army.  Having received a loan from the state, a person cannot quit of his own free will.  Otherwise, you will have to return all the funds to the budget. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Money accumulated in the borrower's account is multiplied by investing using reliable financial instruments.  Funds can be received in cash only after dismissal from service and under certain conditions. </p><h2>  Further actions </h2><p>  After receiving the documents, it's time to start searching for the apartment.  The certificate of ZHZ for the serviceman is the approval of the borrower by the bank, confirmation of its solvency.  Apartments can be chosen in a finished house or a new building.

Papers are considered up to 10 days.  After receiving approval, the employee must appear in the department to sign the contract.  Another 12 days are spent on transferring funds from the Federal State Institution ‚ÄúRosvoenipoteka‚Äù to the bank.  The transaction amount is equal to the down payment.  Then, the borrower‚Äôs account has its own and credit funds.  This money is received by the seller after registration of documents and transfer <span>of ownership.</span>  This is how a loan is issued for military personnel under a contract. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Who can participate in the program? </h2><p>  According to the Federal Law No. 117 ‚ÄúOn NIS‚Äù, these may be military men who serve on a contract basis in the ranks of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.

Since the size of the subsidy is annually regulated by law, the limit is calculated taking into account indexation, forecast values ‚Äã‚Äãof the inflation rate and interest rate.  Funds are transferred to a bank account only for making an advance payment or monthly loan installments. </p><h2>  Algorithm for obtaining ZHZZ </h2><p>  1. Report to the unit commander. </p><p>  2. Federal State Institution "Rosvoenipoteka" draws up a certificate. </p><p>  3. Calculation of the maximum loan amount. </p><p>  4. Search for an apartment. </p><p>  5.

Then it is sent by express mail to one of the branches of the Federal State Institution ‚ÄúRosvoenipoteka‚Äù or to the unit commander.  The document is valid for 6 months.  If during this time the certificate has not been implemented, it must be submitted to the local branch of the Federal State Institution. </p><h2>  How is a loan repaid for military personnel? </h2><p>  After 20 years of service, the money used within the framework of the NIS is transferred from the category of a special-purpose loan to a non-paid subsidy.  If a person leaves before this period, he must return the funds with interest within 10 years.  The contract ZHZZ provides an annuity scheme for debt repayment. </p><h2>  Insurance Nuances </h2><p>  The bank may resell the mortgage.  When changing ownership, the borrower needs to amend the insurance contract.  The soldier learns about this from an official letter from the bank.  After receiving the notice, you must come to the insurance company and re-sign the contract within the agreed period. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="contract zhz" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/711956.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Military mortgage: Sberbank, VTB </h2><p>  The borrower can independently choose a <span>credit institution</span> for execution of the contract.  The conditions are almost the same everywhere: </p><p>  - the minimum age of the borrower is 21 years; </p><p>  - at the time of completion of the contract, a soldier must be under 46 years old. </p><p>  The difference lies in the interest rate and the maximum amount that can be obtained under the Military Mortgage program.  Sberbank provides loans to its customers at 10-12% per annum for 20 years, subject to a 10% down payment.  The maximum amount is 2.17 million rubles.  Based on the stipulated conditions, the age limit of the borrower at the time of signing the documents is 25 years.  A big advantage of this scheme is a small fee for using borrowed funds.  For comparison: the <span>interest rate</span> on any other mortgage program of Sberbank starts at 12%.  VTB provides loans to military personnel for up to 14 years at 12.5% ‚Äã‚Äãper annum.  The borrower must pay at least 20% of the cost of housing in advance.  The maximum loan amount is 1.9 million rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="target housing loan" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/711949.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What do you need to know at the bank? </h2><p>  Ask your financial institution staff for the following information: </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ loan limit; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ list of required documents; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ creditor requirements for the acquired premises; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ A list of partners accredited by AHML, when it comes to buying an apartment in the primary market. </p><p>  Until the approval of housing by a credit institution, you should not transfer money from a savings account.  Not the fact that the seller wants to return the deposit if the bank refuses to issue a loan. </p><p>  Acquired housing becomes the property of a soldier from the moment of registration of documents.  But the right to dispose of it will be limited, as it is a guarantee of repayment of the loan.  The owner will not be able to sell real estate until he has completely paid off the debt to the bank. </p><h2>  A few more nuances </h2><p>  1. A NIS participant may reside in the purchased housing, rent it out (subject to permission from the Federal State Institution Rosvoenipoteka). </p><p>  2. Military personnel are entitled to a tax deduction.  Refunds are made to funds paid in excess of the ZHZZ, as well as the costs of finishing and designing an apartment in a new building.  A deduction is possible while the total amount of expenses does not exceed 2 million rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="VTB military loan" class="if" height="471" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/711958.jpg" width="475"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  ZHZZ for a soldier - confirmation of the solvency of the client, the ability to buy an apartment on credit on favorable terms.  After 3 years of participation in the NIS, you can apply for a certificate.  Based on this document, the bank calculates the maximum loan amount.  Then you can begin to search for a specific offer on the market.  Mortgage conditions are as follows: a loan is provided at a preferential interest (10-12.5%) for a period of up to 20 years.  The amount accumulated under the program is used to pay the advance payment, and then to pay off part of the monthly payment.  After 20 years of participation in the NIS, money can be withdrawn in cash. </p>
