    <h2>  Mechanical damage </h2><p>  If the <span>remote control from the TV does not work</span> and there are obvious signs of mechanical damage on its body, this may indicate that it was simply dropped to the floor or intentionally tried to render it inoperative.  The consequence of such handling of the device may be: </p><ul><li>  lack of contact between the batteries and the electrical terminals of the console; </li><li>  damage to the transmitting LED; </li><li>  violation of the integrity of the conductive tracks or (and) the conclusions of the electrical components on the board. </li></ul><h2>  The TV remote does not work: what to do and where to start </h2><p>  Diagnostics is best started with batteries.  When the device falls, it is they most often become the cause of its failure.  The check itself is to remove the cover of the remote control and check the position of the batteries.  If necessary, they must be reinstalled, observing the polarity.  Pay attention to how tightly their contacts are in contact with the electrical terminals of the device.  If the batteries are loose, you may need to bend the negative terminals (springs). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  If after such events the <span>remote control for the TV is</span> working, close the lid and continue to use it further.  If this does not happen, go to the next stage of diagnosis. </p><h2>  Battery charge </h2><p>  After removing the cover of the device for checking batteries, do not be too lazy to check the value of their charge.  Although the remote control consumes a minimum amount of power to support its operation, the batteries gradually drain. </p><p>  Testing is best done using a conventional voltmeter or multimeter.  To do this, you just need to measure the voltage at the contacts of the batteries.  It should not be less than 1 V. </p><p>  If you do not have such devices, you can check the <span>batteries for the TV remote control</span> by using them in another remote control device, such as a DVD, <span>stereo</span> system, air conditioner, etc. </p><p>  You can also insert obviously healthy batteries into our device.  After making sure that they are suitable both in size and in the magnitude of the output voltage, remove them from another console and install them in the diagnosed one.  Check showed that it was the batteries that failed?  Just replace them. </p><h2>  Check LED </h2><p>  The transmitting LED plays a major role in the operation of the console.  It consists in transmitting an infrared signal of a certain frequency to a special TV receiver.  First of all, inspect the LED for damage.  If it is broken, the only way out is to replace it.  You will have to go to the radio market or to a store specializing in the sale of radio components, buy the same element and solder it to the damaged place. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Does the LED seem to be whole?  Check how it works.  It is impossible to do this with the naked eye, since the infrared radiation does not perceive the human eye.  One of the modern devices equipped with a camera will help here.  It can be a mobile phone, smartphone, tablet, etc. Turn on the camera on it and point it at the remote control LED.  Now try switching channels while looking at the device screen.  With a working diode, you will definitely see light signals when you press the remote control keys.  But if no reaction has followed, most likely, the matter is not in the light element. </p><h2>  Damage inside the device </h2><p>  Mechanical damage can be hidden from your eyes.  If the <span>remote control from the TV has fallen and does not work</span> , and something is hanging inside, there is a possibility that he received a closed ‚Äúinjury‚Äù, which disabled him.  Due to the fall, the wire may break off, the output of, for example, some capacitor may fall off, or the conductive path may crack.  Here you already have to completely disassemble the device. </p><p>  <span>Repair of remotes</span> that have received damage to the board or its elements is, of course, best left to professionals, but if you ever held a soldering iron in your hands, you can try to deal with this yourself. </p><p>  First, open the device.  You are lucky if the remote control case from your TV is fastened with screws.  In this case, you need to unscrew them and disconnect the parts of the device.  If the case is fastened with internal latches, you have to sweat a little. </p><p>  A knife with a thin, blunt blade will help disconnect the parts of the remote control.  It must be inserted between the halves and, gently squeezing, disconnect them from each other, passing in a circle.  When this is done, disassemble the remote control and carefully inspect the board for damage.  Use a magnifying glass for these purposes.  Minor defects with the naked eye can not be seen.  It is also desirable to provide good illumination of the place where the inspection will be conducted. </p>

    <p>  Testing starts from the findings that go to the batteries.  Next, inspect all the tracks, and then the electrical parts.  Having found an open in the electrical circuit of the console, repair it by repairing or replacing a damaged part.  In case of damage to microcircuits, it is better to buy a new remote control than to try to repair it.  At least it will be cheaper. </p><h2>  When individual buttons do not work </h2><p>  Often the reason that the <span>remote control from the TV does not work</span> is the condition of the rubber keyboard.  The lower part of the buttons is covered with a conductive graphite layer, which, in fact, closes the contacts located on the board.  It happens that this layer wears out from constant use, and it also happens that dust, moisture, foreign objects get between it and the contacts. </p><p>  Depreciation usually falls on those keys that we use most: </p><ul><li>  on-off; </li><li>  channel switching; </li><li>  increase-decrease the volume level. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Incomprehensible oily liquid </h2><p>  Having found that the <span>remote control from the TV does not work,</span> and disassembling it, you can see a colorless oily liquid on the bottom of the keyboard.  Do not rush to blame your relatives for the fact that one of them spilled sunflower oil or sweet tea on the device.  This fluid is nothing but the fat secreted from the pores of the fingers.  During the operation of the remote control, it settles on the buttons, as a result of which contact between them and the platforms is lost. </p><p>  This problem is solved very simply.  It is enough to disassemble the remote control, wipe the board and the bottom of the keyboard with alcohol, and the device will work like new.  Before starting operation after such a procedure, be sure to dry the wiped elements. </p><h2>  Is it possible to restore the faded graphite layer? </h2><p>  What should I do if the conductive graphite layer on the bottom of the keyboard of the remote control device is worn out?  It can be restored.  <span>Repair of consoles</span> with damaged conductive spraying involves its removal and the creation of a new one in its place.  But what to make of it? </p><p>  There are two options.  The first is to buy a special kit for repairing remotes in a radio parts store.  The composition of this set includes a tube of silicone glue and several dozen rubber patches (overlays on the bottom of the buttons) coated with the same graphite.  You are required to disassemble the remote control, carefully cut off the old linings, and stick new ones in their place.  This repair allows you to completely restore the device for a long time. </p><p>  The second option does not imply any costs at all.  Take the usual chocolate foil, cut the right amount of pads out of it, keeping the size, and stick them on top of the worn patch.  Of course, this budget repair will not ensure the uninterrupted operation of the remote control for many years, but believe me, it will still serve. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The remote control from the TV has fallen and does not work" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22080/1527099.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Will the film help </h2><p>  You must have seen remote control devices wrapped in plastic wrap.  This method, of course, was invented by our compatriots in order to protect the remote control from the possible consequences of careless handling of it.  Yes, the film is able to temporarily protect the device from moisture and dust.  But over time, it loses its protective properties due to the same intensive use.  Is it worth it to turn the remote control into an incomprehensible and funny object - you decide. </p><h2>  How to extend the life of the TV remote control </h2><p>  To keep your TV remote control for as long as possible, use the tips below: </p><ol><li>  Try to handle it carefully, avoiding falling to the floor. </li><li>  Do not give the remote control to children and protect it from "encroachment" of pets. </li><li>  Monitor the status of the LED. </li><li>  Do not forget to change the batteries on time. </li><li>  Do not use the remote control when your hands are dirty or while eating. </li></ol>
