The number of its inhabitants is increasing due to natural growth, and due to visitors, a huge number of whom, having lived here for a while, also become Muscovites.  And every person wants to have housing.  The new residential complex “Heart of the Capital”, being built almost in the center of the city, will help to fulfill the dreams of several thousand Muscovites.  This complex is designed so that its residents have everything at hand.  We offer detailed information about how the construction of the residential complex is carried out, and about the features of buying real estate here. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Residential complex "Heart of the capital" began to be erected in the North-Western administrative district of the Russian capital.  It will be an amazingly beautiful place a stone's throw from the banks of the Moscow River, however, in order for gardens to grow here, you need to reanimate the soil.  The traffic intersection is now convenient for car enthusiasts, as the Yaroslavskoye Shosse passes near the ZhK, the TTK is just 1,600 meters, Kutuzovsky Prospekt is 4 km, Garden Ring is 8 km, and Moscow Ring Road is 13 km.  For those who use public transport and, in particular, the subway, while the amenities are small.  The “Heart of the Capital” residential complex, as planned by the designers, will grow relatively close to several metro stations, such as Mezhdunarodnaya, Vystavochnaya, Fili, Khoroshevo, but they need to be reached by bus.  Walk to the nearest "International" at an average pace to go more than half an hour.  But in the future, in the immediate vicinity of the residential complex, it is planned to open a new Shelepikha station, which can be reached on foot for a couple of minutes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  An undoubted plus is the fact that the Heart of Moscow complex is being built about 3 km from the Moscow City DC. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ZhK Heart of the capital" class="if" height="296" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1578941.jpg" width="509"></div>

    <h2>  What's next to the LCD </h2><p>  Those who have already bought or are going to buy apartments in a new residential complex have many questions about the correct choice of location for the “Heart of the Capital” residential complex.  Everyone knows that the industrial zone is located around it.  And it scares people.  Not far from the future handsome complex, there are silicate and cement plants, concrete goods plants, industrial warehouses.  They promise to close them, demolish the buildings, and build urban infrastructure at that place, but no one has seen the demolition plan yet.  People are also alarmed by a pre-trial detention center located in about one and a half km, which no one is planning to transfer.  And finally, the third object, which haunts many, is a cargo station and a railway station.  a branch that runs a few hundred meters from the “Heart of the Capital”.  While it is considered reserve, therefore, the movement of trains on it is rare.  But there are fears that they plan to make this branch a passenger one and run fast trains on it. </p><h2>  Information about the developer </h2><p>  Perhaps, it is already known to everyone that the residential complex “Heart of the Capital” has one of the most venerable developers in Moscow, a leader among the city’s real estate developers holding Don-Stroy.  The company was founded in 1994 and at first was engaged in both residential and commercial real estate.  In 2009, the restructuring was carried out, and now Don-Stroy Invest is engaged in housing, although the old Donstroy brand has been preserved.  The new structure is owned by 5 legal shareholders who do not disclose their names.  During the restructuring period, the company was shocked by economic turmoil, and the inability of Donstroy to pay off debts forced attempts to sell subsidiaries for pennies.  But afterwards everything somehow settled down.  Now Donstroy is among the ten largest construction companies in the capital and is engaged in the construction of a business-class residential complex. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Heart of the capital deadline" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1578943.jpg" width="509"></div>  In his piggy bank "Scarlet Sails", "Grand DeLux on Plyushchikha", "Triumph Palace" and many others.  In 2013, Donstroy turned its eyes to the Shelepikhinskaya embankment, where in 2014 the construction of a new residential complex “Heart of the Capital” began.  What are the advantages investors see in this company?  First of all, these are indicators of their work, namely, already completed facilities.  What worries people?  Firstly, the deterioration in the quality of work, a striking indicator of what the falling elevators.  The last incident occurred at the yet unsubmitted facility "Heart of the Capital", where 5 workers were killed immediately.  There are complaints about the quality of internal work in apartments.  Secondly, violation of contractual terms.  The Novolipetsk MK even sued Donstroy over the deadline for <span>putting the house</span> in Mosfilmovskaya Street.  Regarding the LCD “Heart of the Capital”, a deviation from the previously planned key collection dates is also planned.  For example, ZhD5 according to official documents will not be delivered by March 31, 2020, but by October 31, 2020, that is, 7 months later.  And the last thing that alarms people is the frequent litigation with Donstroi.  They were about the house on Mosfilmovskaya Street, the Komsomolsky de Lux apart-hotel, with investigative authorities about financial violations and others.

More than half of them are designed with beveled walls, that is, irregularly shaped.  A separate room in them singles out only a bathroom with an area of ​​4 squares. </p><p>  Two-room apartments have an area of ​​up to 65 squares.

Balconies are not provided. </p><h2>  Price and payment </h2><p>  The cost of housing in the residential complex "Heart of the Capital" is high and, as stated on the official website, started from 8,122,592 Russian rubles for a one-room apartment on the second floor (ground floors are designed to accommodate offices there), an area of ​​32.8 square meters without decoration.  At this facility, Donstroy works with the following banks: VTB-24, Otkritie, and Sberbank.  Everyone can take a mortgage to purchase real estate in the "Heart of the Capital".

    <h2>  Innovative program from the developer </h2><p>  To increase sales growth and attract more buyers to the program, Donstroy proposed a very interesting and, one might say, innovative program for buying housing in the residential complex “Heart of the Capital”.  According to company representatives, it is proposed to draw up a contract certified by legal structures, according to which Donstroy undertakes to buy out its real estate exactly 3 years later from the co-investor at the price that was at the time of sale.  In this case, the company must additionally pay co-investor 4.5% per annum. </p><h2>  LCD "Heart of the capital": deadline </h2><p>  This question worries both those who have already bought their homes, and those who are just eyeing.  Looking at the state of the facilities being built, we can confidently say that things are not standing still.  According to the new plan, the delivery of the first stage with the issuance of keys is expected in the fourth quarter of 2017.  It included buildings numbered 1,2 and 3. The first is a 37-storey building number 1, the keys to apartments in which people should receive in the second quarter, that is, the first half of 2017.  In the second turn, it is planned to put into operation buildings No. 4, 5, 6 and 7. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ZhK Heart of the capital Moscow" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1578954.jpg" width="502"></div>  At the first stage, ZhD4 (the second quarter of 2018) should be commissioned, and at the second building 5.6 and 7 (the fourth quarter of 20218).  The third stage includes 2 apart-buildings, a business center, a school and a kindergarten.  Their delivery, possibly, will be carried out in 2020.  The builders began the construction of the second stage, as evidenced by the progress of construction of the railway station 4. LCD “Heart of the capital” in 2015 opened the sale of apartments in it.  Now they are selling housing in ZhD6.  Today, the first building is almost finished, the construction of the second and third is nearing completion, and in the fourth all construction work is proceeding rapidly.
