    <p>  Everyone dreams of a new apartment.  To be large, comfortable, spacious and bright.  And most importantly, his!  <span>Living with parents</span> until old age is not a good prospect, therefore, a young family wants to live independently.  However, the dream of having a normal apartment for many people may remain a dream, because not all citizens of Russia can buy housing. </p><p>  But who is eligible to receive free housing?  How to line up for an apartment?  What is needed for this procedure?  Let's try to understand this process. </p><p>  Today, to collect all the necessary documents so that you are put on the line, a very responsible matter requiring the observance of a number of procedures.  First, you need to find out if you need to improve your living conditions.  Maybe it just seems to you that you are cramped in your mother‚Äôs three-room apartment. </p><p>  Previously, before the adoption of the new Housing Code, it was possible to get housing for everyone who lived in a ‚Äúcramped‚Äù apartment.  However, with the adoption of new regulations, this was not enough. </p><p>  Let's figure it out: how to line up for an apartment in St. Petersburg.  An applicant for a queue must live in the city for 10 years or more, have the status of a poor person and be recognized as needing housing. </p><p>  The LCD of the Russian Federation lists the persons who belong to this category, and the permissible number of meters per person of living space is set by local authorities, for example, the administration of St. Petersburg. </p><p>  Persons <span>are recognized as poor</span> whose monthly income is not more than two minimum subsistence levels, and the value of their own property subject to taxation was not higher than ten times the average value of one meter of area in the housing market.  In addition, this category of citizens includes families with three or more children, veterans of war and military operations, families with children with disabilities, people with disabilities, etc. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you live in a communal apartment, then you can queue up for registration in need of housing. </p><p>  In other words: now it is necessary for the family to have a low total income, only inexpensive property should be in the ownership of family members and the footage of the housing should be less than that established by the local authorities. </p><p>  Moreover, the one who decides how to queue for an apartment should in no case intentionally worsen his living conditions for the last 5 years. </p><p>  Suppose you are recognized as really needing housing.  What are the next steps? </p><p>  How to queue for an apartment: consider the main stages. </p><p>  First, you must contact the appropriate municipal authority and get an extensive list of certificates and documents that must be submitted so that your application for registration will be considered. </p><p>  When all the necessary documents are collected, a statement is written and signed, you should contact the social security department.  If your family has truly been officially recognized as poor, then the next stage must begin. </p><p>  Now it is necessary to apply to the local council for queuing for an apartment, again collecting a huge pile of various documents.  This package includes: an application for registration, passports or birth certificates of all family members, a certificate from the EC ON about the presence or absence of other housing in the family.  If benefits are provided for housing, then documents are needed to confirm them.  In addition, you need certificates of income for all family members, income for a certain period from the tax office, even a certificate of the presence or absence of any vehicles from the traffic police. </p><p>  In each district, the list of required documents may vary, but you can only say with confidence that it is really large, and it will take more than one day to prepare it. </p><p>  Your application and collected documents are reviewed within a month.  After a positive resolution of the issue, your family is put on a waiting list for an apartment, as it needs to improve living conditions.  And after all this there is a wait ... </p><p>  In general, you understand how to queue for an apartment.  With a successful outcome of the entire procedure, the expectation may stretch for more than a dozen years. </p>
