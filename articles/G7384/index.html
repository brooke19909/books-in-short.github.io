    <h2>  Types of Fishnet Scarves </h2><p>  The classification of scarves as such does not exist.  They can be conditionally divided into the following: </p><ul><li>  Knitted in a simple one-piece pattern. </li><li>  Made up of fragments. </li><li>  With a composition of several ornaments. </li></ul><p>  The first method of making a scarf is quite simple: one rectangular piece is knitted according to the scheme to the desired length.  It is not easy, but real to make a scarf cloth from separately connected motifs.  As a rule, experienced and self-confident knitters or those who have more curiosity and excitement than fear of difficult tasks take up such painstaking work. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="openwork scarf knitting scheme and description" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1240496.jpg" width="369"></div>

    <p>  Often volume cones, bundles and braids of various complexity join them.  The disadvantage of such models is the presence of the wrong side, which can significantly spoil the overall appearance.  A carelessly worn accessory completely hides all the beauty and demonstrates the unsightly back of the scarf.  A good solution is a ‚Äúcollar‚Äù, ‚Äúpipe‚Äù or a lace scarf knitted in a circle with knitting needles.  The diagram and description of the patterns for such products can be any.  This article will discuss the simplest models to perform. </p><h2>  Openwork scarf: a pattern for beginners </h2><p>  Among the interesting and attractive ornaments, which are also quite easy to knit, the cobweb pattern occupies a leading position. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting openwork scarves with knitting patterns and description" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1240500.jpg" width="299"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Almost any material is well suited for such a product.  This scarf is openwork, knitting (the scheme and description will follow), knitted, looks great if you knit it from thin <span>mohair, angora, wool</span> , cotton or even viscose.  Depending on the composition of the yarn, this accessory will be a warm addition to an autumn coat or an interesting <span>wrap on your shoulders</span> for cool summer evenings. </p><p>  It should be noted that viscose allows you to get very beautiful and elegant products, but it is quite difficult to work with it because of its silky and smooth surface.  Therefore, cotton and linen will be preferable if you need a summer stole, shawl or openwork scarf with knitting needles (patterns and description of patterns can be with a large number of large holes). </p><h2>  Preparatory Activities </h2><p>  To knit a cobweb pattern, you need to dial such a number of loops that is a multiple of four (since there are exactly so many loops in the rapport), plus two pieces for the edge.  The exact number of loops should only be determined by measuring a control sample.  The peculiarity of this ornament is that in each front row nakida are formed, which are knitted in the wrong side.  The resulting holes significantly expand the canvas, and it is very difficult to determine by eye how many loops will be needed. </p><p>  In addition, knitting a sample allows you to see on a reduced scale how the color and texture of the threads are combined with the selected pattern.  In extreme cases, it is possible to choose a different yarn to get the desired openwork scarf with knitting needles.  Schemes and description, photo of the sample and interpretation of the symbols are shown in the following figure. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spider web pattern" class="if" height="256" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1240501.jpg" width="394"></div>

    <h2>  A set of loops and getting started </h2><p>  When the required width of the product is determined, and the number of loops is calculated, it is time to proceed to knitting the fabric: </p><ol><li>  It is better to collect loops by the traditional method.  It is important that both ends of the scarf are the same (both typesetting and the edge with closed loops).  Perhaps at the end of the work you will need to complete the crochet. </li><li>  The first loop (edge) should always be removed without knitting. </li><li>  Next, to the end of the row, you need to repeat this sequence: 1 wrong loop, 2 facial. </li><li>  In the wrong row, all the loops are knitted in a pattern. </li><li>  After the edge loop, the yarn is made, then three loops should be knitted together, 1 wrong side.  Repeat the sequence to the end of the row. </li></ol><p>  The third (front) row becomes the only one that forms the pattern; therefore, only it is repeated further.  The inside of the loop knit in a pattern. </p><p>  When the product reaches the planned length, all the loops are closed with a hook or knitting.  Performing this action, you need to ensure that you do not tighten the canvas, otherwise the end will differ from the typesetting edge. </p><h2>  <span>We knit a lace scarf with knitting needles: diagrams</span> and a description of more complex patterns </h2><p>  <span>Scarves connected by a</span> wavy pattern look excellent and do not lose their relevance.  Such ornaments are suitable for the manufacture of more decorative and complex-looking products.  In addition, such schemes perfectly help to combine different threads.  They facilitate the connection in one product of several shades, colors and textures. </p><p>  The photo below shows a pattern connected by a wavy pattern.  An openwork scarf made using it with knitting needles (the diagram and description follow later) will have uneven edges. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="openwork knitting scarf diagram and description" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1240495.jpg" width="538"></div>  To make them the same, you should start and end the canvas with five rows of <span>scarf knitting.</span>  A feature of this pattern can be called the presence of openwork and dense sections.  By and large, this ornament is a composition.

    <h2>  Patterns: rules of use </h2><p>  Considering the options for ornaments made up of different patterns, you can notice a certain regularity: between the openwork sections, harnesses (braids) are most often located, even longitudinal posts from front loops or a combination of both. </p><p>  If the craftswoman decides to knit an openwork scarf with such a pattern (the diagram and description require mastery of the basic knitting techniques), she should be careful and carefully make all the calculations.  It is necessary to arrange the pattern so that there are continuous sections along the edges of the scarf.  The number of openwork stripes can be even or odd, it does not matter. </p><p>  It is advisable to provide a narrow bar at the beginning and at the end of the product. </p>
