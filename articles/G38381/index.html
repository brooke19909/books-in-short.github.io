A large water park with water slides is sure to appeal to children.  Tourists also like to stroll through the park complex with the romantic name "Moonlight".  In fact, there are many interesting places on the territory of the city and its environs, so tourists are provided with a rich excursion vacation. </p><h2>  Hotel prices </h2><p>  The cost of living is one of the most important issues for tourists.  And in this regard, the Rose Resort 4 * hotel offers pretty favorable conditions.  Of course, the final cost is influenced by many factors, including the price policy of the travel agency you have chosen, as well as the time of booking, the date of arrival, the selected room, etc. Nevertheless, on average a day at the hotel will cost you about 3000 rubles.  Agree, this is not so much, given the service offered by the hotel and the level of service.  And, of course, do not forget that some services, including excursions, are paid separately. </p><h2>  Hotel Rose Resort 4 *: reviews of Russian tourists </h2><p>  In fact, Kemer is popular with Russian tourists.
