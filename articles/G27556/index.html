    <h2>  "Seliger peak": reviews, advantages </h2><p>  Guests of the Seliger Peak Hotel note the following positive moments of relaxation in this institution: </p><ul><li>  the hotel is located in a very beautiful place with wonderful views;  excellent quality of food in the restaurant; </li><li>  the territory is very large - there is where to walk; </li><li>  the staff is very polite and attentive;  wonderful bath; </li><li>  quiet and calm atmosphere; </li><li>  beautiful views open from the windows of the rooms; </li><li>  glad that the walls of the rooms are lined with wood; </li><li>  happy with the opportunity to relax with pets. </li></ul><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  In addition to the positive, negative feedback is also left about this institution.  Hotel "Seliger Peak" is characterized by the following disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  there are no telephones in the rooms, and therefore, if you have any questions, you have to go to the reception yourself; </li><li>  the prices in the restaurant are too high (apparently, the administration takes advantage of the fact that vacationers have no alternative); </li><li>  there are no air conditioners in the rooms, which is why it is incredibly stuffy there; </li><li>  too many mosquitoes; </li><li>  poor sound insulation, because of which you will hear everything that happens in the neighboring rooms; </li><li>  there are no conditions for children - no playground, no playroom; </li><li>  the territory is poorly looked after (even the grass is not mowed); </li><li>  maids do not replenish hygiene supplies; </li><li>  access to the hotel is difficult due to the terrible quality of roads; </li><li>  the refrigerator does not work well - practically does not freeze;  in houses practically does not catch wireless Internet; </li><li>  the rooms have very old TVs with poor image quality. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the Hotel "Seliger Peak" is an ideal place for fans of a quiet and relaxing holiday in the lap of nature.  The hotel is located in a remote location.  On the one hand, this provides a calm environment, but on the other, access is difficult.  The best option is to take a taxi or own car, but you should be prepared for the fact that the roads here are just disgusting.  In addition, there is no infrastructure nearby (shops, cafes, etc.).  In view of this, the hotel has greatly overestimated prices for both accommodation and food. </p><p>  As for the rooms, their indisputable advantage is the wooden wall cladding, which gives coolness in the summer and warmth in the winter, as well as a pleasant aroma.  But in hot weather the air conditioner is sorely lacking.  In addition, it is worth hanging mosquito nets on the windows, because in the forest zone there are a lot of mosquitoes and other insects.  Also be prepared for the fact that if you do not live in an administrative building, then you will not be able to catch wireless Internet. </p><p>  The hotel area is simply huge, which is an indisputable advantage for lovers of barbecue and outdoor entertainment.  Nevertheless, she is very groomed.  The grass is not mowed, in some places litter and other unpleasant things.  As for entertainment for children, they simply do not exist (either indoors or outdoors).  Although this option is stated in brochures and booking sites.  Nevertheless, quite interesting field events are organized here, as well as walks along Lake Seliger. </p><p>  Particular attention should be paid to food at the hotel.  Here you are given the opportunity to try traditional Russian cuisine, which is prepared with local organic products.  If we talk about prices, then they are too high, but, due to the absence of other similar establishments nearby, guests have to put up with the situation.  On the whole, the Seliger Peak Hotel is a good place for those who love silence and want to get to know the traditions of the Russian hinterland.  Beautiful nature and clean air compensate for all of these shortcomings. </p>
