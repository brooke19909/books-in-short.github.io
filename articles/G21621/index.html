These are charming snow-capped peaks, picturesque rivers and seas, many historical and cultural attractions.  A trip to almost anywhere in the largest country in the world is a mass of unforgettable impressions and a memory for a lifetime. </p><p>  We will be realistic, it is impossible to cover all the sights of our country within the framework of this article.  However, we tried to choose for you the most beautiful place in Russia.  Rather, the article deals with the most famous and visited sights of the country. </p><h2>  Moscow Kremlin </h2>

The Kremlin is a masterpiece of national Russian culture, a cultural-historical and spiritual-political center not only of the capital, but of the entire Russian Federation.  Now here is the presidential residence.  The Kremlin is a large-scale museum complex, which consists of several cathedral museums: Arkhangelsk, Assumption, Patriarchal, Annunciation, chambers of the 17th century.  Tourists are also attracted by the Armory, where an exhibition of the <span>diamond fund, the</span> royal treasures of the last century, and jewelry is presented.  In the chamber is the famous 190-carat diamond of Catherine II.  And if we take it purely from a position of popularity, then the Moscow Kremlin for the lion's share of Russians and travelers is the most beautiful place in Russia.

This museum is rightfully considered the center of art and culture in Russia.  Here are more than three million different exhibits.  The complex consists of 6 historic buildings, including the Winter Palace. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beauty of Russia" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/8885/471183.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the city on the Neva, tourists also usually visit the Mariinsky Theater, the Peter and Paul Fortress, the Russian Museum, etc. </p><h2>  Elbrus </h2><p>  We continue to study the most beautiful places in <span>Russia.</span>  <span>The nature of</span> our country is a separate conversation.  One of the highest points on the planet and a popular place for climbers is Elbrus.  It is located in the north of the Caucasian ridge (southern Russia) and looks like a two-peaked cone, which was formed by a volcano.  The height of the western peak is 5642 meters, and the eastern one - 5621 meters. </p><h2>  Valley of Geysers </h2><p>  On the Kamchatka Peninsula there is a unique Valley of Geysers.  This place is considered the second largest geyser field on the planet.  The valley was discovered in 1941 by the scientist Tatyana Ustinova.  Since that time, Kamchatka geysers have become a very popular tourist attraction.  The Valley of Geysers is also of great interest to geologists. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Baikal </h2>

    <p>  In Eastern Siberia, there is the oldest and deepest lake in the world - Baikal.  The reservoir contains more than 20% of the fresh water reserves on Earth.  This lake is approximately 25 million years old.  There are several health resorts on Lake Baikal.  Many tourists who have been here claim that this lake is the most beautiful place in Russia. </p><h2>  Kazan </h2><p>  If we talk about the most visited cities of our country, then first of all it is impossible not to mention Kazan.  Russian and Tatar styles are closely intertwined here.  In the capital of Tatarstan, <span>Muslim mosques</span> and Orthodox churches harmoniously coexist.  In addition, the city is the largest educational, cultural and sports center.  During the reign of Ivan the Terrible, Kazan built its own Kremlin. </p>

The city was built in 1255 by the Germans.  It became part of Russia after the Second World War.  The architecture of the village is a symbiosis of European and Russian styles.  To get to know Kaliningrad better, take a look at the Konigsberg Cathedral, <span>the Wrangel Tower,</span> as well as the Queen Louise Church.  In the central part there is a symbol of the city - the House of Soviets, as well as a number of museums, a theater, various monuments and an art gallery.

    <p>  This unique place is located in Karelia (on the border with Finland) directly in the open.  The reserve is considered a unique cultural, historical and natural complex of Russia.  The <span>Kizhi Pogost</span> ensemble is protected by UNESCO.  In Kizhi you can also see dozens of charming wooden houses, chapels, mills and barns. </p><h2>  Sophia Cathedral </h2><p>  The beauties of Russia are also numerous temples and cathedrals.  St. Sophia Cathedral in Veliky Novgorod deserves special attention.  This Orthodox church is considered the oldest in the country.  Many ancient religious artifacts have been preserved here, the most famous of them is the Icon of the Sign of the Mother of God.  According to one legend, this icon saved the city from attack in 1169.  St. Sophia Cathedral is also famous for its elaborate carved gates of the 12th century. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the most amazing churches in Russia" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/8885/471191.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Mysterious places of Russia </h2><p>  Some travelers are attracted by the picturesque nature, others by ancient architecture, but there is such a category of extreme people who give something mysterious and mystical in order to just feel the adrenaline rush.  Well, in Russia there are hundreds of mysterious places, anomalous zones, or simply areas where strange and inexplicable phenomena occur. </p><p>  One of the most terrible places is the Dyatlova pass.  In February 1959, a terrible tragedy happened to a group of tourists under the leadership of Igor Dyatlov.  10 people in this region were found dead, and the reasons for their death were still not fully understood.  A lot of versions were put forward at that time - from paranormal to criminal, however, none of them was confirmed. </p>

    <p>  Smelchakov is also attracted by the Devil's Hillfort (Sverdlovsk Region), where two unique objects are located at once.  There are granite formations in the Iset river valley whose origin is not fully understood.  Some scientists believe that nature created these formations, while others believe that the object was built by representatives of an unknown civilization.  Not far from here there is also the Devil's Hill hill (village of Krivoe Ozero).  It is believed that earlier there were performed various rituals of shamans.  Everyone who has visited these places claims that the Devil's Hillfort has a magical effect on people. </p><h2>  Death Valley and the Russian Bermuda Triangle </h2><p>  One Death Valley is located in the Republic of Yakutia off the banks <span>of the Vilyui River.</span>  According to rumors, Yakut sorcerers carried out bloody rituals in these places.  In this region you can find strange metal objects of a boiler-like shape, which, according to local residents, have supernatural properties. </p><p>  Another Death Valley is in Kamchatka.  Moreover, this place fully lives up to its name: animals, and sometimes lost tourists, constantly die at the slope of the Kikhpinich volcano. </p><p>  Our country also has its own version of the "Bermuda Triangle."  The Moleb anomalous zone has long been of interest to ufologists.  In the late 1980s, a local newspaper reported that at the junction of the Perm Territory and the Sverdlovsk Region, unidentified objects were constantly being seen.  And even despite the fact that scientists did not reveal any deviations from the norm in this zone, ufologists from all over the world still come to this region to observe supernatural phenomena. </p><h2>  Russia is a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãsights </h2>
