For a long time, fashion trends, clothing styles, popular colors are changing, but there are always flowers in women's toilets.  The real ones wither very quickly, and there is no way to decorate their image with them, but women found a way out here too!  Resourceful needlewomen began to create wonderful accessories in the form of flowers from available materials.  And the most creative craftswomen thought up using jeans for these purposes!  Who would have thought that it is possible to make flowers out of denim with your own hands, such that they are not ashamed to decorate even an evening dress or clutch! </p><p>  For jeans, you can apply all the known technologies for working with fabric: fold, twist, cut, puncture, stretch, etc. </p><p>  Let's try to create flowers from denim with our own hands - believe me, this is not at all difficult! </p><h2>  Complex Scrap Flower </h2><p>  Let's figure out how to make denim flowers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="blue Rose" class="if uuid-2594120" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2594120.jpg"></div><p>  For creativity, we need: </p><ul><li>  cropped jeans; </li><li>  metal or wooden beads with a wide hole; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  PVA glue. </li></ul><p>  To give stiffness and shape to a flower made of denim, it is necessary to soak it with gelatin or a starch solution, dry it and stroke it with a hot iron. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  From scraps of material we cut 10-15 petals.  They can be of any shape and size.  We also prepare 3-5 narrow strips for stamens (their size will be 0.5 cm by 7 cm), leaves and stem. </p><p>  Cut petals need to give a shape close to natural.  To do this, use a hot knife to pull them in the center, and bend the edges. </p><p>  We do the stamens this way: we will extend a strip of fabric into a bead and glue it in the middle.  We bend on the sides different from the bead and glue it together.  We form 5 pcs. </p><p>  Wrap them with a middle petal, glue - this is the base of our flower.  We take 5 petals attached to the base.  The following rows are located with a slight shift relative to the previous one.  The flower is ready. </p><p>  In the same way you can make another, smaller;  cut the leaves and stick everything to a hairpin or pin, collecting the composition. </p><h2>  Kansashi-like flower </h2><p>  To create a flower from shreds of denim, it is simpler to cut 11 circles.  Petals will be 2 times more - respectively, 22 pcs.  Cut all the circles in half.  If you have very small trimmings, cut a semicircle right away.  In our flower - kanzashi leaves will be arranged in 3 rows. </p><p>  Fold the semicircles in half and stitch the straight side.  So do with all the petals.  Then we twist and iron them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dpcraft.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="key ring" class="if uuid-2594141" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2594141.jpg"></div><p>  We take a needle with a strong thread in the color of the fabric, make a line, stitching 9 petals in order and tighten everything.  By adding and decreasing the number of petals, you can adjust the amount of colors.  We also collect the subsequent rows of petals, only in the second we sew 8 pcs., And in the third - 5. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Cut a circle of jeans - this is the base of the flower.  We fix all the rows on it, attaching in order. </p><p>  Now take a small button with a leg and cover it with fabric - you can use the same one that the flower is made of, or you can use bright contrast.  Sew (or glue) it to the center of our product.  The sides of the leaves are neatly fastened together. </p><p>  So another denim flower is ready! </p><h2>  Simple layered flower </h2><p>  The formation process is very easy, and at the end of the work the flower will turn out to be lush and airy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="layered flower" class="if uuid-2594123" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2594123.jpg"></div><p>  For this decoration, it is necessary to cut several flowers that have the same shape, but different sizes.  Let's say we have 7 flat flowers with five petals.  Stretch the fabric strongly along the edges - you get a wave with a fringe.  Let's put them in order - from large to small, and fix the middle with a bright button. </p><h2>  The simplest way to make jewelry </h2><p>  This option for creating a flower is based on the method of twisting roses from a satin ribbon. </p><p>  We will cut out from old jeans (the more scuffs will be on them, the better) a strip of width equal to 6-9 cm, and the length will depend on what size rose you want.  The longer the ribbon, the more voluminous the resulting flower. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vintagestylebyjo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="vintage roses" class="if uuid-2594138" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2594138.jpg"></div><p>  So, we take a jeans tape, fold it in half lengthwise and twist it, giving the appearance of a rose.  From the bottom at the base we sew with strong threads.  At the end we decorate with beads or rhinestones. </p><p>  In the modern world, jeans are an integral part of any wardrobe, male or female.  We wear them everywhere - whether it‚Äôs everyday life or a party, on holidays and during vacations. </p><p>  Sometimes they wear out to holes, but the hand does not rise anyway.  And so the old jeans lie in our closets and are waiting in the wings ... </p><div class="photo" data-original="armchairdecoratorblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="work process" class="if uuid-2594129" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2594129.jpg"></div><p>  So cut them, and get creative - create wonderful flowers from denim, which can become the unique decor of your things! </p>
