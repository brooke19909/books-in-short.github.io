    <h2>  A small digression into history </h2><p>  In the XIX century, large industrial enterprises appeared in these villages, most of which were associated with textiles.  The <span>Volokolamsk highway</span> and the railway to Riga were built.  The village of Ban'ki turns into a manufacturing village.  In 1926, Podolsky Mechanical Plant was moved here.  In the circumstances, the country's leadership is considering the possibility of creating the city of Optikogorsk on the site of villages.  But the local population stubbornly did not want to take such a name, and instead of Optikogorsk, Krasnogorsk appeared, by the name of one of the villages - Krasnaya Gorka. </p><p>  The proximity of the city to the capital is one of the ways to get away from the everyday hustle and bustle of the big city and visit Krasnogorsk at the weekend.  Moreover, the sights of Krasnogorsk are of interest.  They can be inspected with pleasure. </p><h2>  Tomb Chapel, Znamenskaya Church </h2><p>  In the very center of Krasnogorsk there is the Znamenskoye-Gubailovo estate.  Its main highlight is the Znamenskaya Church, which is a stone church, erected in honor of the Icon of the Blessed Virgin Mary ‚ÄúThe Sign‚Äù. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The temple has a unique interior, it is decorated with kokoshniks, columns and window frames.  The vaults of the cathedral are crowned with amazing beauty mosaics made in Russian-Byzantine traditions.  There are gorgeous imperial gates representing genuine jewelry work using decorated gilded metal plates, the mosaic floor on the choir is decorated with artistic motifs of the symbols of Christianity.  Peerless mosaic icons are located on both sides of the royal gate: on the right side is the Savior, on the left is the Mother of God, and also the shrine of the cathedral is a revered icon with particles of the relics of the Optina Elders.  The sights of Krasnogorsk are not limited to this. </p><p>  Another striking architectural monument is the chapel-tomb of the spouses Polyakov, erected next to the sanctuary.  This chapel has an original decor of facades and interiors.  They are completely made of ceramic. </p>

    <h2>  What else to visit in Krasnogorsk? </h2><p>  Maybe the Memorial <span>Museum of German</span> Anti-Fascists, which has existed since 1985?  This is an outstanding, unique museum, the history of which began in the years of the Second World War.  During the battle in Krasnogorsk, the German military were captured, as well as a number of civilians who arrived because of curiosity or with the desire to help the fascist army. </p><p>  The prisoners were placed in the small village of Brusky - then it was called a camp, and the prisoners - fascists.  They worked in factories, built, and after some time their way of life became the same as that of many Soviet workers.  In the camp, in addition to German prisoners, there were also representatives of other nationalities.  These were citizens of countries that sided with the Wehrmacht.  The overwhelming majority of these people, like the citizens of the USSR, wanted a peaceful life, and they had such an opportunity. </p><p>  An anti-fascist school was created in the village to educate newcomers to the Russian language and to educate those life values ‚Äã‚Äãthat were adhered to in the Soviet Union.  On the basis of the camp was created the famous council "Free Germany", which was one of the largest organizations of German anti-fascists.  The council specialized in recruiting captives, propaganda on the fronts using loudspeakers, and issuing campaign booklets for Wehrmacht soldiers.  The council had its own radio station of the same name, "Free Germany." </p>
