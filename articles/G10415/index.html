Perhaps at first, the clothes were really used only to protect the body, but over time, they are increasingly used to decorate the body. </p><p>  In order to verify this, just look at the models of modern sundresses.  As a rule, they are items of clothing that open their arms and chest to the maximum extent possible. </p><p>  Modern sarafans can have different lengths; for their tailoring, you can use any, sometimes unexpected, fabrics.  Today in stores you can find <span>sundresses made of cotton,</span> silk, linen, artificial fabrics, there are even crochet patterns.  A distinctive feature of a sundress is straps.  They can be thin, wide or have an average width.  In 2011, square-necked sundresses are considered fashionable.  However, the cutout can be anything.  Moreover, <span>sundress models that</span> fully open the chest and shoulders are enjoying success.  In this case, we are not talking about the shape of the cutout, it simply does not exist, just as there are no straps bordering it. </p><p>  If you are interested in the question of <span>how to sew a sundress</span> yourself, use our tips.  It should be said right away that when tailoring a sundress, success depends on the chosen product model.  If you never sewed anything yourself, choose <span>simple patterns,</span> which are two cloth panels to which the straps are sewn. </p><p>  For work, you will need a sundress pattern.  You can find it on the Internet.  There is also a description of the sequence of work.  For beginners, it is better to sew a cotton sundress.  An ideal option can be considered ordinary chintz.  It looks great in the product, it is easy to process and does not deteriorate with repeated correction of errors.  If you have no experience and sundresses you decided to sew as a result of an unclear impulse associated with watching a television program or meeting with a talented friend who convinced you of the success of this event, do not back down from the intended goal.  Believe that a good pattern of a sundress in combination with a good fabric and your desire will surely give an excellent result. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You will probably be able to sew an excellent sundress, while at the same time feeling like a real dressmaker, if you use one professional advice. </p><p>  There is a small secret in the work of a seamstress, the essence of which is that any unsuccessful line must be redone until it becomes perfect.  If you are in doubt whether you have sewn well or not, drop the doubts and rip everything apart.  High-quality work is immediately visible and at the same time the desire to correct or change something does not arise. </p><p>  A good sundress pattern can be obtained in another way.  Perhaps you already have the perfect sundress that you wear for a long time and would like to sew the same.  True, it is better to use things that have already served their term and with which you are ready to part.  In order for you to get a sundress pattern, spread the existing product at the seams, and thoroughly straighten and iron the received parts.  Work diligently, avoiding any errors.  The success of making your future sundress depends on its quality.  It is better if you make a pattern of thick paper based on the details.  It will be more convenient for you to work in the future.  But sometimes, trying to speed up sewing the product, inexperienced seamstresses use sundress details as a pattern.  The result may be different.  If the fabric is dense and well smoothed, then cutting with it can be of high quality.  Otherwise, it is hardly worth counting on success. </p><p>  And do not forget that sewing is easy and fun, and the products you sew are likely to be unique. </p>
