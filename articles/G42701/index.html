Projector Datasheets and User Reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A multimedia projector is a miracle of technology of the 21st century, a very useful and multifunctional device.  In an apartment you can organize a full-fledged home theater, because the projection of the image allows you to view video on the screen in the entire wall.  Using the projector for educational purposes makes it possible to broadcast video in a wide format for better assimilation of information by students.  In the framework of this article, we will try to understand the principle of operation of various types of projectors, consider the technical characteristics of the devices, and also give recommendations for choosing a more practical model. </p><h2>  What is a multimedia projector? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="nukkads.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Multimedia projector" class="if uuid-2479208" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77293/2479208.jpg"></div><p>  A multimedia projector is a device that projects an image or video from an external source onto a large screen.  The source may be removable media, a computer, or another device having an operating system.  The development of technology has given additional functions to projectors.  Now you can find models that synchronize with the storage medium via a wireless Wi-Fi network.  It is very convenient and practical. </p><p>  We name the main characteristics of multimedia projectors.  The undoubted advantage of these devices is the size of the projected screen.  If we compare the device at a cost with a TV whose screen has the same dimensions, then the projector wins.  The minimum price of the device, intended for home use, varies between 14,000-30,000 rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Image quality largely depends on the technical specifications of the multimedia projector and screen properties.  The canvas should have a high reflectivity, then the image will be sharper and sharper.  To get a saturated picture, you need to remove all extraneous light sources in the room. </p><p>  Before viewing the recording from removable media, some preparatory work is necessary.  The projector is connected to a storage medium, to a sound system.  The projector screen specifications must meet certain requirements.  Adjusts the sharpness of the image on the screen.  Some models make extraneous sounds when working, this creates inconvenience when watching a movie.  The noise comes from the cooling system built into the projector. </p><p>  The stationary projector is most often mounted on the ceiling.  If the model is portable, then it is most convenient to place it on a pedestal or table.  To start using the projector, you must turn on the device and adjust the image by adjusting it at the corners until you get the correct rectangular projection screen. </p><h2>  Projector classification </h2><p>  Currently, there are a huge number of projectors, which significantly differ from each other not only in cost and functionality, but also in technical characteristics, manufacturing techniques of internal parts and profile purpose.  Imagine a classification of types of projectors.  According to their functional purpose, projectors are divided into 3 groups: </p><ol><li>  Home cinema.  These devices are intended for home use.  Characteristics of home projectors budget line have the most basic functions.  The devices are easy to operate, are in the average price range.  Screen size can reach two meters in diagonal.  The projector has connectors for connecting to a personal computer, laptop or game console.  In the absence of the necessary connectors, special adapters can be used to synchronize devices.  These models of projectors also have a number of disadvantages: low brightness of lamps, low level of definition in budget models. </li><li>  Projectors for movie theaters.  These are professional powerful devices that project an image onto the widescreen screen of cinema halls.  Such projectors have a very high cost. </li><li>  Projectors for study and business.  They are used in educational institutions and at enterprises with the aim of delivering information for familiarization.  The characteristics of projectors for schools differ in their affordable cost.  The projection of the screen can reach 7 meters diagonally.  Some models feature a built-in speaker. </li><li>  3D projectors. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.smarthomekeeping.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="3D multimedia projector" class="if uuid-2479332" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77293/2479332.jpg"></div><p>  Innovative devices that project a three-dimensional image.  Such devices are used in the film industry, in educational institutions, as well as in museums and in organizing exhibitions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Depending on the design of the modulator, projectors are divided into: </p><ol><li>  TFT projectors.  The modulator is represented by a small-sized color LCD matrix made using TFT technology.  The distribution of light in the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãcarried out by a condenser, which is a system of lenses. </li><li>  Polysilicon projectors.  To project the image, three monochrome matrices are used (red, blue, green).  The optical system combines images from three matrices and you get a high-definition color picture.  For the distribution of light, special built-in mirrors are used that direct the same amount of light to each of the three matrices. </li><li>  DMD projectors.  Built on a reflective system.  A DMD matrix consists of a large number of micromirrors that can reflect the incident light on the lens or in the absorber.  Thus, an image is formed on the screen. </li></ol><p>  According to the modulator lighting method, the following types of devices are distinguished: </p><ol><li>  Translucent type.  Passing light flux undergoes modulation, which leads to strong heating of the matrix.  For cooling, a fan is installed in the projector housing, which makes noise during operation. </li><li>  Reflective type.  The luminous flux is reflected and sent to the matrix.  This does not cause strong heating, which means that installing a serious cooling system is not necessary. </li></ol><h2>  Types of projectors and their characteristics </h2><p>  The clarity of the picture and the drawing of the image largely depend on the resolution of the file being played from the media.  In addition, the quality of the projected image depends on the technical characteristics of the projector, as well as on the technology for constructing the projection, the characteristics of the lens and resolution. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  LCD technology </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.aitek-d.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD projector technology" class="if uuid-2479250" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77293/2479250.jpg"></div><p>  Light passes through a liquid crystal panel, which consists of a large number of pixels controlled by electrical signals.  A different amount of voltage is applied to the pixels, which controls the transparency level of an individual pixel, which means that the brightness of each point on the screen changes.  This is how an integral projection image is formed. </p><p>  This technology has significantly reduced the size of projection devices and reduce the cost of them.  The maximum light intensity at the same time began to reach 10,000 lm. </p><p>  This technology has some negative aspects.  The liquid crystal matrix begins to degrade and age over time.  Depreciation will adversely affect image quality.  Dead pixels may appear on the matrix.  During operation, the device heats up very much, therefore, for cooling, a powerful fan is built into the case, which creates a fairly loud noise.  Bright and powerful lamps of such projectors have a high cost. </p><p>  CRT Technology </p><p>  One of the first technologies for the manufacture of projection devices, which has been used for several decades.  We list the main characteristics of multimedia projectors created using this technology.  The projection principle is based on a cathode ray tube.  Image quality may be more advantageous than projectors of other technologies.  Black color is saturated, contrast is good.  The duration of continuous operation can reach 10,000 hours. </p><p>  Viewing is possible only in a darkened room, since the maximum brightness level does not exceed 300 lm.  Devices manufactured using this technology are distinguished by their massiveness and large dimensions.  The device can weigh several tens of kilograms.  And setting up the device is so complicated and time-consuming that sometimes it requires expert help. </p><p>  The principle of the projector is as follows: the signal is divided into components of three colors (red, blue, green), the beam intensity changes.  Light passing through a magnetic field scans the surface of the screen.  A monochrome picture is created on the screen, the image of which is projected onto the screen.  As a result, three projections are connected, and a color image is obtained. </p><p>  D-ILA Technology </p><p>  Devices manufactured using this technology are also equipped with LCD elements, but not of a translucent type, as in LCD technology, but reflective.  The light-modulating layer is located above the single-crystal silicon substrate.  It is in it that the matrix control scheme is located.  This gives a significant advantage over LCD matrices, as smaller <span>matrices</span> are able to give a higher resolution.  There is no pixel grid on the projection of the picture. </p><p>  The principle of operation is the same as that of LCD matrices: the matrices create three-color images and project the image through the lens onto the screen.  The devices are distinguished by their small size.  Projection onto wide screens is possible without loss of image quality.  There are also negative aspects: expensive lamps, the appearance of dead pixels, the lack of information about the duration of service of such devices due to the novelty of the technology. </p><p>  DLP Technology </p><p>  The matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãrepresented by a large number of small mirrors that are able to change their position.  Each mirror can project light either onto a screen or into a light absorber.  It turns out black and white colors on the projection.  When the mirror changes its position with high frequency, we get shades of gray.  To separate other colors, a color disk is used, which has light filters.  It is precisely because of the rotation of the disk that the "rainbow effect" can be observed on the screen.  The color wheel in some models may have additional colors - yellow, cyan, magenta.  There is also a transparent segment that plays the role of producing a pure white projection color. </p><p>  The brightness of a black-and-white picture is especially important for devices that are used to demonstrate presentations or diagrams.  On some models, as the light brightness level increases, the picture becomes dimmer. </p><p>  Three-matrix projectors manufactured using this technology work on the principle of superimposing three RBG monochrome images to obtain a full-color image.  Such devices have a high level of brightness, which can reach 18,000 lumens.  The winning features of this type of device are as follows: small size, durability, low noise, high brightness.  The disadvantages include an expensive lamp replacement, the possible appearance of broken pixels, the "Rainbow Effect" in single-matrix models. </p><p>  Laser projectors </p><p>  One of the latest imaging technology is laser.  These devices are distinguished by high cost, good performance and the highest level of quality of the projected image.  Continuous laser operation can be carried out for 20,000 hours.  Let's consider some characteristics of laser projectors.  The brightness of 4500 lm will allow you to view video even in a room that has additional light sources.  Ultra-focal lenses of laser projectors allow you to place the device in close proximity to the projection screen. </p><p>  The principle of operation of the device is similar to the previous ones.  The laser generates three monochrome images that overlap and mix.  A system of mirrors takes part in creating a focused image.  Laser projectors can project images on huge screens, while the image will be very saturated and bright, and the color rendering realistic.  The screen surface does not have to have high reflective properties. </p><h2>  Projector Lamps </h2><p>  The light source for projection is the lamp integrated in the projector.  Power of a light stream is measured in lumens.  Currently, there are models that can produce 60,000 lumens.  If we consider projectors of minimum power, it is worth noting that in some budget devices there are LED lamps that give out a luminous flux of hundreds, or even tens of lumens. </p><p>  In home viewing conditions, a projector with a luminous flux of 1000-1500 lumens is enough.  In the absence of other light sources, the quality of the projected image will be acceptable.  In rooms with additional lighting, more powerful projector lamps are required. </p><p>  If the lamp in the projector burns out, it is best to replace it with the original one.  But sometimes it is not possible to find an identical lamp, then you can use similar analogues, which are more affordable in terms of price and availability in stores.  Let's consider some options and the main characteristics of lamps for projectors. </p><ol><li>  Metal halide lamps.  A kind of high-pressure discharge lamps.  Radiation of light occurs due to the action of metal halides on mercury vapor.  The light is very bright, and the lamp itself consumes a small amount of energy.  Over time, the light becomes dimmer. </li><li>  Gas discharge lamps.  Built on the processes of electric discharge in gases.  The characteristics of the lamps for projectors have some differences depending on the materials used.  They are characterized by high light output - up to 55 lm / W. </li><li>  <span>Xenon lamps.</span>  Light emits a metal arc located in a bulb with xenon.  The lamp gives a bright white light, which is as close as possible to daylight. </li><li>  LED lamp.  Used in budget projectors.  It produces a small level of light, only a few tens of lumens. </li><li>  UHP lamps.  Glow occurs due to the creation of an electric discharge in mercury vapor.  The lamp is small and gives a very bright glow. </li><li>  P-VIP lamps.  A kind of halogen lamp.  They have a high level of brightness and a long service life. </li></ol><h2>  Projectors Sony.

In order to make the right choice, you need to understand the main characteristics of the projectors.  How to choose the right device and select the necessary functionality, we will understand in more detail. </p><p>  The reason for doubt when choosing is the lack of awareness and knowledge about certain technological features of the devices.  Consider the options for projectors that are best suited for specific purposes. </p><p>  If you select a projector exclusively for home use, then choose a model of a well-known brand, and not a Chinese counterpart, which will have a lower cost.  In addition to cost, you should pay attention to such parameters as: </p><ol><li>  The maximum resolution.  If you are not going to project the image on a very wide surface, then 800 * 600 quality will be enough for you, it is better to take models that produce HD or Full HD quality. </li><li>  Light flow.  The valid range for the home version is 1000-2000 lm.  At the same time, you can allow a little light in the room in which the image is projected.  Projector power is a feature that is one of the most important performance indicators. </li><li>  Type of projection lamp.  Some lamps can last up to 30,000 hours.  If you plan to use the projector frequently, then the quality of the lamp will be an important factor. </li><li>  Noise level.  There are projectors whose fans are so loud that they interfere with the perception of the film itself.  The volume of the device is indicated in the technical specifications, it is measured in decibels. </li><li>  Color rendering.  The color scheme should be natural and realistic. </li><li>  The limit of contrast.  Choose a machine with a contrast limit range of 1000: 1 or 2000: 1.  If this parameter is lower, then darkened images will be difficult to distinguish. </li><li>  Connection Methods.  Some models do not have running slots for connecting an information source, since synchronization occurs exclusively wirelessly via Wi-Fi. </li></ol><p>  Given all the nuances, you can choose the device that is ideal for your needs.  When you decide on the necessary parameters, it will become clear how to choose the characteristics of the projector. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  A large variety of projector options presented on the domestic market is too expensive.  If you read the article to the end, then you should understand what characteristics you should pay attention to when choosing a projector. </p>
