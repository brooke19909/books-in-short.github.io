Reviews about this resort complex are full of positive comments, among which are the following: </p><ul><li>  convenient location relative to urban infrastructure; </li><li>  very beautiful and well-groomed area; </li><li>  proximity to a huge beach; </li><li>  spacious and bright rooms; </li><li>  natural sea water in one of the pools; </li><li>  there are a lot of outlets at the hotel with reasonable prices, which eliminates the need to go shopping in the city every time; </li><li>  huge park area where it is pleasant to walk in the evening; </li><li>  bath towels are changed every day; </li><li>  good pools for children - there are slides and inflatable toys; </li><li>  comfortable orthopedic beds that provide a good rest; </li><li>  animators are very attentive to children and spend days trying to entertain them; </li><li>  there is an ATM on the territory, and therefore, to withdraw cash from cards, you do not need to go into the city; </li><li>  newlyweds are presented with a birthday cake and a bottle of champagne; </li><li>  very beautiful views open from the windows of the rooms. </li></ul><h2>  Slavyansk Plaza <span>(Montenegro): reviews</span> and negative comments </h2><p>  Unfortunately, in nature there are no hotels that would not have any drawbacks.  The Slavyansk Plaza 3 * (Montenegro) is no exception.  After studying the reviews of travelers, we can highlight the most significant negative comments: </p><ul><li>  in spite of the fact that booking sun loungers on the beach and by the pool is prohibited by the hotel‚Äôs rules, especially entrepreneurial guests put their towels on them early in the morning, and hotel employees do not interfere with this; </li><li>  the room has very poor wireless internet (with the exception of the lower floors); </li><li>  the decoration and equipment of the guest rooms is somewhat outdated; </li><li>  due to the fact that city runoff goes to the sea right next to the beach, the water in it is very dirty; </li><li>  narrow coastline, which is why there is not enough space on the beach for everyone;  when booking a room, there is a risk of getting completely different apartments that were originally ordered; </li><li>  modest and not very tasty food (it is better to take only breakfast, and go to neighboring establishments for lunch and dinner); </li><li>  the animation is rather modest (especially boring in the hotel in the evenings); </li><li>  the cleaning is very poor-quality (this is especially noticeable if you spill something on the floor - after the visit of the maids, the garbage will remain in place); </li><li>  the bathroom has a musty smell and a lot of mold (especially on tile seams); </li><li>  the dining room, purely physically, does not cope with the influx of guests (this problem is especially relevant in the morning); </li><li>  dishes in restaurants are broken and poorly washed; </li><li>  if in front of you at the table in the restaurant someone had breakfast, then you can not hope that the waiters will remove the crumbs; </li><li>  there is no possibility of early registration (even if you arrive at the hotel in the morning, you will be settled only in the afternoon); </li><li>  a playground and other entertainment infrastructure works only in the summer; </li><li>  part of the hotel buildings is rented for children's camps, and therefore it can be very noisy and crowded on the territory (of course, no one warns guests about this when booking rooms); </li><li>  during dinner, the buffet menu often enough contains those dishes that were left undernourished from lunch; </li><li>  hotel staff do not speak Russian and practically do not understand English; </li><li>  the staff is rather indifferent to the requests and comments of the guests; </li><li>  in the restaurant menu there are practically no fish dishes, as well as vegetables and fruits; </li><li>  despite the presence of a telephone number, you will have to approach the administration personally for all questions, as it‚Äôs almost impossible to get through; </li><li>  strong audibility between numbers; </li><li>  a very confusing instruction for the safe, because of which any problems and malfunctions constantly arise with it; </li><li>  in the daytime, hot water is turned off. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  The resort complex "Slavyansk Plaza" 3 * makes a rather mixed impression.  Montenegro is an incredibly colorful country that attracts many tourists.  If you want to plunge into an authentic atmosphere, then this institution is perfect for you.  The territory will remind you of a cozy Balkan town with many winding streets, greenery and other pleasant moments.  In addition, this hotel is located in the very center of Budva within walking distance from the beach and the old part of the city.  Thus, in terms of exploring the local flavor and attractions, the hotel is simply perfect. </p><p>  Talking about negative points is always unpleasant.  Nevertheless, keep in mind that if you are accustomed to comfort and quality service, then Slavyansk Plaza (4 stars, Montenegro) will not suit you.  One of the main drawbacks is the quality of cleaning (or rather, its almost complete absence), as well as the terrible nutrition (do not spend money on full board).  In addition, quite rarely in resort hotels you can meet the complete indifference of the staff to the guests.  By the way, the number of employees does not correspond to the scale of the hotel.  And the beach, along with the pools, is not able to accommodate everyone who wants to splash in the water. </p><p>  Thus, if you are one of those tourists who do not pay attention to minor troubles and like to organize their own leisure, you will spend unforgettable days at this hotel.  However, if you are used to a high-class Turkish or Egyptian service, you will most likely be disappointed. </p>
